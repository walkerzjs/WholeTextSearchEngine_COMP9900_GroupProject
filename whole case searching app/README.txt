1. First please copy all the 29907 html documents to the ‘/Legal Case Search App/Legal Case Search App/static/NSW’ folder. There are several existed html documents in the folder but can be ignored. And after this, pycharm may take 20 mins to index the documents.

2. Use pycharm to import the project, need to create a virtual environment or use an existed Virtual Env. There is a file named “requirements.txt” under “/Legal Case Search App” folder. In both situations, please activate the virtual environment, and in the command line, type “pip3 install -r requirements.txt” (the path of requirements.txt may need to be changed) to install required python packages.

3. Because for the sake of reducing uploaded size, all data and vectors are not included, so to use the app, the fresh start is needed. For fresh start, please run the init.py under ‘/Legal Case Search App’, but may require 20-30 mins.

4. After init.py has finished running, can start the server by run the “/Legal Case Search App/searchEngine.py” to start using the app.
