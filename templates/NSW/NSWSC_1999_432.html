<center><b><u>IAN KRANTZ v MAGISTRATE DERRICK HAND, STATE
CORONER</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

<center><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>WOOD CJ at CL:</b> The plaintiff seeks an order that a post
mortem examination upon the body of Priscilla, known as Sylvia Krantz,
hereinafter referred
to as the deceased, be limited to:
<P>

(a)  An external examination;
<P>

(b)  The taking of blood samples;  and
<P>

(c)  Radiological examination.
<P>

2  	The proceedings have been brought by the plaintiff in his
capacity as senior next of kin of the deceased.  They are based upon
the
circumstance, which is not in issue, that the deceased came from a family of
traditional Jews who are observers of the Jewish
deity of laws.
<P>

3  	Rabbi Raymond Apple has sworn an affidavit in the proceedings in
which he gave the following explanation as to the significance
of those
beliefs:
<P>

"The precepts of Halachah (meaning the whole body of ethico-legal principles
which govern all aspects of Jewish life) prescribe
an intricate set of rules
and regulations which govern our treatment of the dead, beginning with the
moment of death and continuing
through the preparation for burial, the actual
burial ceremony itself, the erection of tombstones and monuments, the care and
maintenance
of graves and cemetery areas as a whole, and so on.  Moreover, it
is the firm belief of Orthodox Jews that reverence for the dead,
as expressed
through scrupulous adherence to our religious teaching in all the areas
mentioned above, is of paramount importance
to us, to the extent that it is
regarded as a 'sacred duty'.  Some indication of the significance attached to
these practices may
be seen from the fact that even Jews who are not
religiously observant during their lifetimes insist on being buried in strict
conformity
with Jewish laws, customs and usages.  These principles and
practices which relate to our treatment of the dead emanate from beliefs
that
are central to our values, customs, traditions and practices extending over
many hundreds of years in Jewish communities throughout
the world.  Among the
foremost of the precepts concerning reverence for the dead is one which is of
particular importance in the
context of the present Application.  Put simply,
according to Jewish religion, an autopsy is an action of desecration, and as
such
is inimical to our deepest principles and feelings."
<P>

4  	The plaintiff has said that it would be a matter of anguish, both
by reason of his mother's beliefs and his own beliefs, if
her remains were to
be dissected for a post mortem examination.  He has invited the Coroner to
conduct an alternative non-intrusive
examination and for that purpose has
offered to bear any additional costs associated therewith.
<P>

5  	Against that background I turn to the facts that have led the
Coroner to seek a post mortem examination in this case.  During
the afternoon
of 16 April 1999, the plaintiff attended the flat of his mother at Bellevue
Hill where she lived by herself.  When
he let himself in he found her lying in
the bath naked and obviously deceased.  There were no signs of forced entry
that he could
see and nothing appeared to be out of order in the flat.  There
were also no signs of any missing property.  Police and ambulance
officers
subsequently came to the flat and confirmed the death.
<P>

6  	A report was prepared by Constable Fitzgerald for the Coroner
which showed that the deceased was last seen alive at 11am on
14 April 1999 and
that there were no suspicious circumstances so far as investigating police were
concerned. The attached summary
provided to the Coroner recorded the
following:
<P>

"Narrative of circumstances under which death took place.  About 4.10pm on
Friday 15 April 1999, Ian KRANTZ attended his mother's
address at 4/109 New
South Head Road, Vaucluse.  Ian KRANTZ had been trying to contact her via
telephone throughout the day but was
unable to do so.  He found the deceased
lying naked in the bathtub of her house.  There was no water in the bath and
the plug was
not in the drain.  Ambulance and police were contacted and
attended.  The deceased was lying on her back in the bath.  There was
an amount
of blood smeared on both walls of the bathtub.  Detectives attended and crime
scene officers.  After examining the deceased
it was found that she had a cut
on the back of her left calf and a bruise on the palm of her left hand.  There
was no other sign
of physical injury.  After speaking with Ian KRANTZ it was
found that the deceased had no known medical problems.  However KRANTZ
stated
that in the past month he and his wife had noticed the deceased health
deteriorating dramatically.  He stated that she was
having difficulties
breathing and would become 'giddy' and dizzy when she walked around.  The
deceased does not have a treating doctor
and it is believed that she hadn't
seen a doctor for up to three years.  The deceased had not been taking any
prescribed medication.
 THE DECEASED IS OF JEWISH RELIGION AND IT HAS BEEN
REQUESTED THAT NO AUTOPSY BE CARRIED OUT ON HER BODY.  IAN KRANTZ INDICATED TO
POLICE THAT AN INJUNCTION WOULD BE TAKEN OUT THROUGH HIS BARRISTER TO PREVENT
AN AUTOPSY TAKING PLACE."
<P>

7  	The report of the Crime Scene Unit is somewhat more
comprehensive.  It recorded, in summary, the following:
<P>

"CIRCUMSTANCES:
<P>

Elderly female resided at premises alone, has refused to see a Doctor and
therefore medical history is unknown.  Last seen alive

<P>

8  	A notice requesting the Coroner not to direct a post mortem
examination was served upon him in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 48(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</a>.  
<P>

9  	The plaintiff has said that his mother was not accustomed to
seeing a medical practitioner.  She was 86 years old at the time
of her death.
About six weeks prior to her death she had reported to the plaintiff that she
had fallen over in her flat.  Abrasions
to her leg and arm were then
noticeable.  Thereafter the plaintiff said her health began to deteriorate.
She appeared less active
and reported feeling giddy.  She asked the plaintiff's
wife to prepare the children for her death.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff's wife stated that over the past year she had been
informed by the deceased that she was on occasions short of
breath.  A few days
before her death the deceased had said that she could not get to the nearby
post office by herself because she
was finding that she was running out of
breath.  She added that recently the owner of the nearby fruit shop had, for
that reason,
offered to assist her home.
<P>

11  	Notes of the social worker attached to the Berger Centre, from
13 March up to the time of death recorded concerns about the
health of the
deceased.  On 18 March one such note records the obvious difficulty that the
deceased had in walking.  The impression
recorded was that overall she appeared
to be frailer than in recent times.  Over the days preceding her death attempts
were being
made for greater assistance to be provided for her in the home.  
<P>

12  	It is conceded that the death of the deceased was sudden and
that she had not seen a doctor for a period in excess of three
months before
her death.  It was also said that a number of possible natural causes could
have accounted for the death of a person
of her age.  
<P>

13  	A report from Dr Eisenberg was tendered in the plaintiff's case.
He expressed an opinion that with a history of exertional
breathlessness, and
sudden death, in a person aged 86 years, it was highly probable that she died
of coronary heart disease.  Dr
Eisenberg, as it was noted, was not her treating
medical practitioner and did not have the advantage of seeing the remains of
the
deceased.
<P>

14  	Following the matter coming before me to court yesterday
arrangements were made for a preliminary examination of the deceased
of a
non-intrusive kind.  This was conducted by Dr Kala and by Dr Lewin.  Dr Kala,
is a staff forensic pathologist with the New South
Wales Institute of Forensic
Medicine.  He had been directed by the Coroner to conduct a post mortem
examination.  Dr. Lewin was nominated
by the plaintiff to assist.  
<P>

15  	Their examination revealed that the deceased had a number of
bruises and abrasions to her body the age of which could not be
determined with
certainty, a superficial laceration on the dorsal aspect of her right hand, a
V-shaped laceration on the right lateral
anterior lower leg 20mm in diameter,
and a V-shaped laceration measuring approximately 180mm in length by 50mm
maximum width on the
posterior left anterior lower leg.  Flattening of the skin
was present at the outer margin of this laceration and the base of the
wound
was haemorrhagic fatty tissue.  The wound did not penetrate to the deeper
tissue.
<P>

16  	In Dr Lewin's report he noted that there was no bruising over
the skull base and that generalised age-related skin atrophy
was present.
While unable to come to any positive conclusion as to the cause of death from
this examination, he said that the absence
of a defensive pattern of skin
markings, or effective penetrating injuries, led him to conclude that a violent
third party contribution
to the deceased's demise was unlikely.  The pattern of
bruising, he said, appeared to be more consistent with the stated history
of
multiple falls.
<P>

17  	In a document prepared for these proceedings Dr Kala noted that
there are numerous possible causes of giddy and dizzy spells
in the aged, that
they need not be confined to vascular disease affecting the brain, and that
they would not necessarily be revealed
by CAT scan.  The possible natural
causes of death, i.e. excluding foul play, that might have been present, he
said included cardio-vascular
disorder such as myocardial infarct, valvular
heart disease, hypertension, ulceration or bleeding or malignancy in the
stomach, occult
malignancy in any other organ or tissue, haemoglobular
disorder, for example undiagnosed leukemia, and intoxication with drugs or
poisons.
<P>

18  	In his evidence today Dr Kala, while unable to be sure about the
manner or cause of death, thought that the latter was probably
a combination of
the injuries observed and unknown natural causes.  Of the injuries, he thought
that the laceration to the lower
left leg was likely to have been the most
significant.  Although it is now impossible, by any form of investigation, to
determine
the precise extent of blood loss, the quantity of blood seen in the
bath was estimated to be in the order of less than 50 ml. 
<P>

19  	Clearly that injury to the leg was sustained before death. From
the absence of any signs of blood loss elsewhere in the flat
it may well be
that it was sustained in the bathroom and within a short time before death. 
<P>

20  	In an 86 year old he recognised that of the natural causes which
may have brought about or contributed to death, the most likely
ones were
cardiac disease, vascular disease, high blood pressure or kidney failure.  He
said however, that from an external examination
it was not possible to
determine the precise cause or manner of death. 
<P>

21  	If an internal examination of organs and tissues were undertaken
it may be that natural disease processes would be observed.
 In particular,
examination of the coronary arteries or the kidneys for signs of high blood
pressure or blood loss may point to one
or other of the postulated natural
causes. So far as strangulation is concerned, Dr Kala said that there were no
obvious signs of
strangulation. Indeed, in that regard, his examination
revealed an absence of petechial haemorrhage which is recognised as a sign
of
strangulation or asphyxiation. 
<P>

22  	The occasioning of pressure to the carotid artery or other
vessel or nerve in that area producing sudden death was identified
as a
possibility, although, as I understand the evidence, it would be extremely
unlikely that post mortem investigation would reveal
any such injury, that is
in the absence of more significant damage to underlying tissues.  In that
regard the injury to the neck
that Dr Kala identified, was said to be a faint
bruise.
<P>

23  	In Dr Kala's first document he suggested that some of the
possible causes of death may have genetic implications for other
members of the
family.  He also said that absent a post mortem examination it was not possible
to exclude foul play either from smothering,
poisoning or deliberate drowning
in the bath.
<P>

24  	The application needs to be examined in the context of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroner's Act 1980</a>. The functions of the State Coroner are specified by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s4d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4D</a> of
the Act, one being the function:
<P>

"4D(b) 	to ensure that all deaths, suspected deaths, fires and explosions
concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an
inquest or inquiry are
properly investigated".
<P>

25  	The Coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest concerning the
death of a person in the circumstances specified by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(1)</a> of the Act.
Relevantly jurisdiction exists where it appears to the Coroner that:
<P>

"(a)	the person died a violent or unnatural death;
<P>

(b)	the person died a sudden death the cause of which is unknown, or,
<P>

(e)	the person was not attended by a medical practitioner within the period of
three months immediately preceding his or her death
or suspected death."
<P>

26  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 14</a> permits the Coroner who has jurisdiction to hold an
inquest to:
<P>

"dispense with the inquest except in those cases in which an inquest is
required to be held."
<P>

27  	The cases in which an inquest is "required to be held" are
prescribed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s14b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14B</a> and relevantly include
<P>

 1(d):
<P>

"a case in which it appears to the Coroner that the manner and cause of the
person's death have  not been sufficiently disclosed
(unless the case is one in
which an inquest has been terminated or continued under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19)."</a>
<P>

28  	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 24</a>, a Coroner has a right to take possession of
and retain the remains of a person whenever the Coroner has jurisdiction to
hold an
inquest into his or her death.
<P>

29  	The power of a Coroner to direct the performance of a post
mortem examination, or the performance of a specialist examination
or test, in
either case in relation to the remains of a person, is conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(1)</a> and
may be exercised before commencing an inquest.  
<P>

30  	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s48a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48A</a>, the senior next of kin of the deceased may request the
Coroner not to direct a post mortem examination. In the event of the Coroner
deciding that an examination is necessary or is desirable in the public
interest, notwithstanding such request, the next of kin may
apply to this court
for an order that no post mortem examination be performed, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s48a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 48A(6)).</a> 
<P>

31  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s48a.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 48A(8)</a> of that Act provides:
<P>

"The Supreme Court may make an order that:
<P>

(a)  no post mortem examination, or
<P>

(b)  a partial post mortem examination,
<P>

be formed if it is satisfied that it is desirable in the circumstances."
<P>

32  	That section was inserted into the Act after the decision in
<b>Abernethy v Deitz</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20701" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 701</a>, where the Coroner's power to
direct a post mortem examination was held to be subject to review by the
Supreme Court on the <b>Wednesbury Principle, (Associated Provincial Picture
Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation </b> 1948 I QB 223).
<P>

33  	The power to direct a post mortem examination needs to be
considered within the frame work of the Act that I have outlined.
 It does not
depend upon the Coroner having first made a decision to conduct an inquest.  It
may, in my view, be exercised as a preliminary
step in order to determine
whether to hold, or to dispense with, an inquest.  It does however depend on
the case being one in which
the Coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest.
It is that circumstance which enlivens the remainder of the powers and
functions
attached to the office of Coroner.
<P>

34  	As I have observed, the present case is clearly one in which the
Coroner has jurisdiction to order an inquest, and in which
he has power to
direct a post mortem.  The inquiry therefore comes down to the question whether
it is "desirable in the circumstances"
of the present case, to order that there
be no post mortem examination or otherwise that there be a limited examination.
In <b>Deitz,</b> Mahoney JA said at 707:
<P>

"The power given by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48</a> to determine whether a post mortem should be held is,
of course, a discretionary power. The grounds to which a Coroner can and will
ordinarily have regard will no doubt be those which bear directly on the proper
exercise of the Coronial functions: whether there
are medical, legal or other
reasons why a post mortem will be of assistance in, to take examples,
determining whether an inquest
should be held or in the conduct of the inquest.
But grounds of that kind are not the only grounds to which the Coroner can and
should
have regard. It is, in my opinion, proper for a Coroner, in determining
whether to direct a post mortem, to take into account the
legitimate wishes of
the person to whom the body has been committed by law, namely, the legal
personal representative and, at least
in some cases, the members of the
deceased's immediate family. 
<P>

The legislature could not have intended that their wishes be ignored.
Ordinarily it is not necessary that the Coroner seek out the
wishes of others
in this regard. But where those wishes are known to him, it will ordinarily be
appropriate that he take them into
account. Where, for example, a post mortem
would provide only marginal assistance in the discharge of the coronial
functions, the
fact that a post mortem would cause deep distress to the legal
personal representative or relevant family members may be sufficient
to warrant
the Coroner not directing a post mortem."
<P>

35  	In relation to the matter of immediate relevance to this case,
his Honour observed at 709:
<P>

"If there be reasons, relevant to the Coronial functions, why a post mortem
should be directed or an inquest held, that maybe done
notwithstanding that
that decision will be inconsistent with, for example, the religious views of
those concerned. As far as courts
are concerned, action taken by a Coroner must
be taken in accordance with the law. But proper account will be taken of
religious
and other beliefs as far as the law allows and, in many cases, the
law as properly administered will be able to accommodate the religious
views of
those concerned."
<P>

36  	This approach accords with that taken in other jurisdictions in
relation to legislation to similar effect to s 48A(8) of the
New  South Wales
Act.  In <b>Green v. Johnstone</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%202%20VLR%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995 2 VLR 176</a>, Beach J said at 179:
<P>

"In a multicultural society such as we have in this country, it is my opinion
that great weight should be given to the cultural
and spiritual laws and
practices of the various cultural groups forming our society, and that great
care should be taken to ensure
that their laws and practices, assuming they are
otherwise lawful, are not disregarded or abused. 
<P>

If there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Leslie
Green, I may well have taken the view that the interests
of society that the
cause of her death be ascertained outweigh the interests of her parents in
preserving her body unmutilated by
any autopsy. But that is not the situation.
All available evidence is to the effect that the infant died from natural
causes, probably
from the syndrome described as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
In such a situation it is my opinion that the rights of the parents
to be
spared further grief as a consequence of their daughter's death outweigh the
interests of the community that the actual  cause
of death be ascertained.
Clearly that was the view Cummins J took in <b>Bendet's </b>case. I can find no
feature about this case sufficient to distinguish it from <b>Bendet</b>." (at
179)
<P>

37  	In <u>Re the death of Unchango (Jnr); Ex Parte Unchango
(Snr</u>), the Supreme Court of Western Australia, Walsh J, 19 August 1997, his
Honour was concerned with a case of sudden death of an Aboriginal
infant which
could have been attributed to a number of causes, including Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome.  The Coroner pressed for a
post mortem examination upon the basis
that there were public health issues involved in such a case, particularly
where it had occurred
in an Aboriginal Community.  They included the
desirability of investigating the possible cause of SIDS, the possible presence
of
an infection which may have spread to the remainder of the community, the
possible presence of a congenital defect which may affect
the infant's family,
and the possibility of maltreatment, neglect or homicide occurring in a
situation where a number of people were
sleeping together in a single room.  It
was also said to be appropriate for the responsible authorities to try to
reduce the high
rate of Aboriginal mortality, by proper medical inquiry into
deaths of this kind, to see if ways could be devised to reduce their
occurrence. 
<P>

38  	Walsh J, took these matters into account, but being satisfied
that there was no suggestion, on the evidence before him, that
death was caused
by other than natural causes, observed at page 7:
<P>

"Whilst there is undoubtedly potential for a post mortem report to reveal that
death could well not have been caused by sudden infant
death syndrome but by a
natural cause such as infection, nonetheless that would not really advance the
matter a great deal in circumstances
such as this. One should take into account
the very strong cultural beliefs held by the relatives and by the community at
Kalumburu
and the effect that the post mortem would have on them by way of
emotional trauma, particularly in view of the fact that it would
prohibit, in
their view, the spirit of the deceased remaining in the body and returning to
the body and would leave the spirit roaming
at large.
<P>

Having regard to the somewhat unusual factors to which I have referred in this
case and without in any way indicating that these
reasons should be taken as a
general precedent for those who hold such beliefs or other people in the
community who hold similar
beliefs, it seems to me that it is desirable that I
should exercise my discretion under the relevant section and order that no post
mortem examination be performed upon the body, I being satisfied that it is not
desirable in these particular circumstances. But
I emphasise, as I have said
already, that this is no grounds for a general precedent being established that
applies in all similar
cases. Each case must be dealt with individually."
<P>

39  	The only other authority referred to me was that of <b>Magdziarz
v Heffey</b>, Supreme Court of Victoria, McDonald J, 3 October 1995.  That is a
case where the deceased died in the course of his employment when
he fell off a
ride at the Royal Melbourne Show.  The plaintiff swore an affidavit to the
effect that both he and his wife were devout
Catholics and believed that an
autopsy would desecrate their son's body.  While this was not advanced as based
upon a religious tenet
of the Roman Catholic faith, it was accepted that it was
appropriate that the court take into account the individual views of the
parents of the deceased.   While the application was unsuccessful on the basis
that the pathologist was unable to reach a conclusion
as to cause of death, his
Honour nevertheless accepted that it was proper to take into account the views
of the family and any distress
occasioned to them by an autopsy.. 
<P>

40  	I express my entire agreement with the observations, made in the
decisions earlier mentioned, as to the appropriateness of
taking into account
the religious beliefs of the family of the deceased where they can be
demonstrated to be both genuinely held
and to accord with the faith of those
concerned. 
<P>

41  	That is a matter to be taken into account although it will not
necessarily be determinative in any given case.  In some circumstances,
it may
be that there is evidence pointing to foul play, which would need to be
investigated, in order to ensure execution of the
due process of the law.  In
other circumstances there may be evidence of a possibility of an outbreak of a
serious infection which
would need to be investigated in order to cater for
public health interests.  Additionally there may be cases where it could be in
the interests of the immediate family of the deceased to determine whether
there is some genetic predisposition to serious disease,
that might possibly be
treated or detected in its early stages if the possibility of its onset is
known.
<P>

42  	The present however is not a case which falls into any of these
categories.  Although I have given very anxious consideration
to the injuries
and to the presence of blood in the bath, I have reached the conclusion that
this is a case where it is desirable
that there not be any intrusive post
mortem examination.  The reasons for that are as follows:  
<P>

43  	The deceased was an 86 year old woman.  At the time of her death
there was clear evidence that her health was failing, and
that she was becoming
progressively more housebound and dependent upon others.  She exhibited some of
the classic signs of progressive
cardiac disease.  At her age she was
particularly vulnerable to cardiac failure or to a vascular accident.  There
are any number
of similar although related, conditions including renal failure,
hypertension and the like which could have contributed.  
<P>

44  	I can see no possible public benefit in determining which, if
any, of those events brought about death or indeed even whether
she suffered
from some occult malignancy.  There is absolutely no reason to suppose that she
suffered from any form of contagious
disease that might threaten the community,
and I see no public benefit in determining the precise cause of death in a
person of her
age, even if it could be ascertained by post mortem examination.

<P>

45  	In that regard it seems to me that the highest the case can be
put on behalf of the Coroner is that the injuries may have contributed,
in
combination with other natural causes, to death.  It is unlikely in the extreme
that any one cause could be pinpointed by an autopsy
and I see no advantage in
attempting to further refine the possibilities.  
<P>

46  	So far as her own family are concerned, I am not persuaded that
they might gather any benefit by knowing whether she suffered
from some form of
occult malignancy which might have a genetic predisposition.  Having lived to
the age of 86 years and to an age
where sudden death is not unknown, it is
extremely doubtful that the finding of any signs of such malignancy would be of
value to
their own medical management.  Nor do I see any realistic possibility
of a post mortem examination in this case advancing the store
of medical
knowledge concerning the causes of death in the aged.
<P>

47  	Foul play, in my view, is barely even a remote possibility
having regard to the absence of any signs of forced entry or of
damage to the
premises, or of disturbance to its contents or of loss of any property.  The
fact that it was a highly improbable event
is indicated by the circumstance
that there were no signs of any struggle, or of any blood elsewhere than in the
bath, where the
body of the deceased was found.  The external physical signs
are consistent with the falls which the deceased was recorded to have
had, and
the injury to her leg is equally consistent with a collapse in the bathroom
either nearby or as she got into the bath. 
<P>

48  	The case therefore is one where I am satisfied that there are
insufficient signs of a possibility of foul play or other relevant
circumstances that would outweigh the religious interests I have identified,
particularly having regard to the age of the deceased
and the high probability
that her death was due to natural causes.  As I have observed, even if it were
exacerbated or induced by
a fall the likelihood is that those natural causes of
cardiac disease or vascular accident were the more probable immediate cause
of
death.
<P>

49  	Finally, I observe that I am quite unpersuaded by the argument
that the wrong message would be sent to the public in a case
such as this, if
the matter was allowed to proceed without a post mortem examination.  For the
reasons identified by Walsh J, in
<u>Unchango</u>, this case and similar cases
can never be taken as a general precedent.  In every case a discretion has to
be exercised having regard
to the particular facts of the matter.
<P>

50  	I am satisfied in a case such as the present that the public
would readily understand the lack of any need for a post mortem
in respect of a
frail 86 year old woman whose health was observed by independent observers to
have been progressively declining,
who had a supportive family, who died in her
own home, where there was genuine evidence of strong religious beliefs shared
both by
her and by her family concerning the undesirable interference with a
body at post mortem.
<P>

51  	Accordingly I will make an order in the terms of paragraph 1 of
the Summons.  I note that no order is sought as to costs.
