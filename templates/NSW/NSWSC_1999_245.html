<P>

<b>3930/96	ROBYN JAN BARRASS &amp; ANOR   -v-   JUDITH PATRICIA KAINE (ESTATE
OF WILFRED V. WILLIAMS)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>By summons filed on 7 November 1996 the
plaintiffs, Robyn Jan Barras and Rosemary Gai Stevens, each claim an order for
provision for
their maintenance and advancement in life out of the estate of
their late father, Wilfred Victor Williams (to whom I shall refer
as "the
deceased"), pursuant to section 7 of the <i>Family Provisions Act</i> 1982.
<P>

2   	The deceased died aged seventy-eight on 30 April 1996.  He
left a will dated 15 August 1995, probate whereof was on 27 August
1996 granted
to Judith Patricia Kaine, the executrix named in such will (who is the
defendant to the present proceedings).
<P>

3   	The chief assets in the estate of the deceased were two
pieces of real property situate at and known as, respectively, 289
Bobbin Head
Road, Turrumurra and 289A Bobbin Head Road, Turramurra.  The property at 289
Bobbin Head Road, on which there stands
a house presently rented, has a present
value of $345,000.  The property at 289A Bobbin Head Road, on which there also
stands a house,
has a present value of $425,000.  The distributable estate of
the deceased is in an amount of $837,492.
<P>

4   	Having regard to the valuation of the two pieces of real
property totalling $770,000, it will be appreciated that of the balance
remaining, about $67,000, there will be little left after the payment of the
costs of the present proceedings of the defendant executrix,
and, in the event
that either or both of them be successful, of the plaintiffs in the present
proceedings.
<P>

5   	The deceased was married three times.  Of his first
marriage, which took place on 10 May 1941, were born the two plaintiffs.
 In
1958, the deceased and his first wife separated,  his first wife leaving the
matrimonial home at 289 Bobbin Head Road, Turramurra
(which at that stage had
not been sub-divided into the two lots which presently comprise that land).
<P>

6   	The deceased's first wife, in leaving the matrimonial home
was accompanied by each of the plaintiffs.  At that time, Robyn
(who had been
born on 22 April 1942 and who is presently aged fifty-six), was aged about
sixteen, and Rosemary (who had been born
on 28 October 1943 and who is
presently aged fifty-five) was aged about fifteen.
<P>

7   	The deceased continued to reside at the Bobbin Head Road
property.  He and his first wife were subsequently divorced, the decree
becoming absolute on 21 September 1967.  A deed between the deceased and his
first wife in their divorce proceedings has been placed
in evidence.
<P>

8   	The deceased married his second wife, Edna Clarke, on 6
October 1967.  He had apparently been in a de facto relationship with
that lady
since 1959.  He remained married to his second wife until her death on 23
November 1990; that is, the relationship and
the marriage of the deceased to
his second wife obtained for more than thirty years, from 1959 until 1990.
<P>

9   	At the time when he married his second wife, Mrs Edna
Clarke, she was a mother of one child, Judith Joy, and was a widow. 
Judith,
who was born on 15 February 1950, lived with her mother and the deceased from
the time of the relationship between her mother
and the deceased. Although only
a step-daughter of the deceased, she was, it would appear, treated by the
deceased as if she had
been his own natural daughter.
<P>

10   	After the death of his second wife, the deceased married
for a third time, to Mrs Audrey Clare Wadds, on 27 May 1995.  Upon
the death of
the deceased, some eleven months later, Mrs Audrey Williams became the widow of
the deceased.
<P>

11   	In the events which have happened, the deceased left to
his widow, Mrs Audrey Williams, the house property at 289A Bobbin
Head Road,
which had been the matrimonial home throughout the period of their marriage.
The deceased left the balance of his estate
to his step-daughter Judith, now
Mrs Messing.
<P>

12   	The evidence discloses that a considerable financial
benefit in building up the assets of the deceased had come to him from
his
second wife, with whom, as I have already recorded, he had been associated
either in a de facto relationship or in marriage for,
a period of some
thirty-one years.
<P>

13   	After the separation of the deceased and his first wife,
contact between the deceased's elder daughter, Robyn, and her father
was
non-existent.  She had no contact with him whatsoever from the time when she,
her mother and her sister left the family home
in 1958 until the death of the
deceased.  Contact between Rosemary and her father from the separation of the
deceased and his first
wife, in 1958, consisted of one telephone call from
Rosemary to the deceased, when Rosemary was aged nineteen, that is in about
1962;
another telephone call from Rosemary to the deceased when Robyn was aged
twenty, that is in about 1963; and a third telephone call
from Rosemary to the
deceased, in about January 1996, Rosemary at that stage being aged about
fifty-two.
<P>

14   	On the first two occasions, the deceased hung up on
Rosemary.  On the third occasion, he apparently was more affable and invited
her to visit.  She did not however do so before he suffered a cerebral
haemorrhage in April 1996.  Rosemary visited him in hospital
on 19 April 1996.
He was only semi-conscious at the time and did not recognise her.  He died
eleven days later.
<P>

15   	Each of Robyn and Rosemary in due course married.  Robyn
was married in 1964.  She was widowed in 1977.  She has four children,
all now
adults and no longer dependent upon her.  Rosemary married in 1965.  She and
her husband, who is now fifty-six years of age,
have three children.  They are
all now adults and none of them are dependent upon them.
<P>

16   	Each of the plaintiffs, as a child of the deceased, is an
eligible person within paragraph (d) of the definition of that phrase
contained
in section 6(1) of the <i>Family Provisions Act</i>.  As such, each of the
plaintiffs has the standing to bring the present proceedings.  
<P>

17   	Each of the plaintiffs submits that an order for provision
should be made in her favour out of the estate of their late father.
<P>

18   	Neither of the plaintiffs is in particularly affluent
financial circumstances.  Robyn is in a worse situation than her sister
Rosemary.  Each of the plaintiffs owns her own home.  Robyn, however, presently
has a mortgage on the house property in which she
lives.  The house property is
at a place called Naroota, apparently near Blacktown, and is worth about
$250,000; the amount outstanding
on the mortgage is about $29,000.  She also
has a debt owing on Bankcard in the amount of $12,000.  The house is in need of
renovations
and repairs which would cost about $45,000.
<P>

19   	Robyn is qualified as a nurse.  However, in relatively
recent times she has decided to move from that profession to the profession
of
a carer of foster children.  She presently is responsible for four foster
children, whose ages range between seven and eleven
years. Each of those four
children suffers emotional or intellectual problems.  She receives an income
from the Department of Community
Services for looking after those foster
children.  Her weekly expenditure is not much less than her weekly income.  She
does not
presently own her own motor vehicle.
<P>

20   	Rosemary's husband conducts from their residence at Mt
Colah a business of television and video repairs.  The evidence given
by
Rosemary concerning her financial position and material circumstances, which of
course include the financial and material circumstances
of her husband, was not
of the clarity one might have desired.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept
that she and her husband are
not in particularly affluent circumstances.  They
certainly do not have any superannuation arrangements and they appear to have
no
funds to meet unexpected contingencies.
<P>

21   	For the last financial years, Rosemary's taxable income
has been in the range of $18,500 to $19,500, and apparently her husband
has had
an equivalent taxable income.  They each receive drawings from the television
and video repair business, which, however,
is essentially carried on by
Rosemary's husband, although she assists in the clerical and receptionist side
of that business.
<P>

22   	In addition, Rosemary works in a part-time capacity in the
kitchen staff at the Turramurra Bowling Club.  Indeed, it was in
consequence of
her employment in that position that she renewed contact with the deceased who
was a member of that Club and that
she made the final communication with the
deceased in January 1994.
<P>

23   	Of far greater significance, however, in this case, is the
question of a lack of contact, total in the case of Robyn and almost
non-existent in the case of Rosemary, between each of the plaintiffs and their
father.  It has essentially been submitted on behalf
of the defendants, that
the lack of contact was such that neither plaintiff should be regarded as being
in a position where either
she or the community would expect or the Court would
recognise that any order for provision should be made for her out of the estate
of the deceased.
<P>

24   	Robyn has offered an explanation as to why she did not
have any contact with her father from the time when her mother, Rosemary
and
herself left the matrimonial home in 1958.  That explanation is that, during
her childhood, she had suffered physical and sexual
abuse at the hands of her
father.  She has given evidence concerning the details of that physical and
sexual abuse.  It must be recognised,
of course, that the deceased is not
present to give his version of those allegations.  Nevertheless, if those
allegations be true,
then they certainly are justification for the feeling of
the hatred which Robyn expressed as her feelings towards her father and
would
be sufficient justification for her not making any effort to contact the
deceased for the remaining thirty-eight years of his
life.
<P>

25   	There has not been such a significant explanation by
Rosemary as to why she did not have contact with her father.  She said
that
after the two telephone calls made by her when she was aged nineteen and
twenty, it was the fear of rejection that deterred
her from making any other
advances towards her father until January 1996.
<P>

26   	Throughout the entire period from his separation from the
mother of the plaintiffs until his death, the deceased was residing
at what had
been the family home before that separation.  Each of the plaintiffs knew where
to contact the deceased if she so wished.
 They each knew how to contact their
father by telephone.  They could have sent, but did not, cards or other
communications to him.
 They clearly did not want to have any communication
with him.
<P>

27   	Despite the evidence of Rosemary of her desire to have a
father/daughter relationship, she did not do anything for the best
part of
thirty years, from the time she was aged twenty until shortly before her
father's death, to communicate with him.
<P>

28   	However, it does not seem to me that the omissions on the
part of the plaintiffs in taking any steps to have contact with
their father
are determinative of this matter.  The deceased himself did not manifest the
slightest interest in his two daughters
after his first wife left taking with
her the two daughters of the marriage, the only two children of the deceased.
He appears to
have made no effort whatsoever to contact them.
<P>

29   	Apparently, the mother of the plaintiffs kept in
communication with the mother of the deceased.  There would have been no
difficulty in the deceased contacting either or both of his daughters if he had
wished.  He certainly knew the dates of their birthdays,
and there is a
suggestion that he had some knowledge of the fact that Rosemary was residing at
Mt Colah.  Obviously, the plaintiffs
could have done more to re-establish the
relationship if they had so desired, but, by the same token, so, too, could
their father.
 He clearly abdicated all responsibilities of a father when his
first wife departed the matrimonial home with his two daughters in
1958.
<P>

30   	I have reached the conclusion that the lack of contact
between the plaintiffs and their father is not such as to deprive the
plaintiffs from the benefit of any order for provision in their favour, an
entitlement to which they might otherwise have established.
<P>

31   	I have already referred, at least in general terms, to the
financial and material circumstances of each of the plaintiffs.
 What Robyn
requires is an amount of money sufficient to assist her to renovate her house,
to pay off her mortgage and have some
funds available for contingencies.  In
the case of Rosemary, what she requires is some fund to give a degree of
security for herself
and her husband when they are no longer able to conduct
their present business.
<P>

32   	Any order for provision in favour of the plaintiffs must
however be approached in the light of any competing claims upon the
testamentary bounty of the deceased.  In the present case, the only other such
competign claims are those of Mrs Audrey Williams,
the widow of the deceased,
and Mrs Judith Messing, the step-daughter of the deceased.  They are the two
beneficiaries named in the
will of the deceased.  He clearly recognised the
obligation which he had to each of those ladies.
<P>

33   	The deceased recognised an obligation to provide
accommodation for his widow.  He recognised an obligation to the step-daughter
who he has treated as if she were his own natural daughter and, in doing so, he
appears to have recognised the expectation on her
part that she would benefit
from his estate, since the entirety of the estate of Mrs Messing's own mother,
Mrs Edna Williams, had
passed to the deceased upon her death in 1990. 
<P>

34   	I have already referred to the fact that, during her
lifetime, Mrs Edna Williams assisted in the improvement of financial
circumstances of the deceased.
<P>

35   	It will be appreciated that, to the extent that any order
for provision is made in favour of the plaintiffs, the benefit given
to one or
both of the beneficiaries named in the will of the deceased will thereby be
reduced.
<P>

36   	Evidence has been placed before the Court concerning the
financial and material circumstances of each of Mrs Audrey Williams
and Mrs
Messing.  Those circumstances are not such as should, in my view, have the
effect of reducing or even extinguishing any order
for provision an entitlement
to which each of the plaintiffs might otherwise have established.  Each of Mrs
Williams and Mrs Messing
is in material and financial circumstances that are
considerably better than those of each of the plaintiffs.  Indeed, as I
understand
it, the defendant does not submit that any order for provision an
entitlement to which the plaintiffs might have established should
be reduced on
account of the financial and material circumstances of the two
beneficiaries.
<P>

37   	Nevertheless, the Court must take into account the
obligations and responsibility of the deceased to the two ladies who are
the
beneficiaries named in his will, being his widow (albeit of only eleven months'
standing), and his step-daughter, with whom he
had a close relationship for a
period of almost thirty years.
<P>

38   	In all the circumstances, I have arrived at the conclusion
that it is appropriate that Mrs Robyn Barrass, should receive out
of the estate
of the deceased a legacy in the sum of $100,000 and that Mrs Rosemary Stevens
should receive out of the estate of the
deceased a legacy in the sum of
$60,000.
<P>

39   	The question then arises as to how those legacies should
be borne, having regard to the fact that Mrs Audrey Williams is in
residence in
289A Bobbin Head Road. Unless the Court were to give some indication of how
those two legacies should be borne by the
estate, the almost inevitable
consequence would be that they would come out of that part of the estate which
under the will passes
to Mrs Messing.
<P>

40   	It seems to me that in the circumstances of this case the
proper course is that these legacies should be borne proportionately
by the
assets which go to the two beneficiaries named in the will.  That is, that they
be borne both by the share to which Mrs Williams
is entitled under the will and
the share to which Mrs Messing is entitled in the proportion of those
shares.
<P>

41   	Similarly, it seems appropriate that the costs order which
I propose to make should also be borne by the interest of the two
beneficiaries
in the same proportion as their interests under the will.
<P>

42   	The orders I make are as follows:-
<P>

1.	I order that Robyn Jan Barrass receive out of the estate of the late Wilfred
Victor Williams ("the deceased") a legacy in the
sum of $100,000 and that
Rosemary Gai Stevens receive out of the estate of the deceased a legacy in the
sum of $60,000, such legacies
not to bear interest if paid on or before 25 June
1999, and, if not so paid, to bear interest at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

2.	I order that the aforesaid legacies be borne proportionately by the
interests in the estate of the deceased given by the will
of the deceased to
Audrey Clare Williams and Judith Joy Messing in the same proportion as their
interests respectively bear to each
other.
<P>

3.	I order that the costs of the plaintiffs on the party and party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of
the deceased.
<P>

43   	SKINNER:  Could I put to your Honour and have it noted
what you have in mind by way of proportionment would be on the most
recent
valuation evidence in the affidavit of Judith Kaine, Executrix, namely 289
Bobbin Head Road, Turramurra, has a sworn value
of $345,000 and 289A Bobbin
Head Road has a sworn value of $425,000.
<P>

44   	<b>MASTER</b>:  That can be noted, that it will be in
those two proportions.
