<b>1015/98 - DAVID MATTHEW HARPUR  v  WILLIAM LAMBOURNE</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	This is an application brought by way of summons by the
plaintiff, David Matthew Harpur against William Lambourne, the defendant.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff claims an order that the defendant be
restrained from infringing the plaintiff's copyright in a literary work
entitled The Pittwater Hawkesbury Brisbane Water Boating Directory 1998.
<P>

3   	An oral amendment has been sought during the course of
argument by which it is intended that the order cover the documents
contained
in exhibits A1 to 3, it being therefore to include Pittwater Hawkesbury
Brisbane Water Boating Directory 1997, 1998 and
1999.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff further seeks relief at the plaintiff's
election that an order be made that an account be taken of the profits
made by
the defendant by his conversion and reproduction of the directories and that an
enquiry be held to determine the amount of
such profits.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has breached
copyright in each of those works.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff, Mr Harpur, is a yacht broker. He in fact has
had quite a deal of experience in the last 17 years in the boating
industry. He
told me during those 17 years he had worked at various tasks from a fuel marina
attendant, working in marina management,
yacht sales, motor boat sales, broker
management and proprietorship of a brokerage, sail making, yacht rigging, boat
hiring, new
boat assembly, boat delivery and chandlery and marine parts sales,
to name but a few of the areas in which Mr Harpur has worked over
the past now
really 19 years, or 18 and a half years at least.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff said that during 1991 he conceived of an idea
that a marine industry directory with details of all the various
service
providers involved in the industry would be something that might be worthwhile.
His idea was that everything and everybody
to do with the boating industry in
Pittwater could be referenced and advertised in such a directory. He said that
from 1991 until
the middle of 1996 he researched and developed the idea by
gathering and compiling necessary information and that he had completed
that
process by about June 1996.
<P>

8   	The further detail of what he actually did is worthy of
setting out in this case. Mr Harpur said that he was aware that to
be of any
use the directory had to include all the service providers in the relevant area
and the existing directories that he had
observed usually only listed
businesses which paid to be included and he was of the view that resulted in a
less than comprehensive
service. He observed that those existing directories
were mainly sold through news agencies at a premium. His idea was that any
directory
he would produce would be issued free of charge from all outlets
visited by boat owners and so he had to set about working out how
it could be
that income could be made to pay for the work for the production of and
distribution of the directory.
<P>

9   	He spoke to many local boat owners and got feed back as to
which would be the best outlets and his conclusion was from that
work it would
be through yacht and boating clubs, marinas and chandlers. He spoke to various
people in the boating industry and his
feed back, as he called it, was that the
great majority of individuals supported the idea. He told me that in 1991 there
was a slump
in the boating industry and that he decided to, as he put it,
shelve the idea until things got better on the economic front.
<P>

10   	He spent some time in Queensland in 1991 and 1992 and he
researched the prospects of a directory for that area. In late 1992
he moved to
the Sunshine Coast and did some further research on the possibility of
directories both in Queensland and giving some
consideration to directories in
New South Wales. He also gave evidence, via his affidavit and oral evidence,
that for the purpose
of preparing for the directory he purchased nearly every
known boating magazine at one time or another and collected local publications
from the areas in which he was interested.
<P>

11   	He said he studied the advertisements and was soon able to
identify patterns for different types of businesses. He then also
made
estimates for the number of businesses in different fields in each of the
areas. He obtained some casual work in Manly in New
South Wales which gave him
access to a large number of boat owners as well as a good cross-section of the
local marine industry personnel
and by the end of 1994, beginning of 1995, he
had decided that his first task in looking at that research he had done was to
publish
a directory for the Pittwater waterfront in the northern part of
Sydney.
<P>

12   	He returned to Sydney in January 1995 and on his arrival
spent considerable time he said on the Pittwater waterfront observing
the then
changes since he had returned, or while he had been away in Queensland.
<P>

13   	He then in March 1995 commenced to compile a list of
service providers for the Pittwater directory. He said he had not done
this
before as that material becomes outdated by reason of change of businesses and
closing down of businesses, changes in business
names and the like.
<P>

14   	He created what could be described as a card system and he
put the names of these entities on cards and put their addresses
on the cards
and telephone numbers and he would then put them into alphabetical order. He
told me that he took those names from advertisements
in local newspapers and
that some of them came from his visits to places where several marine
businesses were located.
<P>

15   	He then started a second card system whereby he put them
in order under a heading so that headings were created by him. Such
headings
included upholstery and trimming, sail  boarding, fuel supplies, charter and so
on.  He then placed the cards that he had
created in alphabetical order into
the system behind those headings. It was the case he said that sometimes one
business might appear
in two or three categories.  For instance, a boat shed
which had outlets for sale of fuel and or sale of boating items and also hired
boats might appear under boat hire, fuel, equipment, et cetera.  So that one
business might appear a number of times in his card
system.
<P>

16   	He had to work out, he told me, the most efficient way of
selling advertising space and that seemed to be the way in which
he would make
his income and have capacity to issue or distribute this book for free. To that
end he said he drew up another list
of businesses but due to their location and
in some cases the type of business a sales person would be able to visit them
and attempt
to sell advertising space in the book. He had researched the costs
of advertising in other directories and he set a scale of charges
to be
used.
<P>

17   	All of this work he said was done by about April 1996. At
that time he was in fact negotiating with an entity company known
as Newport
Anchorage Pty Ltd for office space in their marina at Newport.
<P>

18   	For the purposes of people being included in the directory
he told me that potential contributors were to be canvassed by
sales persons
and he needed to research how this could be done with reference to the lists
that he had made.
<P>

19   	In June 1996 he met the defendant, William Lambourne. Mr
Lambourne told me that he was a publisher and he owns a small concern
called
Environmental Publications. He also told me he had been publishing various
books and maps for the past 25 years and that he
was well aware of and
understood the Copyright Act. He said that in June 96 he was introduced to Mr
Harpur and they had a discussion
about this directory. It is clear that prior
to June 1996, although Mr Lambourne might have heard what Mr Harpur was doing,
neither
man had been aware of the other personally.
<P>

20   	Mr Lambourne in fact said that when he met Mr Harpur he,
Mr Lambourne, proposed what he describes as a partnership. He said
that the
discussion that they had in June 1996 was such that he, Mr Lambourne, was to be
responsible for layout, compilation, design
and printing of the publication and
that Mr Harpur would be responsible for the collation of a list of names and
addresses of service
providers. He also said that Mr Harpur said he would be
responsible for selling advertising space and the financial accounting.
<P>

21   	His oral evidence was that when they met and had this
first discussion he said that, "We both have skills, lets combine them
and
produce a marine directory." (p 64) He told Mr Cameron in cross-examination
that the first time he had ever talked to Mr Harpur
about the directory was
during the conversation in which he suggested they combine to produce the
marine directory. He told me that
he did know at that time that Mr Harpur was
working on a marine directory and further that he did know that Mr Harpur was
looking
for somebody to publish it. He acknowledges that he, of course, was a
publisher at the time.
<P>

22   	He also told me that he said to Mr Harpur:
<P>

"We will produce a directory together, we will publish that directory, we will
deduct the costs involved in producing the directory
from our total revenue and
we will split the revenue 50/50."
<P>

 
<P>

23   	He wasn't able to say how long the partnership was to
endure. He did say that it ended in November or December 1996.
<P>

24   	Mr Harpur, on the other hand, rejects any suggestion that
what he agreed to do with Mr Lambourne was to go into partnership.
He said that
he was ready to have his directory provided to a publisher to assist him with
publication but that the conversation
that occurred in June 1996 with Mr
Lambourne when they first met was quite different. He said that what was said
by Mr Lambourne
was as follows: 
<P>

"Let me do the publishing, I'll foot all the expenses, I'll reimburse myself
out of advertising income for what it costs me including
printing costs, I'll
guarantee my fees as a publisher will not exceed an amount equivalent to one
half of the net profit."
<P>

25   	Mr Harpur gave evidence that he told Mr Lambourne he would
think about it and some four or five days later he informed Mr
Lambourne that
the offer was acceptable to him, that he had a few months more work to do and
he was aiming to issue the directory
before Christmas.
<P>

26   	Mr Lambourne denies this conversation occurred. Mr Harpur
maintained that they were the terms of the conversation in his evidence
and he
also said he had a conversation with Mr Lambourne in which he said to him, "I
would like the agreement to be in writing.",
to which Mr Lambourne said,
"There's no need to do that."
<P>

27   	Mr Harpur said Mr Lambourne said, "It will not be
necessary, I have done a lot of publishing and have never found the necessity
for a written agreement." Mr Lambourne, on the other hand, says there was no
discussion of that nature in respect of a written agreement.
<P>

28   	So it is that the plaintiff alleges an arrangement whereby
Mr Lambourne would assist Mr Harpur with publication for which
he would be
reimbursed his expenses and would be paid a fee no more than 50 per cent of the
profits.  If his fee was more than 50
per cent of the profits he would only
receive 50 per cent or an amount equivalent to 50 per cent. If his fee was less
than 50 per
cent of the profits he would be paid the actual amount of the fee
and not a flat 50 per cent of the profits.
<P>

29   	Mr Harpur then provided to Mr Lambourne information that
he had gathered, including his cards. Those cards are exhibit F in
these
proceedings.
<P>

30   	So far as the procedure that was adopted in respect of
preparation of the material for publication, Mr Lambourne agreed that
what
happened was that Mr Harpur would prepare a draft and give it to Mr Lambourne,
Mr Lambourne, having entered it on to the computer
disk, would print out a hard
copy effectively and give it back to Mr Harpur. Mr Harpur would write on that
draft and then give it
back to Mr Lambourne and he, Mr Lambourne, would include
the handwritten  amendments into the computer generated document on his
computer.
<P>

31   	That process was followed between June, July 1996 and
continued through to approximately November 1996.
<P>

32   	Mr Lambourne had a different view about what the directory
should cover. He told Mr Harpur he thought it should be a wider
area than just
Pittwater. Mr Harpur disagreed. His plan was one for Pittwater only and he
wanted to maintain that plan.
<P>

33   	It is apparent that a bank account was opened at the local
branch of the Commonwealth Bank and Mr Lambourne and Mr Harpur
attended upon
the bank for that purpose. The name of the account was Coastal Marine
Directories Publishing.
<P>

34   	It is apparent that there was some dispute between Mr
Harpur and Mr Lambourne about this business name. It seems that Mr Lambourne
had it registered without first telling Mr Harpur.  Although Mr Harpur
suggested to Mr Lambourne that he was less than pleased about
him doing that he
proceeded to open the bank account in that name with both Mr Harpur and Mr
Lambourne as joint signatories. The
purpose of opening that bank account was,
it seems, to deposit moneys from advertisers and prospective advertisers for
the directory.
There does not seem to be much issue about the fact that
reimbursement for Mr Lambourne's expenses would come from that account.
<P>

35   	In late 1996 the relationship between Mr Harpur and Mr
Lambourne soured, the reason being that Mr Lambourne and Mr Harpur
disagreed
about the content of the directory and there were other personal matters, it
seems, between the two men.
<P>

36   	Mr Harpur said that he found that Mr Lambourne had been
changing the directory to add material to it that he did not wish
to be in it
and he confronted Mr Lambourne with this fact. It was apparently after this
confrontation that Mr Lambourne and Mr Harpur
decided to have nothing much
further to do with each other. However, there was some discussion between the
two men and the evidence
discloses that figures were discussed as to how much
Mr Lambourne might pay Mr Harpur for Mr Lambourne to continue with the
publication
of the directory that was prepared up to that stage.
<P>

37   	It is appropriate only at this stage to say that those
discussions did not bare fruit by way of an agreement and Mr Lambourne
notwithstanding that proceeded to publish what is entitled 1997 Pittwater
Hawkesbury Brisbane Water Boating Directory. He published
a similar directory
in 1998 and in 1999, under the description The Little Red Book, published the
Sydney Region Boating Directory.
Each of the references in each year have
within them on their front cover at least the reference to Pittwater.
<P>

38   	There were further discussions and correspondence between
the parties between late 1996 and throughout 1997 once again not
reaching any
agreement and on 7 January 1998 the summons in these proceedings was issued.
<P>

39   	The hearing commenced on Tuesday, 20 April 1999 and
continued through to today, 22 April 1999. Mr Cameron of counsel appeared
for
the plaintiff and Mr Lambourne appeared for himself.
<P>

40   	The claim made by the plaintiff is that what Mr Lambourne
has produced effectively is what Mr Harpur gave  him, he has copied
it.  He has
infringed, it is claimed, the copyright of the plaintiff.
<P>

41   	The plaintiff claims that work consists of a compilation
of information made by him and that<b> s 32 of the Copyright Act (Cth) 1968
</b>applies to his work. S 32 (1) provides: 
<P>

"Subject to this Act, copyright subsists in an original literary, dramatic,
musical or artistic work that is unpublished and of
which the author:
<P>

 
<P>

(a) was a qualified person at the time when the work was made; or
<P>

 
<P>

(b) if the making of the work extended over a period - was a qualified person
for a substantial part of that period."
<P>

 Subsection (2) provides:
<P>

"Subject to this Act, where an original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
work has been published:
<P>

 
<P>

(a) copyright subsists in the work; or
<P>

 
<P>

(b) if copyright in the work subsisted immediately before its first publication
- copyright continues to subsist in the work;
<P>

if, but only if:
<P>

 
<P>

(c) the first publication of the work took place in Australia;
<P>

 
<P>

(d) the author of the work was a qualified person at the time when the work was
first published; or
<P>

 
<P>

(e) the author died before that time but was a qualified person immediately
before his or her death."
<P>

42   	 The relevant reference to qualified person means that the
person is an Australian citizen, an Australian protected person
or person
resident in Australia.
<P>

43   	The plaintiff relies upon s 10 of the Act for the
definition of literary work which includes:
<P>

"(a) a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols (whether
or not in a visible form)..."
<P>

44   	 It is clear on an observation of the compilation of
material put together by Mr Harpur and with reference to what he did
to compile
that work and to compile the information, that he also had access to the Yellow
Pages. Neither party has tendered any
portion of that publication, however,
both parties have made reference to it.
<P>

45   	In <b>Hollinrake v Truswell</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281894%29%203%20Ch%20420" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1894) 3 Ch 420</a> Davey LJ
said as follows: 
<P>

"...a literary work is intended to afford either information and instruction,
or pleasure, in the form of literary enjoyment."
<P>

46   	In Blackie &amp; Sons Ltd  v  Lothian Book Publishing Co
Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1921] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281921%29%2029%20CLR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1921) 29 CLR 396</a> Starke J said of the author of the subject
application in that case: 
<P>

"Undoubtedly the compilation of the plaintiff's book involved much independent
labour and research."
<P>

47   	The plaintiff in this case claims that the compilation of
the work fits comfortably within s 10 of the Copyright Act and further
that the
work is in fact original work.
<P>

Starke J in Blackie &amp; Sons went on to say at 398: 
<P>

"The literary expression of the matter so collected was in some cases that of
(the professor) as in the general introduction to
the play and the notes...
whilst in other cases the expression was copied from other authors, as in many
instances in the notes upon
the play itself.  The whole was combined in the
form of a book. It is not a mere copy of written matter already published.
Apart
from the compilation, the work of (the professor), the book did not
exist."
<P>

48   	Sundberg J in<b> Baillieu &amp; Anor  v  Australian
Electoral Commission &amp; Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2033%20IPR%20494" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 33 IPR 494</a></b> summarises the case at
page 505 wherein the matters of principle to be decided in this case are
helpfully set out. Sundberg J refers
firstly to <b>Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v
William Hill (Football) Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%201%20WLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 1 WLR 273</a>,</b> in particular Reid LJ's
judgment at 276/277 in which Reid LJ said: 
<P>

"...the more correct approach is first to determine whether the plaintiff's
work as a whole is 'original' and protected by copyright,
and then to inquire
whether the part taken by the defendant is substantial."
<P>

 Pearce LJ at 293 of that report cited by Sundberg J said: 
<P>

"The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not
normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore
will not be
protected. For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its
collocation will, when robbed of that collocation,
not be a substantial part of
copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an
infringement.  It is this
I think which is meant by one or two judicial
observations that there is no copyright in some unoriginal parts of a whole
that is
copyright. "
<P>

49   	After referring then to Warwick Film Productions Ltd v
Eisinger  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%201%20Ch%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 1 Ch 508</a> and to Kalamazoo (Australia) Pty Ltd v Compact
Business Systems Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%205%20IPR%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 5 IPR 213</a>, Sundberg J then refers back to
Thomas J's language in Kalamazoo and says: 
<P>

"Some degree of concentration, care, analysis and comparison went into the
task. The author had to locate the relevant provisions
and mould them into a
readily digestible form.  Care had to be taken to see that in rendering the
grounds in simpler and shorter
language, the meaning of the schedule was not
altered."
<P>

50   	The plaintiff in this case also referred me to<b> Frank
Smythson Ltd v GA Cramp and Sons Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=59%20TLR%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">59 TLR 223.</a>  </b>That was a case in which
a diary and tables of a diary had been copied. In particular I was referred to
Master of the Rolls Greene
LJ's statement at page 225. After referring to
Atkinson LJ's statement in<b> MacMillan &amp; Co Ltd v K &amp; G Cooper
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281923%29%2093%20LJPC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1923) 93 LJPC 113</a><b>.</b>  Greene LJ said the following: 
<P>

"Why did Mr Eckford copy the defendant's diary in 1938?  The inference seems to
me to be clear. He copied that diary to save himself
trouble. If he had to
exercise independent judgment of his own and decide what were the tables which
it would be useful to include,
and had gone to the sources where that
information was to be found, making abridgements where necessary and selections
where necessary,
he would have clearly, I think, been put to considerable
labour, and would have had to exercise skill and judgment of his own.
<P>

 
<P>

...
<P>

 
<P>

It seems to me that, taking all these matters into consideration, it is
established that there is a sufficient amount of skill,
labour, judgment and so
forth put into the selection of that group of tables to attract copyright."
<P>

51   	In<b> A-One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Off Road
Imports Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1996) 37 AIPC 37258 at 91222</b>, the Federal Court
was there considering a claim of infringement of copyright in respect of a
motoring magazine. It was a catalogue
said to include various material relating
to items of interest to the reader and Drummond J once again helpfully
collected the relevant
cases and summarised those touching upon the topic of
originality. Drummond J said at page 37265: 
<P>

"So far as compilations that consist entirely of existing material, i.e.,
material not created by the compiler, are concerned, Ladbroke
(Football) is
authority that originality may be found and a claim of copyright may therefore
subsist, by virtue of selection alone."
<P>

52   	His honour went on to deal in more detail with examples
such as chemists' catalogues of instructions and the like and then
said: 
<P>

"That copyright can exist in such a mundane compilation of information readily
available to all shows why the skill, judgment and
labour in selecting what to
include in a trade catalogue will be as relevant as the often very limited
skill, judgment and labour
involved in putting that selection into written
form, in determining whether the compilation has sufficient 'originality' to
attract
copyright."
<P>

53   	In further reference to Ladbrokes his Honour said at page
37268:  
<P>

"Ladbroke (Football) Ltd, Redwood Music, (a reference to Redwood Music Ltd v
Chappell and Co  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1982%20RPC%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1982 RPC 109)</a> and Eisinger, proceed on the basis that a
composite work made up of pirated material and original material produced by
the compiler
can itself be an original work posessing copyright, even though it
may also infringe the copyright in the pirated material included
in it."
<P>

54   	Kearney J in Ogden Industries Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v KIS
(Australia) Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 283</a> referred to the locus classicus on the
meaning of the term original at page 288 of the report referring to University
of London Press
Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281916%29%202%20Ch%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1916) 2 Ch 601</a> which his
Honour noted was quoted and applied by the House of Lords in Ladbroke at 469 as
follows: 
<P>

"The word 'original' does not in this connection mean that the work must be the
expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright
Acts are not concerned
with the originality of ideas, but with the expression of thought and, in the
case of 'literary work' with
the expression of thought in print or writing. The
originality which is required relates to the expression of the thought. But the
Act does not require that the expression must be in an original or novel form,
but that the work must not be copied from another
work - that it should
originate from the author."
<P>

55   	In that case, which was a case about the copying of keys,
Kearney J rejected the defendant's submission that it was ridiculous
to apply
originality to the copying of keys and he said:
<P>

"First, it would seem to be directed rather towards the concept of novelty in
the patent law sense than to originality in the copyright
sense of a work
emanating from the independent efforts of an author and not copied. Secondly,
the argument cannot be sustained in
the face of the amount of knowledge,
labour, skill, judgment, time and expense shown by the undisputed evidence to
have been applied
to the production of the subject drawings."
<P>

56   	Final reference was made relevantly to Barwick CJ in
<b>Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1965/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%2d66%29%2039%20ALJR%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965-66) 39 ALJR 32</a></b> wherein
it is said the Chief Justice took the matter one step further. His Honour said
at page 34: 
<P>

"The law has gone a long way to protect the labours of a man in producing and
tabulating information."
<P>

57   	I am not sure that that particular case takes the matter a
good deal further, having regard to the previous decisions to which
I have made
reference.
<P>

58   	In any event, what the plaintiff claims in this case is
that his was a literary work, his work was original and it was in
a material
form, that it was written and it was on a computer disk - see<b> Autodisk Inc.
v Dyson <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20173%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 173 CLR 330.</a> </b>He says pursuant to s 35 (2) of the Copyright
Act he is the  owner, he is the creator or author of the work.
<P>

59   	Mr Lambourne, the defendant, submits that what Mr Harpur
did effectively is not original. He put submissions to me today that
Mr
Harpur's work came in main from the Yellow Pages. Even accepting that for one
moment to be the case, it is clear that what Mr
Harpur did was create something
different from that which was apparently in the Yellow Pages.
<P>

60   	Although I have not had access to the Yellow Pages, as it
is not exhibited before me, Mr Harpur said that he made categories
for the
names and addresses of the various entities that are included on his cards.
Even if it be the case that Mr Lambourne was
right, that the whole of what he
did came from the Yellow Pages, then A-One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v  Off
Road Imports Pty Ltd
seems to suggest that even if it is pirated, copyright may
still attach and if it is put together in a different form than that which
one
finds in the Yellow Pages it seems that it would be a creation of original work
rather than a mere transposition of information
in the Yellow Pages.
<P>

61   	Mr Lambourne submitted that 23 per cent came from the
Yellow Pages. He makes that assessment because Mr Harpur gave evidence
that he
had in fact checked the Yellow Pages in respect of 50 of the entries in the
cards and directory, it being remembered that
there are approximately 200 odd
entries to which Mr Harpur was referred.
<P>

62   	In any event, Mr Lambourne submits that Mr Harpur could
not have obtained this information from the individuals because he
wasn't able
to produce a proforma letter which he said he sent out to various entities in
the area.
<P>

63   	Although not pleaded in this case specifically, I should
deal with one aspect of the Copyright Act in respect of Mr Lambourne's
claims
in his evidence and what seems to come from his submissions.
<P>

64   	Mr Lambourne said on a number of occasions that he made no
claim in respect of the lists of names that he had produced in
the directories
that he had published. He said that he understood the Copyright Act and that no
copyright attaches to them. By reason
of s 115 of the Copyright Act, where it
is established that an infringement has been committed but it is also
established that at
the time of the infringement the defendant was not aware
and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the act constituting the
infringement was an infringement, the plaintiff is then not entitled to any
damages against the defendant in respect of the infringement
but is entitled to
an account of profits in respect of it.
<P>

65   	In this case the plaintiff has in fact elected in respect
of the alternative relief but I should say that the statement by
the defendant,
Mr Lambourne, in respect of this aspect of the matter has troubled me, not the
least because of his statements in
his own publications.
<P>

66   	In the publication in 1999, that is the Sydney Region
Boating Directory the following appears on the second front page: 
<P>

"This publication is published each year by Coastal Marine Directories.  All
rights reserved.  The use of this directory and maps
for any purpose other than
as a reference guide, or  reproduction of any part of this directory is
expressly prohibited without written
permission from the publisher. The
publisher has taken every precaution to avoid errors and omissions in this
directory. The advertisers
assume complete responsibility to use any brand
names and logos."
<P>

67   	It has been established that there is no reference to Mr
Harpur or to his efforts in any of those publications. There has
been no
seeking of approval from Mr Harpur to use any information provided by him to Mr
Lambourne and there has been no payment made
to Mr Harpur in respect of the use
of that material.
<P>

68   	 Mr Lambourne's case is that he did not infringe
copyright. What he did was to create his own work. He criticised the
documentation
of the plaintiff, particularly in exhibit C, suggesting that
various aspects of the work that he was supposed to have copied were
"tucked
away" in parts of the exhibit. He submitted that on the evidence I would be
satisfied that Mr Harpur did not have the majority
of names and addresses
before the formation of the association by way of proformas but, as I say
earlier, by way of just obtaining
it from the Yellow Pages.
<P>

69   	Mr Lambourne gave evidence and was cross-examined by Mr
Cameron in respect of the evidence that he gave about what he did
after the
relationship soured. In his affidavit that he filed in 1998 Mr Lambourne said
that he in fact produced the new publications
as follows (para 14):
<P>

"14.1 Completely discarding the information Mr Harpur had compiled.
<P>

 
<P>

14.2 Writing to service providers to check correctness and determine the
classification they would like to appear under...
<P>

 
<P>

14.3 Collating this information into a publishing format.
<P>

 
<P>

14.4 Selling advertising.
<P>

 
<P>

14.5 Layout and design.
<P>

 
<P>

14.6 Adding informational pages (knots, weather, fish etc.).
<P>

 
<P>

14.7 Map production.
<P>

 
<P>

14.8 Printing &amp; distribution."
<P>

70   	So, on the affidavit evidence on reading 14.1 it appeared
that Mr Lambourne had completely discarded Mr Harpur's information
and set
about preparing his own material and information for his own boating
directory.
<P>

71   	His oral evidence on this topic is significant. Mr
Lambourne told me that he gave the cards that Mr Harpur had given him back
to
Mr Harpur in November 1996. Those documents are exhibit F. He said he gave them
to him at that time because "when I walked out
I gave him all his material
back" (p 69 line 40).
<P>

72   	He was then asked some questions about paragraph 14.1.
The following evidence was given (p 70):
<P>

"Q.  When you say in paragraph 14.1 that you completely discarded the
information Mr Harpur had compiled, do you agree that at the
point in time when
you made that decision the information he had given you, that is to say all of
it, had been transferred on to
your computer and had actually been reproduced
in draft form?
<P>

A.  Yes, to a degree, yes.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  When you used the words discarded the information that he had given you do
you mean to say you threw away the disks on which
the information was
stored?
<P>

A.  No."
<P>

73   	Mr Lambourne then told me he kept those disks.  He was
then asked (p 71):
<P>

"Q.  Did you go and compile all the information that is in the 1997 directory
afresh without recourse at all to the information
that you had stored on those
disks?
<P>

A.  Can I explain how I did it?
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  Can't you answer the question?
<P>

A.  To a degree."
<P>

74   	Mr Lambourne then gave the following evidence:
<P>

 
<P>

"I have a computer with a list of names and addresses on which is the combined
work of both Mr Harpur and myself, not just Mr Harpur's
work but a combined
effort between the both of us. I then took the complete list of names and
addresses which I admit I took from
the Yellow Pages and I wrote to each of the
boat owners, boat services providers. I then checked those facts against the
list I had
on my computer, amended it, added to it, changed it.
<P>

 
<P>

...
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  So, you had no reason at all to use or have access you say to any of the
information that Mr Harpur had given you and which
you had stored on disks on
your computer?
<P>

A.  No, that's not what I said.  I said I had a list of names and addresses on
my computer.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  Stop there, that being the list of names compiled by Mr Harpur and given to
you, is that right?
<P>

A.  Correct, that's right.
<P>

 
<P>

...
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  Then you have got that, you then said you went to the Yellow Pages and got
some more information out?
<P>

A.  No, I said I got all my information, I got a second listing completely from
the yellow pages.
<P>

 
<P>

...
<P>

 
<P>

 Q.  In what way did you use Mr Harpur's information when you were doing this
exercise with the Yellow Pages book?
<P>

A. Well, basically all the names or the majority of the names were already on
the computer. I then checked with each of those names
to the correctness of
their address, their name and the telephone number when I sent the proformas
back and you can see copies of
the proformas in my affidavit. I then looked at
the list, if there was any difficulty I excluded them, if there were any
changes
I changed them.
<P>

 
<P>

...
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  Did you use the Yellow Pages to see whether or not he had missed something
out?  (He being Mr Harpur)
<P>

A.  I suppose generally I did, yes."
<P>

75   	After telling me he in fact had contacted various entities
on the waterfront area by writing letters to them (p 73): 
<P>

"Q.  If they wanted to be included you added them to the listing that Mr Harpur
had given you, is that right?
<P>

A.  Yes correct."
<P>

76   	It seems to me that the evidence that Mr Lambourne gave in
the various portions that I have just extracted clearly suggests
that Mr
Harpur's work remained on Mr Lambourne's computer and, as the last question and
answer demonstrates, where the Yellow Pages
indicated a change was necessary or
alternatively where the proforma returns indicated a change was necessary,
either by way of amendment,
inclusion or exclusion, Mr Lambourne added or
changed Mr Harpur's work.
<P>

77   	In making an assessment of the submissions that Mr
Lambourne has put to me in respect of the nature of Mr Harpur's work it
has
been necessary to analyse the documentary evidence in this case. That includes
most importantly a comparison between the first
portion of the document behind
tab F in exhibit C and exhibit A3, the 1997 boating directory.
<P>

78   	To assist in this regard Mr Lambourne tendered a chart or
table that he had prepared, which is exhibit 3 in these proceedings,
setting
out the various categories and entries both in Mr Harpur's work and Mr
Lambourne's book. There is no doubt that the vast
majority of Mr Harpur's work
is included in Mr Lambourne's book. Not only that, it is clear beyond doubt
that the majority of the
descriptions are almost identical. Where there appears
a difference it is slight. For instance, Mr Harpur's work refers to boat
brokers.
Mr Lambourne's work refers to brokers, boat and yacht sales. Mr
Harpur's work refers to boat builders and shipwrights. Mr Lambourne's
work
refers to builders, shipwrights and repairers. Mr Harpur's work refers to boat
building supplies and exhibit A3, as I have been
calling Mr Lambourne's work,
refers to boat building materials. Other references such as covers, canopies in
Mr Harpur's work and
then in Mr Lambourne's exhibit A3, covers, canopies,
upholstery, trim.
<P>

79   	So far as the other documents in exhibit C are concerned
there is a Marine Services Directory 1996-1997 at tab F of  exhibit
C and there
is a Pittwater Marine Services Directory 1997 in tab D. Once again a comparison
of those two documents result in a conclusion
by me that the vast majority of
Mr Harpur's work appears, both in style and under the same heading, or one so
similar that it seems
minor, in exhibit A3.
<P>

80   	A further analysis is the cards, exhibit F, with exhibit
A3. It is clear that the cards that Mr Harpur produced include categorisation
of the various outlets and entities in the area. It is clear to me that quite a
deal of energy and skill has been applied to the
creation of the work by Mr
Harpur. If one were to look at an entity such as Gonsalves Boat Shed in a book
such as a telephone book,
one can not know that it is in fact an outlet for
various other aspects of boating interest. That boat shed appears in a number
of
categories. For instance, it appears in the Antifouling Services and it
appears under the heading Boat Builders, Shipwrights and
Repairers. Going
through the book you find it under Boat Hire and various other headings.
<P>

81   	One needs to know the industry and have some skill in
categorising each of the entities in each of the categories. That does
not come
from a mere copying of details from a phone book on to a page. It comes from,
as Mr Harpur swore to, his experience in the
industry, his research of the area
and his creation of his two card system. Exhibit F is evidence at least of some
of this.
<P>

82   	Although it is clear that the card entries are less than
the entries in the 1997 book, exhibit A3, the step between the card
entries is
really the creation of the drafts that appear in tab F and tab D of exhibit
C.
<P>

83   	So it is that one can trace by independent evidence the
energies that were expended by Mr Harpur on the creation of his work.
True it
is that Mr Lambourne provided assistance to Mr Harpur in creating the layout on
the computer system but both drafts in exhibit
C indicate that it was Mr Harpur
that was authoring this material. He was the one who amended it. He was the one
who gave it back
to Mr Lambourne after amendment and checking.  That much is
clear from the evidence of both the plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

84   	I am satisfied that Mr Harpur satisfies the requirements
of s 32 of the Copyright Act. I am satisfied that this is a literary
work
within the meaning of the Copyright Act having particular regard to s 10 and
the reference to compilation. I am also satisfied
that the reference made to
the Yellow Pages by Mr Harpur was such that he was checking his work rather
than using it as a source.
However, if I were to be wrong in respect of that it
seems to me, having regard to Drummond J's decision in the A-One case, that
it
may not be decisive in this case.
<P>

85   	In those circumstances it seems to me that it is
unnecessary to proceed into the actual arrangements that were made between
Mr
Harpur and Mr Lambourne and the conflicts that they have had between each other
about what the arrangements were. However, for
more abundant caution in case it
be suggested I am wrong in my finding in respect of the copyright matter I say
the following.
<P>

86   	I am not satisfied that this was an agreement for a
partnership. On the one hand Mr Lambourne states that he  agreed to that
effect
with Mr Harpur at the beginning of their relationship in June 1996. He stated
in his affidavit at para 12, "I had probably
invested about $10,000 cash in the
project." When tested as to how that $10,000 was invested Mr Lambourne told me
that he in fact
had provided various pieces of furniture, computer, a
programme, a fax, drafting material and a laser printer. He gave details of
the
cost of that being to the amount of $9,000 and yet he told Mr Cameron in
cross-examination that he did not regard any of that
as partnership property.
He did not in fact pay the last telephone account of $1,000, although Telecom
had phoned him in respect
of the contribution to be made by him in respect of
it. He did not actually ask Telecom for a copy apparently but rang Mr Harpur's
solicitor to obtain a copy of that bill. He said that when he did not receive a
response from Mr Harpur's solicitor he did not pay
it. That last mentioned
matter is not decisive because it is an aspect of the relationship that seemed,
at the very least, a very
woolly one to be suggesting it was a partnership.
<P>

87   	It seems to me that Mr Harpur's rejection of the
partnership suggestion is to be believed. He said effectively in his affidavit
sworn in April 1998 that he would not have gone into a partnership with someone
he did not know and if there was to be a partnership
arrangement he would have
involved the solicitors. Certainly from Mr Lambourne's point of view, he
stating that he was well aware
of the Copyright Act, it seems s 196 of that Act
is relevant.
<P>

88   	Mr Cameron referred me to<b> O'Brien v Komesaroff
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%2d82%29%20150%20CLR%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981-82) 150 CLR 310</a></b> in which Mason J (as he then was) referred to that
section and said at page 317 in effect it is necessary for there to be a
transmission
by assignment by will or by devolution by operation of law for any
property in the copyright to become property of the partnership.
So, even if I
am wrong in finding that there is no partnership there does not seem to be any
appropriate assignment of the copyright
as property of the partnership.
<P>

89   	It seems to me what happened between these two men was
that Mr Harpur was very keen to have his work published, Mr Lambourne
was
willing to assist in that publishing role. For one reason or another the
specific roles to be played by each of the parties became
blurred over a period
of time and the plaintiff and the defendant did things that perhaps the other
might have thought was the responsibility
of the other in the beginning of the
relationship but at the end of 1996 it is clear that the correspondence between
the parties
puts it beyond doubt that Mr Lambourne understood that Mr Harpur
did not wish him to proceed to publish the directory which contained
his work
unless a suitable agreement was reached prior to the end of that year. It is
clear that Mr Lambourne made some offers of
money to Mr Harpur but for various
reasons, the detail of which is not necessary to go into,  an agreement that
could be reached.
<P>

90   	One other aspect of this case with which I should deal is
the use of money in the bank account by Mr Harpur in October 1996.
Mr Lambourne
cross-examined Mr Harpur about the writing of two cheques to clear out that
bank account, the total in the bank account
at the time being $324.48.  Mr
Harpur wrote a cheque for $135.95 and $150. He told me he  used those moneys to
pay personal bills
as he was in need of the funds. Mr Lambourne maintains that
he did not know that had occurred prior to it occurring. Mr Harpur says
he told
Mr Lambourne.
<P>

91   	The correspondence that occurred between the two men
suggests on one view of it that Mr Lambourne was alleging that Mr Harpur
had
misappropriated advertisers' money without his knowledge. It is clear that Mr
Harpur by October 1996 understood that money in
that account was to pay for Mr
Lambourne's expenses. Consistently with that understanding he told me when I
asked him why he told
Mr Lambourne that he cleared the money out, he thought it
was the right thing to do. It seems to me in the circumstances of this
case it
would have been the right thing to do.  Whether or not it did occur, that is
whether or not he told him, does not, it seems
to me in all the circumstances
of this case, have much relevance to the decisions I have already made.
<P>

92   	In the circumstances therefore I find that the plaintiff
did have the copyright in the original literary work which has now
been
infringed by Mr Lambourne's publication of that work as contained in tab F and
tab D of exhibit C, emanating from, in part,
exhibit F.
<P>

93   	In those circumstances I will make an order consistent
with par 1 of the summons filed in these proceedings as amended and
I will make
an order that an account be taken of the profits made by the defendant as
contained in par 4 of the summons.
<P>

94   	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of this
application.
<P>

95   	I will list the matter at 10am, Friday 30 April 1999 for
short minutes.
