<b>2963/95	SYDNEY LEGACY APPEALS FUND   -v-   LEGAL CHAMBERS PTY LIMITED &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> By notice of motion filed on 9 March 1999
the first defendant, Legal Chambers Pty Limited, seeks an order that the
summons of the
plaintiff, Sydney Legacy Appeals  Fund, be struck out pursuant
to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a> or, in the alternative, pursuant to the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> rule 26(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, upon the basis
that the proceedings do not disclose a reasonable cause of action and are
frivolous,
vexatious and an abuse of process.
<P>

2   	The substantive proceeding were commenced by summons filed
by the plaintiff on 2 July 1995.  That summons names two defendants,
being
Legal Chambers Pty Limited as first defendant and the Registrar-General as
second defendant.  The Registrar-General has not
taken any active part in the
proceedings and has not been represented at the hearing of today's
application.
<P>

3   	The substantive relief sought in the summons is a
declaration that the plaintiff, as registered proprietor of the land described
in Schedule 1 to the summons, is entitled to the benefit of a right of way
along and inside the western boundary of the land described
in Schedule 2 to
the summons, of which the first defendant is the registered proprietor.  The
summons also seeks as consequential
relief an order for the production to the
Registrar-General of the duplicate certificate of title and an order that the
Registrar-General
rectify the register.
<P>

4   	The present dispute relates to a laneway which is part of
the land known as 9 George Street, Parramatta.  That land now comprises
the
entirety of the land contained in Certificate of Title Folio Identifier
41833824.  Part of that land consists of a laneway about
12 feet wide along the
western boundary of that land.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of land known as
150 Marsden Street, Parramatta, which land is in part contiguous
to the land of
the defendant.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff, which is a body corporate, claims through
various of its members that it has in fact been using the laneway,
the subject
of the present dispute, since at least 1956 and probably since the time when it
acquired the land at 150 Marsden Street
two or three yearly earlier.  The
laneway was not originally part of the land which was owned by the defendant,
known as 9 George
Street.
<P>

7   	The substantial part of the land at 9 George Street was
held under Old System title when acquired originally by the  defendant.
Subsequently the major part of that land, but not including the laneway, was
brought under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i>.
<P>

8   	The defendant acquired the laneway by way of prescriptive
title. On 10 September 1993 the defendant lodged a primary application
to bring
that laneway under the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> </i>and for
consolidation of the laneway with the balance of the land at 9 George Street,
which was already under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> </i>and already owned by the
defendant and of which the defendant was the registered proprietor.
<P>

9   	On 20 July 1994 the plaintiff lodged a caveat pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 74B</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act </i>1900</a> against the defendant's
primary application.
<P>

10   	In August 1994 the defendant received a letter dated 3
August 1994 from the Director of the Land Titles Office, advising of
the
lodgment of the caveat and stating the caveat would remain on the title for
three months, after which period the caveat would
lapse.  The caveat itself in
the schedule thereto set forth the nature of the estate or interest being
asserted by the caveator as
being "right of way pertinent to land owned by the
caveator or contained in certificate of title 6936 folio 76".  The following
facts
were then stated: 
<P>

The caveator has used the right of way for more than 20 years.
<P>

11   	Subsequently the caveat lapsed, and on 12 December 1994
the primary application of the defendant was approved and a fresh
certificate
of tile issued to the defendant. That certificate of title consolidated the
title to the subject laneway with the title
to the land of which the defendant
was already the registered proprietor. That title was, however, subject to an
easement, described
thereon as follows:
<P>

Right of way affecting the part shown as per contained in the title diagram.
<P>

12   	The right of way referred to in that certificate of title
as a right of way over the area of the laneway is the subject of
the present
proceedings.  However, the benefit of the right of way disclosed in the
certificate of title was benefit not for the
registered proprietor of the land
of the plaintiff but a benefit for the Commonwealth of Australia in its
capacity as the registered
proprietor of certain other land which was
contiguous to the land of the defendant.
<P>

13   	In due course, the Commonwealth, as the registered
proprietor of the dominant tenement, on 10 December 1997 executed in favour
of
the defendant, the registered proprietor of the servient tenement, a transfer
releasing the right of the way in favour of the
Commonwealth.
<P>

14   	Thus it will be appreciated that since the date of that
release the defendant is the registered proprietor of the land known
as 9
George Street and there is no right of way or other easement operating on the
title to that land.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff in the substantive proceedings, however,
asserts that it has acquired a prescriptive easement over the laneway.
 In
support of that assertion the plaintiff has filed a number of affidavits from
various persons who, according to their affidavits,
have since as early as 1956
used the laneway in order to gain access to the rear part of  the property of
the plaintiff and have
parked various motor vehicles on the property of the
plaintiff using the laneway for the purpose of ingress to and egress from that
area of the plaintiff's land upon which the vehicles have been parked. None of
those persons have been cross-examined upon their
evidence.  Indeed, it would
be quite inappropriate in an application for summary dismissal of the
plaintiff's claim, as is the present
application, for disputed questions of
fact to be attempted to be resolved.
<P>

16   	The defendant is content in the present application to
accept the evidence asserted by the plaintiff, in the various affidavits.
<P>

17   	The defendant does not deny that the laneway has been used
on behalf of the plaintiff for many years.  Indeed, the defendant
asserts that
that use has been as a consequence of permission or consent given by the
defendant to the plaintiff.  The defendant
does, however, deny that the
plaintiff, through its various members and advisers, has any right to use the
laneway.  The defendant,
through its Counsel, has informed the Court that it
will continue to abide by the statement of intention appearing in
correspondence
which passed between the parties in October of 1994 (being
annexures K and L to the affidavit of Maxwell Crothers Clark sworn 12
March
1999), and confirms that it will permit continued vehicular access to the
parking area at the rear of the plaintiff's property
along the laneway which is
the subject of the present proceedings.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff, however, is not content that it should have
some, what might be described as, personal consent or permission
from the
defendant to use the laneway for access. The plaintiff is desirous of
establishing a legal right to use it, such that that
right will continue
irrespective of whether the defendant is the registered proprietor of the land
at 9 George Street or whether
some other entity becomes the owner of that
land.
<P>

19   	The defendant brings the present application pursuant to
the provisions of each of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> rule 26, essentially upon
the basis that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed in the plaintiff's
claim.  The principles in
relation to such an application are well-known.  It
is only necessary for me to refer to the decision of the High Court of
Australia
in<b> </b><i>General Steel Industries Incorporated v Commissioner for
Railways (NSW) </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a>, especially the judgment of Barwick
CJ.
<P>

20   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the
plaintiff's claim is doomed to failure and that it cannot succeed.  
The
defendant based its submissions on two grounds.  The first ground is that which
emerges from indefeasibility of title contained
in a number of provisions of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act </i>1900</a>.  The defendant submitted that Division 2 of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the Act creates a regime concerning the lodging of caveats against
primary applications and the consequences of such lodgement.
<P>

21   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the
plaintiff, having lodged the caveat but not having complied with the
machinery
and procedures contemplated by such provisions of that Division as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74c.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
74C(1)</a>, has totally lost any right which it might otherwise have to
substantiate the existence of the alleged right of way, including any
right
which it might have to a prescriptive easement over that laneway.  In this
regard the defendant relied upon the passage in<b> </b>Peter Butt, <i>Land Law,
</i>3 ed.<b> </b>(1996), in which the learned author, at paragraph 20103 on
page 770, refers to the importance of resorting to the provisions of the
Act
relating to the lodgment of a caveat against a primary application. In that
paragraph the learned author states:  
<P>

Resort to the caveat provisions may be imperative for a person claiming an
interest in the land the subject of a primary application.
 If the primary
application is granted and a folio of the Register is created for the land,
interests not carried forward into the
folio will be extinguished (see<b>
</b><i>Assets Co Ltd v Mere Roihi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%20AC%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] AC 176</a> at 212).
<P>

22   	The defendant also points to the fact the plaintiff has
not seen fit to make any claim against the Registrar-General in consequence
of
the primary application having been granted and the certificate of title in
respect of the laneway issuing without any reference
to a right of way in
favour of the land of the plaintiff.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff, however, submitted that there is no
provision in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> </i>which has the effect asserted by the
defendant, in that no provision of the Act says that failure to follow the
procedures set forth
in Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p7a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7A</a> will result in the caveator being
deprived of an opportunity of asserting the existence of a prescriptive
easement.  The plaintiff
submitted that any rights which it might have in
respect to the existence of a prescriptive easement in its favour cannot be
lost
merely as a result of the plaintiff having lodged a caveat against the
primary application and that caveat having in due course lapsed
and the
plaintiff not having chosen then to follow the procedures contemplated by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74c.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 74C(1)</a>, in particular paragraph (a) of that subsection.
<P>

24   	The defendant also submitted that, in any event, even if
the plaintiff was not precluded by the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>
</i>and the failure of the plaintiff to avail itself of the machinery contained
in Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p7a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7A</a>, the plaintiff, nevertheless, has not established that
a prescriptive right to an easement over the laneway has come into existence.
For such a prescriptive easement to exist the plaintiff must establish a user
for at least 20 years and that user must have been
as a result not of a
permission or consent of the owner or registered proprietor of the land but as
a result of a right asserted
openly, not by force, and not by permission.
<P>

25   	I have been taken to the decision of the Court of Appeal
of New South Wales in<b> </b><i>Dobbie v Davidson </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 625</a>, in
particular to the judgment of Kirby P (as he then was) commencing at 627.  His
Honour there considered the nature of such a prescriptive
easement which could
then fall within the exception to the principle of indefeasibility provided in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42(1)(b)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i>.  That section provides that
the registered proprietor shall hold the estate or interest in the land: 
<P>

"... subject to such other estates and interests and such entries, if any, as
are recorded in that folio, but  absolutely free from
all other estates and
interests that are not so records except:
<P>

...
<P>

(b)  in the case of the omission or misdescription of any profit &agrave;
prendre created in or existing upon any land.
<P>

26   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that, even if
the plaintiff could establish that, in an open fashion, as of right,
it has for
at least 20 years exercised a user over the laneway, and although from the mid
1950s that right was exercised, nevertheless,
according to the defendant, in
1972 at the request of the plaintiff the defendant consented to the plaintiff
using the laneway. 
Thus the period of 20 years by right was interrupted, and
so, it was submitted by the defendant, since 1972 the user of that laneway
by
the plaintiff has been as a consequence of the consent given by the defendant.
It was submitted, therefore, that no prescriptive
easement has come into
existence and that no prescriptive easement can come into existence because of
that consent given in 1972.
<P>

27   	It is, as I have already recorded, not contested that the
plaintiff has been using the laneway for more than 20 years. But
a very
important question is whether it has been using it in consequence of an
asserted right or in consequence of a grant of permission.
<P>

28   	The alleged grant of permission, however, appears from the
minutes of various meetings of the board of directors of the defendant
which
are annexed to the affidavit of Maxwell Crothers Clark sworn 7 April 1999.
Those minutes relate to the permission being given
by the defendant to the
plaintiff to the parking of motor vehicles.  They do not expressly refer to the
use of the laneway.
<P>

29   	It may very well be that, upon a final hearing of these
proceedings, when contested questions of fact are to be evaluated
by the Court
and findings concerning those contested questions of fact are to be made, the
plaintiff will be found not to have been
able to substantiate the asserted
right which it claims to have exercised over the laneway.
<P>

30   	However, it seems to me that in the present application it
would be quite inappropriate for me to conclude that use of the
laneway since
1972 has been consequent upon that permission granted by the defendant.
<P>

31   	Also, despite the submissions made on behalf of the
defendant, I am not persuaded that the only construction which can be
given to
the provisions of Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p7a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7A</a> of the Act is to extinguish for all
purposes any right asserted by a caveator where the caveat against the primary
application lapses
and that caveator does not choose to follow the statutory
procedures and machinery then made available by that Division.
<P>

32   	It may well be that at a final hearing the defendant would
succeed in such a construction of the statute, but it is by no
means certain.
It is certainly arguable that the statute does not have that construction.
<P>

33   	It is not appropriate, therefore, that in an application
for summary dismissal of the plaintiff's claim I should deprive the
plaintiff
of an opportunity of arguing at a final hearing, firstly concerning the
statutory consequence of the lapsing of the plaintiff's
caveat and the failure
of the plaintiff thereafter to take the steps contemplated in that  regard by
the provisions of Division 2
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p7a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7A</a> of the Act, or to deprive the plaintiff
of an opportunity of establishing by evidence in appropriate form that it has
acquired a
prescriptive right to the use of the laneway.
<P>

34   	By the same token, of course, the defendant will have an
opportunity at a final hearing of contesting the evidentiary matters
asserted
in the various affidavits of people who have said they have used the laneway on
behalf of the plaintiff since the mid 1950s
and the defendant will also have an
opportunity to place before the Court in admissible form evidence which in
today's application
was, upon the objection of the plaintiff, rejected.  That
evidence included evidence relating to the control and dominion said to
be
exercised by the defendant over the laneway and also concerning the assertion
of the defendant, which is disputed by the plaintiff,
that the defendant was
responsible for the construction of a gate at the entry to the laneway and the
circumstances in which that
gate was used by persons entering the laneway and
travelling to the rear of the plaintiff's premises.
<P>

35   	In all the circumstances, therefore, I am not satisfied
that the defendant has established an entitlement to the summary relief
which
it presently claims. I propose, therefore, to dismiss the notice of motion.
<P>

36   	(Ms Dowling sought costs for the preparation of the
motion.
<P>

Mr Khan opposed the costs order sought and submitted that costs should be costs
in the cause.)
<P>

37   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the notice of motion filed by the defendant on 9 March 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff for the aforesaid
notice of motion.
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
forgoing costs.
<P>

4.	I order that the plaintiff serve any further affidavits upon which it may
wish to rely on or before 27 May 1999 and that the
defendant serve any further
affidavits within 28 days thereafter.
<P>

5.	I stand the matter over to 5 July 1999 before the Registrar.
