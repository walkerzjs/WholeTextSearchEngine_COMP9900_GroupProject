<i>Friday, 26 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3402 of 1993	MARK OLIVER DRESSLER  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			GEORGE MRISH &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before the court a notice of motion by
Donna Marie Mrish filed 12 March 1999.  She seeks an order that she as
the
adminstratrix of the first defendant's estate be substituted for the first
defendant and that she be allowed to participate in
the hearing of the
substantive proceedings, which have been specially fixed to be heard by me on 8
April 1999.
<P>

2	The plaintiff, Mark Oliver Dressler, is the son of the two persons of whose
murder George Mrish, the first defendant, was subsequently
convicted.  The
first defendant committed suicide in gaol on 29 July 1998.  The substantive
proceedings have been fixed for hearing
on the basis that that hearing will
consist of an assessment only and there will be no issue as to liability.
<P>

3	When the notice of motion was returnable before me on 12 March 1999 the
evidence in support thereof was totally inadequate.  The
matter was, on the
application of the applicant, stood over to this day, 26 March 1999, at 9.30am
before me.  It was fixed for 9.30am
to suit the convenience of the legal
representatives of the parties.  When the matter came before me to-day the
applicant was not
in a position to proceed at 9.30.  The matter was
subsequently stood down until 10 o'clock.
<P>

4	The applicant has now applied for (but only one 3 March 1999), and has not
yet been granted, administration of the intestate estate
of the first
defendant.  However, there has been annexed to the affidavit of Philip James
Beazley, the solicitor for the applicant,
sworn 26 March 1999, an inventory of
property said to constitute the estate of the first defendant.  Item 4 in that
inventory of
property headed "Money in Banks or Financial Institutions" is
described as "money held on trust by Hardings, solicitors,  being proceeds
of
sale of the property known as 73 Adam Street, Guildford" in an amount of
$140,000.  That is the only item in respect of which
any relief in the present
proceedings is sought in which the estate of the first defendant might have any
interest.  Apparently that
property at Guildford was sold by arrangement
between the plaintiff and the first defendant and the proceeds of sale are
being held
on trust by the solicitors for the plaintiff.
<P>

5	Upon the intestacy of the first defendant it would appear that the applicant,
as the widow of the first defendant, is entitled
to the sum of $150,000 plus
six thirteenths of the residue.  The deceased left at least six infant
children, possibly seven.  Each
of those children is entitled to at least one
thirteenth of the residue. 
<P>

6	It seems to me appropriate that the applicant should be allowed to be heard
in relation to the substantive proceedings in order
to represent the estate of
the deceased, but only in respect to any asset the subject of a claim by the
plaintiff in which the estate
of the deceased might have an interest.  The only
such asset is that to which I have already referred, being item 4 in the
inventory
of property.  Accordingly, any right of participation by the
applicant in the hearing of the substantive proceedings should be limited
to
the plaintiff's claim in respect to that foregoing asset.  The applicant should
not be allowed a general right to participate
in the proceedings concerning the
claim of the plaintiff in respect to assets to which neither the applicant
herself nor the estate
of the deceased makes any claim.
<P>

7	I propose, therefore, to make a limited order of the nature which I have just
outlined.  
<P>

8	I make the following order:
<P>

1. 	I order that the applicant, Donna Marie Mrish, be permitted to represent
the interests of the first defendant, now deceased,
in relation to any claim by
the plaintiff against the asset referred to in item 4 of the inventory of
property which is annexure
C to the affidavit of Philip James Beazley sworn 26
March 1999, but that the applicant not otherwise be permitted to participate
in
the proceedings.
<P>
