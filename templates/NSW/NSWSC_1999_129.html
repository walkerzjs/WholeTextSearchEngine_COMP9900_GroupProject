<P>

DECISION:

See para 11

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> This is a matter with a long history.  In 1995, a
Statement of Claim was issued on behalf of the Australian Customs Service
against
a number of defendants, including D'Aquino Bros Pty Ltd and two
directors, or officers, of that company, Rex Nunzio D'Aquino and
Zina
D'Aquino.
<P>

2	The allegation was that the company, aided and abetted by the other
defendants, had smuggled alcohol into Australia in breach
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/s233.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 233(1)(a)</a> of
the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>.
<P>

3	I have some familiarity with the matter.  I have seen the original Statement
of Claim, and the amended Statements of Claim which
followed it, and they each
are voluminous documents.
<P>

4	It is clear that, were the matter to proceed, it would take a considerable
amount of time.  Indeed, the parties contemplated taking
the evidence of a
number of witnesses in Scotland.  It was in this context that the Court ordered
on 18 November 1998 that the matter
proceed to mediation. That mediation
proceeded before Mr Trevor Morling QC over some five days in early February
this year. The length
of the mediation is itself some indication of the
complexity of the issues.  However, it was successful, and a Deed of Settlement
dated 19 February 1999 was executed by the parties.  That Deed has been shown
to me in the course of these proceedings.
<P>

5	The parties now seek to implement the terms of that Deed.  One aspect
requires Court approval.  The matter is put forward on the
basis that, should
the Court refrain from giving its approval, the parties would not seek to
implement the balance of the terms.
<P>

6	The terms which appear in the Deed have been embodied, substantially, in a
Notice of Motion which has been filed in Court today.
 Some eight orders are
sought.  Those orders, in summary form, are as follows:
<P>

	(1)	that the plaintiff's claim against the third defendant, that is Zina
D'Aquino, be dismissed with no order as to costs;
<P>

	(2)	that the plaintiff be given leave to file a Fifth Amended Statement of
Claim in the form of the document which is annexed to
the Notice of Motion
marked A;
<P>

	(3)	that the claim for debt of the Fifth Amended Statement of Claim be stood
over generally, with liberty to restore on  three
days notice;
<P>

	(4)	that the second defendant, that is Rex Nunzio D'Aquino, be convicted of an
offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/s233.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 233(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>, in respect of the aiding and
abetting of the smuggling, referred to in para 5 of the Fifth Amended Statement
of Claim;
<P>

	(5)	that the second defendant pay to the plaintiff the penalty of $232,850.08
pursuant to the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>;
<P>

	(6)	that the penalty be paid by instalments, which are set out in the Notice
of Motion and appear in the Deed;
<P>

	(7)	that if default is made in the payment of any of the amounts, the balance
shall be payable immediately;
<P>

	(8)	that there be no order as to costs as between the plaintiff and Rex Nunzio
D'Aquino.
<P>

7	Now, dealing with those terms, the debt of the company is a matter which does
not require the approval of the Court.  It has been
said in open court that it
is a substantial sum.  That sum has been revealed to me through the Deed of
Settlement.
<P>

8	In respect of terms 4 and 5 however, that is, relating to the conviction and
penalty of Rex Nunzio D'Aquino, the Court's approval
is required.  The giving
or withholding of approval is based upon the Court's assessment of the penalty,
and whether it is appropriate,
having regard to the range of penalties that may
be fixed by the Court in the circumstances.
<P>

9	I have been provided with the decision of Sperling J in a matter of
<b><i>Comptroller General Customs v Kingswood Distillers Pty Ltd</i></b> dated
5 December 1997;  and a later decision of 11 February 1999. Those decisions set
out the principles to be applied in circumstances
such as this.  Indeed, the
circumstances in that case, involving as it did a customs prosecution, are not
dissimilar to the present
case.  I have some familiarity myself with
prosecutions by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC,
under the
Trade Practices Act, and the line of authority to which Sperling J
refers.  The penalty for an offence under s 233(1)(a) is fixed
by s 233(1AA)
and s 233AB(1).  The penalty is determined by reference to the amount of duty
evaded.  The penalty should not be less
than twice the sum evaded;  nor should
it exceed five times that sum. Here the duty evaded was $116,426.04.  The
penalty which is
suggested is twice that sum, namely  $232,850.08.
<P>

10	It is a further aspect of the penalty, or the agreement arising out of the
Deed of Settlement, that Rex D'Aquino, during a period
of five years, be
prohibited from involvement in the preparation and presentation of documents of
the Australian Customs Service,
and prohibited from handling goods subject to
control by that service.  Should D'Aquino Bros be given a warehouse licence,
there
is an undertaking that Rex Nunzio D'Aquino will not enter the bond which
is the subject of that licence during the same period, that
is, five years.
<P>

11	Having considered the matter, and the authority which  has been provided, I
believe that the penalty is appropriate.  It is within
the range of penalties
which this Court may impose.  I therefore make the following orders, reading
from the Notice of Motion:
<P>

	(1)	The plaintiff's claim against the third defendant be dismissed with no
order as to costs.
<P>

	(2) 	The plaintiff be given leave to file a Fifth Amended Statement of Claim
in the form annexed to the Notice of Motion, and marked
with the letter A.
<P>

	(3)	The claim for debt of the Fifth Amended Statement of Claim be stood over
generally with liberty to restore on three days notice.
<P>

	(4)	The second defendant be convicted of an offence against s 233(1)(a) of
the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a> in respect of the aiding and abetting of the
smuggling referred to in para 5 of the Fifth Amended Statement of Claim.
<P>

	(5)	The second defendant pay to the plaintiff a penalty of $232,850.08,
pursuant to the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>.
<P>

	(6)	The penalty of $232.850.08 be paid as follows:
<P>

	     $26,250 to be paid on or before 30 June 2001.
<P>

	     $40,250 will be paid on or before 30 June 2002.
<P>

	     $40,250 will be paid on or before 30 June 2003.
<P>

	     $40,250 will be paid on or before 30 June 2004.
<P>

	     $40,250 will be paid on or before 30 June 2005.
<P>

	     $45,600.08 will be paid on or before 30 June 2006.
<P>

	(7)	If default is made in the payment of any of the amounts referred to in
order (6), then the  balance of the $232,850.08 shall
become immediately due
and payable.  It shall carry interest from, and including, the date when
default is made at the rate payable
on judgments of the Supreme Court of New
South Wales.
<P>

	 (8)	There is no order as to costs as between the plaintiff and Rex Nunzio
D'Aquino. 
<P>

12	They are the orders.  I will return the papers that were sent to my
chambers.
