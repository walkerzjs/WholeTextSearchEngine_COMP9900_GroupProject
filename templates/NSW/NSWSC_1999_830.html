<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>17 August 1999</b>
<P>

1   	This is an application by the Defendant/Applicant in a
commercial dispute in relation to a company to cross-vest the proceedings
from
this Court to the Supreme Court of South Australia.  The factors which Young J
conveniently lists after citing the relevant
authorities, doing so in
<i>Divinyls Holdings Pty Ltd v Billboard Pty Ltd</i> (Young J, 17 October 1995,
unreported) are these:
<P>

"Often in cross-vesting applications there are some particular factors that
make it clear that one Australian forum is to be preferred
rather than another.
Often there will be proceedings in two different fora and there would be
duplication of work and one finds that
one proceedings was more advanced than
the other.  There are no such matters in the instant case, nor would it appear
that there
are any real differences in the law of New South Wales and the law
of Western Australia.
<P>

The only factors that need to be balanced would appear to be these:
<P>

(a)	The number of witnesses on each side of the proceedings;
<P>

(b)	the place where the various parties live and carry on their business;
<P>

(c)	The New South Wales jurisdiction clause;  and
<P>

(d)	the matter as to whether the factual events make it more convenient to hear
the matter in Western Australia ..."
<P>

2   	Regrettably, the dispute is at a stage where it may not be
clear precisely where the relevant factual events the subject of
the litigation
predominate, as between NSW and South Australia, if indeed in either place.
While that matter could be made the subject
of further evidence, there is a
danger that the cost of drawing out the present application will be
disproportionate, a factor which
has also led me to decline an adjournment for
the purposes of having witnesses available for cross-examination.  Increasingly
Courts
are recognising the need for proportionality in keeping costs to their
appropriate level having regard to the nature of the matters
in dispute and the
amounts involved.
<P>

3   	It appears on the evidence before me that neither side has
a knockout blow when it comes to a majority of witnesses in one
state or
another, or the practical unavailability of a crucial witness were travel
required.  There was some evidence from the Respondent
that one particular
witness, Mr Grigg the former director of the relevant company would find it
inconvenient to travel to South Australia
given his employment but I do not
take that evidence as arising higher than that.
<P>

4   	There is evidence however from Mr Gatt for the Applicant
who is Chairman of the board of directors of the First Defendant to
the effect
that all of the business records of the First Defendant company are in South
Australia.  This is the place also where
it is incorporated though it has in
the past maintained a business and office in New South Wales before moving its
business (as it
appears) to South Australia, though that last is not conceded.
The critical point which Mr Gatt emphasises is that "there are tens
of
thousands of pages of business records in filing cabinets and boxes in South
Australia and the cost and risk and disruption likely
to occur if these
documents had to be transferred to New South Wales for this case would be
extreme";  see para 5 of his affidavit
of 15 July 1999.  
<P>

5   	The Respondent does not concede that the documents are of
that volume or that, as the Applicant contends, they would all be
subject to
perusal for the purposes of discovery.  On the other hand, the Respondent
produces no evidence to the contrary but simply
wants the opportunity to
cross-examine Mr Gatt on that matter.
<P>

6   	Having determined that some proportionality has to be
maintained in terms of how the present application is dealt with, I believe
the
interests of justice are sufficiently met if that matter be noted.  Should it
transpire that the contention of Mr Gatt proves
incorrect, that would be a
matter properly to be the subject of an application for costs in relation to
the cross-vesting.  Were
that to transpire, there would have been insufficient
basis for cross-vesting in South Australia, on the evidence before me.
<P>

7   	What persuades me on the present evidence that the
interests of justice dictate cross-vesting in South Australia is that factor,
reinforced by two other related matters.  These are the availability of an
early hearing date within five months in South Australia
compared to no better
than a prospect that expedition <i>might</i> be granted in New South Wales, and
cost saving as regards access to the relevant documents for discovery.
<P>

8   	Accordingly, I grant the Applicant's Notice of Motion of 17
August 1999 in terms of order 1 of the Applicant's Notice of Motion.
<P>

9   	As to costs, while these ordinarily would follow the event,
here I am dealing with an interlocutory application in circumstances
where the
relevant facts have not been tested with the rigour that might have been
appropriate were I not concerned about proportionality
in costs.  Given the
circumstances, I order that costs be reserved.
<P>
