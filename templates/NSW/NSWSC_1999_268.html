<b><u>2552/98 KEVIN WILLIAM MAUGER v MICHAEL PEARSON</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Question</b>
<P>

1	The question for determination is the entitlement to proceeds of sale of
property 27 Edward Street, Marrickville of which the
plaintiff and the
defendant were the registered proprietors as joint tenants.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2	The plaintiff and the defendant entered into homosexual relation in 1989 or
1990.  It does not matter which.  They first lived
together at 11 Bridge
Street, Erskineville, which property was owned by the defendant.
<P>

3	In 1992 they moved to Perth.  After a short time they purchased 48 Hampshire
Street, East Victoria Park, Perth.  The purchase
price was $94,000.  They
borrowed $75,000 and I find they contributed equally towards the balance.
There was some conflict about
this but I find that it was agreed the plaintiff
would contribute his share over a period; that he did have the available funds
to
do so; and that so far as this was relevant, the defendant lent him his
share in the meantime.  It does not really matter because
the defendant agreed
that they both had equal shares in the Perth property.
<P>

4	In 1994, the Perth property was sold for $134,000.  After repayment of
mortgage expenses a sum of about $60,000 was received and
put into a joint
account in the names of the plaintiff and defendant.  They returned to Sydney
and lived in the Erskineville property
for a while.  They purchased property 27
Edward Street, Marrickville for $250,000.  The property was placed in their
names as joint
tenants.  Of that purchase price $75,000 was borrowed by way of
bank loan, about $60,000 came from the joint account including the
proceeds of
the Perth property and about $130,000 came from the proceeds of sale of the
Erskineville property.  From those figures
it can be seen that the plaintiff
contributed about $67,500 and the defendant $197,500, a total of $265,000.  The
difference over
the purchase price is not explained by evidence but could in
part be accounted for by the stamp duty.  On that basis the proportional
interest of the plaintiff in the property in accordance with contributions to
the purchase price would be about 25.5%.
<P>

5	Some time prior to November 1997 the relationship came to an end.  In
November the Marrickville property was sold for $362,000
and after discharging
the mortgage and paying costs the sum of $241,080 was paid to the joint account
at the Commonwealth Bank. 
Subsequently the deposit after deduction of
commission, namely $27,300 was paid in equal shares to the plaintiff and the
defendant.
<P>

6	On 24 or 25 December 1997, the defendant withdrew $241,080 from the joint
account so that, together with his share of the deposit
meant that he received
a total of $254,730.  He subsequently repaid $10,286 for some reason which is
not explained and as a result
of these proceedings later paid back into the
bank account $222,000.  The result of this is that he has received $22,444 from
the
joint account moneys.  As against that the plaintiff withdrew the sum of
$19,000 and has retained his one half of the deposit of
$13,650 so that he has
retained the total of $32,650.
<P>

7	The plaintiff seeks a declaration that the bank account is held for the
parties in equal shares.  In the alternative he seeks
a declaration that it is
held in proportion to the contributions of each to the acquisition of the
funds.
<P>

<b>Other financial and non-financial contributions</b>
<P>

8	There was considerable evidence as to who did what so far as improvements and
contributions to the upkeep of the homes was concerned.
 In the long run this
is of little, if any, significance.  It does not go to the relief claimed by
the plaintiff.  This is because,
while it is alleged in paragraph 5 of the
statement of claim, that it would be unconscionable for the defendant to retain
more than
one half so that a constructive trust should be imposed, the relief
sought does not really go to that.  In any event while the plaintiff,
on his
evidence, made a fair contribution to the joint welfare of the parties and to
the maintenance of the various properties, the
defendant contributed as well
and it must be remembered that the defendant owned the Erskineville property.
There is no basis shown
for the imposition of a constructive trust.
<P>

<b>Claim for joint tenancy</b>
<P>

9	The plaintiff says that it was the common intention the parties would obtain
equal shares in the properties and thus in the proceeds
of sale.
<P>

10	This gives rise to a simple question.  It can relate only to the
Marrickville property as I am satisfied each contributed equally
to the Perth
property.  So far as Marrickville is concerned the homosexual relationship does
not give rise to a presumption of advancement.
 Accordingly the Marrickville
property would be held by the parties on resulting trust for themselves in
shares proportionate to
their contributions to the purchase price, unless the
evidence shows that the presumption of the resulting trust is rebutted.
<P>

11	On this question the evidence of each party given on cross-examination
really favoured the other.  Mr. Pearson admitted that
the Perth property was
held beneficially in equal shares and that was his intention.  That was,
according to him, because they were
together at the time, as he did not accept
that the contributions were equal, although I have found that they were.
Nevertheless
he said that so far as Perth was concerned he accepted this was
equal ownership and there was equal entitlement to the proceeds of
sale paid
into the joint account.  
<P>

12	So far as the Marrickville property was concerned the defendant's evidence
was quite clear that the property was purchased as
joint tenants because he and
the plaintiff had a relationship; that he wanted himself and the plaintiff to
feel they were on the
same footing financially; that he had told both the
plaintiff and the plaintiff's children that there was an equality between them
and that this was because he thought they had a future together.  His view
changed when the relationship came to an end.  On the
clear evidence of the
defendant at the time the Marrickville property was purchased he intended, so
far as contributions were unequal,
to make a gift to the plaintiff so as to
make their interests equal.  The fact that his intentions altered later cannot
bear on this.
<P>

13	The defendant's case is that he and the plaintiff made an agreement for the
disposition of the proceeds of sale under which the
whole of the proceeds of
sale of Erskineville, namely $180,000 plus an amount of $800, which is not
explained, were to be deducted
from the proceeds of sale in the joint account;
that he was to get the $180,000 and the balance of about $60,000 was to be
divided
equally between the plaintiff and the defendant.  Then some further
adjustments made for the benefits which the plaintiff had obtained
under
another loan.  
<P>

14	The plaintiff's evidence was that he arranged to meet the defendant on 30
December 1997 to negotiate the split up of the money.
 He said the defendant
was drunk and he arranged to see him shortly thereafter.  He agreed that they
had to sit down and work out
their financial and non-financial contributions
and divide the assets fairly based on those contributions.  This evidence must
be
seen alongside his evidence on affidavit, which I accept.  He and the
defendant had discussed their future after the Marrickville
property was
purchased, because he became anxious about the defendant's health and said to
him that they should see a lawyer "about
who owns what in case something
happens to me".  He said that the following conversation took place, he saying
to the defendant:
<P>

Plaintiff:
<P>

We should see a lawyer about who owns what in case something happens to you or
me.
<P>

Defendant:
<P>

We don't need to, you don't have to worry about anything you are set up now.
It's 50/50 between us.
<P>

Plaintiff:
<P>

		What about your family?
<P>

Defendant:
<P>

Don't worry its 50/50 they can't throw you out of here.  If something happened
to me you'd stay.  You know this is your home as
much as mine you're on the
title with me now.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

15	While there must be some little doubt in view of the evidence about
splitting up the moneys, I consider the plaintiff has made
out his case.  I
consider it clear that the intention of the defendant was that he and the
plaintiff should have equal shares in
the Marrickville property.  The fact that
the deposit was shared equally, apparently in accordance with instructions from
both, supports
that view.  There does not seem to be any logical reason to
support the claim of the defendant that the total sale price of the
Erskineville
property should be brought to his credit without any allowance for
the amount paid to discharge the mortgage over that property.
<P>

16	It follows from this that the balance in the joint account should be divided
equally between the plaintiff and the defendant,
subject to the plaintiff
bringing to account the sum of $19,000 withdrawn by him and the moneys
withdrawn and deposited by the defendant
being brought to account.  There is
one further adjustment that should be made.  The evidence is that in respect of
a particular
loan from the Commonwealth Bank the plaintiff used about $10,000
to purchase a motor vehicle.  There was no evidence which convinced
me that
amount had been repaid but the debt to the bank was discharged on sale of the
Marrickville property.  This amount should
be brought to account in adjusting
the entitlement to the proceeds of sale.
<P>

17	The parties can bring in draft minutes to give effect to this judgment.
<P>

I certify that paragraphs <b>1 to 17</b> are a true copy of the Reasons for
Judgment given by Mr Justice Windeyer in matter <b>2552/98 Mauger v
Pearson.</b>
