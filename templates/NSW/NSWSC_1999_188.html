<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> The plaintiffs' claims arise out of a hire purchase
transaction in a written Hire Purchase Agreement Exhibit 1 signed according to
its terms by the plaintiffs on 20 February 1997 and by a representative of the
first defendant CBFC Limited on 26 February 1997.
 The Hire Purchase Agreement
related to a used 1992 Volvo prime-mover truck modified and equipped with a
tray and other equipment
to meet the plaintiffs' requirements for their
bee-keeping business.  The burden of the plaintiffs' case is that the Hire
Purchase
Agreement Exhibit 1 is not a true record of the contractual
arrangements between them and CBFC.
<P>

2	The second defendant Mr Haydn Ireland is a finance broker who carries on
business in Wagga Wagga.  He put the plaintiffs' application
for finance to
CBFC with the object of enabling them to acquire the truck.
<P>

3	Arrangements about the modifications and equipment were made between the
plaintiffs and CMV Truck and Bus Pty Ltd the fourth cross-defendant,
in direct
dealings between the plaintiffs and representatives of CMV, principally Mr Tony
Sevidio.  Negotiations and dealings with
Mr Sevidio took place during January
1997 and led to a written offer by the plaintiffs to CMV dated 18 February 1997
in which, according
to the terms of the offer document, they offered to
purchase the truck with extra equipment for $115,000.00.
<P>

4	The transaction as recorded on paper appears to show that CMV sent CBFC an
invoice dated 10 February 1997 which recorded a sale
or proposed sale of the
truck by CMV to CBFC for $115,000.00.  The paper record, supplemented by some
events which are undisputed,
also shows that on 26 February 1997 CBFC paid CMV
$115,000.00 being the price of the truck as so invoiced, and on the same day
completed
by written acceptance the plaintiffs' offer to enter into a Hire
Purchase Agreement.  Exhibit 1 among other things records particulars
of the
transaction in which the cash price of the goods was $115,000.00, there was to
be a deposit of $23,000.00, the amount to be
financed was $92,000.00 and there
were also to be terms charges or interest of $23,443.36, so that the plaintiffs
were to pay sixteen
quarterly instalments of $7,215.21.  A space for nominating
the date of the first quarterly instalment was left uncompleted, and
on a
reasonable reading the first quarterly instalment was payable on 26 May 1997,
at the end of the first quarter.
<P>

5	Before agreeing to enter into the Hire Purchase Agreement CBFC's officers
required that the plaintiffs pay a deposit of $23,000.00
towards the purchase
of the truck and also required that the $23,000.00 be paid to CBFC, with the
obvious result that when CBFC paid
$115,000.00 for the purchase of the truck,
it was actually financing the purchase to the extent of $92,000.00.
<P>

6	The plaintiffs' case is that the true transaction was to the effect that it
was established by dealings between them and CMV that
CMV required to be paid
$92,000.00 as the purchase price of the truck before CMV began to modify the
vehicle and that CMV was to
modify the vehicle for a further $13,000.00 to be
paid by CBFC to CMV on delivery of the truck to the plaintiffs. The truck was
to
be registered when they received it from CMV, with registration charges paid
by CMV.  It was to be the obligation of CBFC to pay
to CMV a further $13,000.00
on completion of the modifications in addition to the net financing of
$92,000.00 which CBFC provided
on 26 February.
<P>

7	The plaintiffs' Statement of Claim is founded then on allegations to the
effect that it was the obligation of CBFC to ensure that
the plaintiffs were
put in possession of the truck and left in quiet possession of the truck from
the time when the modifications
were completed;  that time was late in March or
early in April 1997; that CBFC failed to ensure that the plaintiffs then
obtained
possession of the truck.  The plaintiffs claim damages for this
failure.  The plaintiffs also base claims on the undoubted fact that
on 26 May
1997 CBFC gave a direction to CMV not to deliver the truck to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs claim that the Hire Purchase
Agreement Exhibit 1 should be
rectified to bring it in accordance with their view of what the true
transaction was.
<P>

8	The plaintiffs did not give evidence of any direct communication between them
and anyone representing CBFC which would establish
their view of the true
transaction.  They claim that the substance of what they say was the true
arrangement was made, or was explained,
in a conversation between Mr Ireland
and an officer of CBFC (and they name Mr Weston) on 10 or 12 February 1997,
that they signed
a blank form of offer to enter into a Hire Purchase Agreement
in Mr Ireland's office with no particulars filled in, and that it was
filled in
or must have been filled in by someone representing CBFC in a manner which did
not record the true arrangement.
<P>

9	The evidence offered by the plaintiffs did not include any substantial basis
for a finding that anyone representing CBFC took
part in any such communication
as they described between Mr Ireland and a CBFC officer, whether Mr Weston or
anyone else.  (Plainly
it was not Mr Weston).  Mr Ireland denied firmly on oath
that there had been any such conversation or arrangement, and adhered to
his
denial under challenge.  The CBFC officers who were concerned in the management
of the transaction gave evidence, and in no case
would their evidence in any
way tend to confirm that there had been such an arrangement.  Evidence of Mr
Ireland and CBFC officers
establishes with overwhelming strength that the Hire
Purchase Agreement was not blank but did contain the particulars which it now
contains when the plaintiffs signed it and when it was forwarded to CBFC, and
the plaintiffs' evidence on this subject has been wholly
outweighed.  Their
account of what happened seemed to me to be very improbable, and witnesses in
whom I have confidence established
that it did not happen.
<P>

10	I am satisfied that the true contractual arrangement between the plaintiffs
and CBFC is that recorded in Exhibit 1.  Any supposed
obligation of CBFC to
ensure that the plaintiffs were put in possession of the truck by CMV would be
directly contrary to the clear
terms of Exhibit 1.
<P>

11	In fact and in accordance with its routine for such business CBFC did
concern itself with whether the truck was delivered to
the plaintiffs at the
time when CBFC paid $115,000.00 to CMV on 26 February 1997.  Mr Dilworth, a
CBFC officer, satisfied himself
that arrangements had been made to deliver the
truck;  on that day he telephoned Mr Ireland, and Mr Ireland told him that the
plaintiffs
were on their way to Melbourne to pick up the truck.  In making this
finding I accept Mr Dilworth's evidence notwithstanding the
evidence to the
contrary of Mr Ireland.  I do not regard Mr Ireland's evidence on this subject
as convincing.  When directly challenged
a few months later by CBFC with the
fact that he told Mr Dilworth this Mr Ireland was unable to summon up a clear
denial.  I am satisfied
that Mr Ireland was carrying out a scheme the exact
details of which are not altogether clear but which was clearly directed at
hoodwinking
CBFC about important aspects of the transaction which were relevant
to CBFC's view of how it was being handled.
<P>

12	For about 10 weeks after 26 February CBFC received no information and
nothing happened which would indicate to CBFC that the
transaction was in any
way untoward or was not proceeding as CBFC had expected, or that the plaintiffs
had not received possession
of the truck from CMV on 26 February 1997.  In fact
however a completely different course of events was actually being followed.
On having payment of $115,000.00 from CBFC on 26 February 1997, CMV set about
carrying out the modifications and completed them by
late March or early April.
In doing this CMV acted in accordance with the transaction as CMV understood it
(and not strictly in accordance
with the transaction as recorded in their
invoice to CBFC or the later order from the plaintiffs dated 18 February
1997).
<P>

13	CBFC's purchase and payment for the truck on 26 February 1997 entitled CBFC
to demand immediate possession of the truck, or to
direct that possession be
delivered to anyone it chose, including the plaintiffs.  However no information
came to CBFC which might
possibly motivate it to act in that way.  If it had
its action would have come into a direct collision with CMV's understanding of
its rights in which it was to complete work on the truck, and then deliver the
truck to the plaintiffs, but only on payment of $13,000.00
and some other
charges.  The arrangements about the other charges were not clearly
established, but my understanding is that the
charges were either a further
$10,000.00 to make a total of $115,000.00, or whatever charges were incurred at
cost up to a further
$10,000.00.
<P>

14	When CMV in fact was paid $13,000.00, which happened on 10 July 1997, it
then delivered the truck to the plaintiffs, and forewent
whatever claim it had
to a further payment for sums which it incurred for the registration of the
truck, and other sums relating
to registration.  Evidence of Mr Jackson its
manager established in firm terms that without that payment CMV was not
prepared to
deliver up the truck.  CMV was never actually put to the test of
its intentions which would have been produced if it had received
a demand from
CBFC for delivery up of the truck without payment of the $13,000.00.  Quite to
the contrary, for part of the period
of non-delivery of which the plaintiffs
complained, that is from 26 May to 10 July 1997, CMV had before it a direction
from CBFC
not to deliver the truck to the plaintiffs.  For that period there
were two causes, each entirely sufficient of itself, for the truck
not being
available to the plaintiffs;  one cause arose out of the arrangements the
plaintiffs had made with CMV, and one arose out
of their conflict with CBFC.
<P>

15	Although Mr Dilworth, the first CBFC officer to consider the plaintiffs'
application for finance, had not imposed a requirement
that the plaintiffs pay
a deposit, and was prepared to support financing the acquisition of the truck
for $115,000.00, his superior
Mr Porter imposed a requirement that the
plaintiffs pay $23,000.00 as a deposit towards the purchase of the truck, being
20% of $115,000.00;
 so that when CBFC offered finance it was for $92,000.00
and on condition that the plaintiffs were to pay the deposit of $23,000.00,
and
pay it to CBFC.  The imposition of this condition was not motivated by concern
about the value of the truck considered as a security;
 it is clear enough that
as modified it was worth $115,000.00, if not more.  However from a financier's
point of view it is material
to know and to require that the party obtaining
finance has made a contribution to the asset.
<P>

16	The plaintiffs however had earlier told Mr Ireland that they wished to
obtain finance for the full amount payable.  I am satisfied
that Mr Ireland
overcame this apparent difficulty by constructing some nefarious arrangement,
the manner and details of which have
not been fully revealed by evidence, to
the effect that the plaintiffs would give CBFC a cheque for $23,000.00 for the
deposit, but
that when CBFC paid CMV $115,000.00 for the truck, CMV would
immediately pay the plaintiffs $23,000.00;  CMV would then have received
net
$92,000.00, the figure at which they were prepared (not to deliver the truck
but) to start work on the modifications;  and they
would do so.  This would
mean that the truck would not be available for delivery when CBFC paid for it,
but it would only be available
later after the modifications were made;  and it
would also mean that the plaintiffs were not fully financed by CBFC, but had to
find another $13,000.00, and also some other amount according to whatever (and
I cannot make a clear finding) their actual arrangements,
as distinct from
their arrangements on paper, with CMV were for paying the charges relating to
registration.
<P>

17	The arrangements, whatever they exactly were, under which CMV was
immediately and by an unusually rapid bank transfer to pay
the plaintiffs 20%
of the apparent price on its being paid by CBFC to CMV, were generally
inconsistent with the arrangements recorded
in CMV's invoice to CBFC, and
overall they were so strange that it appears to me that CMV could well have
suspected that some manipulation
of the terms on which finance was available
was being carried on.  The arrangements meant that the invoice which CMV issued
to CBFC,
and passed on to CBFC through Mr Ireland, became misleading, but CMV
did nothing to point out these further circumstances to CBFC.
<P>

18	Mr Ireland also did not pass any information about the arrangements on to
CBFC, and as he was the source of all CBFC's knowledge
about the terms of
dealing, and as he was proceeding by manoeuvre to avoid the effect of CBFC's
requirement that the plaintiffs pay
a deposit of $23,000.00, his behaviour was
deceptive and reprehensible.  The false statement which he made to Mr Dilworth
on 26 February
giving Mr Dilworth to understand that the plaintiffs were about
to take possession of the truck was an especially reprehensible aspect
of his
reprehensible behaviour.  He embarked on a course of deception, mainly by
omission but in that respect by false statement;
 there was no arrangement for
the plaintiffs to go to Melbourne on 26 February to pick up the truck, Mr
Ireland had no reason to
think that there was, and he must have known that
there was not.
<P>

19	The plaintiffs' evidence about their part in the arrangement for them to pay
$23,000.00 to CBFC and immediately to receive it
back from CMV (which is what
actually happened) was not credible.  They gave explanations to the effect that
Mr Ireland told them
that the $23,000.00 which they paid to CBFC was to cover
$13,000.00 for the modifications, to pay the first 3 payments (meaning payments
for the first three months or the first quarter) under the Hire purchase
Agreement, and to pay Mr Ireland's commission.  According
to their explanation,
they thus expected that CBFC would pay CMV the $13,000.00 required on
completion of the further work, and that
they would not have to pay a quarterly
instalment in May 1997.  I am unable to see any logical thread which connects
all of their
explanations together;  I cannot see how they could think that the
purchase of the truck was fully financed, that they also had put
CBFC in funds
to pay another $13,000.00 and to pay a quarterly instalment, and to pay Mr
Ireland's commission;  yet they were to
receive $23,000.00 back.
<P>

20	The plaintiffs have not satisfied me, on the balance of probabilities, that
they made any such arrangement with Mr Ireland. 
Mr Ireland denies what they
say about this;  according to his evidence he left it with the plaintiffs to
raise the $13,000.00 or
whatever other money was necessary to obtain possession
of the truck on completion of the further work, and Mr Marshall said to the
effect that this was difficult but that he could do it.  It is not unusual for
a Court to be told differing accounts of an arrangement
which of itself was
dishonest.  Notwithstanding that Mr Ireland's credibility is adversely affected
by his behaviour in this transaction
overall, I am satisfied that the
probabilities favour his evidence about this part of the facts, and that I
should not find that
the plaintiffs were given to understand by Mr Ireland that
they could look to CBFC to pay any further money to CMV to obtain possession
of
the truck or on any account whatever.  Of course there is no basis on which it
could be found that they were so given to understand
by CBFC.
<P>

21	It follows from my view of the facts that the plaintiffs' depiction of
themselves as being aggrieved against Mr Ireland and CBFC
in respect of their
not having funds available from CBFC to pay to CMV so as to take possession of
the truck when it was available
is completely untrue, and that the complaints
which Mr Marshall levelled against CBFC when he could not obtain possession of
the
truck were quite insincere.  On the facts as they were, he must have
understood that it was for the plaintiffs and for no one else
to clear away any
claims that CMV placed between the plaintiffs and possession of the truck.  The
plaintiffs' difficulties in getting
possession of the truck were not caused by
any failure of any obligation owed to them by CBFC, or by Mr Ireland;  they
were caused
by their failure to produce money for payment to CMV which their
own arrangements with CMV required them to pay before CMV would
give them the
truck, and they were overcome when the plaintiffs actually did produce the
money for the first time on 10 July 1997.
<P>

22	Upon these findings I will give judgment for the defendants on the
plaintiffs' claim.
<P>

23	The Cross-claim against CMV is based on CMV's misleading and deceptive
conduct to which I referred earlier.  I do not find it
possible to see that
CMV's conduct in this respect has caused CBFC any loss of sufficient substance
to warrant directing an inquiry
to ascertain its money amount.  I am not
satisfied that the probabilities are that if CMV had told CBFC that in addition
to the arrangement
recorded in the sales invoice there were arrangements under
which possession was to be withheld until the modifications were completed,
that $23,000.00 of the amount advanced was to be returned to the plaintiffs and
that the plaintiffs were later to pay $13,000.00
for the work, and possibly
some other sum, the plaintiff would not have entered into the transaction.  It
seems to me to be at least
equally probable, and on the whole somewhat more
probable that CBFC would have insisted on the business being conducted in
accordance
with its condition for the plaintiffs to provide the deposit and on
some arrangement which would ensure that the works were done,
and that the
transaction would then have gone ahead with net finance of $92,000.00.  CBFC
has not satisfied me that it is probable
that it would have turned away good
business on a truck with plenty of value in it, after giving studied
consideration to the proposal;
 the probabilities are, in a line of business
which is not very fastidious, that CBFC would have insisted on its conditions
being
met, and that they would have been met.
<P>

24	An endeavour to trace the effect in terms of loss to CBFC caused by CMV's
misleading and deceptive conduct meets a very distinct
turning point on 10 July
1997.  On that day CBFC withdrew its prohibition against CMV giving the truck
to the Marshalls, and required
that the truck be delivered to the Marshalls.
CBFC then acted inconsistently with the right, conferred on it by the general
law and
also by express terms of the Hire Purchase Agreement, to rescind or
terminate the Hire Purchase Agreement on the basis of the deception
which had
been practised on it.  Its readiness to do this is part of the reasons for
which I have referred to the unfastidious nature
of their line of business.
CBFC also acted inconsistently with reliance on the plaintiffs' failure to pay
the instalment which had
fallen due on 26 May 1997.  CBFC made an arrangement
with Mr Marshall, established clearly by the evidence of Mr Weston (and denied
by Mr Marshall, whose evidence on this subject I reject) under which the
plaintiffs were to make up the default by an increased scale
of payments over
the future and the plaintiffs were to have possession of the truck.  Thereafter
the contractual relationship between
the plaintiffs and CBFC continued subject
to those modifications, and encountered a continuing series of disasters, as
the plaintiffs
did not pay the modified scale of instalments, denied the
modification, did not pay other instalments, withheld re-delivery of the
truck
and embarked on this litigation.  As I discern them, the causative effects of
CMV's breaches on these events were exhausted
by 10 July 1997, and the later
contractual difficulties, loss trouble inconvenience and legal costs which CBFC
have incurred have
been caused by the behaviour of the plaintiffs.
Endeavouring to appraise the causation of the later events by a commonsense
test
I see the effect of CMV's conduct as exhausted on 10 July 1997.  In these
circumstances I am not prepared to direct an inquiry to
ascertain the amount of
damages which CBFC may recover from CMV on its Cross-claim.
<P>

25	I see the Cross-claim against Mr Ireland differently.  Mr Ireland's
misleading and deceptive conduct, indeed his fraud, made
a much greater
contribution to the outcome;  but its causative affects too were exhausted on
10 July before CBFC had incurred any
significant loss, and I reach a similar
conclusion.
