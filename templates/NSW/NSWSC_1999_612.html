<b>5095/97 &amp; 4088/97 - GREGORY ALFRED WILDE &amp; ANOR  V MATTHEW THOMAS
ANSTEE &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: This case involves a dispute between the vendor and
purchaser of a residential waterfront property situated at 338
Victoria Place,
Drummoyne (`the Property').  As I shall explain, part of the dispute relates to
whether the Property included a strip
of reclaimed land at the mean high water
mark of the Parramatta River.  My reference to the Property is not intended to
pre-judge
that issue.
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs, Mr and Mrs Wilde, were the registered proprietors
of the Property at all material times until 2 May 1997.  The
second defendant,
Burridge Realty Pty Ltd, was the plaintiffs' agent for the sale of the
Property.  On 19 September 1996 an auction
of the Property took place at which
the first defendant, Mr Anstee, was the successful bidder.  Later that day the
plaintiffs and
the first defendant entered into a contract for the sale of the
Property for $890,000.  The contract was the 1992 edition approved
by the Law
Society of New South Wales and the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales,
with annexures and special conditions.  The
first defendant paid a deposit of
$44,500 to the second defendant.  The deposit is still held by the second
defendant in an interest-bearing
account.
<P>

3  	The contract provided for a completion date 13 weeks after the
date of the contract.  The parties agree that the effect of this
provision was
to designate 19 December 1996 as the completion date.  On 20 December 1996 the
plaintiffs' solicitor served a notice
to complete on the first defendant,
purporting to require completion by 7 January 1997 (the first notice to
complete).  By a letter
dated 6 January 1997 the first defendant's solicitor
challenged the validity of that notice on grounds which will appear later in
this judgment.  Completion did not take place on 7 January, and on 13 January
1997 the plaintiffs' solicitor served a second notice
to complete on the first
defendant, purporting to require completion by 28 January 1997 (the second
notice to complete), `without
acknowledging the correctness of the matters
raised' in the letter of 6 January 1997.  In fact two notices to complete were
issued
on 13 January 1997.  The earlier of the two notices, which provided for
completion on or before 27 January 1997, was withdrawn and
replaced with an
otherwise identical notice which required completion on 28 January 1997.  It is
the latter which I call the second
notice to complete.  Apart from their dates
and the last date for completion which they stipulated, the first and second
notices
to complete were in identical form.
<P>

4  	Completion did not take place by 28 January 1997, and the
plaintiffs' solicitor served a notice of rescission on the first defendant,
purporting to terminate the contract.  As I shall explain, there is a dispute
about the date of service of the notice of rescission,
which bears the date 28
January 1997.  The plaintiffs entered into a contract for the sale of the
Property to someone else on 21
March 1997, and that sale was completed on 2 May
1997.  
<P>

<b>The Proceedings</b>
<P>

5  	The plaintiffs commenced proceedings against the first and second
defendants in the District Court on 14 May 1997 (No.2518/97).
 In their
statement of claim the plaintiffs sought to recover the deposit from the second
defendant and damages from the first defendant
for breach of contract.  The
first defendant filed notice of grounds of defence on 17 September 1997.  He
then filed a summons in
this Court (matter No.4088/97) on 19 September 1997
seeking, inter alia, an order that the second defendant pay the deposit to him.
He also sought orders that the plaintiffs' District Court proceedings be
transferred to the Supreme Court and that they be heard
and determined together
with the proceedings initiated by him.  
<P>

6  	On 24 June 1997 the Registrar made consent orders transferring
the District Court proceedings to this Court (becoming matter
No.5095/97) and
providing that they be heard together with the proceedings initiated by the
first defendant.  On 4 September 1998
the Master ordered that proceedings
No.4088/97 and 5095/97 be consolidated, and that the summons in No.4088/97
stand as a cross-claim
within proceedings No.5095/97.
<P>

7  	Thus in the consolidated proceedings the plaintiffs seek to
forfeit the deposit and recover damages from the first defendant
for breach of
contract, and the first defendant seeks the return of the deposit.  The second
defendant will abide by the order of
the Court.  The hearing before me was
confined to the questions of entitlement to the deposit and liability to pay
damages.  Since
I have concluded, for the reasons set out in this judgment,
that the plaintiffs are entitled to forfeit the deposit and to recover
damages
for breach of contract from the first defendant, it will be necessary for me to
order an inquiry as to damages.
<P>

<b>The legal issues</b>
<P>

8  	Essentially the case turns on various challenges by the first
defendant to the legal efficacy of the two notices to complete
and the notice
of rescission.  First, there is a challenge arising out of special condition 6
of the contract, which relates to a
Waterways lease and the waterfront boundary
of the Property.  Second, there is a challenge based on the fact that land tax
for 1997
was neither assessed nor paid until well after the expiry of the
second notice to complete.  Third, there is a challenge to the content
of the
notices to complete, and finally, there is a challenge to the content and
timing of the notice of rescission.  I shall deal
in turn with those legal
issues, and the further findings of fact which are necessary in order to
dispose of them.
<P>

9  	According to Professor Butt (P Butt, <i>The Standard Contract for
Sale of Land in New South Wales</i>, 2nd Ed, 1998, p 638) the requirements for
a valid notice to complete are as follows:
<P>

`(1)	The recipient of the notice must be in default such as to justify the
giving of the notice;
<P>

(2)	the giver of the notice must be free of relevant default when giving the
notice;
<P>

(3)	the giver of the notice must be able ready and willing to proceed to
completion;
<P>

(4)	the time fixed by the notice must be reasonable in all the circumstances;
and
<P>

(5)	the notice must be in order as to form and content.'
<P>

10  	In this case the plaintiffs say that Professor Butt's condition
No.(1) was met as regards both notices to complete.  They say
that the first
defendant was in default at the time of the first notice, such as to justify
the giving of the notice, because the
first defendant did not complete as
required by the contract on 19 December 1996.  The first defendant says there
was no such default
because, as a matter of construction of the contract, the
obligation to complete did not arise (if at all) until 10 January 1997,
21 days
after he was notified of registration of a deposited plan which gave the
plaintiffs registered title to a small strip of
land above the mean high water
mark in conformity with the plaintiffs' obligations under special condition 6;
and even if this were
not so, he was entitled to reasonable notice of
registration of the plan before a notice to complete could effectively be
issued.
 Since these matters were fully argued I shall deal with them.
However, the contentions by the first defendant challenge the efficacy
of only
the first notice to complete.  In my opinion it is clear that by failing to
complete on 7 January 1997, the first defendant
came to be in default if that
was not already the case, and this default justified the giving of the second
notice.
<P>

11  	The first defendant also says that Professor Butt's conditions
Nos.(2) and (3) were not satisfied by the plaintiffs at any
stage, because the
Property was charged with the payment of land tax on 1 January 1997 and that
tax was not assessed and paid until
well after the expiry of the second notice
to complete.  
<P>

12  	The first defendant also attacks both notices to complete for
failure to comply with Professor Butt's condition No.(5), on
the ground that
they are deficient as to content, because the notices seek to preserve the
alternative remedies of termination and
specific performance.  
<P>

13  	The first defendant's attack on the notice of rescission is
essentially that it was given one day too early and fails to specify
the
alleged breach with sufficient particularity.
<P>

<b>Special condition 6</b>
<P>

14  	The first page of the contract specifies the address of the
property and in a box labelled `Improvements' the word `house'
has been typed.
Then there is a box labelled `Plan', in which the following appears:
<P>

Registered Plan:	Lot 1	Section	Plan 964578 (copy attached)
<P>

		
<P>

Unregistered plan:	Lot	in an unregistered plan (copy attached) (clause A6)
<P>

    which is part of 	Lot	Section	Plan               (copy attached)
<P>

           (the plan registration time is 6 months after the date of this
contract)
<P>

All of the above text is printed as part of the standard form of contract,
except the lot and plan numbers and the number `6' on
the last line, which have
been inserted in typescript.  It is noteworthy that the printed form concerning
an unregistered plan is
not filled in, except for the number `6' on the bottom
line.
<P>

15  	Annexed to the contract was a copy of Plan No.964578 and also a
survey certificate dated 24 May 1985.  The certificate is useful
because it
expresses the measurements of lot 1 in  Plan No.964578 in metres, whereas the
plan itself is in feet and inches.  The
certificate shows that the eastern
boundary was 38.3 metres in length and the western boundary was 40.32 metres in
length.
<P>

16  	Special condition 6 is in the following terms:
<P>

`Annexed hereto is a copy of the existing lease between the Maritime Services
Board and the vendors and letter from Waterways dated
10 September 1996.  The
vendors agree to take all steps and do all things necessary for the purchaser
to obtain a new lease of the
area referred to in the Waterways letter.  The
vendors agree that prior to completion they shall ensure that the boundary of
their
property hereby sold shall be adjacent to and contiguous with the
property referred to in the lease.'
<P>

17  	Special condition 6 contains two obligations.  The first is to
take all steps and do all things necessary for the purchaser
to obtain a new
lease of the area referred to in the Waterways letter of 10 September 1996.
The Waterways letter states that subject
to three conditions the Waterways
Authority would be prepared to grant a fresh lease to any purchaser in respect
of areas designated
in an attached plan.  The three conditions are satisfactory
termination of the existing lease, proof of ownership of the adjoining
freehold
(that is confirmation of title details following completion of the sale), and
payment of the annual rental which is specified.
 The evidence shows that the
plaintiffs have done everything within their power to comply with their
obligation to procure a new
Waterways lease, having regard to the conditions
set out in the Waterways letter.  Of the three conditions specified by the
Waterways
Authority, the second could not be satisfied until completion and at
that time would be satisfied by the first defendant as purchaser
rather than by
the vendors;  and the third condition relating to payment of rent was a matter
for the purchaser alone.  As to the
first condition, satisfactory termination
of the existing lease, the plaintiffs did everything they could do to comply.
By their
letter of 9 December 1996 the plaintiffs' solicitor submitted to the
first defendant's solicitor a copy of a signed deed of surrender
of the
existing lease.  Though the letter does not expressly say so, it bears the
clear implication that the original deed of surrender
would be available upon
completion.
<P>

18  	The second obligation in special condition 6 is for the
plaintiffs to ensure that prior to completion the boundary of their
property is
adjacent to and contiguous with the property referred to in the lease.  In my
opinion the words `adjacent to and contiguous
with' in special condition 6
convey the meaning that at completion the northern boundary of the property
sold to the purchaser was
required to touch the southern boundary of the area
to be leased by the Waterways Authority and referred to in the annexure to its
letter of 10 September 1996.  
<P>

19  	It appears that there was an area of reclaimed land between the
northern boundary of lot 1 in Plan No.964578 and the mean high
water mark of
the Parramatta River.  A plan was registered on about 18 December 1996
(Deposited Plan No.864896), effectively in substitution
for the earlier plan,
having the effect of re-defining the northern boundary of the Property.  In the
new plan the length of the
eastern boundary is 45.285 metres and the western
boundary is 47.77 metres.  Whereas the survey certificate shows that the
northern
boundary of the Property was to the south of the boatshed, the new
plan shows the northern boundary passing through the boatshed,
which has
therefore become fully accessible from the (enhanced) Property.
<P>

20  	The plan annexed to the Waterways letter shows the location of a
boatshed, jetty, pontoon and ramps, and identifies an area
of reclaimed land
adjacent to the boatshed.  The first defendant submits that there was no direct
evidence that the new boundary
of the Property was adjacent to and contiguous
with the property referred to in the lease.  In my opinion, however, it is
reasonably
clear from a comparison of the plan annexed to the Waterways letter
of 10 September 1996 with Deposited Plan No.864896 that the new
boundary was
adjacent to and contiguous with the property the subject of the proposed new
Waterways lease, and I think it appropriate
to infer from all the evidence that
the property which Waterways proposed to lease was identical with the property
which it had leased
to the plaintiffs.  Further, the evidence shows that the
first defendant's solicitor was provided with a copy of the proposed plan
by
letter of 9 December 1996, and there is no evidence that the first defendant at
any stage complained that registration of the
plan would not discharge the
plaintiffs' obligation under the last sentence of clause 6.  I conclude that
the plaintiffs discharged
that obligation when the plan was registered on about
18 December 1996.
<P>

21  	My conclusions therefore are that the plaintiffs complied with
the first limb of their obligations under special condition
6 when they
provided a copy of the deed of surrender of the existing Waterways lease to the
first defendant's solicitor on 9 December
1996, impliedly agreeing to hand over
the original of that document on completion.  They complied with the second
limb of their obligations
under special condition 6 on about 18 December 1996
when they procured the registration of the new Deposited Plan.  
<P>

<b>Clause A6</b>
<P>

22  	The first defendant submits that, even if the Court concludes
that the plaintiffs complied with special condition 6 by 18 December
1996, they
were in no position to demand completion on 19 December 1996 nor to issue the
first notice to complete on 20 December
1996.  The first defendant's submission
is based on two grounds.
<P>

23  	The first ground flows from clause 20.12 of the contract, which
says:
<P>

`Normally, clauses A1-A6 referred to in this contract apply in the form last
published by the Law Society of NSW and the Real Estate
Institute of NSW, even
if not attached.'
<P>

24  	The application of clause A6 to the standard form of contract is
confirmed by the description of the property on the first
page, which (as noted
above) cross-refers to clause A6.  
<P>

25  	Clause A6 is in the following terms:
<P>

`A6 Unregistered plan
<P>

If any of the property is described as a lot in an unregistered plan - 
<P>

A6.1 the vendor must do everything reasonably necessary to have the plan
registered within the plan registration time, with or without
any minor
alteration to the plan or any document to be lodged with the plan validly
required or made by a statutory authority or
the Registrar General; 
<P>

A6.2 normally, either party can rescind if the plan is not so registered;
<P>

A6.3 the purchaser must serve the form of transfer within 14 days after either
party serves notice of the registration of the plan
and every relevant lot and
plan number;
<P>

A6.4 the completion date becomes the later of that date and the date which is
21 days after that service;
<P>

A6.5 clauses A6.1 and A6.2 apply to any prior plan which is to be registered
before the plan is registered;  and
<P>

A6.6 the purchaser cannot make any claim, objection or requisition or rescind
or terminate in respect of a boundary adjustment plan
making only one or more
minor adjustments.'
<P>

26  	The first defendant submits that clause A6 applied to the
present case because the contract contemplated the registration of
an
unregistered plan which would incorporate the area of reclaimed land into the
plaintiffs' title. The first defendant says that
the additional land area is
part of the property which was the subject of the contract.  He relies on
<i>Dabbs v Seaman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1925/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1925] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281925%29%2036%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1925) 36 CLR 538.</a>  In that case the title documents to
land referred to a `20 foot lane' adjacent to the land, and the majority in the
High Court of
Australia held that the purchaser of the land was entitled to use
that 20 foot strip as a lane, notwithstanding the absence of any
formal
easement over it.  The plaintiffs submit that the Property did not include the
additional area.  They contend that since particulars
of the `unregistered
plan' were not filled in, the `property' identified on page 1 of the contract
and referred to in the printed
conditions was only lot 1 in Plan No.964578.
The insertion of the number `6' in the bottom line of the description of
property, was,
they say, simply a mistake.
<P>

27  	In my opinion the additional land area was not part of the
Property which was the subject of the contract.  Instead, the plaintiffs
as
vendors contracted to sell lot 1 in the old Plan No.964578 and made a separate
promise in special condition 6 to ensure that the
boundary of their property
would be adjacent to and contiguous with the property referred to in the
Waterways lease.  This is not
a case where any of the property sold by the
contract is a lot in an unregistered plan.  Rather it is a case where the
vendors promise
to alter the boundary to their existing property by the
registration of a new plan.  Even if the situation could be described as
a sale
of a lot in an unregistered plan, it could not be said that any of the property
sold is <b>described</b> as a lot in unregistered plan, since the particulars
on page 1 of the contract adjacent to the words `unregistered plan' have not
been completed.  If find, therefore, that clause A6 does not apply to designate
a completion date later than 19 December 1996.  
<P>

<b>Reasonable time for completion after registration of the plan</b>
<P>

28  	The first defendant also submits that, quite apart from clause
A6, the plaintiffs were not entitled to demand completion on
19 December 1996
and serve a notice to complete on the following day, when they did not notify
the first defendant that the new plan
was registered until 18 December 1996
(or, arguably, 19 December 1996, having regard to  clause 20.6 of the
contract).  One way of
putting the point is to say that there was an implied
term in the contract that the plaintiff would not require completion until
a
reasonable time had elapsed after they notified the defendant of registration
of the plan.  Another way of putting the point is
that for the purposes of
specific performance and other discretionary remedies, equity will not regard a
notice to complete as effective
unless a reasonable time has elapsed after the
vendors have made good their title.
<P>

29  	In addition to special condition 6, special condition 2 and
printed clause 15 are relevant:
<P>

`2. If this Agreement is not completed by the completion date either party
shall be entitled to issue a Notice to Complete fixing
a time for completion
which time shall be the essence of this Agreement and such notice shall be
deemed to be sufficient as to time
if a period of not less than fourteen (14)
days from the date of the notice is allowed for completion.'
<P>

`15. Completion date
<P>

15.1 The parties must complete by the completion date (being a fixed but
inessential date).
<P>

15.2 If the parties do not complete by the completion date, a party can serve a
notice to complete if that party is otherwise is
entitled to do so.'
<P>

<i>Louinder v Leis </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 509</a> is authority for the proposition that
a mere failure to comply with a non-essential stipulation as to time of
completion justifies
the giving of a notice having the effect of making time
the essence of performance of that stipulation, even though the failure to
comply does not involve an unreasonable delay.  In other words, all other
things being equal it would not be necessary for the plaintiffs
to wait for any
further period after 19 December 1996 before giving a notice to complete.
<P>

30  	However, as Mason J pointed out in that judgment (at 523),
before a notice to complete can be validly given, in a case where
the contract
stipulates a completion date, not only must the intended recipient of the
notice be in breach by failing to complete
on the stipulated date, or guilty of
unreasonable delay, but also the party giving the notice must be free of
default by way of breach
or antecedent relevant delay (see also <i>Neeta
(Epping) Pty Ltd v Phillips </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20131%20CLR%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 131 CLR 286</a>, 299).  These requirements
were considered by McLelland J in <i>Jillinda Pty Ltd v McCourt</i> (1983) NSW
ConvR para 55-145.  In that case a contract for the sale of a strata title home
unit provided for completion to take place
on 19 February 1983.  A special
condition of the contract required the vendor to furnish a certificate from the
body corporate pursuant
to s 70(1)(c) of the Strata Titles Act not less than
seven days before completion.  The certificate was not furnished until 18
February
1983.  Settlement did not take place on 19 February, and on 22
February the vendor gave a notice to complete to the purchaser requiring
completion within 14 days.  McLelland J held that on the true construction of
the contract of sale the purchasers' obligation to
complete on 19 February was
conditional on the vendor having furnished the certificate not less than 7 days
before that date.  Since
the certificate was not furnished until much later, it
could not be said that the purchaser was in default by virtue of not completing
on 19 February.  As to the vendor's position, his Honour held that the vendor
was in default until 18 February because it had not
furnished the certificate
until that date, and its delay in performance of the obligation to furnish the
certificate remained relevant
to the relative situation of the parties in
respect of completion at the time when the notice was given on 22 February.  He
concluded
that the notice to complete was invalid both because there was no
relevant default by the purchaser and because the vendor's previous
delay
remained relevant to prevent it from issuing a notice at that stage.
<P>

31  	While the facts of the present case are close to the facts in
<i>Jillinda</i>, in my opinion that case is distinguishable.  In the present
case the contract merely required the vendor to ensure that the boundary
of the
property was adjacent to and contiguous with the boundary of the waterfront
lease area `prior to completion'.  The contract
did not require this to occur
at any specified time prior to completion.  Nor, in my opinion, could it be
said that special condition
6 contained an implied term that contiguous title
be obtained at a reasonable time before the date fixed for completion.  The
effect
of the contract, plainly enough, was that completion was to take place
on 19 December 1996 and that prior to that time, but at no
particular earlier
point of time, the plan must be registered.  Registration of the plan on 18
December 1996 constituted compliance
by the plaintiffs with their obligation
under special condition 6, and the failure by the first defendant to complete
on 19 December
1996 constituted a relevant default for the purposes of the
principle in <i>Louinder v Leis</i>.  Consequently the plaintiffs were entitled
to give the notice which they gave on 20 December 1996.

32  	<i>Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20537" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR
537</a> suggests that a special condition such as special condition 6 obliges the
vendor to comply with its terms within a reasonable time.
 Here it cannot be
contended that the plaintiffs were guilty of any unreasonable delay in
registering the plan by 18 December 1996.
<P>

33  	The position would have been different if, as in <i>Castle Hill
Tyres Pty Ltd v Luxspice Pty Ltd </i>(1996) NSW ConvR para 55-771, special
condition 6 had not been complied with until after the date fixed by the
contract for completion.
 In the <i>Castle Hill</i> <i>Tyres </i>case, where a
non-essential completion date was fixed in a contract clause 15 of which was
identical with the present contract, and
the special condition required that a
lease and surrender of lease be registered prior to completion, registration
did not take place
until about four weeks after the completion date.  But when
registration occurred, the vendor immediately issued a notice to complete.
Young J held that the notice to complete was invalid because at the time when
it was issued, the purchaser was not in default under
the contract.  Since the
vendor had not complied with the special condition at the contractual
completion date, the purchaser could
not have been in breach by failing to
complete at that time, and was entitled to reasonable notice of registration
before completion
could be insisted upon, `to enable the purchaser to arrange
for the financial institution which was assisting it to get paperwork
together
to allow for completion, a time that usually requires some seven to 14 days'
(at 55,919).
<P>

34  	The first defendant argued, by analogy with the <i>Castle Hill
Tyres </i>case, that he was entitled to reasonable notice to enable him to get
the paperwork together for completion after registration of the
deposited plan.
I disagree.  In the present case the relevant entitlements of the parties are
governed by the express terms of the
contract.  Under those express terms, the
first defendant agreed to complete on 19 December if at any time prior to that
day, the
vendor complied (inter alia) with special condition 6.  By entering
into a contract in those terms, the first defendant agreed, in
effect, that he
would not need any additional time to `get the paperwork together' if special
condition 6 was complied with at the
last minute.  Given the speed of searching
the computerised land titles register, that is not an unreasonable or
surprising agreement
to make.
<P>

35  	I conclude, therefore, that the first notice to complete is not
open to challenge on the ground that it was issued too soon
after the
registration of the deposited plan.

which is exempted.  According to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8</a>, land
tax is charged on land as owned at midnight on 31 December immediately

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47(2)</a> authorises the Chief Commissioner to release land which is subject to
land tax on payment of an amount which the Chief Commissioner
estimates to be
not less than the proportion of tax referrable to the land.  The effect of
these provisions is to authorise a procedure
for release of specified land from
the charge before the owner's land tax is paid or even assessed, upon the
payment of an amount
estimated by the Chief Commissioner, and for the issue of
a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> certificate to confirm that the release has occurred.
<P>

38  	Under the contract of sale in the present case the vendor was
liable for any land tax up to and including the date of settlement
(clause
14.1), and no provision was made in the contract for adjustment of land tax
liability between the vendor and purchaser. 
The vendor was obliged to clear
any land tax certificate served by the purchaser before completion if the
certificate disclosed a
land tax charge on the property (clause 16.2.2).  
<P>

39  	The plaintiffs and the first defendant exchanged requisitions on
title and answers in the normal way.  The requisitions by
the first defendant's
solicitors, Brock Partners, required that land tax in respect of the property
should be paid prior to settlement,
and asked whether the property was liable
to land tax.  The plaintiffs' solicitors, Helliars City, replied saying that
the property
was not subject to land tax.  It appears that that was true at the
date of the reply, namely 9 December 1996, but when settlement
had not occurred
by midnight on 31 December 1996 the property became subject to a land tax
charge in the plaintiffs' hands for the
first time.  On 6 January 1997 Brock
Partners served on Helliars City a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> certificate showing that the land was
subject to a charge for land tax for the 1997 year, in an amount which could
not at that time
be stated.  Brock Partners said that the purchasers would
require land tax to be cleared prior to completion.
<P>

40  	Then Helliars City made arrangements with the Office of State
Revenue for settlement to take place at that office and for the
first
defendant's <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> certificate to be endorsed with a land tax clearance upon
payment of an agreed amount to the Office of State Revenue by bank cheque.
Those arrangements were first notified by Helliars City to Brock Partners on 7
January 1997, the date nominated in the first notice
to complete as the
completion date.  They were reiterated in later correspondence when subsequent
attempts at settlement were made.
 Some variations to the estimate of the
amount to be paid for release of the land from the land tax charge were, in my
view, immaterial
on the facts.
<P>

41  	I infer from this evidence that Helliars City on behalf of the
plaintiffs did everything that could be done in the circumstances
to address
the land tax problem which had arisen on 31 December 1996.  The evidence
indicates that it was not practicable for them
or their clients to obtain an
assessment to land tax and pay the tax at any time during January 1997.  In
fact the land tax was assessed
later in the year, being paid only in May 1997.
The question is whether arrangements of the kind made by Helliars City in
January
1997 imply that their clients, the plaintiffs, were ready, willing and
able to proceed to completion of the transaction on the day
specified in the
first notice to complete, namely 7 January 1997 and if that is not the case,
whether that condition was satisfied
in respect of the second notice to
complete, which required completion by 28 January 1997.
<P>

42  	The third of Professor Butt's requirements for a valid notice to
complete, referred to above, is that the giver of the notice
must be able,
ready and willing to proceed to completion.  The requirement was stated in that
way by Danckwerts J in <i>Re Barr's Contract</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20Ch%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] Ch 551</a>, 556.  In
<i>McNally v Waitzer </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 294</a>, both Reynolds JA (at 296) and
Hutley JA (at 303) acknowledged the link between this requirement and
traditional equity pleading
in a suit for specific performance.  The allegation
of readiness should in their opinion be given the same meaning with respect to
notices to complete as it bears in the law of specific performance.  After all,
a notice to complete is in a sense the obverse of
a decree of specific
performance, since the notice makes time of the essence and takes away the
recipient's right to specific performance.
 Not surprisingly, therefore, the
Court of Appeal of New South Wales unanimously held in <i>McNally v Waitzer
</i>that it is unnecessary for the party giving the notice to do things prior
to giving the notice which are suitable to be done upon
rather than prior to
completion.  
<P>

43  	In <i>McNally v Waitzer </i>a land tax assessment was issued two
weeks before the vendor served a notice to complete on the purchaser, and the
vendor paid the
land tax two days before the date which the notice fixed for
completion.  The Court held that it was no objection to the validity
of the
notice that at the time when it was issued, the property was subject to a
charge for the assessed but unpaid land tax, since
it was open to the vendor to
remove the charge by paying the tax at or prior to completion.  Hutley JA said
(at 303-4):
<P>

`What the vendor has to do when he is selling land subject to land tax is, at
most, to have removed the charge for land tax created
by the Act.  I am able to
see that, in principle, land tax is in any different position from an ordinary
mortgage;  assuming the
purchaser is not going to take over the responsibility
of the mortgage, it has to be discharged at latest on completion and in many
cases it will be discharged out of the purchase price.  The same principle, in
my opinion, applies to land tax.  The vendor has to
get rid of the charge for
land tax, but only at the latest on completion and there is no objection to him
giving a valid and effective
notice to complete if at the time he gives it the
property is still subject to land tax. ...The correct rule, in my opinion, is
simply
that a vendor who is in default in respect of things which up until then
should have been done cannot give a notice to complete,
but he can give notice
to complete prior to performing all those other things which he has to perform
in order to complete the contract.
 The vendor does not have to satisfy the
purchaser prior to completion that the land is not subject to a charge for land
tax.  He
has, at the most on completion, to provide satisfactory evidence to
the purchaser that either the land is not subject to land tax,
or, if it is,
that liability has been discharged in the course of completion itself.'
<P>

44  	In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal disagreed with
a dictum of Street CJ in Eq in <i>Halkidis v Bugeia </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20NSWLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 NSWLR 423</a>,
427, in which his Honour said that a `vendor, in order to be able to rescind in
reliance upon non-compliance with a notice specifying
a period for completion,
must be able to establish in court that he was himself not only ready and
willing, but also able, to complete
in accordance with the requirements under
the contract throughout that period, that is to say <i>at the time he gives the
notice through until the time at which it expires'.  </i>[Emphasis
supplied.]
<P>

45  	Those observations were applied by McLelland J in <i>Maxsujur
Pty Ltd v Asimus</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%2096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 96.</a>  In that case the vendor served a
notice to complete on 22 May 1979 calling for completion by 12 June 1979.  The
land was subject
to a charge for land tax for the year 1979, but the assessment
of tax did not issue to the vendor until 8 June, and the vendor paid
the land
tax on 13 June, the day after the date fixed by the notice for completion.
McLelland J held that the notice was ineffective
because the vendor was not
able to remove the charge for land tax at the time when the notice was given.
He said (at 99):
<P>

`It seems to me to be inconsistent with the equitable principles which have
given rise to the procedure of giving a notice making
time of the essence that
a party who is himself not then able to proceed to completion can effectively
require the other party to
complete within a stipulated time or lose the
benefit of the contract, bearing in mind the concurrent and interdependent
character
of the respective obligations of the parties to complete.'
<P>

46  	The Court of Appeal in <i>McNally v Waitzer </i>disapproved of
Street CJ in Eq's dictum in <i>Halkidis</i> and overruled the decision in
<i>Maxsujur.</i>  Then in <i>Jillinda</i> <i>Pty Ltd v McCourt </i>(cited
above) McLelland J made some observations about <i>McNally v Waitzer, </i>by
way of obiter dicta.  He suggested that `in some appropriate future case it may
be desirable for some of the dicta in the judgments
in that case to be
re-examined' (at 57,062).  He proceeded to give the following reasons for his
suggestion:
<P>

`Completion of a contract for sale involves the performance of concurrent
obligations of vendor and purchaser.  Therefore one party
cannot be said to
have defaulted in the performance of his obligation to complete at the
contractual time for completion (whether
stipulated or not) unless the other
party was ready to proceed to performance of his concurrent obligations at that
time (unless
such readiness has been waived...).  Accordingly where the only
default alleged against the recipient of the notice to complete is
his failure
to complete at the contractual time for completion, the readiness of the giver
of the notice at that time to complete
may be a critical matter.  Furthermore,
although readiness to proceed to completion does not connote readiness
instantly to hand
over everything required on completion..., the analogy
between discharging a mortgage and removing a charge for land tax referred
to
by Reynolds JA and by Hutley JA in <i>McNally v Waitzer</i> may break down in
this context in a case where land tax had not yet been assessed, since unless
and until the assessment issues,
the charge is incapable of being removed,
failing protection to the purchaser by action under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/" class="autolink_findacts">Land Tax
Management Act</a>, whereas there is no equivalent bar to the discharge of the
mortgage.'
<P>

47  	In <i>McNally v Waitzer</i> the land tax assessment had been
issued before the notice to complete was served, and therefore at the time of
service of the notice,
the vendors were in a position to remove the land tax
charge simply by payment of the assessed amount.  The analogy with the
discharge
of a mortgage was in those circumstances a close one.  In <i>Maxsujur
</i>the land was subject to a land tax charge when the notice to complete was
served but the tax was not assessed until after the service
of the notice,
though before the date fixed by the notice for completion.  By overruling
<i>Maxsujur, </i>the Court of Appeal in <i>McNally v Waitzer </i>took the view
that in such a case the vendor is ready willing and able to proceed to
completion although the amount of land tax charged
on the land was unknown at
the time when the notice was served.  Because in both cases an assessment of
the actual amount of land
tax payable in respect of the land had been made
prior to the date fixed for completion, payment of that amount upon completion
would
remove the land from the charge absolutely.  
<P>

48  	If one looks solely at the second notice to complete in the
present case, the land was subject to a land tax charge at the
time of service
of the notice and at the date fixed for completion, but land tax was not
assessed at any relevant time.  Those facts
are distinguishable from the facts
of <i>McNally v Waitzer</i> and the <i>Maxsujur </i>case, but they are the very
facts envisaged by McLelland J in his dicta in <i>Jillinda.</i>  If one looks
solely at the first notice to complete, the position is that there was no land
tax charge when the notice was served,
but since the notice fixed a date for
completion after 31 December 1996 in circumstances where the tax exemption for
a principal
residence occupied by the owner would not be available, a land tax
charge was bound to arise prior to the date fixed for completion,
and the
amount of land tax would, again, not be assessed at any relevant time.  In
effect, the situation produced by the first notice
to complete also falls
within McLelland J's observations in <i>Jillinda.</i>  
<P>

49  	It therefore falls to me to reconcile, as best I can, the
decision of the Court of Appeal which overruled a decision of McLelland
J, with
later remarks by McLelland J which suggest that the Court of Appeal's reasoning
may break down in the very circumstances
which are before me.  The decision
which I am to make could have important ramifications for conveyancing
practice, in cases where
a vendor of land subject to land tax wishes to give a
notice to complete which straddles midnight on 31 December in a year, or which
requires completion too early in the year for a land tax assessment to be
issued prior to that time.
<P>

50  	It appears to me that the correct resolution of the matter
depends on a precise analysis of the vendor's obligation, reinforced
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW), to give good title on completion.  In
<i>Dainford Ltd v Yulora Pty Ltd</i> (1984) NSW ConvR para 55-184 Rath J held
that where land was subject to a land tax charge but the amount of tax had not
been assessed,
the purchaser was not required to accept on completion the
vendor's undertaking to pay the land tax when it was assessed.  On appeal
([1984]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20NSWLR%20546" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 NSWLR 546</a>, 550) the vendor accepted that since the liability was
secured on the land, it was obliged to have the land tax charge removed as
at
settlement by payment of the assessed tax and not having done so, it was not in
a position to settle.  It appears to me that what
was assumed by the parties in
the Court of Appeal is importantly different from what was held by Rath J, and
goes too far.  Short
of removal of a land tax charge by assessment and payment,
protection from the charge in respect of specific land may be obtained
by
release of the land and the issue of a certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47.</a>  The certificate
is conclusive evidence of the matter certified against the Chief Commissioner
and in favour of any person, whether
or not the person relying on the
certificate is the person to whom the certificate was issued:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47(1C).</a>  There
are only two exceptions to this protective provision.  The certificate is not
conclusive evidence in favour of a person who:
<P>

(a)	had notice, when the certificate was issued, of land tax charged on the
land that the certificate failed to disclose, or
<P>

(b)	was an owner of the land (other than a genuine purchaser for value who had
not obtained possession of the land) when the certificate
was issued.
<P>

51  	Given the protection which the procedure of release of specific
land followed by the issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> certificate offers, I do not believe it is
accurate to say that a vendor of land must in all cases remove the land tax
charge prior
to completion by paying land tax assessed in respect of the
owner's total land holdings.  In my opinion the vendor's obligation to
give
good title on completion is discharged if on completion, the purchaser and
persons acquiring interests under the purchaser have
the protection conferred
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47(1C)</a> by virtue of the issue at or prior to completion of a certificate
that no land tax is charged on the land, procured by release of
the land on
payment of an amount estimated by the Office of State Revenue.  The fact that
at an earlier time, the purchaser may have
obtained a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a> certificate which
stated that the property was subject to land tax in an unassessed amount does
not mean that after receiving that
certificate the purchaser has notice of land
tax that a subsequent clear certificate fails to disclose.  But any doubt on
that score
could be removed by endorsing the clear certification on the
purchaser's previous certificate.
<P>

52  	Once one accepts that the vendor's obligation is discharged by
giving the purchaser and others the protection of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 47</a>, it seems that the only
remaining question is whether the law requires that the vendor must put in
place arrangements with the Office
of State Revenue for the issue of a clear
certificate on completion (no doubt in most cases, upon payment to the Office
of State
Revenue of an estimated amount) before the notice to complete is
served, or whether it is sufficient that those arrangements are
made and
notified to the purchaser in time for completion on the day which the notice
fixes for completion.
<P>

53  	If I were to approach that question solely as one of principle,
without governing authority, I would say that the notice is
ineffective unless
it is true, on the facts as they exist at the time when the notice is given,
that the vendor is able to make arrangements
with the Office of State Revenue
for the issue of a clear certificate, and is ready and willing to do so.  To
take an extreme case,
if the facts showed that at the time of the service of
the notice, the amount required to discharge mortgages and pay the amount
likely to be estimated by the Office of State Revenue would exceed the purchase
price, and that the vendor could not afford to provide
the balance, the notice
would be ineffective.  In my opinion the notice would also be ineffective if,
no prior arrangement for release
of the land having been made, the evidence
showed that the Office of State Revenue would only exercise the power to
release land
upon payment of an estimated amount in exceptional circumstances.
Perhaps the notice would be effective if the evidence showed that
the Office of
State Revenue had adopted the practice of releasing land on payment of an
estimated amount routinely or in normal circumstances.
 
<P>

54  	If one approaches the issue in this way, it seems to me that the
apparent point of difference between the Court of Appeal and
McLelland J
dissolves.  Hutley JA's remarks in the Court of Appeal proceed on the factual
assumption that there will be no obstacle
to the vendor freeing the land from
the land tax charge on or prior to completion.  This is clearly so if land tax
has been assessed
before the notice is served, and it is also the case if land
tax is assessed after service of the notice but before the date fixed
for
completion.  It is also true, in the absence of a relevant assessment, if it is
clear that at the time of service of the notice
the Office of State Revenue
will release the land upon payment of an estimated amount out of settlement
moneys.  In any of those
situations, there is no lack of readiness on the part
of the giver of the notice which would excuse the recipient from failing to
complete on the date originally fixed by the contract for completion.
Consequently the recipient's failure to complete at the contractual
time for
completion is a default justifying the issue of the notice.  The concern
expressed by McLelland J does not arise in such
a case.  But where there is a
real doubt, at the time of service of the notice, as to whether the vendor is
in a position to obtain
a land tax clearance by the date for completion
nominated in the notice, the vendor is not able, ready and willing to proceed
to
completion and conversely, the purchaser cannot be said to have defaulted by
not completing at the contractual time for completion.
 The situation is then
analogous to the facts of <i>Halkidis v Bugeia</i>, where the contract provided
for vacant possession and at the time when the vendors served a notice to
complete, the premises were
tenanted and a notice to quit had not been given.

<P>

55  	If it were necessary for me to apply these principles to the
first notice to complete in the present case, I would have a real
doubt as to
whether the notice was effective.  While there was no land tax charge at the
date of service of the notice, it fixed
a time for completion after 31 December
in circumstances where there would be a land tax charge at the nominated
completion time.
 Although the evidence shows that the plaintiffs were able to
make arrangements with the Office of State Revenue on 6 or 7 January
1997 for
release of the land on payment of an estimated amount, the evidence before me
leaves me in doubt as to whether the plaintiffs
were able, as well as ready and
willing, to do so on 20 December 1996 when the notice was issued.  However, it
is not necessary for
me to resolve this question, since I am clear that the
second notice to complete complies with the requirements of the law.  By the
time that the second notice was issued on 13 January 1997, the plaintiffs had
established arrangements with the Office of State Revenue
for release of the
land on payment of an estimated amount.  In view of those arrangements, the
plaintiffs' position with respect
to land tax was as a practical matter
analogous to the position of a vendor who has a mortgage to discharge, and the
principles stated
in <i>McNally v Waitzer </i>are in my opinion applicable.
The fact that a mortgagor has a legal right to discharge the mortgage whereas
vendors in the position
of the plaintiffs would have to rely on a favourable
exercise of a statutory discretion to obtain a release from land tax does not
seem to me to destroy the analogy, because in my opinion the Court should have
regard to the practical circumstances.  My conclusion
implies that a vendor who
first makes proper arrangements with the Office of State Revenue may proceed to
issue a notice to complete
which requires completion well before a land tax
assessment is available.  
<P>

<b>Content of the notices to complete</b>
<P>

56  	The first and second notices to complete were in the same form.
After reciting relevant terms of the contract for sale and
asserting that the
purchaser had failed to complete and that the vendors were ready willing and
able to complete, the notice proceeded
to make time of the essence of the
contract and of the essence in respect of the notice, and required the
purchaser to complete by
a nominated date and time at a specified place.  The
notice proceeded:
<P>

`Should you fail to comply herewith the vendor will then either rescind the
said Agreement for Sale or sue for specific performance
in accordance with the
said Agreement and shall hold you liable for all damages costs and losses
incurred by the vendor by reason
of your default in performing the said
Agreement.'
<P>

57  	The requirements for the content of a valid notice to complete
were set out by Jordan CJ in <i>O'Brien v Dawson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1941/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1941] NSWStRp 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281941%29%2041%20SR%28NSW%29%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1941) 41 SR(NSW) 295</a>,
304, as follows:
<P>

`The time prescribed by such a notice must be reasonable and the notice must
state with reasonable explicitness what it is that
is being required to be
done... and that if it be not done within the time prescribed the party who has
given the notice will treat
the contract as at an end, or will treat himself as
entitled to put an end to it.'
<P>

58  	The first two conditions have clearly been complied with here.
The first defendant submits, however, that the third condition
has not been
met, because the notice in the present case sets out two alternative
consequences of non-compliance, namely termination
or specific performance.
The first defendant also submits that the contract did not authorise
transmission of the notices by facsimile.
 I reject that submission on the
ground that whatever the contract initially provided, the evidence shows that
each party acquiesced
in communications being made between their respective
solicitors by facsimile.
<P>

59  	Prior to the introduction of the judicature system and the
enactment (at an earlier time in New South Wales) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act 1919</a> (NSW), which requires that stipulations as to time must receive in all
courts the same construction and effect as they would have
had in a court of
equity, breach of a contractual stipulation as to time would have entitled the
innocent party to terminate the
contract at law.  However, equity would
intervene, at the suit of the party in default, to grant relief against the
loss of the contract,
typically by ordering specific performance.  Equity
countermanded the contractual stipulation as to time, but that was explained
on
the basis that time was not `of the essence' in equity unless there was an
express or implied contractual provision to that effect
or due notice was
given.  In that intellectual framework, the function of notice to complete was
to provide a mechanism, where a
non-essential stipulation as to time had been
breached, for the innocent party to destroy the defaulter's right to equitable
relief
against termination, after the expiration of a specified reasonable
period.  Once <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> was enacted and particularly after the fusion of the
jurisdiction of courts of common law and equity, courts have sometimes
explained
the function of a notice to complete by reference to general
contractual concepts rather than pure principles of equity, treating
the notice
to complete, and failure to comply with it, as evidence demonstrating that the
party in default has repudiated the contract,
thus putting beyond question the
innocent party's right to terminate (see esp <i>Taylor v Raglan Developments
Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 NSWLR 117</a>, 131;  <i>Ciavarella v Balmer </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2057%20ALJR%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 57 ALJR
632</a>, 635, approving observations by Glass JA [1983] 2 NSWLR at 449).  This
analysis appears to be based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a>, which prevents the common law from
recognising termination for breach of a non-essential time stipulation, with
the result that
failure to comply with the notice to complete establishes the
innocent party's common law right of termination for breach of a time
stipulation, rather than merely extinguishing the defaulting party's right to
equitable relief to prevent termination.  Nevertheless
the impact of the notice
to complete on the availability of equitable remedies remains of first
importance, for it is equity rather
than the common law which has shaped the
requirements for a valid notice.  As Deane and Dawson JJ said in <i>Laurinda
Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20166%20CLR%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 166 CLR 623</a>, 652:
<P>

`In identifying the requirements of a valid notice to complete or perform, it
may be important to bear in mind that the purpose
and operation of such a
notice must be explained by reference to equitable doctrine and that the rules
relating to the requirements
of such a notice reflect the traditional equitable
notions of fairness and good conscience.'
<P>

60  	Given its equitable origins, the purpose of a notice to complete
is, as Deane and Dawson JJ said, to give reasonable warning
to the party in
default, so as to remove any basis for a claim by that party that it would be
inequitable or unconscionable for the
innocent party to rescind.  If that is
the purpose of a notice to complete, the essential ingredient of the warning,
apart from specifying
what the giver requires to be done and prescribing a time
which is reasonable, is to convey to the recipient that if the notice is
not
complied with, the defaulting party will no longer have any basis for holding
the giver of the notice to the contract.  This
ingredient is supplied if the
notice states that if completion does not occur as required by the notice, the
giver will terminate
the contract (assuming, of course, that the statement in
the notice is not countermanded or waived by other conduct).  It is sufficient
if the giver's intention to terminate is communicated by the notice when read
in the light of surrounding conduct and circumstances,
even if the notice is
itself ambiguous.  Thus in <i>Balog v Crestani</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20132%20CLR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 132 CLR 289</a> a notice
which said `in default the vendor will exercise his power under the contract
without further notice' was held to be adequate
because the history of the
matter showed that the power which the giver intended to exercise was the power
to terminate.  However,
while it is sufficient for the giver to convey an
intention to terminate, it is reasonably clear from modern authorities that it
is not necessary for the giver to do so.  Sir Frederick Jordan said it was
enough for the giver to convey an entitlement to terminate.
 Although in
<i>Balog</i> Gibbs J said that Jordan CJ had `enlarg[ed] somewhat the
traditional statement of the rule', he contemplated (132 CLR at 298) that
it
may be enough for the giver to indicate that he will rely on his rights if the
other party fails to comply with the notice, and
found it unnecessary to decide
the point.  But Deane and Dawson JJ in <i>Laurinda</i> (166 CLR at 654) were
firmly of the view that a notice is adequate to warn the defaulter if it
conveys that the giver will be entitled
in the event of non-compliance, or will
regard himself as entitled, to rescind. 
<P>

61  	There at least two good reasons for this view, as Deane and
Dawson JJ acknowledged in <i>Laurinda</i> (166 CLR at 653-4).  One is that an
effective notice binds both the giver and the recipient.  If the giver fails to
complete at the
time nominated by the notice, the recipient of the notice is
then entitled either to terminate the contract or institute proceedings
for
specific performance.  The giver of the notice must enjoy the same rights if
the recipient defaults.  That being so, it would
be bizarre if equity were to
require that the notice to complete should nominate an election to terminate
rather than to enforce
the contract, prior to the occurrence of the events
which would otherwise allow the giver to elect between remedies.  Secondly, if
the notice states an intention to terminate but is an invalid notice, the
giving of the notice might be regarded as wrongful repudiation
of the contract,
and it is inequitable to expose the giver of the notice to that risk.
<P>

62  	I conclude, for these reasons, that a notice is adequate if it
indicates, when read in the surrounding circumstances, that
the giver will be
entitled or will regard himself as being entitled to bring the contract to an
end in the event of non-compliance.
 Clearly it is not necessary to convey that
message in those very words.  Both Gibbs J in <i>Balog </i>(132 CLR at 299) and
Deane, Dawson and Brennan JJ in <i>Laurinda</i> (166 CLR at 654 and 646
respectively) favoured the view that it is sufficient for the notice to make it
clear that the time fixed
by the notice is to be treated as of the essence for
performance of the contract.  
<P>

63  	The second notice in the present case makes it clear that the
time which it fixes will be treated as of the essence for performance
of the
contract.  The notice also makes it clear that the plaintiffs would regard
themselves as entitled to terminate the contract
if the first defendant did not
comply.  The sole remaining question is whether the addition of words
signifying an alternative right
to seek specific performance has invalidated
what would otherwise clearly be a valid notice.  In <i>Balog</i> Gibbs J said
that `it must be regarded as doubtful' whether such a notice would be effective
(132 CLR at 297), but he noted that
in <i>Gostown Pty Ltd v Prior </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2092%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20882" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 92
WN (NSW) 882</a> Helsham J had a taken a contrary view, and he expressly refrained
from deciding the question.  While Deane and Dawson JJ did not
resolve the
question in <i>Laurinda</i>, in my opinion their remarks imply that a notice
which indicates that time will become of the essence and the giver will be
entitled
to terminate is not invalid if it says that the giver will also be
entitled to enforce the contract.  As their Honours pointed out
(166 CLR at
653), the recipient would have those alternative rights if the giver failed to
complete at the nominated time, and therefore
the giver must have those rights
and it would be anomalous for equity to require the notice to elect between
them prematurely.  My
conclusion, therefore, is that the second notice was not
invalidated by referring to the alternative of specific performance, and
consequently the second notice was not open to challenge on this basis.  I
would reach the same conclusion with respect to the first
notice, were it
necessary to do so, as the relevant wording is identical.
<P>

<b>Content and timing of the notice of rescission</b>
<P>

64  	Clause 9 of the contract is in the following terms:
<P>

`9. Purchaser's default
<P>

If the purchaser does not comply with this contract (or a notice under or
relating to it) in an essential respect, the vendor can
terminate by serving a
notice and then -
<P>

9.1 keep or recover the deposit (except so much of it as exceeds 10% of the
price);
<P>

9.2 hold any other money paid by the purchaser under this contract as security
for anything recoverable under this clause - 
<P>

	9.2.1 for 12 months, or
<P>

	9.2.2 if the vendor commences proceedings under this clause within 12 months
unless those proceedings are concluded;  and
<P>

9.3 sue the purchaser - 
<P>

	9.3.1 to recover damages for breach of contract;  or
<P>

	9.3.2 where the vendor has resold the property under a contract made within 12
months after termination, to recover the deficiency
on resale (with credit for
any of the deposit kept or recovered), and the reasonable costs and expenses
arising out of the purchaser's
non-compliance with this contract of resale and
any attempt at resale.'
<P>

65  	The second notice to complete required the first defendant to
complete the contract by 28 January 1997 at 12 noon at a nominated
place.  The
deadline was extended twice by letter, so that it eventually became 4pm on the
same day.  In my opinion those extensions
were effective in the sense, at
least, that the plaintiffs would have been estopped by the letters from
complaining of failure to
complete at the earlier time.  The plaintiffs
purported to `terminate and rescind the Agreement', and declared the deposit
forfeited
and claimed damages, by a document entitled `Notice of Rescission'
dated 28 January 1997.  That document recited the making of the
Agreement for
Sale and that `the vendors pursuant to that Agreement rely on a default by the
purchaser in an essential respect under
the contract and notices served
pursuant thereto'.
<P>

66  	The first defendant complains that these words do not specify
the breach relied on for the purpose of termination.  I reject
this submission.
The Notice of Rescission refers to a default by the purchaser in an `essential
respect' and to `notices' served
pursuant to the contract.  Given that the
Notice of Rescission followed the serving of the two notices to complete, it is
plain that
the reference to `notices' is a reference to the two notices to
complete and the reference to a default `in an essential respect'
refers to the
fact that the notices to complete expressly made the nominated completion time
of the essence of the contract.  In
those circumstances the breach specified in
the Notice of Rescission must be the failure to complete by the times nominated
in the
two notices to complete.  I have held that the second notice to complete
was effective, while not deciding whether the first notice
to complete was
rendered ineffective by the plaintiff's failure to make arrangements for land
tax clearance before the notice was
served.  Since the notice of rescission
relies, in my opinion, on failure to complete in accordance with, inter alia,
the second
notice, the Notice of Rescission is effective to terminate the
contract.
<P>

67  	The evidence of service of the Notice of Rescission is sketchy.
It includes a copy of a letter to the first defendant dated
28 January 1997
enclosing the Notice of Rescission, but there is nothing to indicate how the
letter was sent.  If it had been served
prior to 4pm on 28 January 1997 (or
perhaps at any time on 28 January 1997), it would have been ineffective, since
the time specified
in the second notice to complete, as extended, did not
expire until 4pm or possibly midnight on that day. 
<P>

68  	A letter from Helliars City to the second defendant dated 30
January 1997 asserts that the Notice of Rescission was served
on the first
defendant's solicitors on 29 January 1997. The first defendant contended that
this letter cannot be treated as evidence
as to the date of service of the
notice, and referred to the principle in <i>Jones v Dunkel </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR
298</a>, that if a party fails to adduce seemingly material evidence without
explanation then the court may infer that, had that evidence
been adduced, it
would not have assisted the party's case.  But in this matter evidence as to
the date of service has been tendered
and that evidence is the letter.  It is
not the case that the plaintiffs have failed to adduce any material evidence of
the fact
in issue.  I accept the plaintiffs' submission that it would carry the
principle in <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> too far to find that the plaintiffs' failure
to produce more compelling evidence as to the date of service entitles me to
draw the
inference that such evidence would not have assisted the plaintiffs'
case.  In view of the evidence represented by the letter of
30 January 1997,
and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I find that the Notice of
Rescission was served on first defendant
on 29 January 1997.
<P>

<b>Conclusions and orders</b>
<P>

69  	The plaintiffs were entitled to terminate the contract when the
first defendant failed to complete on 28 January 1997, because
the second
notice to complete was effective.  They terminated the contract by written
Notice of Rescission on 29 January 1997.  Clause
15 and special condition 2 of
the contract authorised the giving of the notices to complete.  Since the
second notice to complete
made time of the essence and the first defendant did
not comply, clause 9 then applied to authorise the plaintiffs to terminate by
serving a notice, as they did.  The consequences according to clause 9 are that
the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the deposit
which is held by the second
defendants, and sue the first defendant to recover damages for breach of
contract.
<P>

70  	The plaintiffs are entitled to declarations that the second
notice to complete was effective to make the time which it nominated
an
essential time for completion, and that the Notice of Rescission was effective
to terminate the contract on 29 January 1997. 
They are entitled to an order
that the second defendant pay them the deposit together with the interest which
that amount has earned
in the hands of the second defendant.  The plaintiffs
are also entitled to recover damages for breach of contract.  Since no evidence
was led for the purpose of quantifying the plaintiffs' damages, I propose to
make an order for the assessment of damages by the Master.
 The first
defendant's cross-claim should be dismissed.  I shall ask the plaintiffs'
counsel to prepare short minutes of the orders
which I propose.
<P>

71  	I propose to order that the first defendant pay the plaintiffs'
costs of the summons and cross-claim.  However I shall make
provision that my
order for payment of costs should take effect only seven days after my making
of the orders, and I shall grant
any party liberty to apply to me on any week
day on 24 hours' notice to the other parties, with the intention that the
liberty should
be exercised by any party who wishes to make a submission on the
question of costs before my order for costs becomes effective.
