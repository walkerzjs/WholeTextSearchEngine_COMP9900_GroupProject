<b>MONDAY, 1 FEBRUARY 1999</b>

<b>3643/97 - HORTIS V PAPANIKOLAOU</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>     This is an appeal from Master McLaughlin, who was
reviewing an order of a Registrar refusing access to the applicants of
documents
produced under subpoena by a law firm, ISP Law, which has now ceased
to practise as such.
<P>

2	     It would seem (and I use those words advisedly, as there was very little
evidence before either the Registrar or the Master)
ISP Law have acted for the
present cross-claimants in some commercial matters, which in a sense have led
to the current litigation.
 Thus ISP Law were acting for the cross-claimants in
earlier matters, they have never acted for them in the present proceedings.
<P>

3	     The documents were produced to the court constituted by a Registrar and
the question before the Registrar was whether there
should be access.  The
learned Registrar refused access.  He did not give any reasons, and it would
seem that the decision was made
in the hurly burly of a normal directions list.
There was some mention made before the Registrar of a possible solicitors'
lien.
<P>

4	     The cross-claimants asked the Master to review that decision.  The
Master took the view that there was virtually no evidence
of anything before
him; there was no evidence of any lien; there was no material which could
assist him and, accordingly, he should
merely dismiss the application to
review.  However, he made it clear that further applications could be made for
access to the documents
at appropriate times on proper evidence.  From that
decision the current appeal was lodged.
<P>

5	     With great respect, the principles upon which access to documents is
given in this Court at the present day appear to have
been largely
overlooked.
<P>

6	     It needs to be said that current day practice is different to the
practice that existed in former years and because methods
of trial have
altered, one needs to adjust what happened in former years to produce the same
result under the current practice.
<P>

7	     Subpoenas used to be returnable at the hearing, so that when a document
was produced to a court it was produced to the  court
when it was conducting
the trial.
<P>

8	     When a document was produced to the trial court under s 12 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ea189880/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1898</a> the judge had to consider whether he or she would grant
access.  The practice in New South Wales, as appears in Glass<b> Seminars on
Evidence (</b>Law Book Company, Sydney, 1970) in the paper of Moffitt J, as his
Honour then was, at page 7, was that the judge would not grant leave
for a
party to inspect a document unless that party was bound to put the document in
evidence.  However, there was a  discretion
given to the judge and he or she
might exercise that discretion the other way.  In particular, the judge would
not give leave to
inspect the document if he or she was informed that the owner
of the document may need it to conduct a cross-examination, so that
the
contents of the document should not be disclosed so as to destroy the
cross-examination.
<P>

9	     In former years there was a big gap between the law of discovery and the
law governing subpoenas.  However, the decisions
made in the old cases on
discovery are of assistance in situations such as the present. 
<P>

10	     When a document was discovered the person giving discovery alerted the
other side to the existence of the document and it
could be inspected.
However, it being inspected, and a copy made, did not make it any evidence in
the case, and the rule was where
the defence was a solicitor's lien, that the
lien was no objection to discovery and inspection of the document because the
lien only
stopped possession of the document, or it being deployed in evidence,
not inspection:  <b> Lockett v Cary</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281864%29%2010%20Jur%20%28NS%29%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1864) 10 Jur (NS) 144.</a>  In that case
Romilly MR held that there could only be inspection of the documents at the
solicitor's office, but no copies could
be made.  In<b> Pratt v Pratt</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2030%20WR%20837" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 30 WR 837</a>, Bacon VC said that copies were merely for the purpose of
assisting the memory and were not evidence, unless the original was lost,
and
as a person could learn a document by heart it was idle to stop copies being
made because the copies could not be put in evidence.
<P>

11	     Today the rules of evidence are more relaxed and it is possible that
the copy made could be used in evidence unless some
particular order was
made.
<P>

12	     One cannot go back to the old subpoena law because it would not be
right to say to a party seeking inspection of documents
that that party must
deploy all the documents inspected into evidence.  One reason for this is that
an unscrupulous opponent might
put into the box to be inspected all sorts of
self-serving statements which the other party would then be bound to tender.
One, accordingly,
cannot follow the old practice under s 12 of the former
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ea189880/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1898</a> when subpoenas were returnable at the hearing.
<P>

13	     It seems to me that when applications are made for access and the claim
is voiced by the owner of the documents that there
is a solicitor's lien that
at least until the issue of the lien is resolved or dealt with by some process
like the application in
lieu of distringas under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s74.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act
1970</a>, one should follow by analogy the discovery decisions to which I have
referred.  That is, access should be allowed to the documents
on the basis that
copies may be taken but only on an undertaking that those copies will not be
tendered in evidence in any court
without further leave of a court and on the
basis that it is understood that any lien affecting the document is not
discharged.
<P>

14	     When a Registrar has to consider the question of access to documents
the first question to consider is whether the documents
could be relevant to
the case of the person seeking production.  It is not only documents which are
relevant to a fact in issue that
may be subpoenaed, but documents ancillary to
such issues.  Prima facie the assertion of the person issuing the subpoena that
they
are so relevant, at least if supported by some reasoning, should be
accepted and access should be granted.
<P>

15	     The onus is really on the person objecting to show some  reason why
access should be denied.  A reason may be that the forensic
value of the
documents is such that they should not be prematurely disclosed to the
opponent, especially in a fraud case.  There
may well be other good answers
which the Registrar will have to evaluate.  Where there is a claim for a
solicitor's lien then ordinarily
an order should be made for access, preserving
the lien and taking an undertaking as to copying.  In due course the way of
dealing
with liens is for a proper bill to be produced and security given for
the lien or other arrangements made.
<P>

16	     I should add that in the instant case there was no actual evidence of
lien.  All I have is a suggestion that there is an
amount owing of some $14,000
by the solicitors concerned and a counter-allegation that whilst there may be
some moneys owing for
costs,  there is also the liability of those solicitors
for damages  which will need to be resolved in due course.
<P>

17	     Accordingly, the court grants access to the documents produced, upon
the solicitor for the cross-claimants undertaking that
any copies made in the
course of inspecting the documents will not be deployed in evidence and on the
basis that any existing lien
of the solicitors producing the documents is
preserved pending further order of the court.
<P>

18	     The next question is the question of costs.  The learned Master ordered
the cross-claimants to pay the costs.  As I am really
setting aside his
decision, that order must go.
<P>

19	     It seems to me that the present appeal is the first time that the
matter has really been considered on the basis of principle
and that the appeal
before me was something in which each side got something and lost something.  I
think that the Master should
have allowed the appeal and, accordingly, the
cross-claimants should have their costs before the Master and each side should
pay
their own costs of the appeal before me.
<P>

                                            oOo
