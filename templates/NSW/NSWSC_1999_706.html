DAMPFSCHIFFFAHRTS-GESELLSCHAFT EGGERT &amp; AMSINCK &amp;
ANOR </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	Proceedings 15 of 1998 were commenced by a Statement of
Claim filed on 29 June 1998, which was amended by an Amended Statement
of Claim
filed on 5 January 1999.  In the Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiff,
James N. Kirby Pty Limited trading as Kirby Engineering,
("Kirby"), for which
Mr N.C. Hutley of Senior Counsel and Ms J.S. Gleeson of Counsel appeared, sued
International Cargo Control Pty
Limited, ("ICC"), for which Mr S.R. Horgan of
Counsel appeared, and Hamburg Sudamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft
Eggert
&amp; Amsinck, ("Hamburg Sud"), for which Mr B.W. Larkin of Counsel
appeared.
<P>

2   	The Amended Statement of Claim alleged that pursuant to
Bill of Lading No AU12-27086101 dated 27 August 1997, ICC agreed to
carry on
board the motor vessel "Queensland Star" ten containers containing certain
equipment in good order and condition for an
agreed freight for carriage from
Sydney to the Port of Savannah, USA, and from there for delivery to Huntsville
Ramp, Alabama, in
accordance with its terms.
<P>

3   	It was alleged that Kirby was, at all material times, the
owner of the goods and the holder of the Bill of Lading and entitled
to
possession of and delivery to it of the goods, and that in the premises Kirby
was entitled to claim under and in respect of the
Bill, the contract of
carriage evidenced therein, and for loss or damage to the goods.
<P>

4   	It was pleaded that the Bill was a clean Bill expressly
acknowledging the shipment of the goods in apparent good order and
condition,
and that it was a term thereof that ICC would procure the transportation of the
goods to their destination and would be
responsible for them and for any
occurrence, which caused loss or damage to them whilst in its charge, unless
the loss or damage
was proved by ICC not to have been caused or contributed to
by any fault or neglect on its part, or that of its servants or agents,
or on
the part of any person of whose services ICC made use.
<P>

5   	It was alleged that a number of the goods were delivered in
a damaged condition, in consequence of which Kirby has suffered
damages in the
sum of approximately $2m.
<P>

6   	It was further pleaded that ICC was a bailee for reward
and, by reason thereof, owed a duty to Kirby in respect of the transhipment
of
the goods; that ICC entrusted the goods to Norfolk Southern Railway Company,
("Norfolk"), for which Ms L.A. Muston of Counsel
appeared, and that ICC, "by
its servants or agents" for which it was responsible, was negligent in the
carriage of the goods.  The
particulars alleged that Norfolk failed to maintain
the railway line over which the goods were to be transported; ran a railway
line
over an area of land which was unstable; failed to maintain a traction
vehicle so that bearings did not fail during the course of
the journey; failed
to rectify the problems associated with the instability of the railway line;
caused a train to travel at a speed
which caused or contributed to the
carriages being derailed; and <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.  These were allegations
made by Kirby against ICC.
<P>

7   	As against Hamburg Sud, Kirby alleged that it was a bailee
for reward of the goods and had a duty to it to properly care for
and deliver
them in the same good order and condition as when shipped at Sydney, and that
in breach thereof Hamburg Sud delivered
the goods in a damaged condition.
<P>

8   	Further, or alternatively, Kirby relied on a Bill of Lading
issued by Hamburg Sud at Sydney on or about 27 August 1997, the
terms of that
Bill of Lading, and the failure by Hamburg Sud to deliver the goods in
accordance therewith.
<P>

9   	In his affidavit of 5 July 1999 the solicitor for Kirby, Mr
S.W. Hetherington, deposed that the claim made by it against ICC
is primarily
in contract pursuant to ICC's Bill of Lading, and that the claim made against
Hamburg Sud is one in bailment and contract,
pursuant to its Bill of Lading,
and in tort.
<P>

10   	The Bill of Lading, which was issued by ICC and is
Annexure "A" to Mr Hetherington's affidavit, is described as a Negotiable
Fiata
Multimodal Transport Bill of Lading.
<P>

11   	It was not in issue that :-
<P>

(a)	Kirby could only sue ICC and Hamburg Sud in this Court: clause 19 of ICC's
Bill of Lading and clause 22 of Hamburg Sud's Bill
of Lading; 
<P>

(b)	proceedings had to be brought against ICC and Hamburg Sud within nine
months and one year respectively after delivery of the
goods: clause 17 of the
ICC Bill of Lading and clause 18 of the Hamburg Sud Bill of Lading; 
<P>

(c)	these times have now passed; and
<P>

(d)	neither ICC nor Hamburg Sud was prepared to waive these contractual
rights.
<P>

12   	In paragraphs 11 and 12 of his affidavit, Mr Hetherington
deposed:-
<P>

<b>"11.	By their defences both ICC and Hamburg Sud rely upon provisions in one
or both of the bills of lading which are annexed hereto
and marked `A' and `B'
and in particular rely upon limitations of liability contained in those bills
of lading.  If the Plaintiff
is successful in these proceedings and the First
and Second Defendants are entitled to rely upon any limitation of liability
provision
under the bills of lading the recovery which the Plaintiff will make
in these proceedings will be considerably less than the amount
of its claim,
which is quantified in paragraph 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim as being
Aust$2,065,183.00.  On the view which
is most favourable to the plaintiff the
potential recovery for the Plaintiff if the Defendants are entitled to rely on
limitation
of liability under those bills of lading is under the ICC bill
approximately Aust$345,000.00 or under the Hamburg Sud bill of lading
approximately Aust$316,000.</b>
<P>

<b>  12.	It was in anticipation that the one or both of the Defendants, ICC and
Hamburg Sud would seek to exclude and/or limit their
liability to an amount
considerably less than the Plaintiff's damage that I was instructed to appoint
attorneys in the United States
to commence proceedings against Norfolk Southern
Railway Company."</b>
<P>

13   	Mr Hetherington annexed to his affidavit the Complaint
filed by Kirby against Norfolk, on 8 October 1998, in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, ("the United States
District Court"), and the Answer thereto whereby, inter
alia, Norfolk relied
upon the terms and conditions of its "Intermodal Rules Circular", which it
asserted formed the contract of carriage
between Kirby and it, whereby the
maximum liability is $500 "pursuant to the bill of lading".
<P>

14   	He exhibited to his affidavit as "SWH1" those Rules, which
required proceedings to be commenced only in certain nominated
jurisdictions in
the United States, including the United States District Court.
<P>

<b>The Claim By Norfolk For An Anti-Suit Injunction</b>
<P>

15   	Mr Hetherington exhibited to his affidavit a Motion filed
by Norfolk in the United States District Court for an anti-suit
injunction "to
enjoin Plantiffs from pursuing parallel cause of action in Australia". The
plaintiffs are Kirby and MMI General Insurance
Limited. The Motion asserts:-
<P>

<b>"The case at bar, and the Australian actions, involve the same claim for
nearly two million dollars in damages to cargo allegedly
occurring in the
course of a derailment in Littleville, Alabama.  Plaintiffs contend Norfolk
Southern is negligent and/or otherwise
responsible for these damages under the
applicable contracts of carriage.  Norfolk Southern seeks to enjoin the
Plaintiffs from proceeding
with the Australian action on the grounds that
simultaneous prosecution of these two actions will result in inefficiency for
the
Court and the parties .. and inequitable hardship on Norfolk Southern.  In
addition, prosecution of the case in Australia will not
permit Norfolk Southern
to obtain a fair trial of the case because it cannot adequately present
evidence in support of its defences
in the distant forum of Australia, when the
site of the derailment and all equipment involved are located in the United
States, as
well as virtually all the witnesses.  Finally, such an injunction
will not work a hardship on Plaintiffs as they have voluntarily,
submitted
themselves to the jurisdiction of this Court and are aggressively proceeding
with discovery and prosecution of their claims
in this Court."</b>
<P>

This injunction is sought notwithstanding that neither Kirby nor MMI General
Insurance Limited has instituted any proceedings against
Norfolk in this
Court.
<P>

16   	Exhibit "SWH3" to Mr Hetherington's affidavit is the brief
in opposition to Norfolk's motion, which starts by asserting that
Norfolk is
incorrect in alleging that the proceedings constitute "a parallel cause of
action" to those in Australia, because no action
has been brought by the
plaintiffs against Norfolk in Australia.  Reference is then made to Hamburg
Sud's Cross-Claim against Norfolk
in the Australian proceedings and, under the
heading:-
<P>

<b>"There are forum clauses which necessitate the jurisdictional posture of the
suits"</b>
<P>

it is stated:-
<P>

<b>"Granting this motion puts the Court in the position of ordering Plaintiffs
to stop pursuing a properly instigated suit against entities
which are
<u>not</u> parties to this suit, ICC and Hamburg Sud, thereby leaving
Plaintiffs with no suit pending against those entities.  Forum clauses,
which
are enforceable, are what caused the current situation."</b>
<P>

Subsequently it is stated:-
<P>

<b>"Accordingly, this Court, while it has jurisdiction over Norfolk Southern
and Plaintiffs, does not and would not have jurisdiction
over the other parties
to the Australian proceeding.  Meaning, if the instant motion is granted, Kirby
is stripped of its claims
against ICC and Hamburg Sud."</b>
<P>

17   	The submissions concluded:-
<P>

<b>"Accordingly, while there are two proceedings involving some, but not all,
of the same parties, it cannot be said that Plaintiffs
are maintaining parallel
or duplicative actions.  Furthermore, the multiple forum selection clauses of
the parties must necessarily
be given effect, resulting in multiple actions.
International comity dictates that the injunction of the Australian proceedings
only
be granted in rare instances.  The remaining factors to be considered by
the Court when assessing whether to enjoin a foreign suit
are either not
present or are insignificant.  Accordingly, this Court should allow both
proceedings on the <i>in personam</i> claim to proceed simultaneously, at least
until a judgment is reached in one jurisdiction which can be pled as <i>res
judicata</i> in the other."</b>
<P>

18   	Exhibit "SWH4" to Mr Hetherington's affidavit is Norfolk"s
Reply, which asserts that Norfolk's only objective is to have the
duties and
liabilities surrounding the derailment near Littleville, Alabama on 9 October
1997 tried in the most practical and efficient
forum possible, which is
asserted to be the United States District Court.  The only proceedings brought
by Kirby against Norfolk
in relation to this incident have been instituted in
the Court which Norfolk asserts to be "the most practical and efficient forum
possible".  Norfolk's complaint against Kirby is therefore very difficult to
understand.  MMI General Insurance Limited is not a
party to any presently
relevant proceedings in this Court.
<P>

19   	The problem confronting Kirby is easy to see.  Pursuant to
its contractual arrangements with ICC and Hamburg Sud it was obliged
to sue
them in this Court and within limited times after the loss.  Because of the
monetary limitation on which those defendants
seek to rely, Kirby has also
sought to proceed against Norfolk, in the possession of which the goods
obviously were at the time they
were damaged, in the United States District
Court.  It clearly has different causes of action against each, certain of
which can
only, as a matter of contract, be brought in this Court, and some of
which, arguably as a matter of contract, can only be brought
in the United
States District Court.  Further, if Kirby had sought to join Norfolk in the
proceedings in this Court it would, in
all probability, have been met with an
application for a stay on forum non conveniens principles.
<P>

<b>The Position In This Court</b>
<P>

20   	On 21 August 1998, in proceedings 15 of 1998, ICC
cross-claimed against Hamburg Sud in this Court alleging, inter alia, that
it
was the duty of Hamburg Sud or a term of the contract that it and/or its
servants, agents and/or independent contractors, for
which it was responsible,
would exercise reasonable care of the goods during the loading, carriage and
discharge thereof.  ICC alleged
that Hamburg Sud had breached this duty.
<P>

21   	On 30 November 1998 Hamburg Sud cross-claimed against
Norfolk, alleging that by a contract evidenced by a rail way bill between
it
and Norfolk, Norfolk received the goods in good order and condition for
carriage by it by rail and for delivery in like good order
to Hamburg Sud or
its agents, which obligations Norfolk failed to meet.   Alternatively, it
alleged that Norfolk was a bailee for
reward and breached its duties as such in
the manner to which I have referred.
<P>

22   	ICC brought a third cross-claim against Norfolk making
essentially the same allegations against it as Hamburg Sud had.
<P>

23   	By each of the cross-claims, the cross-claimants sought
indemnity or contribution from the cross-defendants.  However, Kirby
has not
sought to join Norfolk in the proceedings in this Court.
<P>

24   	In proceedings 17 of 1998, which were commenced by a
Statement of Claim filed on 10 July 1998, ICC  sued Hamburg Sud and Norfolk
claiming damages arising out of the defendants' alleged breaches of duty, and a
declaration that ICC is entitled to an indemnity
from those defendants in
respect of any liability of ICC "to any person" for loss or damage to the cargo
pursuant to its Bill of
Lading.  It is not clear how the allegations in
proceedings 17 of 1998 advance those made in proceedings 15 of 1998.  What is
clear
is that Kirby is not a party to those proceedings.
<P>

25   	On 30 November 1998 Hamburg Sud cross-claimed against
Norfolk and, on 5 February 1999, Norfolk filed a Notice of Conditional
Appearance.
<P>

26   	In so far as Norfolk has been made a party to proceedings
15 of 1998 that has been pursuant to the Second Cross-Claim brought
by Hamburg
Sud against it and the Third Cross-Claim brought by ICC against it.  In so far
as it has been joined as a party to proceedings
17 of 1998 that is by virtue of
its being joined as a defendant by ICC, and as a cross-defendant by Hamburg
Sud.
<P>

<b>The Present Notices Of Motion</b>
<P>

27   	On 13 May 1999 the solicitors for Norfolk filed Notices of
Motion in each of the proceedings, which named as the applicants
Hamburg Sud
and Norfolk.  Each Notice of Motion named Kirby and Kirby USA Inc as
respondents and sought the same relief, namely:-
<P>

<b>"1.	The proceedings numbered 015 of 1998 and 017 of 1998 be stayed
permanently.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	In the alternative, the proceedings numbered 015 of 1998 and 017 of
1998 be stayed until final determination of the proceedings
brought in Atlanta,
Georgia, USA by" Kirby.</b>
<P>

<b>"3.	Further and in the alternative the proceedings numbered 015 of 1998 and
017 of 1998 be stayed until further order of the Court."</b>
<P>

Notwithstanding that ICC's proceedings were sought to be stayed, it was not
named as a respondent.  However, it appeared and, in
the end, Mr Horgan
consented to the making of orders 2 and 3, (order 1 not by then being pressed),
thus consenting to his client's
proceedings (17 of 1998) being stayed
conformably with those orders.
<P>

28   	The Notices of Motion were supported by the affidavits of
the solicitor for Norfolk in Sydney, Mr Robert Bruce Conway, sworn
13 May 1999,
and of Counsel for Norfolk in the United States, Ms T.T. Daly, sworn 28 June
1999.  It is sufficient, for present purposes,
to refer to Ms Daly's affidavit.
No objection was taken to any part of it and she was not required for
cross-examination.
<P>

29   	Ms Daly set forth the history and content of the
proceedings in uncontroversial terms, and then dealt in some detail with
the
proceedings between Kirby and Norfolk in the United States District Court.
These proceedings are well advanced in that a number
of interlocutory steps
have been taken, including the obtaining of depositions of witnesses, the
delivery and answering of interrogatories
and the having of discovery.  It is
also clear that there are a number of factual issues concerning the
circumstances in which the
goods were damaged in the United States, which can
be more efficiently and effectively determined in the United States District
Court.
 Before me so much was not in issue.
<P>

30   	In paragraph 33 Ms Daly referred to the injunction
proceedings, and deposed that "judgment generally is handed down between
thirty
and one hundred and twenty days after the filing of the brief in reply but,
this depends on the Judge".
<P>

31   	In paragraph 34 she stated:-
<P>

<b>"If NS" (Norfolk) "is forced to defend the Australian proceedings, its
defence to the claims will be identical to its defence to the
United States
Proceedings.  The evidence upon which NS will rely in defending the Australian
Proceedings will be identical to that
relied upon in the United States
Proceedings.  In view of the defence that NS would have to mount in the
Australian Proceedings,
NS will be required to make all of its witnesses
available for cross-examination.  Many of these witnesses will require
considerable
time to give their evidence and explain to the Supreme Court the
technical issues in this case, including the workings of their models
and
graphs and the observations, findings and conclusions which they have
reached."</b>
<P>

The only proceedings Norfolk is required to defend in this Court are brought
against it by ICC and Hamburg Sud.
<P>

<b>The Present Case</b>
<P>

32   	I should note that on 13 November 1998 Hunter J made an
order, by consent, that proceedings 15 and 17 of 1998 be consolidated.
<P>

33   	In the course of submissions it became a little difficult,
if I may say so with respect, to ascertain precisely what Norfolk's
position
is.  This arose essentially because of its concession that there is no Court,
other than the Supreme Court of New South
Wales, which can, having regard to
the contractual obligations between the parties, hear the proceedings between
Kirby as plaintiff,
on the one hand, and ICC and Hamburg Sud as defendants, on
the other.  Neither of these defendants was prepared to accept that the
dispute
between Kirby and it should be determined in the United States proceedings, nor
were they prepared to forego the time limitation
defences in the event of any
such proceedings being instituted.  In these circumstances Ms Muston, whose
submissions Mr Larkin adopted
on behalf of Hamburg Sud, conceded that she could
not press for an order that the proceedings in this Court be stayed
permanently.
 That concession was made in both sets of proceedings, perhaps
because of the consolidation order. 
<P>

34   	It may be, and I put it no higher than that, appropriate
that the making of this concession be drawn to the attention of the
United
States District Court because it may be, and, once again I put it no higher
than that, a matter which that Court considers
relevant in determining how it
should exercise its discretion in considering the anti-suit injunction for
which Norfolk has applied
in that Court.  The granting of that injunction would
have the effect of preventing Kirby proceeding against ICC and Hamburg Sud
in
the only Court in which it can, and in circumstances where, even if it could
proceed in another Court, it would be met by time
limitation defences.  Of more
immediate relevance, however, is the concession by Norfolk that it is not
entitled to a permanent stay
in this Court when the anti-suit injunction, if
granted, would lead to essentially the same result.  It will have to be
explained
why Norfolk is seeking an anti-suit injunction against Kirby when it
has not been sued by Kirby in this Court, and why Norfolk has
not pressed for a
permanent stay in this Court against ICC and Hamburg Sud, by which it is being
sued.  As Hamburg Sud is suing Norfolk
in this Court, its joining as an
applicant in the Notices of Motion and adoption of Norfolk's submissions is
very strange.
<P>

35   	It is also necessary to note that ICC made a similar
concession and, further, that Mr Horgan submitted that it had no desire
for a
"deconsolidation" of the proceedings.  However, he consented to the making of
the orders in terms of paragraphs 2 and 3.  In
all these circumstances the
proper applications by Norfolk may be for an order staying the proceedings
brought by ICC and Hamburg
Sud both by way of claim and cross-claim against it
on the ground of forum non conveniens, but, so it seems to me, those
applications
would have to be made by Norfolk, as applicant, against ICC and
Hamburg Sud, as respondents.
<P>

36   	The questions then arise as to whether the only other
relevantly substantial relief sought by Norfolk, and supported by Hamburg
Sud,
namely the stay of the proceedings in this Court until final determination of
those in the United States District Court should
be granted against Kirby,
which opposes the granting of any such relief, and ICC, which consents to it.
Those questions throw up
for determination the reason why Kirby, which has
regularly instituted proceedings against various parties in the Courts where it
is contractually obliged to do so and, so far as Norfolk is concerned, in the
more appropriate forum, should be precluded for any
period from pursuing its
proceedings in this Court against the defendants it has chosen to and is
contractually obliged to sue in
this Court, in circumstances where those
defendants will not agree to be sued elsewhere or by way of proceedings
commenced now, and
why there is any utility in staying the proceedings brought
by ICC, even though it consents.
<P>

37   	Norfolk has been brought into the proceedings in this
Court by parties other than Kirby, and by parties which Kirby is obliged
to sue
in this Court and which will not agree to being sued by it elsewhere.  Prima
facie, therefore, it seems an extraordinary result
that Kirby should be
precluded from proceeding against ICC and Hamburg Sud and, speaking for myself,
I can see no reason why that
result should follow.
<P>

38   	It may be that as between Norfolk, as cross-defendant, and
ICC and Hamburg Sud, as cross-claimants, and ICC as plaintiff and
Norfolk as
defendant, Norfolk may be able to assert that it should not be sued in this
Court.  However, that is only part of  the
order it seeks and it only does that
inferentially and in circumstances where it has not joined either ICC or
Hamburg Sud as a respondent.
 Even after the concession to which I have
referred was made, viz that it was not entitled to a permanent stay, it did not
seek to
formulate an order that the proceedings, in so far as they have been
brought by ICC and Hamburg Sud against it, should be stayed.
<P>

39   	It may well be, at the end of the day, that the view is
taken that the proceedings as between ICC and Hamburg Sud, as cross-claimants,
and Norfolk, as cross-defendant, and ICC as plaintiff and Norfolk as defendant,
should not proceed in this Court.  However, that
is not a matter, which should
cause any concern to Kirby in the prosecution of its proceedings against ICC
and Hamburg Sud in the
only Court in which it can sue them.  It also must be
kept firmly in mind that in relation to Norfolk, Kirby has sued it in the Court
Norfolk accepts to be the most appropriate forum for it to be sued.  Nor do I
consider that I should resolve the position as between
Norfolk, ICC and Hamburg
Sud in the way in which the Notices of Motion have been brought and argued.
<P>

40   	Various submissions were put to me based on forum non
conveniens.
<P>

41   	Mr Horgan relied upon the following passage from the
decision of the High Court of Australia in <b>Henry v Henry</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20185%20CLR%20571" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 185 CLR
571</a> at p.591 in the joint judgment of Dawson, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.
He did this, as I understood it, in the context of supporting
Norfolk's
position, no doubt because no claim was being made which would bind his client,
it not being named as a respondent.  I
assume the view is taken   that as ICC's
claim is essentially defensive in nature, the first objective is to ensure that
Kirby's
claim does not proceed.  This may seem a good tactical manoeuvre.
Their Honours said:-
<P>

<b>"It is prima facie vexatious and oppressive, in the strict sense of those
terms, to commence a second or subsequent action in the
courts of this country
if an action is already pending with respect to the matter in issue.  And
although there are cases in which
it has been held that it is not prima facie
vexatious, in the strict sense of that word, to bring proceedings in different
countries,
the problems which arise if the identical issue or the same
controversy is to be litigated in different jurisdictions <u>which have
jurisdiction with respect to the matter </u>are such, in our view, that, prima
facie, the continuation of one or the other should be seen as vexatious or
oppressive within the
<i>Voth</i> sense of those words.</b>
<P>

<b>It does not follow that, because one or other of the proceedings is prima
facie vexatious or oppressive within the <i>Voth</i> sense of those words, the
local proceedings should be stayed.  However, it does follow that the fact that
there are or, even, that
there may be simultaneous proceedings in different
countries with respect to the same controversy is highly relevant to the
question
whether the local proceedings are oppressive in the sense of
`seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging', or, vexatious,
in
the sense of `productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment'.
And it also follows that the Court should strive,
to the extent that
<i>Voth</i> permits, to avoid that situation."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

42   	There are several matters to which I would respectfully
draw attention.  Firstly, their Honours were considering the situation
in which
both countries had jurisdiction with respect to the matter.  In the present
case, and relevantly for present purposes, that
does not appear to be the
situation qua Kirby.  It was conceded that the only Court with jurisdiction as
between Kirby, on the one
hand, and ICC and Hamburg Sud, on the other, was this
Court.  It was not argued that this Court had jurisdiction over the dispute
between Kirby and Norfolk.  In so far as there are jurisdictional problems they
are such as to force Kirby to sue in both Courts
and, as I have noted, none of
the parties is prepared to give up any of its rights in that respect.  Further,
Kirby has not brought
proceedings against Norfolk in the jurisdiction which, on
the material presently before me, would be the less convenient jurisdiction.
<P>

43   	Reference was also made to the majority decision, (Dawson,
Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ) in <b>CSR Limited v Cigna
Insurance Australia Limited &amp; Ors</b> (1997) 189 CLR 345 at p.399.  Their
Honours referred to <b>Henry</b> and observed that in <b>Henry</b> the parties
were identical and the same subject matter was involved.  They stated that
there was not, in <b>Cigna</b>, "the same correspondence of subject matter".
Their Honours considered that if the question whether New South Wales is a
clearly
inappropriate forum were to be answered solely by reference to the
issues involved in the New South Wales proceedings, there would
be strong
considerations pointing in favour of the view that it is not.  After setting
forth various reasons for coming to that conclusion
their Honours said, at
pp.400-401:-
<P>

<b>"In cases such as the present, where different issues are involved in the
local and foreign proceedings, albeit that the different
proceedings arise out
of the same sub-stratum of fact, the question is not whether the Australian
Court is a clearly inappropriate
forum for the litigation of the issues
involved in the Australian proceedings.  Rather, the question must be whether,
having regard
to the controversy as a whole, the Australian proceedings are
vexatious or oppressive in the <i>Voth</i> sense of those terms, namely, that
they are `productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment' or
`seriously and unfairly
burdensome, prejudicial or damaging'."</b>
<P>

44   	I should note that all parties expressly disavowed any
submission that the proceedings in either this Court or the United
States
District Court were brought for any improper motive or purpose.
<P>

45   	It seems to me, with respect, that in applying this
portion of the decision in <b>Cigna</b>, upon which Mr Horgan relied, the
answer may well be that as between Kirby, on the one hand, and ICC and Hamburg
Sud, on the other,
any Court other than this Court would be clearly
inappropriate within the meaning of the <b>Voth</b> test because the parties,
by their contract, have invested this Court alone with jurisdiction.  On the
other hand the view may well
be taken that as between Kirby, on the one hand,
and Norfolk, on the other, it would have been oppressive, within the
<b>Voth</b> test, for Kirby to have instituted proceedings against Norfolk in
this Court.  It may be that it is oppressive, within the <b>Voth</b> test, for
ICC and Hamburg Sud to have instituted proceedings in this Court against
Norfolk.  I say nothing more about that because
the matter was not finally
argued and I can hardly think that Hamburg Sud would have joined in an
application to stay its own proceedings,
and adopted the submissions of Norfolk
to bring about the same result.  It seems to me that ICC and Hamburg Sud must
have had in
mind that their stance would only affect the right of Kirby to
proceed, and thus bring to an end their involvement.
<P>

46   	The complaint about an inconvenient forum, if there be a
legitimate complaint about that, is as between ICC and Hamburg Sud,
on the one
hand, and Norfolk on the other.  No such complaint arises, at the suit of
Norfolk, against Kirby.  A consequence of the
comments I have made is that it
may well be that the appropriate relief to be sought by Norfolk in this Court
is that it is not the
convenient forum for the disposition of the proceedings
between it, on the one hand, and ICC and Hamburg Sud, on the other.  It may
also be that so far as Norfolk is concerned the appropriate relief to be sought
by it in the United States is an order restraining
ICC and Hamburg Sud from
proceeding against it in this jurisdiction.  A decision whether this is the
appropriate course is one for
the parties' legal advisers.  In so far as I have
made comments about it, I have done so for the purpose of deciding the present
Notices of Motion.  If any such application is made it will have to be
determined on all the evidence and submissions.  In the absence
of such
applications joining both Hamburg Sud or ICC, or either of them, as
respondents, I do not propose to make orders against
them.  If I were to have
acted on the concessions I would have stayed until the determination of the
United States District Court
proceedings all claims (including cross-claims)
made by ICC and Hamburg Sud against Norfolk in proceedings 15 and 17 of 1998.
If
those are the orders those parties want, I will deal with the matter either
by consent or pursuant to a Notice of Motion which makes
the claim for that
relief clear.
<P>

47   	It is, of course, no part of my function to pre-empt the
decision of the United States District Court, and I do not seek to
do so.  I
will content myself by saying that it may, at least on the material before me
and in the way in which the matter was argued
before me, seem a somewhat
strange result if the United States District Court were to hold that Kirby
could not proceed against ICC
and Hamburg Sud in this Court when, in fact,
Kirby is not seeking any relief against Norfolk in this Court and, at the risk
of some
repetition, can only seek relief against ICC and Hamburg Sud in it.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

48   	In the result I have come to the conclusion that the only
substantive relief pressed in the Notices of Motion, being that
set forth in
paragraph 2 thereof, against Kirby should be refused.  Kirby should be allowed
to proceed with its litigation against
the parties it has chosen to sue.  In
referring to the only substantive relief I am not to be taken as overlooking
the third order
sought, but I can see no utility in making the general order
sought in paragraph 3.  I do not consider, as the motions are presently
constituted, that I should make any orders against ICC and Hamburg Sud.
<P>

49   	For all these reasons I am of the view that the Notices of
Motion must be dismissed with costs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

50   	In proceedings 15 of 1998 and 17 of 1998 I order that:-
<P>

(a)	the Notices of Motion filed on 13 May 1999 be dismissed; 
<P>

(b)	Norfolk and Hamburg Sud pay Kirby's costs of the Notices of Motion.  I make
no order in respect of ICC's costs; and
<P>

(c)	Exhibits be returned.
