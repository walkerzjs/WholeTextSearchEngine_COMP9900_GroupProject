<b>50268/95 - CURRABUBULA HOLDINGS PTY LTD &amp; PAOLA HOLDINGS PTY LTD V STATE
BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>	The Proceedings</b>
<P>

1	These proceedings concern an 8.5 million dollar multi-option banking facility
(`the facility') provided by the State Bank of New
South Wales Limited (`the
Bank') to companies associated with Mr Anthony Paola and his wife, Mrs Lynette
Paola.  The plaintiffs are
Paola Holdings Pty Limited (`Paola Holdings') and
Currabubula Holdings Pty Limited (`Currabubula' or Currabubula Holdings').  The
borrowers identified in the facility letter dated 1 February 1990 from the Bank
addressed to the plaintiffs were Paola Holdings;
 ABE Holdings Limited (`ABE
Holdings'),  ABE Telecommunications Pty Limited (`ABE Telecommunications'), ABE
Fax Pty Limited (receivers
and managers appointed) (`ABE Fax'), ABE Travel
Service Pty Limited (`ABE Travel'), ABE Jet Charter Pty Limited (`ABE Jet'),
Currabubula
Holdings, Campbell Rixon and Graham Pty Limited (`Campbell Rixon'),
Northern Rural Services Pty Limited (`NRS'), Franxton Pty Limited
(`Franxton')
and Pyojit Pty Limited (`Pyojit').  For convenience the companies will together
be referred to as `the Paola Group Companies'
or as `the Group'.
<P>

2	The proceedings were commenced on 23 December 1995 by Currabubula Holdings as
sole plaintiff.
<P>

3	Limitation questions and questions as to the standing of the plaintiffs to
bring the proceedings as representing Paola Group Companies
otherwise than the
plaintiffs, are included in the issues for determination.  By a judgment dated
29 September 1997, Hunter J granted
leave to amend the summons to permit Paola
Holdings to be joined as second plaintiff.  It is convenient in outlining the
issues raised
by the pleadings to leave these questions for later
consideration.
<P>

4	Essentially, the dispute concerns whether the Bank breached the terms of the
facility by its conduct on and after mid-February
1990, following meetings and
communications by the Group to the Bank of 12 and 13 February 1990, inter alia,
proposing that the Bank
place ABE Holdings into receivership.  The Bank,
without prior notice, informed the Group that it had `frozen' all current
accounts
operated by Group Companies and that no further drawings would be
allowed on the accounts.  A number of cheques were dishonoured.
 The detail of
these events which necessarily require to be viewed in context against the
history of the banker/customer relationship,
will be referred to below.
<P>

5	The plaintiffs also claim that the Bank is estopped from contending that it
had a legal right to freeze the facilities following
precontractual
representations.
<P>

6	Other issues include the effect of the Bank sending out bank statements to
members of the Group with the words `in liq' appearing
upon the bank
statements.  The sending of the statements is relied upon in the plaintiffs'
contract case as `an essential part of
the Bank's communication of the freezing
decision'.  [Plaintiffs' submissions in reply, paragraph 22]  The statements
with the `in
liq' notations form the basis of the cause of action in defamation
pursued by Currabubula.  An issue also arises as to whether the
Bank is
entitled to rely upon a Deed of Release entered into on or about 6 September
1990 as extinguishing any antecedent liability
of the Bank to Currabubula
Holdings which may otherwise have existed.
<P>

7	The bulk of the documentary tender was admitted as Exhibit PX.  It is
convenient to refer to that material as for example `PX
1/1' being a reference
to Exhibit PX Volume  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Page%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Page 1.</a>  Likewise `PX 1000' is reference to Exhibit PX
at page 1000.
<P>

	<b>Outline of the Plaintiffs' Contentions and the Bank's Defence</b>
<P>

8	The following is a broad outline of the plaintiffs' contentions and the
Bank's defence.  It is not intended to repeat every word
of the detailed
pleadings.
<P>

	<b>Cause of Action for Breach of Facility Agreement</b>
<P>

9	Paragraphs 2 through to 31 inclusive of the Plaintiffs' contentions contain a
cause of action pleaded by Currabubula Holdings
for breach of the facility
agreement.  (I interpolate that in paragraph 27A, Currabubula pleads that it,
in the alternative, brings
the proceedings as representing all Paola Group
Companies and/or for itself and as trustee for all Paola Group Companies).
<P>

10	The facility agreement is pleaded as in writing and the terms are said to be
set out in the letter from the Bank addressed to
Paola Holdings and to
Currabubula Holdings dated 1 February 1990.  That letter is in turn said to
incorporate terms set out in earlier
letters from the Bank addressed to Paola
Holdings dated 4 September 1987 and 18 November 1988, except to the extent that
the provisions
in the letter of 1 February 1990 were inconsistent with those
earlier letters.
<P>

11	The plaintiffs' case is that the agreement was entered into between the Bank
and the companies earlier referred to, which in
the summons are together called
`the Paola Group of Companies'.
<P>

12	The Bank's pleading accepts that there was what is termed a `Credit
Agreement' between the parties, constituted by the three
letters.  The Bank,
however, asserts that there was a `Final Arrangement' whereby there would be a
new facility agreement with only
one company in the group.  The Bank puts that
the agreement was conditional upon the Paola Group Companies appointing one
company
to enter into a new facility agreement with the Bank, upon the facility
agreement being executed by the Bank and by the company to
be appointed by the
Group for that purpose, and upon Mr and Mrs Paola executing guarantees of the
obligations of the company to the
Bank in the new agreement.  The Bank asserts
that these conditions were not fulfilled and in consequence, asserts that the
Final
Arrangement did not come into operation.
<P>

13	Paragraph 3 of the plaintiffs' contentions set out the terms alleged to be
part of the facility agreement.  These terms are set
out below.  In each case
the Bank's pleaded response is set out.:
<P>

	(a)	That the Bank would increase the existing multi-option facility provided
to the Group from $6.8million to $8.5million.  The
Bank agrees that it was a
term that there would be such an increase but alleges that it `promised to
increase the individual credit
facilities available to <u>some</u> of the
relevant Paola Group Companies'.
<P>

	(b)	That the Bank would provide the financial accommodation totalling not more
than $8.5million to such of the Paola Group Companies
and in such a amounts and
in such forms (whether commercial bill acceptance/discount or overdraft limit
or fixed and floating rate
term loans or documentary letter of credit) as was
requested of it by the Paola Group Companies.  The Bank admits this agreement
but says that it was subject to the occurrence of the conditions earlier
referred to that were never fulfilled and asserts that for
this reason, the
terms never became operative.
<P>

	(c)	That the $8.5million multi-option facility would be available for so long
as was desired by the Paola Group Companies subject
only to four limitations
set out in sub-paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) below.  The Bank denies this
allegation.
<P>

	(d)	That the multi-option facility was to reduce to $7.5million by 31 May
1990.  The Bank admits this allegation.
<P>

	(e)	That the multi-option facility was subject to a review immediately
financial accounts for the Paola Group Companies for the
half year ended 31
December 1989 became available, such review to be completed by 31 March 1990.
The Bank admits this allegation.
<P>

	(f)	That an immediate review was to be conducted in the event of a material
adverse change in the financial condition of any of
the Paola Group Companies.
The Bank admits this allegation.
<P>

	(g)	That the defendant was entitled by notice in writing to the Paola Group
Companies to declare that the facilities may be cancelled
forthwith and/or to
declare the facilities immediately due and payable together with all interest
accrued thereon and all other amounts
payable thereunder if any of eight events
of default specified in the letter of 4 September 1987 occurred and were
continuing (the
last of which events was any circumstances arising which give
reasonable ground in the opinion of the Bank that there has been a
material
adverse change in the financial condition of the Paola Group Companies).  The
Bank admits this allegation.
<P>

	(h)	That the Paola Group of Companies promised to pay the fees specified in
the letter of 1 February 1990 and the Bank's legal
fees.  The Bank admits this
allegation.
<P>

	(i)	That each of the Paola Group Companies (other than ABE Fax and Automated
Business Equipment Pty Limited) agreed to be responsible
to the Bank for a
payment of all moneys advanced to any of the Paola Group Companies under the
Facility Agreement.  The Bank admits
this allegation.
<P>

	(j)	That the Paola Group Companies promised to provide securities already in
place which were specified in the annexure to the
1 February 1990 letter.  The
Bank admits this allegation.
<P>

14	The plaintiffs rely upon four related implied terms which are put as
confining the powers of the Bank in the conduct of the reviews
provided for by
the agreement.  The Bank denies that such terms can be implied.  The suggested
terms to be implied are pleaded by
the plaintiffs as follows:
<P>

	<i>`On the proper construction of the facility agreement, if circumstances
arose entitling a review of the facility, in the carrying
out of the
review:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the Defendant was not entitled unilaterally to vary any of the terms of
the Facility Agreement and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the Defendant was not entitled to declare that the facilities may be
cancelled forthwith or declare the facilities immediately
due and payable
unless an event of default under the letter of 4 September 1987 was
established;</i>
<P>

<i>	Alternatively,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the Defendant was not entitled unilaterally to vary any of the terms of
the Facility Agreement unless the variation was fair
and reasonable between the
parties;</i>
<P>

<i>	Alternatively,</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the Defendant was obliged to give the Paola Group Companies reasonable
notice of any intention to vary any of the terms of the
Facility
Agreement.'</i>
<P>

15	Factual issues arise in relation to sub-paragraphs 5 and 6 of the notice of
contentions as to the balance of the facility as
at 11 and 12 February 1990.
<P>

16	Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the summons plead as follows:
<P>

	<i>`5.	In performance of the Facility Agreement, as of 11 February
1990:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	The Defendant had provided accommodation to the Paola Group Companies
by way of overdraft limit and other facilities totalling
$8,335,507.23.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The Paola Group Companies had provided securities to the Defendant as
required in the annexure to the letter of 1 February 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	On 12 February 1990 the Defendant honoured further cheques drawn on the
accounts of the Paola Group Companies such that the total
accommodation
provided by the Defendant by way of overdraft limit and other facilities was
$8,518,348.43.'</i>
<P>

17	Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the amended defence plead in response:
<P>

	<i>`5.	As to paragraph C5 of the further amended summons, the
defendant:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	admits that the total drawings on overdraft accounts held by the
various companies within the Paola Group as disclosed by the
Bank Statements in
respect of such accounts as at 11 February 1990 amounted to $8,335,507.23
(subject to funds deposited to those
accounts which were not cleared funds at
that time subsequently becoming cleared) but otherwise does not admit
sub-paragraph (a);</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	admits that the pre-existing securities referred to in the annexure to
the letter of 1 February 1990 from the defendant to the
plaintiff remained in
place as at 11 February 1990, but otherwise does not admit sub-paragraph (b);
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	denies that the additional accommodation referred to in sub-paragraph
(a) of the further amended summons, or the securities referred
to in
sub-paragraph (b), were provided in performance of the Facility Agreement and
says that the additional accommodation was provided
in anticipation of the
Final Arrangement and the securities were pre-existing and continuing.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	The defendant admits that the total drawings on overdraft accounts held
by the various companies within the Paola Group as disclosed
by the Bank
Statements in respect of such accounts as at 12 February 1990 amounted to
$8,518,348.43 (subject to funds deposited to
those accounts which were not
cleared funds at that time subsequently becoming cleared) but otherwise does
not admit paragraph C6
of the further amended summons.'</i>
<P>

18	Paragraph 7 introduces important allegations in terms of the overall issues
about the communications to the Bank by the Paola
Group Companies on or about
13 February 1990.
<P>

19	The plaintiffs there plead that on 13 February 1990 the Paola Group
Companies communicated to the defendant:
<P>

	(a)	The information contained in a letter from ABE Holdings to the defendant
dated 13 February 1990.
<P>

	(b)	The information contained in a letter from Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co to the
defendant dated 13 February 1990.
<P>

	(c)	Oral communications from Mr Tony Paola on behalf of the Paola Group
Companies to the defendant to the effect that it was proposed
that the
defendant place ABE Holdings Pty Limited into receivership, but that if the
defendant chose not to do so Currabubula Holdings
would continue to give ABE
Holdings Pty Limited sufficient support to meet its debts.
<P>

20	No issue is raised as to the receipt on 13 February 1990 of the 13 February
1990 letters by the Bank.
<P>

21	An issue is however raised in relation to the alleged oral communications by
Mr Paola to the Bank.  The Bank does not admit that
such communications
occurred.  The issue is significant in terms of the proceedings as the
plaintiffs allege that Mr Paola indicated
to the Bank that if the Bank did not
consent to the proposal, then Currabubula Holdings would `continue to provide'
financial support
to ABE Holdings sufficient to enable that company to pay its
debts.  The nature of such support said to have been earlier provided,
is dealt
with below.
<P>

22	Paragraph 8 pleads that the substance of the information contained in the
two 13th February 1990 letters was known to the Bank
prior to 13 February 1990.
The Bank denies that it had this information save that it asserts that it was
aware of concerns that creditors
of ABE Fax might seek recourse from ABE
Holdings.
<P>

23	The Bank does not admit the further allegation pleaded in paragraph 7 that
even after receiving the letters it formed the view
that the Paola Group
Companies were still solvent.  It does however concede that at all material
times it had the view that there
was sufficient security for the indebtedness
of the Group to ensure that the Bank would be repaid.
<P>

24	An issue arises as to whether the events set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 of
the notice of contentions, alone or in combination,
amounted to a `material
adverse change' in the financial condition of ABE Holdings or to circumstances
giving reasonable grounds
for the formation of an opinion by the Bank that
there had been a material adverse change in the financial condition of the
Group.
<P>

25	The plaintiffs then plead a number of alleged breaches of the facility
agreement.  Put shortly, the breaches alleged are:
<P>

	.	The advice in the Bank's letter of 15 February 1990 [`the freezing letter']
that all current accounts operated by Group Companies
were `frozen', and that
no further drawings would be allowed on these accounts.
<P>

	[The case was conducted on the basis that the Bank on 15 February in fact also
communicated the advice that the accounts had been
frozen by facsimile to
managers of the Group's several branches.  Hence references in the Judgment to
the `freezing letter' should
be taken to embrace both sets of
communications.]
<P>

	[Until June 1992, when the facilities were repaid, the Bank is said to have
continued to `freeze' the accounts and not to have
permitted any drawings
thereon.]
<P>

	.	The dishonour, by the Bank, of the cheques listed in the first part of
Schedule 1 to the summons, which are said to have been
presented on 15 February
1990.  The Bank admits that it dishonoured these cheques.
<P>

	[The plaintiffs assert that honouring `all or some' of the cheques would not
have led to the facilities exceeding $8,518,348.43
or $8.5million.  It is
further alleged that as at the close of business on 16 February 1990, the
proper figure for this facility
provided by the Bank was $8,482.747.70 and that
from 16 February to 31 May 1990 the total amount advanced did not exceed
$8.5million.
 In its defence, the Bank takes issue with the proper balance for
the accounts relying upon the failure of the plaintiffs' figures
to take into
account cheques banked to the various accounts where the funds had not yet
cleared.]
<P>

	.	The dishonour by the Bank of cheques listed in the second part of Schedule 1
as being presented on and after 16 February 1990.
 The Bank admits that it
failed to pay from the number one accounts upon which they were drawn such
cheques, but does not admit that
this constituted dishonouring the cheques.
<P>

	.	The refusal by the Bank to permit Currabubula Holdings to take $390,000 from
the proceeds of sale of Durhambone East in late
1990.  This is alleged as a
discrete breach in paragraph 25 of the contentions.  This failure is said to be
a breach of the promise
to provide accommodation pleaded in paragraph 3(b) of
the contentions and the promise that the facility would be available as long
as
the Group desired - paragraph 3(c).
<P>

26	The issue therefore raised, is whether or not the freezing of the accounts
was a breach of contract by the Bank.  The plaintiffs'
case is expounded in
paragraph 24 of the contentions.  Critically the plaintiffs assert that:
<P>

	(a)	There was no exercise of the right of review and no such right had arisen
in any event.
<P>

	(b)	No notice was given.
<P>

	(c)	There had been no event of default as defined in the 4 September 1987
facility letter.
<P>

	(d)	The Bank was not in a position where it could declare the facilities to be
cancelled and/or declare them to be immediately
repayable.
<P>

	(e)	In any event, the Bank did not even purport to cancel the facilities.
<P>

27	The Bank denies that its actions constituted a withdrawal of the facility.
It's stance is that it was not obliged to grant further
credit to the
plaintiffs beyond the credit limit established by the facility.  It asserts
that its actions were no more than a conventional
response to a situation in
which a customer notifies a Bank that it is insolvent, or as in this case, that
one or more company members
within the group is/are insolvent.  The Bank points
out that it agreed to the opening of Number Two accounts to be operated in
credit
and to a notional set-off of credit balances in the Number Two accounts
against debit balances in the `frozen' Number One accounts.
 Hence the Bank
asserts that it's action did not impact adversely upon the plaintiffs whose
obligations under the facility agreement
to pay interest were not, in the
result, varied.
<P>

28	In the alternative and if the February 1990 actions of the Bank amounted to
a withdrawal of the facility, the Bank asserts that
a term of the Credit
Agreement entitled the Bank to withdraw the facility upon the occurrence of a
material adverse change in the
financial condition of any of the companies in
the Paola Group.  The Bank asserts that such an adverse change took place in
the financial
condition of ABE Holdings when:
<P>

	(a)	that company admitted in its letter to the Bank of 13 February 1990 and in
the letter of the same date from its financial adviser,
Ferrier Hodgson &amp;
Co to the Bank, that it was unable to pay its debts as they fell due;
<P>

	(b)	the Statement of Position accompanying the Ferrier Hodgson letter stated
that the operating businesses of NRS and Campbell
Rixon had no value.
<P>

	[Defence paragraph 39G]
<P>

29	The question of the relevance in these proceedings of the Bank's assertion
that events of default had taken place, should be
made clear.  The Bank's
central submission is that its conduct in the matter of sending the so-called
`freezing letter' on 15 February,
did not amount to a cancellation or
withdrawal of the facilities.  It is only if that submission is not accepted
and if the letter
is held to have constituted a termination or withdrawal of
the facility, that questions of events of default are raised by the Bank.
 In
short, if contrary to the Bank's central submission, the sending by the Bank of
the 15th February letter constituted a termination
or withdrawal of the
facility, then the Bank submits that its actions were justified and that events
of default having on the Bank's
case occurred, the `freezing letter' should be
regarded as an exercise by the Bank of its right, by notice, to declare the
facilities
as cancelled.  A considerable part of the hearing was concerned with
evidence primarily concerned with the event of default issue
which inter alia,
raises questions as to the subjective states of mind of Bank officers at
material dates.
<P>

30	The plaintiffs addressed submissions in support of the proposition that
after 15 February the Bank's conduct constituted an affirmation
of the
facility, such that on <i>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20131%20CLR%20634" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 131 CLR 634</a>
grounds, the Bank could not thereafter rely upon the occurrence of the earlier
events of default.  The plaintiffs appear to have
regarded the Bank's case of
the happening of events of default as asserting that, on a day by day basis
after 15 February, there
were continuing events of default, such that the Bank
sought in some way to rely upon the continued occurrence of those events of
default, as a means of minimising the plaintiffs' entitlement to claim for loss
or damage suffered to the plaintiffs by reason of
the suggested repudiation of
the facility by the plaintiffs.  This was not however how Mr Macfarlan QC put
the Bank's position in
relation to the events of default issue.
<P>

31	Mr Macfarlan did however make plain that a continued relevance of the Bank's
perception that events of default had been committed
or may have been
committed, is that it was for this reason that the Bank became concerned at the
financial position of the companies
and adopted its attitude in the middle of
1990 concerning the sale of Durhambone.
<P>

32	The `event of default' question thus arises only in the event that the Court
would, contrary to the submissions of <u>both</u> parties, hold that the
so-called `freezing letter' constituted a termination of the facility.
<P>

	<b>Estoppel Claim</b>
<P>

33	The plaintiffs submit that prior to entering into the facility agreement,
officers of the Bank represented to Mr Paola on behalf
of the Paola Group
Companies (or alternatively Currabubula Holdings) that the Bank would not
exercise any legal rights to withdraw
the facility prior to giving the Group or
Currabubula Holdings reasonable notice of its intention to exercise such rights
so that
the Group (or Currabubula Holdings) could refinance the liabilities to
the defendant with another banking entity.
<P>

34	The plaintiffs plead reliance to their detriment upon the representations in
entering into the agreement; that the facilities
were frozen without notice and
without the provision of a reasonable opportunity to refinance, and that the
Bank is estopped from
contending that it had a legal right to freeze the
account.
<P>

35	The Bank denies the representations and the estoppel.
<P>

	<b>Defamation Claim</b>
<P>

36	The plaintiffs plead that bank statements were sent by facsimile machine to
Currabubula Holdings and other Paola Group Companies
bearing the words `in
liq'.  Schedule 2 to the summons [corrected in accordance with letter dated 12
March 1999 from Gadens Lawyers
to my Associate and copied to Mallesons Stephen
Jaques which I mark for identification `SCH2'].provides particulars as to the
statements
and as to those to whom the statements are said to have been sent.
They are:
<P>

	(a)	To NRS on nine occasions between 16 February 1990 and 21 March 1990.
<P>

	(b)	To Currabubula Holdings on seven occasions between 21 February 1990 and 28
March 1990.
<P>

	(c)	To ABE Holdings on 21 February 1990.
<P>

	(d)	To Pyojit on 15 and 22 February 1990.
<P>

37	The plaintiffs plead that the natural and ordinary meaning of the Bank's use
of the words conveyed imputations which were defamatory
of Currabubula
Holdings, namely that Currabubula Holdings was insolvent and that a liquidator
had been appointed to Currabubula Holdings.
<P>

38	The plaintiffs then plead that Currabubula Holdings suffered loss of
business reputation, loss of cash flow and dividend income
and a reduction in
the value of its shareholding in Paola Holdings.
<P>

	<b>Damages</b>
<P>

39	A number of issues are raised in relation to damages.
<P>

40	The plaintiffs assert loss to have been suffered by the Paola Group
Companies and assert there to be seven heads of loss:
<P>

	(i)	Loss of the opportunity to refinance the debt without there being any
interruption to the business or trade of the Group.
<P>

	(ii)	Losses caused by the `fire sale' of the business of NRS, with the
business being hampered by the requirement to operate on
a `cash sale only'
basis.
<P>

	(iii)	Loss caused by the `fire sale' of Durhambone East in September 1990.
<P>

	(iv)	Loss caused by the sale of the Gabo property by Currabubula Holdings in
November 1991 at an undervalue;  but for the breach
by the Bank, the plaintiffs
assert that this property would have not had to be sold.
<P>

	(v)	Interest charges that would not have been incurred but for the Bank's
alleged breaches.
<P>

	(vi)	Loss said to be suffered by the inability of the Paola Group to acquire
the shares in U-Bix N.Z. Limited.  The shares are
said to have been shares
which were to have been acquired by a New Zealand company, Leman Enterprises
Pty Limited (`Leman Enterprises'),
owned as to 99 shares by Paola Holdings and
as to the remaining share by Currabubula Holdings.
<P>

	(vii)	As a further or alternative head of loss, the Paola Group claims for
approximately $1.1million raised by a mortgage on the
property `Currabubula
Station' in about June 1992 to pay out the balance of the debt to the Bank,
which otherwise would have been
paid out already.
<P>

	<b>Deed of Release</b>
<P>

41	Currabubula Holdings on or about 6 September 1990, executed a Deed of
Release with the Bank.  Currabubula Holdings' case is that
the Deed was brought
about by duress and illegitimate pressure of the Bank and is voidable.
Currabubula then asserts that it has
avoided the Deed.  These allegations are
denied by the Bank.
<P>

	<b>Additional Issues Raised by the Bank's Defence</b>
<P>

42	In addition to its various denials and non-admissions, the Bank has raised
the following defences:
<P>

	(a)	It pleads the terms of the agreement entitling it to `cancel the facility'
and seek repayment of moneys outstanding.
<P>

	(b)	It asserts that ABE Holdings admitted on 13 February 1990 that it was
unable to pay its debts as they fell due.
<P>

	(c)	It asserts that Paola made the same admission on the same date in the
`Statement of Position' document.
<P>

	(d)	The consequence of the above is said by the Bank to be that the Bank was
entitled to cancel the facility and call for repayment.
<P>

	(e)	Additionally, the Bank pleads that circumstances arose, impliedly on 13
February 1990, which gave reasonable grounds in the
opinion of the Bank that
there had been a material change in the financial condition of ABE Holdings and
that the Bank was thereupon
entitled to cancel the facility.
<P>

	(f)	Similar circumstances allegations are made for Paola and for the Paola
Group.
<P>

	(g)	The Bank seeks to make a case on alleged breaches of the representations
and warranties said to be found in the Bank's letter
of 1 February 1990, which
are said to have `repeated' the representations and warranties made in the
Bank's letter of 4 September
1987.
<P>

	(h)	The Bank alleges that through a combination of events, being those set out
in paragraph 40 through to 42 of the defence, the
Bank would, in any event, not
have caused any loss to the plaintiffs since the plaintiffs would have had to
sell the business of
NRS, Gabo and Durhambone.
<P>

	(i)	Finally, the Bank relies upon the Deed of 6 September 1990.
<P>

	<b>The Plaintiffs' Amended Reply</b>
<P>

43	The plaintiffs, by amended reply, plead:
<P>

	(1)	That the conditions relied upon by the Bank were severable from the
facility agreement and should be severed.
<P>

	(2)	That the Bank cannot rely upon the conditions.
<P>

	(3)	That the Bank was at all times aware that creditors of ABE Fax might seek
recourse against ABE Holdings.
<P>

	(4)	That the Bank had not formed any relevant opinion for the operation of the
matter relied upon in the defence at paragraph 38(c)
[circumstances said to
have arisen giving reasonable grounds in the opinion of the Bank that there had
been a material adverse change
in the financial condition of any of the Paola
Group Companies].
<P>

	(5)	That the warranties and representations were true when made.
<P>

	(6)	That the Bank at all times possessed sufficient information to form a view
as to the solvency of Paola, ABE Holdings and the
companies in the Group.
<P>

	<b>Limitation and Standing Questions</b>
<P>

44	As already indicated, these issues will be addressed in detail below.
<P>

	<b>Live issues for determination - Liability</b>
<P>

45	On the plaintiffs' submissions, the central issues for determination by the
Court with respect to liability are as follows:
<P>

	I.	Whether the Bank's conduct in `freezing' the Group's accounts on 15
February 1998 amounted to a breach of contract.
<P>

	II.	Whether the Bank's failure to pay the cheques listed in Schedule `1' to
the further amended summons constituted dishonour of
the same and, if so,
whether such dishonour amounted to a breach of contract.
<P>

	III.	Whether the Bank was entitled to cancel or terminate the Facility
Agreement by virtue of the existence of an event of default
being the alleged
admission of insolvency of ABE Holdings and/or Paola Holdings at the meeting on
12 February 1990 and in the correspondence
dated 13 February 1990 from ABE
Holdings and Ferrier Hodgson to the Bank.
<P>

	IV.	If so, it being accepted by the parties that the Facility Agreement was
never cancelled or terminated by the Bank, what flows
from any such
entitlement.
<P>

	V.	Whether the Bank was entitled to cancel or terminate the facility, on or
about 12 February 1990 by virtue of there having been
a material adverse change
in the affairs of the borrowers - either by virtue of such change being an
event of default under the 4
September 1987 letter or pursuant to the right of
review of the facility enjoyed by the Bank.
<P>

	VI.	Whether it was necessary for the Bank, in order to be able to rely on any
such adverse change, to form any opinion that the
borrowers, or one or more of
them, had suffered such a change in their financial affairs.
<P>

	VII.	If so, whether the Bank formed such an opinion at relevant times.
<P>

	VIII.	If the Bank had any entitlement to cancel or terminate the facility
whether it waived such right or elected not to pursue
it.
<P>

	IX.	Whether, at 15 February 1990, there had been a breach of warranty by the
borrowers within the meaning of the 4 September 1987
letter with respect to any
of the `representations and warranties' therein contained.
<P>

	X.	If so, what flows from that.
<P>

	XI.	What if anything, is the consequence for the respective plaintiff's cases
in damages against the Bank, of any entitlement by
the Bank, on 15 February
1990 to terminate the facility.
<P>

	XII.	The effect of the Bank sending out bank statements to members of the
group with the words `in liq' on them, both in terms
of the plaintiffs'
defamation case and in terms of the breach of contract alleged.
<P>

	XIII.	The proper construction of the deed of release entered into between the
Bank and Currabubula on 6 September 1990.
<P>

	XIV.	Whether the Bank is precluded from reliance upon the deed of release by
virtue of economic duress worked upon Currabubula.
<P>

	XV.	Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to prosecute the action in the absence
of all the borrowers as defined in the 1 February
1990 letter.
<P>

	XVI.	Whether, in relation to causes of action alleged by Paola, such causes of
action are statute barred in any event.
<P>

	XVII.	Whether the Bank is estopped, arising from conversations between Mr
Paola, Mr Brennan, Mr Tansley and Mr Swinburne, from
asserting that it had a
right to withdraw the facilities without notice.
<P>

	<b>Witnesses</b>
<P>

46	It is appropriate before dealing with the detailed facts to identify the
relevant witnesses and then to deal with the Court's
assessment of their
respective reliability.
<P>

	<b>Mr Alan Booth and the Hierarchy Within the Bank</b>
<P>

47	Mr Alan Booth joined the Bank as an Account Manager (`account manager') in
January 1986 and in about July 1988 became the account
manager responsible for
the Paola Account.  He was responsible for most aspects of the administration
of the account of the Group
and reported to Mr Swinburne, his immediate
superior.  Mr Swinburne was, in 1989, a senior manager within the Corporate and
Financial
Institutions Division, later called the Corporate Finance Group
(`corporate/financial institutions division') of the Bank.  [T 446.15]
 Mr
Booth also worked with Mr Ken Owens another Account Manager who was involved in
the administration of the account at relevant
times and who also reported to Mr
Swinburne.  Mr Swinburne in turn reported to Mr Peter Brennan or Mr Peter
McClennan who were chief
managers of the corporate/financial institutions
division and who occupied a like level in the hierarchy.
<P>

48	Mr Booth was effectively in day to day contact with representatives of the
Group at material times and attended the meeting of
12 February 1990 referred
to below.
<P>

49	Mr Booth completed a Bachelor of Business at the University of Technology in
1979 and completed a Master of Business Administration
Degree with the
University of New South Wales, graduating in 1986.  That Degree was obtained
through the Australian Graduate School
of Management within the University of
New South Wales.
<P>

50	At the time he completed his MBA he regarded himself as qualified to
undertake financial analysis of company financial statements,
cash flows and
the like.
<P>

51	He had never received any specific training in relation to dealing with
rural accounts of the Bank.
<P>

52	He saw it as part of his responsibility to familiarise himself as accounting
manager for the Paola Group in July 1988 with the
standing operating
instructions of the Bank and in particular in relation to matters within his
area.  [T 403]
<P>

	<b>Mr Mark Bryant and Mr Brendan Halligan</b>
<P>

53	Mr Bryant is a partner in Arthur Anderson who has, since 1975, been involved
in auditing investigations and advising on accounting
and financial reporting
issues.  He is the partner for the world wide auditor of one of Australia's
largest multi-national companies.
 Since 1985, he has specialised in
accounting, valuation and other business issues in litigation and other
disputes.  He is the partner
in charge of Arthur Anderson's litigation services
group in Sydney and the Asia Pacific Region.
<P>

54	Mr Brendan Halligan is a Senior Manager in the litigation services practice
of Arthur Anderson Sydney office with professional
experience in the valuation
of businesses and shareholdings, the administration of corporate and personal
insolvencies and the financial
investigations of distressed businesses.
<P>

55	Mr Bryant and Mr Halligan prepared reports on the instructions of the
defendant which were admitted into evidence.
<P>

	<b>Mr David Diamond</b>
<P>

56	Mr Diamond is a chartered accountant, having practiced predominantly in the
areas of insolvency and corporate reconstruction
since 1983.  Between 1983 and
1985 he was with Deloitte Haskins and Sells and from 1985 through to 1996 with
Ferrier Hodgson.
<P>

57	In about October 1989, he was a director of Ferrier Hodgson and of its
offshoot company National Consulting Group Pty Limited
when he received
instructions from the directors of ABE Fax, per medium of Mr Paola, through the
Company's external accountants Williams
Hatchman and Keane.  At the time he was
asked to review the position of ABE Fax prior to the appointment of a receiver
to that Company.
 He prepared that report, following which a receiver and
manager was appointed to ABE Fax in early November 1989.
<P>

58	At that time, his involvement was limited to the receivership of ABE Fax and
he did not involve himself in the affairs or financial
position of any other
member of the Paola Group or Currabubula Group other than to the extent that
they touched upon the affairs
of ABE Fax.
<P>

59	He was employed by the receiver and manager to conduct the receivership of
ABE Fax and prepared reports which were provided to
the State Bank in relation
to ABE Fax.
<P>

60	During the course of the receivership, he became aware that ABE Holdings had
provided guarantees in favour of ABE Fax in respect
of certain debts.  Upon the
appointment of the receiver of ABE Fax, a report as to affairs being a
Statement of Assets and Liabilities
was prepared by the directors which
included provision of the extent and nature of the contingent liabilities and
outstanding commitments
all referred to in Mr Diamond's report of 26 October
1989.
<P>

61	Mr Diamond's evidence was that the existence of any guarantee provided by
ABE Holdings or any other third party to support the
contingent liabilities of
ABE Fax was not relevant to the receivership of that company nor was it
relevant to the discharge of the
obligations of the receiver.  His evidence was
that the only relevant issue for the purpose of the receivership was the
existence
of the contingent liability owed by ABE Fax which was reported to the
Bank.  That liability would have had a bearing upon the ultimate
recovery and
realisation of assets of ABE Fax following any receivership.
<P>

62	Mr Diamond became aware of guarantees having been provided by ABE Holdings
in favour of debts due by ABE Fax some time in December
1989 through February
1990, and in early February 1990 he was asked by the officers of ABE Holdings
to assist in determining a strategy
to protect the Company and the secured
creditors in the first place from the contingent unsecured guarantee claims
flowing from ABE
Fax to ABE Holdings.  In that capacity, he became involved in
the important events of early to mid February 1990 and attended the
12 February
1990 meeting referred to below.
<P>

	<b>Ms Janet Hamblin</b>
<P>

63	Ms Hamblin commenced employment in about 1989 as an assistant to Mr Plante
who was at the time the Financial Controller of the
Paola Group of Companies.
She assisted Mr Plante in relation to the companies but was not involved in the
day to day operations.
 She and Mr Plante were located in the same offices as
NRS at Tamworth.  The office was a `reasonably open plan office' with
partitions
between offices [T 287].  Mr Paola described it as `the general
office at Northern Rural Services' [T 51].She also acted as Mr Plante's
secretary and looked after ABE Finance Pty Limited and was responsible, as Mr
Plante's assistant, for looking after the pastoral
operations which were mainly
Currabubula Holdings Operations.  She was present in mid-February 1990 in the
office when the bank statements
with the `in liq' wording were received and
when telephone calls were being received in the office relating to cheque
dishonours
and the like.

small business groups from around Australia.
<P>

68	He was a former auditor of Currabubula.
<P>

69	He gave evidence in chief to the effect that he had worked in the country
for about 15-16 years and in his capacity as an accountant,
had been involved
in giving advice to businesses in that region, that is to say the Tamworth
region and other regions, also advising
in Orange, the Central Coast and
Sydney.  He was asked in giving evidence in chief whether he had had occasion
in his 15 years of
experience in the country, to form a view about the rapidity
or otherwise with which bad news about a business travels in the countryside.
His answer was:
<P>

	<i>`Yes.  I guess when I did all my training - I started working in 1970 and I
probably trained for 25 years in Sydney.  It came as a
bit of a shock to me
when I moved to Tamworth what a small community propensity for news to travel
in a small community is . . .
 I think that is [sic] a high likelihood of bad
news travelling in the country further than and becoming known to other
businesses
and people in the community than is the case say in Sydney.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . Have you had experience where bad news about a particular business
and its financial strength is used by other competitors
in the bush in a
particular way?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Difficult to answer.  I guess there is a range of things come to mind.
I had an experience of a manager of a financial institution
sharing bad news of
a client, one of my clients was the competitor.  I have seen the experience of
a real estate agent distributing
bad news to the legal profession about a
competitor.  Generally I have experienced the apparent keenness of some people
to explain
to whoever will listed bad news of competitors or other people in
the community.  It's something that is, I think simply because
it is a smaller
community people are aware more of each other's businesses and like to talk
about it.'</i>

	<b>Mr Stenhouse/Ms Osborne</b>
<P>

80	Mr Stenhouse was the principal solicitor to the corporate/financial
institutions division.  Miss Osborne was a solicitor reporting
to Mr
Stenhouse.
<P>

	<b>Mr Garry Tansley</b>
<P>

81	During 1987 Mr Tansley was employed by the Bank as a Manager, `Corporate and
Financial Institutions' in which role he was responsible
for managing a
portfolio of commercial `pty limited' accounts.  He reported to Mr Brennan.
During 1987 and 1988 for approximately
a 12 month period, he was responsible
for the client relationship and management of the Paola Group of Companies.
<P>

	<b>Mr Ross Taylor</b>
<P>

82	Mr Taylor was a founder of the Northern Rural Services business which he
commenced in Tamworth and in respect of which he later
caused branches to be
opened in Moree, Gunnedah and Narrabri.  The business was financed from 1987 by
Mr Paola and the Paola Group
Companies.  Mr Taylor's arrangement was that he
would operate the business and Mr Paola would provide the finance and own the
company
NRS.
<P>

83	Mr Taylor was general manager of NRS from the time Mr Paola became involved
and was in charge of day to day operations for all
branches.  This involved Mr
Taylor in ordering supplies, being responsible for all sales, supervision of
staff including hiring and
firing, purchase of stock, control of debtors and
creditors and maintaining customer and supplier relationships.  Mr Taylor made
a statement on 17 October 1996 and died in December 1996.  An interlocutory
judgment dealing with objections to the admission of
Mr Taylor's statement was
handed down and sections of Mr Taylor's statement were allowed and sections
disallowed.

	<b>Mr Peter Terrey</b>
<P>

84	Mr Peter Terrey is an accountant who commenced employment with ABE Copiers
in March 1975.  He became financial accountant for
the Paola Group and the
Currabubula Holdings companies up to the beginning of 1989 when Mr Plante took
over as financial controller
of those companies.  In April 1990, Mr Terrey
again assumed the role of financial controller of the Paola Group and of the
Currabubula
Holdings companies after Mr Plante departed. There was a short
break in Mr Terrey's earlier employment from February to June 1987.
<P>

	<b>The Credit of Witnesses</b>
<P>

85	Counsel for both parties accepted, as I understood their submissions, that
as the events in question had occurred some nine years
prior to the hearing, it
could be and should be accepted that the recollections of witnesses would be
relatively imprecise.  Hence
the significance of contemporaneous documents and
the Court's concern to look at objective and common sense factors in assessing
conflicts of evidence.
<P>

86	Mr Macfarlan submitted that in relation to Mr Paola's credit, in each of the
areas where credit might be of importance, contemporaneous
documents and
objective and common sense factors would be seen as inconsistent with Mr
Paola's version of events.  The submission
was that Mr Paola, not necessarily
consciously, but at least subconsciously, has come to see the past events
relating to this case
in a perspective which favours himself and that this
colours his evidence.  The number of years passing since the occurrence of the
events leaves room, so Mr Macfarlan submitted, for distortion to a considerable
extent.
<P>

87	Mr Macfarlan did refer to the evidence given by Mr Paola in relation to the
letter from Paola Holdings to Blake Dawson Waldron
of 12 September 1990.  [PX
1614] as detracting from Mr Paola's credit.  The matter is dealt with below.
<P>

88	In my view, Mr Paola was a reliable witness with a reasonable recall of the
material events and whose memory may be relied upon
as generally accurate.
This is not to say that in every instance his evidence is accepted.  From time
to time his recollection was
successfully challenged in cross-examination.
However, those occasions were few and when matters which were inconsistent with
Mr
Paola's recollection were put to him, he immediately accepted the
propositions put to him.  I formed the view that whilst his interest
in the
case is obvious, he was at pains to do his level best to recall the events of
some nine years ago as clearly as he could.
 He was clearly affected by the
events in question which represented matters of very high moment to his
interests.  Where his evidence
is rejected, I accept that he has come to
believe that the events in respect of which his evidence is rejected in fact
occurred and/or
that the circumstances which obtained at the time were as he
has stated in giving evidence.  Save as expressly indicated in the judgment,
I
accept his evidence as accurate.
<P>

89	In relation to the evidence given by Ms Hamblin, Mr Macfarlan submitted that
the Bank had no particular problem with her credit
and sought to address no
special criticism of her having carried out her best efforts to recall
accurately the position as it obtained
at the time.  This represents my own
assessment of Ms Hamblin's evidence.  I was impressed by her demeanour in the
witness box. 
To my mind, her evidence may be accepted as reliable.  The events
of February 1990 obviously left a real impression upon her.  Her
evidence was
given clearly and in a straight forward manner.  Her recollection of the events
at the time seemed to me to be particularly
good and she seemed to be quite
sure of herself.  Taking into account the fact that she was not involved in the
day to day operations
of the Paola Group, she was still plainly able to give
reliable evidence of what had occurred at the time when the bank statements
with the `in liq' notations were received and within the next few days.
<P>

90	Mr Macfarlan addressed no particular submissions in relation to Mr Plante's
credit.
<P>

91	Mr Plante's evidence may be regarded as reliable.
<P>

92	In relation to Mr Taylor who was not able to be cross-examined, the
submission was that no weight should be given to his evidence
at all, at least
to the extent that his evidence was inconsistent with other evidence before the
Court.  Mr Macfarlan pointed out
that Mr Taylor had not in his statement
adverted anywhere to the mid-January 1990 circumstances which had led to his
resignation,
or to the directions which he had been given by Mr Paola and which
he had opposed.  He had sought, so Mr Macfarlan submitted, to
put forward a
picture of NRS having in January/February 1990, developed into a viable and
thriving business.  This was, Mr Macfarlan
submitted, inconsistent with the
evidence, and for this reason, Mr Taylor's evidence generally should be given
no weight at all,
or no weight at all at least to the extent that it was
inconsistent with other evidence.  The matter is dealt with in the Judgment.
<P>

93	In relation to the evidence given by Mr Terrey, Mr Macfarlan drew the
Court's attention to what I accept was the unwillingness
of Mr Terrey to accept
that there had been a transfer of the pastoral division from Currabubula to ABE
Holdings.  And this, notwithstanding,
Exhibit `D4' being the February 1990
minute of Meeting of Directors of ABE Holdings at which Mr Terrey attended,
which had resolved
that the pastoral operations be undertaken by Currabubula
Holdings Pty Limited from 1 July 1989 `thus rescinding the previous arrangement
that they be undertaken by ABE Holdings Limited'.  Ultimately the reliability
of Mr Terrey's evidence, save in relation to this issue,
was not seriously
challenged.  In the result, Mr Terrey's evidence is accepted as reliable, but
is not accepted on this specific
issue.  The passage of time has no doubt
clouded his recollection on this issue.
<P>

94	In relation to Mr Hardy, the plaintiffs' submissions were that Mr Hardy had
approached his reporting and the giving of evidence
from an emotional
disposition towards Mr Paola and his Group, having been associated with the
plaintiffs since the late 1980's. 
Mr Hardy, it was submitted, was not to be
seen as a disinterested expert.  The matter is dealt with in the Judgment.
<P>

95	In assessing the credit of the different Bank witnesses, the Court is
assisted to a considerable extent by the contemporaneous
banking records in
evidence.  Ultimately, there were only a few discrete areas where the credit of
bank witnesses could be said to
be in issue.  As appropriate, those matters are
dealt with in the Judgment.
<P>

	<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

<b>	January 1984 - Initial Credit Facility $4.2 million - Term of 2
Years</b>
<P>

96	In January 1984 Mr Paola, the then Managing Director and principal
shareholder of ABE Holding Limited [who held approximately
37 percent of the
capital of that company] and intended to make a takeover bid for the balance of
the outstanding shares, applied
to the bank to provide finance to enable the
acquisition to be effected.  A credit facility of $4.2million was made
available only
to Paola Holdings as borrower.  This was a bill
acceptance/discount facility for a term of two years.  The security to be
provided
comprised a registered first mortgage over Currabubula Station near
Tamworth, being a 9,000 acre property;  a registered first mortgage
over
Durhambone Station, being a 22,000 acre property at Narrabri;  a registered
second mortgage over `Orlando', being a 10,000 acre
property at Narrabri;  a
personal guarantee by Mr Paola for $4.2million;  a first ranking charge over
8.8 million shares in ABE Holdings
and a letter of comfort from Okura &amp; Co
Limited in respect of its intention to continue to distribute products
manufactured by
Konishiroku Photo Industries Co Limited to ABE Holdings [PX
pages 16-17].
<P>

97	It appears that the Bank's facility of $4.2million was utilised to allow the
acquisition by Paola Holdings of the outstanding
shares in the publicity listed
company Automated Business Equipment Limited and that upon successful takeover,
that company was delisted.
<P>

98	U-Bix Copiers N.Z. Limited (`U-Bix N.Z.') was publicly listed on the New
Zealand Stock Exchange.  A substantial shareholding
in U-Bix N.Z. was held by
ABE Holdings and ultimately sold in the late 1980's when some A$6.2 million was
utilised to reduce group
debt.
<P>

	<b>February 1984 - Come and Go Facility for Currabubula Holdings -
$250,000</b>
<P>

99	By mid-February 1984, the Bank had established a `Come and Go' overdraft
facility of $250,000 in the name of Currabubula Holdings
at the Tamworth Branch
to meet the various working capital demands of Currabubula Holdings' rural
activities.
<P>

100	Mr Booth did not know what the meaning of a `Come and Go' overdraft was and
could not recall ever reading any bank instruction
in respect of this term not
being used for overdrafts.  He recalled that the words `on demand' were
generally used with overdrafts.
 He could not recall whether or not it was his
understanding whilst he was account manager, that it was a bank instruction
that overdrafts
be either identified by a fixed term or that the term be
identified as on demand.
<P>

101	Mr Booth could not recall ever reading banking instructions as to the term
for overdrafts and the description of overdrafts
to be used in communication
with customers.  [T 408 and 409]
<P>

	<b>September 1985 - Conversion of Remaining Bill Facility to Foreign Currency
Facility</b>
<P>

102	In September 1985, Paola Holdings' then remaining A$2.1 million bill
facility was converted to a foreign currency [PX 28] facility.
<P>

	<b>6 January 1986 - Increased Facilities to Currabubula Holdings and Paola
Holdings</b>
<P>

103	By letter dated 6 January 1986 from the Bank to Mr Paola, the Bank
confirmed its approval to provision of increased facilities
to Currabubula
Holdings by way of an increased `Come and Go' overdraft facility from the then
$350,000 to $450,000 and a term loan
of $1.4million to permit the purchase of
two properties.  At the same time, a facility granted to Paola Holdings was
identified as
a Bill Acceptance/Discount Facility of $485,000 and the Bank
granted an extension of the then existing `Multi Currency' Facility
of
$4.2million and `overdraft' facility of $50,000 to 30 November 1986.  [PX 34
and following]
<P>

	<b>12 May 1987</b>
<P>

104	Mr Booth accepted that when he became account manager, he would have read a
financial analysis entitled `ABE Holdings Limited
and Subsidiary Companies
Financial Analysis', which had been prepared on 12 May 1987 and in particular
the section reading:
<P>

	<cite>`Liquidity</cite>
<P>

<i>	Both current assets and current liabilities have been significantly reduced
due to the Group's disposal of its subsidiary, U-Bix
Copiers.  As a result of
the transactions involved in the disposal, the Group's liquidity position has
been substantially improved
as evidenced by working capital, current and liquid
ratios.'     </i>[PX 39]
<P>

	<b>End March 1987 - Paola Group Structure</b>
<P>

105	At the end of March 1987, the Paola Group structure as recorded at PX 69
was as follows: 
<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

106	It was, however, common ground that at all material times Mr and Mrs Paola
each held one of the two issued shares in Currabubula
and that the three issued
shares in Paola Holdings were held by Mr Paola, Mrs Paola and Currabubula
Holdings.
<P>

	<b>August 1987</b>
<P>

107	A convenient summary of the Group's background is to be found in PX at page
65 and following, which is an August 1987 summary
of the Group up to that point
in time as known to the Bank.
<P>

108	The summary reads, inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`On 13 February 1984, Bank assistance of $4.2million was provided to allow
the Paolas to acquire the outstanding shares in the public
listed company,
Automated Business Equipment.  Upon successful takeover, the Company was
delisted.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr and Mrs Paola, the principals of this Group were major shareholders of
Automated Business Equipment (ABE) since incorporation
in 1972.  Following
privatisation under the Paola's entrepreneurial but prudent management, the
Group became one of the largest distributors
of plain paper copiers in
Australasia.  As a consequence of this growth the company developed a
reputation for its reliability and
quality of service.  Subsequently the
corporation who manufactured the copiers distributed by ABE, namely
"Konishiroku Photo Industry
Co Limited" negotiated to purchase the copier
business.  Completion of the purchase was effected in January 1987 for the sum
of $A10million.
 Sale proceeds were used to repay intercompany borrowings,
establish a facsimile business, purchase a rural property and reduce State
Bank
debt.  Mr Anthony Paola has been the driving force behind the success of U-Bix
Copiers and for this reason he has been retained
as a Director and is under a
restrictive trade agreement to act in this capacity for a minimum of two
years.</i>
<P>

<i>	Prior to the sale of the copier business the Paolas invested in farming
properties.  Their attraction for their country retreat has
seen their interest
blossom into livestock and pastoral production under the name of "Currabubula
Station".  Their properties have
a combined area of over 27,000 hectares.  The
properties are situated at Collarenebri, Tamworth and Narrabri, New South
Wales.</i>
<P>

<i>	Each property has its own manager all of whom are experienced rural people.
The properties have been cultivated for wheat and wool
production and the
grazing of beef capital.</i>

within the Paola Group . . . </i>

<P>

109	The same banking summary at PX 68 reads:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Management</cite>
<P>

<i>	The success of this Group can be attributed to Tony Paola's industrious
nature and business acumen.</i>
<P>

<i>	ABE's line management are long-term employees who are experienced in their
respective areas of responsibility.</i>
<P>

<i>	The managers of the pastoral, live stock properties are "country people"
who have earned a high reputation for farm management ability.</i>
<P>

<i>	Tony Paola supervises the group's activities by "hands-on management" and
acts positive if any area is not performing to predetermined
targets.'</i>
<P>

110	The same document at PX 66 includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Serviceability</cite>
<P>

<i>	Previously, the Bank has relied almost entirely on U-Bix Copiers
Australasia to service debts.  With the sale of the `Copiers' business
and the
increased emphasis on primary production, it is important the changes in
sources of cash flow be noted, particularly in the
next 12 months.  This is
considered necessary to allow the ABE Telecommunications (Facsimile
Machines/Supplies) operations to develop
to replace the "Copiers" contribution
to cash flow and profits.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst the copiers business has been sold, it does not involve a move to a
new industry.  Therefore we believe the experience gained
by our client will be
a benefit in quickly establishing the new business.  The Paolas predict the
facsimile business will be larger
and more profitable than copiers.'</i>
<P>

111	Mr Booth accepted that when he had become account manager, his
understanding from his perusal of the files was that `at least
until August
1987 the Bank had relied almost entirely on the income generated by the Group's
photocopying business' and he became
aware on or shortly after he became
account manager, that that business had been or was in the process of being
disposed of.  [T410]
<P>

112	Mr Paola gave evidence that prior to entering into the facility, the
subject of the 4 September 1987 letter he attended a meeting
with the State
Bank at which were present Mr Brennan and Mr Tansley and possibly, although he
could not be certain, Mr Swinburne.
 This took place on his evidence, just
prior to and no more than a month before the letter of 4 September 1987 from
the Bank.
<P>

113	Mr Paola's evidence was that at the meeting he said in substance:
<P>

	<i>`As I have mentioned to you previously the sale to the Japanese of Konica
has occurred.  I am now gearing up into the country.'</i>
<P>

114	Mr Brennan in substance is said to have replied:
<P>

	<i>`Tony, we helped you with privatisation of your copying business and you
didn't give us the trading business for ABE Copiers, you
kept that with
Westpac, so we'd like to be involved in the businesses you are undertaking now
in the country.  As you recall, the
State Bank used to be the rural bank, we
know all about the country and we already do a lot of business up that way
(namely the Tamworth
area).  We can do a better deal than any other bank.  We
could charge you .25% margin on our reference rates for overdrafts.'</i>
<P>

115	Mr Paola gave evidence that the proceeds which he was to receive from the
ABE Copiers sale were earmarked for the purchase of
further properties and that
with the bank facility being offered by the State Bank, the acquisitions could
be accelerated. 
<P>

116	On Mr Paola's evidence, he also stated at the meeting:
<P>

	<i>`I'm looking the develop the trading operations out in the country.  I've
got a few companies which are doing things.</i>
<P>

<i>	For the time being I am going to concentrate on the primary production
side.  I am trying to develop a business which is drought
proof, has cash flow
and can make sizeable capital gains.  I am drought proofing the business by
acquiring irrigation property. 
I've got an exposure to inexpensive dry land
farming towards Collarenebri and I am also developing inexpensive land for
cropping.
 I am also developing a cash flow business in Northern Rural Services
which is a rural merchandise business and a stock and station
agent.  I'm doing
that because based on Currabubula's own business with merchants and stock and
station agents, it could feed a business
on its own.  I have also a couple of
the companies left over from the copier business, namely the Jet Charter and
the ABE Telecommunications
and ABE Finance and Credits which I will ultimately
get rid of and wind them up while I focus primarily on the agricultural
business.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Mr Paola's Statement, December 1998 paras 3 to 7 inclusive.]
<P>

117	Neither Mr Brennan nor Mr Tansley gave evidence disagreeing with or denying
the correctness of Mr Paola's evidence of this early
meeting.
<P>

118	I accept Mr Paola's evidence as to the meeting.
<P>

	<b>4 September 1987 Facility Letter - $2.14 million</b>
<P>

119	Reference has earlier been made to the Bank's facility letter of 4
September 1987 addressed to Paola Holdings Pty Limited. 
The letter is set out
in Appendix 1.
<P>

120	Mr Booth accepted in cross-examination that he recalled when reading this
letter having become account manager, that seven borrowers
were identified in
the letter and that there were various facilities that were allocated between
the borrowers.  He noticed that
the document did not use the word or phrase `on
demand' in relation to any of the overdraft components of the facilities.
<P>

121	The facility letter probably remained `a marked letter' in Mr Booth's files
because of its clear importance.
<P>

	<b>Alleged Conversation with Mr Tansley</b>
<P>

122	Mr Paola's evidence was that subsequent to his receipt of the 4 September
1987 letter, he met with and had a conversation with
Mr Tansley and said to Mr
Tansley words to the effect: `I am concerned about the Bank withdrawing this
facility for any reason if
it decides to change it's mind'.
<P>

123	Mr Paola's evidence was that he showed Mr Tansley the `events of default'
clause and the clauses which gave a discretion to
the Bank to form an opinion
and in particular clause (viii).  On his evidence, Mr Tansley then said words
to the effect:
<P>

	<i>`That's a standard clause of the Bank in the Bank's documentation.  I don't
know of any circumstance where the Bank has actually used
it.  In your case
we're only interested in the security.  We are providing the funding to you
based on the security only because
we know that the businesses you've got are
just starting off and really there's no track record on any of them.'</i>
<P>

124	Mr Paola gave evidence that after this meeting with Mr Tansley, he arranged
for the Facility Letter to be signed by the Company.
 [Paras 10, 11 and 12 -
Statement of December 1998]
<P>

125	Mr Tansley gave evidence that he did not recall the discussion with Mr
Paola but may have said to Mr Paola words to the effect
`That's a standard
clause of the bank in the bank's documentation.  I don't know of any
circumstances where the Bank has actually
used it.'  [`It' being a reference to
default clause (viii) in the Bank's letter of 4 September 1987]
<P>

126	Mr Tansley denied that he would have said words to the effect:  `In your
case we're only interested in the securities.  We are
providing the funding to
you based on the security only'.
<P>

127	Mr Tansley volunteered in giving evidence that his knowledge was `very
vague in a lot of areas' [T 540].  I accept Mr Paola's
evidence as to the
meeting.
<P>

	<b>8 September 1987</b>
<P>

128	On 8 September 1987, Mr G.R. Plummer a Senior Manager in the Risk Policy
Unit,  commented on the loan quality assessment in
respect of Paola Holdings,
Currabubula Holdings and ABE Holdings.  Mr Plummer's comment was:
<P>

	<i>`LQ2 Assessment confirmed and decision noted, in view of the security level
provided and reported financial strength, although the
Group will need to be
carefully monitored in view of its recent move from photocopiers to facsimile
machines.'   </i>[PX 84]
<P>

129	Mr Booth accepted that the loan quality assessment was one of the things
which he always had to comment on in his submissions
and that when he made
submissions, he had to address the question of whether or not a customers loan
quality assessment should be
varied up or down.  He accepted that this was a
qualitative assessment and that various factors were looked at.  He recalled as
familiar
that during his time as account manager for the Paola Group, loan
quality assessments ran from LQ1 through to LQ4.  Initially he
recalled as
familiar and appeared to accept the proposition that as to LQ3 and LQ4 these
were loan quality assessments which would
involve the Bank in deciding not to
advance further funds to a company.  [T 412] Later he said as to LQ3 and LQ4,
that he could not
recall whether the Bank had a policy that it would not lend
new money to customers with those gradings.
<P>

130	Mr Booth also recalled that the Bank had a system called risk rating, where
alpha-numeric records of risk assessments would
be recorded.  He recalled that
when he had become account manager, the account had been rated as LQ2 and that
he had noticed when
he had become account manager that Mr Plummer had awarded
the LQ2 grade to the Group because of the security level provided and reported
financial strength.
<P>

131	His understanding of the LQ1 assessment was that it was awarded to a blue
chip borrower, namely a borrower with very strong
liquidity, very strong asset
bases and very good ratios of debt to net assets.  As to LQ2, he accepted that
it was an assessment
which meant that the borrower was entirely satisfactory to
the Bank.  He believed that LQ3 and LQ4 were probably customers who had
weakening financial ratios or some identified or potential problem.
<P>

132	Mr Booth accepted that he was at all times aware of a need to carefully
monitor the Paola Group and that to the best of his
ability he did carefully
monitor the Group.  To the best of his ability, he had obtained relevant
information for the Bank about
the Group and analysed that information as
carefully as he possibly could as part of his duties.  [T 414]
<P>

133	Mr Booth recalled that the risk policy unit of which Mr Plummer was a
Senior Manager, was a unit that was separate from the
lending unit of the Bank
of which Mr Booth was a member and he believed that although arrangements
changed from time to time, this
was because of a Bank policy to have
independent loan quality assessments made of customers and borrowers.  [T
414]
<P>

	<b>November 1987</b>
<P>

134	On 23 November 1987, a bill of sale and an equitable mortgage and floating
charge was provided by a number of companies in the
Paola Group to the Bank.
The relevant Paola Companies, parties to the document were ABE Travel Service,
Campbell, Rixon, Paola Holdings,
ABE Telecommunications, ABE Holdings,
Currabubula Holdings, Automated Business Equipment and ABE Jet.

Account Manager within the division.  The note reported that:

	<i>`Further discussions with Paola have disclosed that they cannot guarantee
any profits this year (1987/88) even though sales should
substantially
increase.  The reason being that there have been large start-up costs for the
facsimile business which are likely to
continue throughout the year . .
.'</i>
<P>

136	The note included the following:
<P>

	<i>`. . . it is acknowledged that there have been large changes to the Group's
structure over the past 12 months.  This has led to a
substantial inflow of
funds (due to the sale of subsidiaries',) however these funds have been
reallocated to new ventures.  Profits
are not likely this year due to the high
start-up costs of the ventures in an effort to gain a large portion of the
market.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is no doubt that Paola is constantly changing in response to the
market with Tony Paola as Managing Director.  He has sound
entrepreneurial
skills and quickly capitalises on the opportunities presented.</i>
<P>

<i>	Overall, the financial position of Paola is considered satisfactory.'</i>
[PX 123]
<P>

137	Mr Booth recalled examining this document and noting from it, under the
sub-head `Negative', that an operating loss of $1.853million
had been made
during the period.
<P>

138	He accepted that while he was account manager for the Group, an assessment
of Mr Paola's abilities and skills was important
in assessing the safety of the
loan to the Paola Group and that Mr Paola was a person who constantly changed
his business activities
in response to the market.  He was also aware at least
as at February 1988 of the Bank's view that Mr Paola had sound entrepreneurial
skills and quickly capitalised on opportunities presented.  [T 420]
<P>

139	At the time Mr Sullivan wrote the note, he was, to the best of Mr Booth's
recollection, a financial analyst for the Corporate
Loan Group.
<P>

	<b>March 1988</b>
<P>

140	On 16 March 1988, Mr Moore who was Chief Manager, Corporate and Financial
Institutions Division, made a note in relation to
the division's recommendation
for an additional $1.7million by way of increase in facilities.  That note was
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`This account is to receive a higher degree of management and facilities
are not to be exceeded.  Account Manager is to report in
writing each month on
status of Group and its adherence to financial budgeting.  This report to be in
Section Head's hands by 21st
day of each month.'    </i>[PX 124]
<P>

141	Mr Booth could not recall whether when he became account manager, he
received instructions that the Paola Group Account was
to receive a higher
degree of management than other accounts and he had paid no part in the
preparation of Mr Moore's note.  He did
not recall a requirement when he became
account manager, that he report in writing each month on the status of the
Group.
<P>

	<b>16 March 1988 - LQ2 Assessed Rating</b>
<P>

142	On 16 March 1988, Mr Martin Meldrum of the Bank, assessed Paola Holdings
and its subsidiaries at LQ2, under the heads `Default
Risk', `Credit Risk',
`Management' and `Special Characteristics'.  This assessment was approved by Mr
Moore at the time.  [PX 135]
<P>

	<b>22 March 1988 - Additional Facility Letter - Increase to $2.217
million</b>
<P>

143	Additional facilities were then approved in terms of a letter from the Bank
to Paola Holdings of 22 March 1988.  This letter
is set out in Appendix 2.
<P>

144	Mr Booth's evidence was that he saw the facility letter when he became
account manager but he probably would not have noticed
that there were fewer
borrowers referred to than on the 4 September 1987 letter.  He was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And you wouldn't have noticed because in your mind the borrower was the
Paola Group and its constituent companies?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that was your understanding throughout the entirety of your dealings
as account manager of the Paola Group relationship wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'    </i>[T422]
<P>

	<b>July 1988</b>
<P>

145	In July 1988, Mr Alan Booth became the Bank's account manager responsible
for the Paola account.  When Mr Booth became account
manager, he read the
documents relating to the history of the facility.
<P>

146	Mr Booth's evidence was that for the period 1988 until later in 1989, he
was not overly concerned with the exposure of the Bank
to the Paola Group of
Companies.  It appeared to him that adequate security was held.  However, the
financial material and information
he was receiving from the Paola Group of
Companies was not, he said, detailed or particularly regular.  His evidence was
that he
was never certain at any time whether or not the significant increases
in borrowing by the Paola Group were for the purposes of business
expansion, or
because of problems with cash flow arising from one or more of the companies
within the Group.  [Statement 20 November
1996 paragraph 15]
<P>

147	Mr Booth signed a `call minute' on 8 July 1988 which reads inter alia as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Remarks</cite>
<P>

<i>	Meeting requested by Paola.  Management are of the view that the Bank is
not servicing the Group adequately in spite of all Paola
assets being held as
security.  Consequences of this are that Paola is unable to fund growth
adequately and is missing growth opportunities.
 Specific examples of
opportunities missed in the ABE Group and in Northern Rural Services were
raised.  In the case of Northern
Rural, sales of $6 million only were achieved
against budgeted $10million and three new branch openings were
postponed.</i>
<P>

<i>	At the commencement of the meeting, Paola was of the view that better
banking arrangements would be possible if individual entities
were responsible
for securing their own funding.  Much of the meeting was spent convincing them
otherwise, that on individual entity
bases, Paola companies would lose
bargaining power and the flexibility to move funds within the Group.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was also conceded that more innovative arrangements could be made under
the existing security which could possibly significantly
increase loanable
funds to the Group.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was agreed that if Paola could provide cash flows and projected balance
sheets for the next twelve months a review of banking
facilities would be
conducted and facilities renegotiated.</i>
<P>

<i>	Other disclosures made during the meeting included:</i>
<P>

<i>	- Paola's rural programme is being scaled down.  One property was sold
recently, another sale is currently being negotiated.</i>
<P>

<i>	- The jet charter operation is changing focus with aircraft ownership being
scaled down and replaced by management of aircraft owned
by others.</i>
<P>

<i>	Follow up action:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	On receipt of future cash flows and balance sheet projections prepare
review of banking facilities.  More innovative approach
needs to be adopted re
security valuations i.e. include WIP values of farm produce . . .'   </i>[PX
173]
<P>

148	In being tested in cross-examination with what precisely he said to Mr
Paola about the flexibility to move funds within the
Group, the following
evidence was given by Mr Booth:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You said words to the effect, didn't you, that if the Paola companies
went to dealing with facilities on an individual basis he
would lose the
flexibility to move credit with the Bank from company to company.  That was
what you put, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The words to lose flexibility to move funds within the Group, yes, that
would be what I was thinking . . .'   </i>[T 423]
<P>

149	Mr Booth also accepted under cross-examination on being shown this note,
that he had been told that the jet charter operation
was being scaled down in
July 1988.  He was aware of this from that time on.
<P>

150	He accepted that as account manager, he did not consider that the jet
charter company was as large as the rural operation or
facsimile businesses.
He was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You knew from virtually the inception of your role as account manager
that the Jet Charter operation was being scaled down and
eventually in 1989 the
jets were sold or were put on the market?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Subsequently, well, events took that course yes.'   </i>[T 424]
<P>

151	In about late August/early September 1988, Mr Booth prepared a
recommendation for release of certain securities.  That document
included the
following comment by Mr Booth:
<P>

	<i>`Tony Paola has recently successfully negotiated the sale of the majority
of his shareholding in U-Bix Copiers (N.Z.) Limited to Fernbank
Industries
Limited . . .'  It is understood that approximately 2.6 million shares have
been sold at N.Z. D3 per share which at current
value represents in excess of
AUD$6 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola's stated intention for the proceeds of this sale is to repay all
secured banking facilities of his companies.  (The remaining
shares will be
sold as necessary to cover any shortfalls) . . .'  </i>[PX 178[
<P>

152	Mr Booth recalled that the assets were sold and that he believed some of
the proceeds went to reduction of bank debt.  He accepted
at transcript 425
that it was perfectly normal in the operation of the account, for the borrower
to repay bank debt not by regular
servicing but by intermittent asset sales.
<P>

	<b>August 1988</b>
<P>

<b>	10 August 1988 - Loan Quality Assessment Rating of `Management' Raised to
LQ1</b>
<P>

153	On 10 August 1988, Mr Plummer approved a further overall loan quality
assessment rating of Paola Holdings at LQ2 but which raised
the `management
assessment' rating to LQ1, leaving the `default risk', `credit risk' and
`special characteristics' ratings at LQ2.
<P>

154	Mr Booth was unable to recall whether his views were sought by the persons
who made this assessment.  He could not, however,
recall any occasion where any
officer or officers of the Risk Policy Unit inspected documents or files for
the Group and produced
a loan quality assessment sheet without talking to him.
[T 426]
<P>

155	Mr Booth accepted that the loan quality assessment of `management rating'
as LQ1, effectively referred to Mr Paola, and that
Mr Paola was so rated in
light of all the information the Bank had as at 10 August 1988 about the
conduct of the facilities between
the Bank and the Group.  Mr Booth accepted
that Mr Paola was rated as LQ1 as a result of the Bank's assessment of Mr
Paola's skills
as a businessman.
<P>

	<b>11 August 1988 - Additional $1.1 million Overdraft</b>
<P>

156	On 11 August 1988, approval was given by the Bank for the provision of an
additional $1.1million overdraft for Paola Holdings
on the basis that the
facility was to be reviewed along with all other facilities available to the
Paola Group by 31 August 1988.
 The security comprised a first registered real
property mortgage over a property on the Liverpool Plains, known as `Gabo',
which
was being acquired;  a second registered real property mortgage over a
property known as `Bombargo' which was being acquired, as
well as all other
security already held on behalf of the Paola Group.  [PX page 174]
<P>

157	Exhibit PX 183 is a memorandum from Mr Peter Terry to Mr Paola of 29
September 1988 setting out the current bank balance under
heads `Balance';
`Limit'; and `Variance'.  The document includes the following:
<P>

	
 [ IMAGE ] <i>
</i>
<P>

<i>I am arranging that $250,000 be transferred from A.B.E. Holdings to Paola
Holdings.'</i>
<P>

158	On being shown this document, Mr Booth accepted that whilst he was account
manager, credit was transferred from one company
to another within the Paola
Holdings by adjustment of overdraft limits.  He was also asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And I also want to put this, it happened from time to time, did it not,
whilst you were account manager that the Paola Group of
Companies would go over
their approved overdraft or facility limits?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Individual companies I believe, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, and that happened on a relatively regular basis, did it not, whilst
you were account manager?</i>
<P>

<i>	. . . A.	I do recall it happening.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that position was tolerated by the Bank wasn't it . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't understand the meaning of tolerated.  We would have been
required to report any excess drawings.  I can't recall the approval
process,
but an approval was required.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes and approval was given wasn't it to your understanding during that
period for excess from time to time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Where individual companies exceeded their limits yes.'  </i>[T 425]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>18 November 1988 - Facility Letter increase to $4.65 million</b>
<P>

159	The terms of a further temporary facility agreement were then documented by
letter dated 18 November 1988 from the Bank to Paola
Holdings.  That letter is
set out in Appendix 3.
<P>

160	The total overdraft limit achieved by the temporary facility agreement then
became $4.65million.
<P>

	<b>Late 1988/Early 1989 - Alleged Representations</b>
<P>

161	It will be recalled that the plaintiffs in their estoppel claim assert
that, prior to entering into the February 1990 facility
agreement, officers of
the Bank represented to Mr Paola that the Bank would not exercise any legal
rights to withdraw the facility
prior to giving the Group or Currabubula
Holdings, reasonable notice of its intention to exercise such rights so that
the Group (or
Currabubula Holdings) could refinance the liabilities to the Bank
with another banking entity.
<P>

162	This allegation is grounded upon evidence given by Mr Paola in his
statement of 21 October 1996, paragraphs 9 to 11 inclusive.
 He there alleges
that some time in late 1988 or in 1989, he had a conversation with Mr Swinburne
where they were discussing `the
spectacular failures of various entrepreneurs
in the late 1980s'.  Mr Paola alleges that during that conversation, Mr
Swinburne raised
`the problems the State Bank were having as a result'.  On Mr
Paola's evidence, during that discussion the following conversation
took
place:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Swinburne:  There has been a lot of high profile people falling over
recently.  This is not a good time to be falling in love
with assets
business-wise.  Take for example Russell Goward and the shortfall in the assets
that was discovered there.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:  I mean if the bank was having difficulties, is there any
likelihood that the bank would pull the rug out and withdraw
its facilities
without giving me notice?  The bank wouldn't do that to me would it Jim?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:  No no Tony, in your case, the bank is very happy with the
security.  There is not much likelihood that that would
happen to you.'</i>
<P>

163	Mr Paola also gave evidence that he recalled an occasion when he was
driving with Mr Peter Brennan of the Bank to Durhambone
Station from Tamworth
and that during this trip, Mr Brennan said words to the effect:
<P>

	<i>`The Bank is more than happy with its security.  The Bank wouldn't withdraw
its facility without giving you plenty of notice'.</i>
<P>

164	Mr Paola's evidence was further that the trip to Durhambone with Mr Brennan
took place in late 1988 or early 1989 and that:
<P>

	<i>`After this and other similar conversations with Peter Brennan and Jim
Swinburne, I believed that if the Bank were to seek to withdraw
the facilities
to all the various companies, it would give me adequate time to refinance the
outstanding borrowings with another
institution.  I did not seek to find
another bank as a result of these conversations.  Because of statements made to
me by Brennan
and Swinburne concerning the State Bank, I was concerned that the
State Bank may demand its money because it needed it.'  </i>[Statement
paragraph 11]
<P>

165	Mr Swinburne in his statement of 18 November 1996, gave evidence that he
had no recollection of any conversation with Mr Paola
in the terms alleged by
Mr Paola either in 1988 or 1989 or at any other time.  Further, he gives
evidence that to his recollection
it was he who visited Mr Paola's property,
Currabubula, in late 1988 or early 1989 and that to his recollection Mr Brennan
visited
the property some time earlier than he did.  He cannot recall any
conversations of the type referred to in paragraph 11 of Mr Paola's
statement.
<P>

166	Mr Brennan, who was at the time employed by the Bank as the chief manager
of its corporate and financial institutions division,
gave evidence by
statement of 19 November 1996 that he recalls visiting Currabubula Station, to
the best of his recollection in about
1988 although he is unable to say exactly
when the visit took place.  He cannot recall any conversations which he had
with Mr Paola
at the time, nor whether he informed Mr Paola that the Bank was
more than happy with its security and would not withdraw its facility
without
giving him plenty of notice.
<P>

167	The recollections of both Mr Swinburne and Mr Brennan appeared extremely
vague.  I accept Mr Paola's evidence of these conversations.

<P>

	<b>January 1989</b>
<P>

168	On 23 January 1989, the Bank's Coordinator, Statistics and Weekly Reports,
sent a memorandum to the Bank's manager at Gunnedah
in respect of overdraft
limits, stating the overdrafts which had been established but indicating that
no approval for the limits
appeared to have been received on an agenda and
asking whether the records could be checked `to see if you have scheduled any
of
the overdrafts and forward it on to your regional office'.  The particular
account in question was that of NRS and the amount as
at 14 December 1988
identified as $75,000'.  [Exhibit PX page 206]
<P>

169	Mr Booth wrote a handwritten note at the end of this memorandum reading as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`No approval involved, this ODL is the result of a re-allocation of ODL's
already existing for the Paola Group of Companies over which
the Bank holds
interlocking EMFCs.</i>
<P>

<i>	Please note a $350,000 limit was also established for NRS at Moree under
the same circumstances.'</i>
<P>

170	Mr Booth was asked whether he would agree that this was an example of the
re-allocation of overdraft limits and his answer was:
`My comment refers to a
re-allocation of overdraft limits, yes, it could be that.'  [T 427]
<P>

	<b>Late January, Early February 1989</b>
<P>

171	In February 1989, Mr Plante became the financial controller and company
secretary of the companies in the Paola Group.
<P>

172	In late January/early February 1989, a corporate/financial institutions
division submission signed by Mr Booth, recorded the
Bank's approach to an
application by Paola Holdings and Currabubula Holdings for an increase in
facilities to $5.8million.  That
document (PX 207) which Mr Booth accepted was
a significant document comprising his best efforts to accurately set out the
position,
reads inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Paola's operations are now substantially based on a Fax business, sheep,
wheat and cattle farming as well as a farm service operation
based in the north
west of New South Wales.  The growth in Fax sales in Australia is strong and
expected to expand by 400% over the
next five years.  The outlook for wool,
wheat and beef is also very favourable in the short/medium term.</i>
<P>

<i>	This outlook should underpin Paola's cash flows and importantly also
support property values which represent a large proportion of
the Bank's
security.</i>
<P>

<i>	While . . . Tony Paola intends to reduce total borrowings to $3.1million in
the near future following the sale of a property and
some more U-Bix shares,
his track record is one of frequent changes in direction at short notice
usually prompted by opportunities
for trading in real estate.  Mr Paola has
however shown himself to be astute in his real estate operations.</i>
<P>

<i>	In view of the above and the strength of our security position (which is
probably undervalued), I am prepared to approve the increase
in facilities to
$5.8million.'</i>
<P>

173	That submission was approved by Mr Swinburne and by Mr Brennan.
<P>

174	The document contains Mr Booth's conclusion that there was a coverage in
terms of secured facilities in terms of a ratio of
assets valued and loanable
sum of 2.79 times.  The 2.79 represented the division of the total value of the
securities by the proposed
final debt.  The total valuation was recorded at
$16,341,253.
<P>

175	The profit and loss analysis under the head `financial position' at PX 209
recorded net profits after tax for Currabubula Holdings
for the year 1988 on
the basis of unaudited figures, of $2,100,000 and recorded for ABE Holdings and
subsidiaries, net losses after
tax for 1988 of $772,000.
<P>

176	The same document in the financial commentary at PX page 210 stated inter
alia:
<P>

	<i>`. . . the preceeding (sic) financial summaries provide the best picture of
the financial position of the Paola Group.  No accounts
have been provided for
PHL as it is a passive holding company whose assets and liabilities consist
almost entirely of inter-company
debts . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Over the year, the group had been developing 2 new businesses, Northern
Rural Services. . . the farm supplies operation and ABE Fax,
a facsimile sales
and service operation. </i><cite> Both of these have incurred considerable
start-up costs</cite><i> and only now are beginning to show positive
returns.</i>
<P>

<i>	As a result of this and of the loss of revenue of ABE Copiers which was
sold in January 1987, the accounts of the ABE Group as at
30 June 1988 show a
marked deterioration in terms of gearing, liquidity and general performance.
Subsequent to balance date however,
this has been effectively reversed as a
result of the sale (at a considerable profit) of much of the Group's
shareholding in the
U-Bix Copiers (N.Z.) Limited . . .'  </i>[emphasis
added]
<P>

177	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth accepted that his view as at January
1989, was that Paola Holdings was a passive holding company
and that this view
about Paola Holdings never changed through his period as account manager for
the Paola Group.  [T 429]
<P>

178	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth also accepted that to his perception the
importance of Currabubula Holdings was that it owned
the rural properties in
the Group having, through mortgages and other securities, pledged its property
to repayment of the Bank debt
should that be necessary.  He also accepted that
he always understood that all the assets of Currabubula were secured by the
relevant
mortgages and other securities including the equitable mortgage and
floating charge to repay the Bank's debt if necessary and that
that position
never changed, had always been his understanding and was his understanding in
1990.  [ T 429]
<P>

179	At transcript 431, Mr Booth was asked as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Do you tell his Honour that you came to form a view that there was not
ample security to cover the borrowings from the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There were times when that was a possibility.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you form the view at any stage that there wasn't ample security to
cover borrowings from the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would have formed a view that there was a possibility that was the
case.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When did you form that view?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Exactly I am not sure.  1990, at possible times.'</i>
<P>

180	I do not accept that at any point in time Mr Booth formed such a view.
<P>

181	Under cross-examination, it was put to Mr Booth that at no time during his
employment as account manager for the Paola Group
account did he think that
there was insufficient security to cover all proposed or actual borrowings.
His answer was that he did
not agree.  [T 432-433]  I do not accept this
evidence as accurate.
<P>

182	The same document includes under the head `Risk Assessment', the
following:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Pros</cite>
<P>

<i>	.	Industry outlooks for all of Paola's Group's core businesses are
good</i>
<P>

<i>	-	High growth expectations for the facsimile business, given industry
predictions, are not unrealistic.</i>
<P>

<i>	-	The rural sector outlook is positive for the `88/'89 financial year, the
industry is experiencing the best conditions for many
years.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Paola Group management is considered very experienced.  Many of the
senior people have been known to the Bank in excess of four
years.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Ample security is held to cover all proposed borrowings.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Due to Tony Paola's entrepreneurial style which includes continually
changing plans and similarly changing requests to his bankers
the Paola account
continues to be a high maintenance account.  Accordingly, the pricing structure
instituted last year is to remain
unchanged.' </i>
<P>

Mr Booth's evidence was that the last paragraph may have been intended as a
`con'.  [T 433]
<P>

183	Mr Booth's interpretation of why the last paragraph was a `con' was
`because it led to the account being high maintenance and
the Bank having to
spend a lot of time and energy on this customer.'  [T 433]
<P>

184	Mr Booth did not, however, agree that it was his understanding that early
in 1990, Bank officers to whom he reported, had formed
the view that Mr Paola
was really not worth it as a customer in terms of what the Bank was getting for
its efforts.  [T 433 and 434]
 Nor did he accept that in 1990 it was his
understanding that the Bank wanted Mr Paola to move his business to another
financial
institution.  [T 434]
<P>

185	Under the heading `Remarks' at PX page 210, the same document includes the
following:
<P>

	<i>`Events of recent months have seen a significant reduction in group debt.
By December 1988 the level of Bank debt had exceeded $9million
however, Tony
Paola had in earlier months successfully negotiated the sale of most of his
shareholdings ($2.6million of his $3.6million
shareholdings) in U-Bix Copiers
(N.Z.) limited to Fernbank Industries Limited, a subsidiary of Development
Finance Corporation of
New Zealand.  The sale realised some $A6.2million, all
of which was put to the reduction of group debt.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola is currently rationalising both the group operations and the
company structure.  Likely future developments include the
winding down of the
Jet Charter business and the grain trading and the stock and station agency of
the NRS group to enable the group
to concentrate on the more profitable
businesses.  In the longer term Mr Paola is considering inviting a new equity
participant in
ABE Fax.  He is also considering relisting ABE Holdings as a
vehicle for further new equity raising.'</i>
<P>

186	At PX 213 under the heading `Term', the following appears:
<P>

	<i>`Annual review of all facilities to be conducted by 31 October 1989 or
earlier on availability of audited annual financial statements
of the
Group.</i>
<P>

<i>	- 113,000 guarantee to expire 30 June 1989</i>
<P>

<i>	- Immediate review in the event of a material adverse change in the
financial condition of ABE PHL or CHL, or of shareholding therein.'</i>
<P>

187	The following was put to Mr Booth:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Now you didn't include in your proposal or your paper a specific term
for these facilities did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Specific term?  The term was defined by that review as 31 October '89, I
think that is a specific term in my mind.'  </i>[T 434]

189	At that time the real property security description was as follows:

[PX at 219]
<P>

190	The loan quality assessment sheet gave Mr Booth's assessment rating `LQ2'
to `default risk' (`capacity to service or repay');
 `credit risk' (`security
or financial structure) and to `management' (`personal factor or management
expertise'). [PX page 227]]
 Mr Brennan approved the assessment as Chief
Manager of the Corporate/Financial Institutions Division.  [T436]
<P>

191	By facsimile letter dated 9 February 1989, Mr Booth advised Mr Paola that
an annual review of facilities available to the Group
had been formally
approved, which included approval being given to an increase in overdraft
limits by $1.5million, making overall
facilities $5.848million.  This was the
facility the subject of the 23 January 1989 credit precis appearing at PX 208
earlier referred
to.
<P>

192	On the covering facsimile enclosing the letter, Mr Booth added the
words:
<P>

	<i>`The reporting requirements are unchanged from last year's but these have
never been adhered to.  I will be looking to significantly
improve that this
year.  Please advise if you see any problems with this.'  </i>[PX 247]
<P>

193	Mr Booth accepted under cross-examination that he saw it as part of his
responsibility to obtain such information as the Bank
required to be able to
assess the customer's performance on the loan.
<P>

194	Mr Booth was asked on 16 February 1989 to assist with respect to a Bank
opinion sought qua Currabubula Holdings and whether
it was good for $50,000 on
demand.  The request had been received from Westpac at Tamworth.  Mr Booth's
handwritten note was:
<P>

	<i>`Relationship with Bank over 4 years.  Management of company considered
reliable and would not enter into </i><cite>any</cite><i> commitment the
company could not meet - considered safe.'  </i>[PX 279]
<P>

195	At about the same time, the Bank was extending the offer of a further
$1.5million by way of an increase in the facility.  Mr
Booth under
cross-examination, accepted that in that context, he would not have had a hand
in the Bank making that offer if he thought
that the money was unsafe.  [T
438]
<P>

196	Valuations of the secured properties were conducted from time to time by
the Bank's valuers in Tamworth and at other places.
 [T 436]
<P>

197	At all material times the Bank had a regional valuer at Tamworth.
Initially this was a Mr John Miller as far as Mr Booth could
recall.  From time
to time Mr Booth corresponded with Mr Miller about the valuation of secured
property.  Ultimately the Bank also
had a valuer in the area called Mr Yeo.
<P>

	<b>April 1989</b>
<P>

198	Mr Plante recalled making on a number of occasions, requests to Mr Booth,
the substance of which was as follows:
<P>

	`Mr Plante:	How about we look at the bills facility and do something about
restructuring them and move the overdrafts to bills.
<P>

	Mr Booth:	Well lets just wait until the annual review.  We will when we do the
review.'  [Paragraph 22 Mr Plante's Statement, 27
October 1998]
<P>

199	In late April 1989, Mr Plante spoke with Mr Paola and later with Mr Booth.
In the latter conversation, Mr Plante said `We don't
want to increase the
limits.  Tony is taking steps to reduce the overdraft.  We would like to
convert some of the overdraft to bills'
and Mr Booth said `It's possible but
the Bank would like to do the security review which is due at the end of June
before altering
the facilities'.  [Statement para 24 of 27 October 1998
statement]
<P>

200	In about June 1989 Mr Plante recalled that property valuations were
prepared and forwarded to the Bank in preparation for the
security reviews.
<P>

	<b>28 June 1989 - Group Restructuring</b>
<P>

201	At a meeting of directors of Paola Holdings, held on 28 June 1989, the need
for a restructuring of the Group so as to facilitate
the public float of ABE
Holdings as soon as economic conditions and interest rates improved, was
discussed.  The outlined restructuring
included the desirability for
inter-company debts to be removed from the various balance sheets `so that they
would not distort analyses
of the companies' accounts'.  The inter-company
debts listed as proposed to be forgiven were as follows:
<P>

	<i>`ABE Holdings indebtedness to Automated Business Equipment of
$4.7million.</i>
<P>

<i>	Paola Holdings indebtedness to Automated Business Equipment of
$5.4million</i>
<P>

<i>	Currabubula Holdings indebtedness to Automated Business Equipment of
$4.5million</i>
<P>

<i>	Currabubula Holdings indebtedness to ABE Holdings of $1.5million</i>
<P>

<i>	ABE Fax's indebtedness to ABE Holdings of $394,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Currabubula Holdings indebtedness to Paola Holdings of $1.5million</i>
<P>

<i>	Currabubula Holdings indebtedness to ABE Fax of $88,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Automated Business Equipment indebtedness to ABE Fax of $304,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Northern Rural Services indebtedness to Currabubula Holdings of
$282,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Campbell Rixon indebtedness to Currabubula Holdings of $50,000'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[The amounts are given in approximate terms only]
<P>

202	Mr Paola also recommended to the meeting that Automated Business Equipment
be placed into voluntary liquidation, following the
forgiveness  of the debts
and the transfer of the shares owned in U-Bix (N.Z.) to Paola Holdings, stating
that Automated Business
Equipment `would then have no operations and would be
of no further use to the Group'.
<P>

203	The directors resolved that the company forgive a loan to Currabubula
Holdings of $1.5million effective as at 31 May 1989 and
the resolution included
that the forgiveness of the debts be ratified at an extraordinary general
meeting of the company to be held
forthwith.
<P>

204	Mr Booth was aware that the voluntary liquidation of Automated Business
Equipment was taking place and had been told that it
was part of the
restructuring of the Paola Group of Companies.  His evidence was that he was
not concerned by the liquidation because
it was a voluntary liquidation for
commercial reasons and because the solvency of Automated Business Equipment was
not in question.
 Further, Mr Paola had informed him that this was not an
operating company.  [Booth's statement 20 November 1996, para 21]
<P>

205	The financial statements of NRS for the financial year ended 30 June 1989
show an operating loss for that period of $218,057
as against an operating
profit for the year ended 30 June 1988 of $146,629.  [PX page 412]
<P>

	<b>June 1989</b>
<P>

206	A file minute appearing at PX 327 and following, signed by Mr Booth on 29
June 1989, deals with Mr Booth's recommendation that
an approval be given to a
temporary increase in the Group's overdraft limits by $500,000 on particular
terms.  The recommendation
also was for the Bank to note a proposed restructure
of the Paola Group of Companies.
<P>

207	The file minute reads inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>Restructure Arrangements</cite>
<P>

<i>	During conversations in recent weeks covering the future requirements of
the Group I have been informed of the following proposed
developments:</i>
<P>

<i>	Prior to June 30, 1989 the entire Group of Companies is to be reorganised
as follows (a diagram of existing structure is attached):</i>
<P>

<i>	- Automated Business Equipment Pty Limited is to be liquidated and all its
assets transferred to Paola Holdings Pty Limited.  These
include ABE Fax Pty
Limited, ABE Jet Charter Pty Limited and others.  (Jet Charter will shortly
also cease operations).</i>
<P>

<i>	- All inter-company loans made by Automated Business Equipment are to be
forgiven, these include the following:</i>
<P>

<i>	- $5 million to ABE Holdings, $7 million to Paola Holdings and $4.5million
to Currabubula Holdings.</i>
<P>

<i>	- ABE Holdings is to take on the management of all properties owned by
Currabubula Holdings (Currabubula Holdings will remain the
owner of all rural
properties, all other assets are to be transferred to and all leases assigned
to ABE Holdings).</i>
<P>

<i>	The resultant group will thus be organised as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Paola Holdings will be the holding company of all the Paola
telecommunications/facsimile and photocopier sales and service business.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	ABE Holdings will be the holding company of all the Paola rural
operations.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Currabubula Holdings will be the rural property owning company.</i>
<P>

<i>	The reasons for the restructure are primarily to consolidate the Group in
preparation for a planned public float of ABE Holdings.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is also intended to reorganise the Group's debt requirements along
similar lines.  Mr Paola is currently negotiating vendor finance
arrangements
with Konica (ABE Faxes' supplier) which will eliminate the need for Bank debt
facilities for that company (currently
at $1.5 million).  It is expected that
when this occurs the Bank will be asked to release from its interlocking EMFC's
the companies
which comprise the reorganised Paola Holdings Group.</i>
<P>

<i>	With regard to the rural operations </i><cite>represented by the new ABE
Holdings Group</cite><i> it is anticipated that Bank facilities will be
continued however I have been asked to consider releasing these companies also
from
our EMFCs so they too can negotiate more advantageous vendor finance
arrangements.  Should we concede to these requests the Bank
will be relying
solely on existing RP mortgages on the properties owned by Currabubula
Holdings.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is noteworthy that Mr Paola recently commissioned independent valuations
of all the Currabubula Holdings properties </i><cite>which value the properties
at in excess of $22.5 million;  bank valuations as at 1987 were $9.6 million.
Either way we are assured
that considerable cover exists in the properties
alone to support both the present and future debt requirements of the Group. .
</cite><i>. .'  </i>[Exhibit PX 327 and 328]  [emphasis added]
<P>

208	Mr Booth could recall that in the middle of 1989, there was a proposed
restructure of the Paola Group and he agreed under cross-examination
that Mr
Paola was a person `who was constantly doing what he could to take advantage of
business opportunities . . . and that involved
. . . for one thing buying and
selling assets'.  [T 439]
<P>

209	Mr Booth was asked questions in relation to his note recording that ABE
Holdings was to take on the management of all properties
owned by Currabubula
Holdings, and agreed that he had an understanding at the date of this
memorandum that that was something that
was going to happen in the future.  He
could not recall whether he received any copies of documents such as contracts,
or other documents,
relating to any taking over by ABE Holdings of management
of the Currabubula properties.  It was put to him that he never received
any
such contracts or similar documents whereby there was any formal agreement
between ABE Holdings and any other Group company that
it would take over
Currabubula properties management and he answered "Yes.  I can't recall.'  [T
440]
<P>

	<b>July 1989</b>
<P>

210	By letter dated 6 July 1989, the Bank advised the Paola Group of Companies
that approval had been given to the provision of
additional overdraft limits of
$500,000 for a three-month term, all other terms and conditions as described in
the Bank's letter
of offer of 6 February 1989 to apply to this additional
accommodation.  [PX page 445]
<P>

211	By letter dated 10 July 1989, Mr Plante wrote to Mr Booth at the Bank
requesting a re-allocation of facility limits to be effective
immediately.  The
letter is a clear example, as Mr Booth accepted, of the Group asking for the
particular overdraft limits and in
this case also bill limits, to be
reallocated amongst the Group.  Mr Booth's handwritten note, part of Exhibit PX
234 reads: `Please
amend the limits as requested', which information was then
sent to Loans Administration at Tamworth, Gunnedah and Moree.  Mr Booth
accepted that he had acceded to the request and that from time to time such
requests were made and were acceded to by him.  [T 436]
<P>

212	A facsimile from Mr Booth to Mr John Miller, the Bank's Regional Office
Valuer earlier referred to, appears at PX 475 and is
an example of a number of
requests in 1989 by Mr Booth to Mr Miller to consider valuation of security
properties.  [T 441]
<P>

213	On 26 July 1989, Mr Booth prepared a file minute dealing with a request for
a $500,000 overdraft for `ABE Holdings Pastoral
Division'. The note includes
the following:
<P>

	<i>`Reference is made to a submission dated 29 June 1989 in which requests
were made for increased overdraft limits of $1 million for
the Group - $500,000
of which was necessary to carry the Group through a temporary liquidity
shortage resulting from difficulties
encountered by ABE Fax with an earlier
supplier and delays in summer crop proceeds experienced by the rural operation
as a result
of persistent rains over the past 6 months.  The remaining $500,000
was required to provide working capital finance for a </i><cite>newly created
division of the Group (ABE Holdings, Pastoral Division</cite><i>) whose purpose
is to expand the rural trading operations of the Group.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst approval was given to the former request, the latter was refused due
to lack of supporting information being available (at
the time the request was
made the Chief Executive of ABE Holdings Pastoral had not yet joined the firm
and no specific plans/requirements
had been formulated) . . .'  </i>[PX 478]
[emphasis added]
<P>

214	Mr Booth accepted under cross-examination, that he understood as recorded
on the note, that the ABE Holdings Pastoral Division
was simply a newly created
division of the Group and that he did not place any significance on the fact
that the new division was
to be entitled `ABE Holdings Pastoral Division'.  [T
442]
<P>

215	The same note at PX 178, referred to the proposed sales as including a jet
aircraft operated by ABE Jet Charter.  
<P>

216	On 26 July 1989, Mr Booth prepared a further loan quality assessment sheet
report again giving the Paola Group of Companies
the assessed rating LQ2 for
all categories.
<P>

	<b>September 1989</b>
<P>

217	Mr Booth prepared a call note dated 6 September 1989, summarising a meeting
of 5 September 1989 attended by Mr Paola, Mr Plante,
by Mr Booth and Mr Owens.
According to the file note, the purpose of the meeting was `general discussions
regarding present arrangements
and future plans'.
<P>

218	The file note read as follows:
<P>

	<i>`REMARKS</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Group Performance</cite>
<P>

<i>	Unaudited group accounts for the year ended 30 June 1989 are now available
and will be received shortly (audited accounts will follow
when available).
The consolidated accounts indicate an operating loss for the group of
approximately $2 million.  This is due primarily
to the poor performance of ABE
Fax which turned in an operating loss of $1.9 million (profit before tax
however is expected to exceed
$2 million as a result of the successful sale
last year of the group's shareholding in U-Bix Copiers (N.Z.) Ltd).  Other
entities
of the group to also record operating losses included ABE Holdings and
Northern Rural Services.  These however were offset by net
returns from the
farms of in excess of $0.5 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	The operating loss of ABE Fax was due to supply problems being experienced
with its supplier over much of that time (Mitsubishi).
 Since then ABE Fax has
successfully resourced its supplies through an alternate source and is
negotiating a compensation claim with
Mitsubishi.</i>
<P>

<i>	NRS's operating loss was a result of establishment costs in setting up two
new branches during the year in Gunnedah and Moree.</i>
<P>

<i>	With regard ABE Holdings whilst it earned no profit, it was required to
make payments on various transactions including ABE Jet's
aircraft
repayments</i>
<P>

<i>	Budgeted profits for 1989 are as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>		$</i>
<P>

<i>	ABE Pastoral	600,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Currabubula Holdings	300,000</i>
<P>

<i>	NRS	450,000</i>
<P>

<i>	ABE Fax	not yet determined</i>
<P>

<i>	ABE Holdings	(722,470)</i>
<P>

<i>	Settlement of claims with Mitsubishi is now imminent and is expected to
result in Mitsubishi forgiving ABE Fax's outstanding debt
(approximately $3
million).  Upon completion of this the company is expected to embark on a new
growth phase which could involve
increased Bank funding being required.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst details of the future developments are unavailable at this stage
this was given as the major reason why Paola would prefer
the account to
continue to be managed from Sydney rather than Tamworth as we recently
proposed.</i>
<P>

<i>	Given the reluctance of both the Tamworth region and now of Paola himself
to agree to a transfer it would be advisable that this
be considered.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the interim a submission is to be prepared recommending increases in
facilities in the order of $1.7 million to a total of $7.87
million.  These
increases are required to.</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	increase the group's DLC limit from $100,000 to $300,000 to enable more
economical facsimile orders to be made;</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	provide seasonal working capital funding for </i><cite>the new pastoral
division</cite><i> ($700,000);</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	enable repayments to be made on properties previously acquired on terms
(total payments to be made this year amount to $875,000);</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	fund increases in working capital requirements of ABE Jet Charter
($100,000) and NRS ($345,000).</i>
<P>

<i>	Cash flow projections for the remainder of this financial year have been
provided which support these requirements.  The loanable
sum of security
currently held by the Bank amounts to in excess of $9 million ($7 million of
which is directly attributable to properties).</i>
<P>

<i>	As current accounts operated by the group are now overdrawn some $800,000
in excess of present arrangements this submission is to
be prepared as a matter
of urgency.'</i>  [emphasis added]
<P>

219	Mr Booth accepted in cross-examination on this call note that he had been
told that the poor performance of ABE Fax had resulted
in it turning in an
operating loss of almost $2 million and that a profit before tax was expected
to exceed $2 million as a result
of the successful sale of the U-Bix Copiers
(N.Z.) shares.  He was then asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You remember I took you to that and the proceeds were approximately $6
million Australian.  Do you remember that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I do.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now if you knew that profit for the year was expected to exceed $2
million because of the successful sale of the shares you were
well aware,
weren't you, that the operating company's performance, the operating divisions
of the Group, had been very poor.  You
knew that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The operating companies had incurred losses, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.  And it took the very large amount of money produced by the sale of
the U-Bix (N.Z.) shares to turn it into a profit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I suggest to you you weren't overly concerned about that because it was
part of the normal way Mr Paola did business to sell assets,
earn a profit and
reduce debt?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'  </i>[T 444]
<P>

220	Mr Booth also accepted under cross-examination that he was aware that
during the year ended 30 June 1989, two new branches of
the NRS business had
been set up and that he knew that the operating loss for NRS was being ascribed
to the costs of setting up those
two new outlets.  He also, under
cross-examination on this note, accepted that he knew that he was being told
that ABE Holdings had
not earned a profit and that he had recorded that
budgeted profits were as set out at PX 512.  He also agreed that he drew a
distinction
between ABE Holdings and its budgeted loss of $700,000-odd, and ABE
Pastoral, and that he did this because he understood that ABE
Pastoral was
simply the rural operations of the Paola Group.  [T 445]
<P>

221	Mr Plante's evidence was that from about August 1989 it became apparent to
him that ABE Fax was not performing and was causing
a large drain on the
financial needs of the Group.  At the same time to his recollection,
Currabubula Holdings held a number of non-performing
assets in the nature of
land which was not producing a significant amount of cash.  [Statement para
31]
<P>

222	Under cover of facsimile letter dated 7 September 1989, Mr Plante forwarded
to Mr Booth, consolidated profit and loss accounts
and balance sheets for Paola
Holdings, ABE Holdings and Currabubula Holdings.  The NRS budget/cash flow for
`89/90 was also enclosed..
<P>

223	In referring to these documents, Mr Plante said:
<P>

	<i>`Those accounts show that for the Paola Holdings subsidiary companies there
was a reduction of non-current assets of receivables and
investments of
approximately $6 million with minor changes to other liabilities and asset
items.  This is reflected in the reduction
in net assets from $4.7 million to
-$1.8 million.  In that position, Paola Holdings Pty Limited and the subsidiary
companies are,
in the absence of any support from Currabubula Holdings to
provide security for the deficit, technically insolvent.  It also means
in
reality that at that point Paola Holdings itself was technically
insolvent.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Paragraph 9 Statement 14 December 1998]
<P>

224	On 14 September 1989, Mr Plante forwarded to Mr Booth group figures which
had apparently been requested.  The document at PX
530 through to 532 was
divided into a section dealing with the 1988/89 financial year and a further
section dealing with the 1989/90
budget.
<P>

225	Apropos the financial year ended 30 June 1989, the document recorded an
operating profit for the Paola Group of $1.73million
and for the Currabubula
Group of $0.51million, representing a total operating profit of
$2.24million.
<P>

226	Apropos the 1989/90 budget figures, the document forecast an operating
profit for the Paola Group of $0.89million and an operating
profit for the
Currabubula Group of $0.24million, resulting in a total estimated operating
profit of $1.13million.
<P>

227	A credit precis for the Group, prepared by Mr Booth and dated 13 September
1989, appears at PX 533.  This precis deals with
a proposed increase in the
bill acceptance/discount facility/overdraft limits from $5.5million to
$6.8million, taking a total of
existing facilities from $6,134,760 through to
$7,634,760.  The proposed increase was supported by Mr Booth.  [T 446]
<P>

228	The cover sheet to the credit precis at PX 533 includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`Fundamentally, we are quite comfortable with the proposed increased
facilities to the group.  We believe Mr Paola to be an astute
businessman, who
has done well with most of his ventures and faced decisions to "cut his losses"
when this becomes necessary.</i>
<P>

<i>	However I believe our debt will be full enough against security cover,
which is, after all quite specialised and not particularly
diverse.  We must
retain our comfort level.</i>
<P>

<i>	Also, Mr Paola has a lot of deals going at any point in time.  I am anxious
to avoid situation (sic) where we are requested to change
the terms of our
approval several more times after this annual review.</i>
<P>

<i>	With the above points in mind, the proposal carries my support subject
to:</i>
<P>

<i>	- Letter of offer containing a clause to the effect that the bank would not
expect to be approached for release of any further security
other than that
referred to in this submission during the term of facilities.'</i>
<P>

229	The above was written by Mr K.N. Owens as Acting Section Head Corporate
Finance Group.  [PX 533]  Mr Booth received back a copy
of Mr Owens' comments
with the Credit Precis.
<P>

230	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth accepted that he knew that following the
work he had done in producing the Credit Precis,
Mr Owens had said that `we are
quite comfortable with the proposed increased facilities'.  Fundamentally as he
recalled it, it was
business as usual in relation to the account.  He took Mr
Owens' comments as information from a senior officer about concern as to
the
way Mr Paola carried on business.  [T 446]
<P>

231	The `facilities required' section on PX 534 included the following:
<P>

	<i>	
 [ IMAGE ] </i>
<P>

<i>* Existing facilities to be combined into a multi-option facility
incorporating over cash and bill acceptance/discount options.</i>
<P>

<i>Related</i>
<P>

<i>Exposure:          Nil'</i>
<P>

232	Mr Booth was asked under cross-examination in relation to this section:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	. . . I want to suggest to you that for the first time you introduce
under the heading "Facilities required" reference to a multi-option
facility?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think that was one of the purposes of this submission yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.  And the existing facilities were to be combined into a multi
option facility.  To your understanding what was a multi option
facility?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	A facility that incorporated various drawing options within its
limit.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In relation to these various options, whose options were they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The borrowers.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The customers or the Bank's?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The customers . . .'  </i>[T 447]
<P>

233	The recommendation at PX 539 included:
<P>

	<i>`Approval be given for the conversion of the group's existing bill
acceptance/discount facility and Overdraft limits to a Multi Option
Facility
with drawing options including overdrafts, Cash Advances and Bill Acceptance
Discount Options.'</i>
<P>

234	Under cross-examination on the document, Mr Booth was shown the line entry
for working capital at PX 535 and the deficiencies
in working capital for
Currabubula Holdings and for Paola Holdings, recorded under the working capital
heading `For the years 1988
and 1989'.  For 1989, Currabubula Holdings is
recorded as having made net profit after tax of $7.862million but the Paola
Holdings
Group was recorded as having made a net loss of $5.588million.
<P>

235	The financial position commentary made the point that the financial summary
included in the document, had been provided from
unaudited draft accounts of
the primary holding companies of the Group and that insufficient detail was
available to enable a consolidation
of the accounts at that time.
<P>

236	The financial commentary made the point that: 
<P>

	<i>`. . . these accounts are however considerably distorted as a result of
inter-company transactions including inter-company loans (a
significant amount
of which were forgiven last year under a restructure which is described below).
They have also been distorted
by the transfer of extraordinary profits between
companies within the group . . .'.</i>
<P>

237	Remarks at PX 536 include:
<P>

	<i>`Analysis of the group's budgets and projected cash flow requirements
indicates the group will be unable to service all operating
expenses (including
of course, borrowing costs) and capital/expansion commitments at the same time.
This is the fundamental reason
for the proposed increase in facility
arrangements.'</i>
<P>

238	Under cross-examination in relation to so much of the document as referred
to the accounts being distorted, Mr Booth was asked
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You knew did you not in September 1989 that there had been a very
significant reordering of inter-company loans within the Paola
Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think I knew at the time of a - yes, I would have known at that time I
think of the liquidation of the company that included
forgiving a number of
inter-company loans.  Is that the question you are asking?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I am specifically asking about your knowledge of the inter-company loans
restructure.  As you say, in your paper, it is described
the loan.  You knew
that in the middle of the year there had been a significant rearrangement of
inter-company indebtedness within
the group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You referred to that as one of the factors supporting your view that the
financial position statement on PX 535 was considerably
distorted?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And in this passage coupled with the financial position you were telling
your senior officers, weren't you, that the accounts
and the accounting picture
was distorted, the accounting picture on the previous page/  that was
clear?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And yet of course the paper recommends, does it not, the increase in
facilities referred to on PX 534 from facilities of $5.5million
to
$6.8million?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In terms of the bill acceptance overdraft, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And I am suggesting to you that you felt comfortable recommending
approval of that increase to your superiors notwithstanding
that the accounts
for the Group showed or contained considerable distortions?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you felt that comfort I suggest to you because you viewed the
operations of Mr Paola's company as a group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In terms of measuring the performance of the operations yes, I did view
it as a group.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And thus if there was an inter-company forgiveness of a debt A to B it
didn't really matter to your mind if A forgave the debt
owed to it by B because
the total picture would remain the same?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You also referred to distortion of the financial statements and accounts
by the officer of extraordinary profits, do you see that,
between companies,
page PX 536?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you conclude that any ratio analysis would be misleading?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That was a ratio analysis of the financial statements wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And notwithstanding that the application of such an analysis would be
misleading, you felt comfortable in recommending the increase?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Again, won't you agree with me that this is because viewed in the global
you were happy or content with the position of the Paola
Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'    </i>[T 453-454]
<P>

239	Mr Booth was asked as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And did you note there for your superiors that Mr Paola's success was
due more to profits on sale of strategic investments than
from business
profits?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That is the comment I made.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you made that comment did you not to assist your superiors in the
Bank to approve the further advance being sought?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you made that comment because you wanted to point out to your
superiors that relevant fact to assist them to understand the
financial
position set out on PX 535?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  </i>[T 454]
<P>

240	The same document stated that as at that week, Mr Paola had appointed
Dalgety's as agents to handle the sale of Durhambone and
that he hoped to
achieve a price of at least $15million.
<P>

241	In Annexure `C', being a summary of recent activities of the Group and its
future plans and funding requirements, there is a
reference to ABE Holdings as
`the group's new chief rural operations organisation'.
<P>

242	Under the heading `ABE Holdings Limited', the following inter alia
appears:
<P>

	<i>`Under a restructure conducted last year ABE Holdings became the holding
company of all the Group's rural operations which comprise
the
following:</i>
<P>

<i>	- Northern Rural Services Pty Limited, the Group's farm service and supply
organisation</i>
<P>

<i>	- Campbell Rixon and Graham Pty Limited, a stock and station agency;</i>
<P>

<i>	- ABE Holdings Pastoral Division, which is responsible for the management
of all the Group's rural properties.</i>
<P>

<i>	Under this arrangement it is expected ABE Holdings will achieve operating
profits for the year ended 30 June 1990 in excess of $1million
. . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Future plans for ABE Holdings Limited include plans to relist the company
next year . . .'</i>
<P>

243	The cash flow annexed to the Bank's approval dated 13 September 1989,
recorded an estimated reduction in drawings to take place
between 30 November
1989 and 30 June 1990 from a facility of $6.8million to a facility of
$5.9million, that is to say was suggestive
of a positive cash flow and a
reduction in total facility of some $850,000.
<P>

244	In short, the Bank considered the application to increase the overall level
of borrowings of the Group by a further $1.5million,
the Bank's review being
based upon unaudited draft accounts showing an after tax profit for the 30 June
1989 financial year of in
excess of $2million and showing projected profits for
the year ended 30 June 1990 as $1.13million after tax.  The additional facility
was required because the cash flow could not both provide capital for expansion
as well as service the debt.
<P>

245	The proposal was also to combine existing facilities into a multi-option
facility incorporating overdraft, cash and bill acceptance/discount
options.
[PX 534]
<P>

246	In September 1989, Mr Booth received from Mr Brennan a note on the Paola
Group of Companies, reading inter alia:  
<P>

	<i>`Whilst we remain well covered in a security sense on traditional lending
margins we are always reacting to rather than planning with
Mr Paola.</i>
<P>

<i>	I understand the difficulties of communication with country clientele but
we </i><cite>need</cite><i> to place more emphasis on relationship management
of this account, which may limit future surprises . . .''  </i>[PX 578] 
<P>

247	By letter dated 22 September 1989, addressed by the Bank to Paola Holdings
and to Currabubula Holdings, the Bank advised inter
alia as follows:
<P>

	<i>`. . . an interim review of facilities to Currabubula Holdings Pty Limited,
Paola Holdings Pty Limited and its subsidiaries (`the
Group') . . . has been
noted as satisfactory and approval has been given for the following variations
to existing arrangements:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	The conversion of the Group's existing Bill Acceptance/Discount Facility
and Overdraft Limits to a Multi-Option Facility with
drawing options including
Overdrafts, Cash Advances and Bill Acceptance/Discount Options.</i>
<P>

<i>	2,	Approval be given for an increase in existing facilities by $1,500,000
making the proposed Multi Option Facility limit $6,800,000
and the DLC limit
$300,000.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	The bank to release from its equitable mortgage and floating charge the
property known as `Camelon'.'</i>
<P>

248	Mr Booth was asked whether he remembered that Mr Plante had asked on a
number of occasions to convert overdraft facilities into
bill facilities and he
accepted that this had occurred.  The purpose of paragraph 1 he said was to
give the Paola Group the option
to draw the funds currently in overdraft in
other forms within those forms described.  [T 455-456]
<P>

249	The facility letter advised that the facility amounts were to be:
<P>

	Multi Option Facility	$6,800,000
<P>

	DLC Limit	$300,000
<P>

	Leases (current balance)	$519,175
<P>

	Guarantees (current balance)	<u>$15,585</u>
<P>

		$7,634,760
<P>

250	The letter provided that all facilities were `to be subject to annual
review next due by 31 October 1990 or earlier on availability
of audited
accounts of the group'.
<P>

251	The facility letter included as a term and condition `immediate review in
the event of a material adverse change in the financial
condition or change in
ownership of the Group'.
<P>

252	The letter included the following:
<P>

	<i>`All other terms and conditions as described in the Bank's Letter of Offer
dated 18 November 1988 and 4 September 1987 are to continue
to apply unless the
provisions herein are inconsistent.  In such case the provisions herein shall
prevail.'</i>
<P>

253	In September 1989, Mr Paola negotiated the purchase of the Maxi Yacht
`Condor of Bermuda' to be financed through Barclays Bank.
 The property Camelon
was released to permit this acquisition.  [Mr Booth's statement 20 November
1996 para 20]
<P>

254	The Property Manager of Dalgety Winchcombe FGC wrote to Mr Paola at ABE
Travel by letter dated 26 September 1989 referring to
a meeting with Mr Paola
in Sydney since which there had been quite a bit of action on the Collarenebri
properties', and referring
to a video then being completed.  The Collarenebri
properties included Durhambone.
<P>

255	On 12 October 1989, a meeting took place between Mr Paola, Mr Plante, Mr
Swinburne and Mr Booth.  Mr Booth's call note reads
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The primary purpose of the meeting was to verify whether Paola's forecast
funding requirements were about to change given variations
already apparent
from budgetted (sic) cash flows for the 1988/89 financial year and the
likelihood of diminished farm revenues later
in the year as a result of current
condition.  [sic]</i>
<P>

<i>	Detailed budget revisions were not available at this time but summaries
prepared for the meeting indicated the following:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Despite current seasonal conditions Mr Paola sees no reason to amend the
farming budgets.  The wheat harvest, whilst now expected
to be well below
optimum level, will still produce the revenues forecast in the earlier budgets.
All wheat production on the farms
is on a long fallow basis and accordingly is
not expected to suffer moisture stress to a significant extent.  It is however
too early
to tell whether the summer crops now being planted (sunflowers,
maize, soybeans and sorghum) will be affected by the current dry
spell.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	ABE Fax sales however are continuing at levels well below forecast
resulting in a neutral cash flow as against the positive flow
forecast.</i>
<P>

<i>	As a result ABE Fax's level of debt remains approximately $600,000 above
forecast.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is the Fax business where Mr. Paola is now focusing most of this
attention.  In fact he will be contacting us within 2 weeks to
inform us of the
results of an independent account's investigation upon which he will be making
a decision on the future of that
company.</i>
<P>

<i>	Because of ABE Fax's continuing under performance revised forecasts now
indicate group debt requirements of up to $660,000 above
current Bank limits by
January (current limits are $6.8 million and are now fully drawn).</i>
<P>

<i>	This of course depends on Mr Paola's decision next week.  Should ABE Fax
continue in its present form overall group borrowing will
however be back
within existing limits come February next year.  This is because Mr Paola now
has in train the following proposals:</i>
<P>

<i>	- The sale and leaseback of industrial properties in Narrabri and Moree
(expected to occur by end December).</i>
<P>

<i>	- The sale of the jet aircraft which is now planned to occur by end
February.</i>
<P>

<i>	- The sale of "Elimatta" a 1,700 acre property at Bellata which has been
sold for $460,000 (50% of which is on a delayed repayment
basis).</i>
<P>

<i>	- Mr Paola is </i><cite>already negotiating with parties interested in
Durhambone which he hopes to sell within the year</cite><i> for around $15
million.  Dalgety's has been appointed as agent.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst the first 3 of the above will ensure borrowings stay within existing
limits the latter will of course have the capacity to
repay the Bank in
full.</i>
<P>

<i>	Other matters of interest included:</i>
<P>

<i>	- Discussions appear to be underway between Northern Rural Services and
Seed &amp; Grains Sales over possible mutually beneficial
opportunities that
may exist.</i>
<P>

<i>	- Mr Paola at this time has not yet finalised negotiations with Mitsubishi
however budgets now include a $1.2 million payment being
made in March 1990 in
full repayment of the present $ 3 million debt.</i>
<P>

<i>	- Further meetings being planned include a visit to Currabubula early
November.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>Follow-Up Action</b></i>
<P>

<i>	Annual review to be undertaken on receipt of audited 89 accounts and
detailed revised budgets.  By that time Mr Paola's decision
on the future of
ABE Fax will have been made.</i>
<P>

	<b>October 1989 - Voluntary Winding Up of ABE</b>
<P>

256	On 6 October 1989, a liquidator was appointed to Automated Business
Equipment, a non-operating company through a voluntary winding
up.
<P>

	<b>Insolvency of ABE Fax</b>
<P>

257	Mr Booth recalled that in about mid-October 1989 on a date he could not
precisely recall, he learned that ABE Fax was in serious
financial trouble.  He
could not recall attending the meeting referred to in paragraph 18 of Mr
Paola's affidavit but recalled that
at about this time he was informed that ABE
Fax was in serious trouble and that the Bank should consider appointing a
receiver. 
[Para 22 Booth's Statement, 20 November 1996]
<P>

258	At that time Mr Booth was not overly concerned with the apparent insolvency
of ABE Fax in respect to the Bank's security position
at the time.
<P>

259	Mr Booth had noted that the Paola Group was at all material times set up so
that ABE Holdings which later became ABE Holdings
Pty Limited, was a
non-trading, but holding company for other companies and properties in the
Paola Group of Companies.  On the other
hand, he recalled that ABE Fax was
neither a holding company nor one which he at any time considered to be one of
Paola's `core'
companies which were those companies concerned with Mr Paola's
farming businesses.  [Mr Booth's statement 20 November 1996 para 25]
<P>

260	None the less, Mr Booth's evidence was that the insolvency of ABE Fax was a
surprise to him.  His evidence was that he was aware
that the business had some
troubles but that until being informed by Mr Paola or Mr Silvia of Ferrier
Hodgson that ABE Fax was insolvent,
he had not known how serious its problems
were.  He recalled speaking to Mr Paola about the insolvency of ABE Fax on a
day he could
not precisely recall but in or about November or December 1989
when Mr Paola said to him words to the effect `I regret not staying
active in
Fax.  I had hired other managers to take it over but they let it go'.  [Booth's
Statement 20 November 1996 para 26]
<P>

261	At about the same time as this conversation, namely in about November or
December 1989, Mr Booth gave evidence that he recalled
feeling concerned about
the Bank's relationship with the Paola Group and that his concern was that the
Bank was not being fully informed
at all times of significant financial
decisions being made within the Group.  His evidence was that he often learned
what Mr Paola
was doing after the event.
<P>

262	On the day following the meeting, Mr Booth wrote to Mr Chris Smith,
Corporate Finance Solicitors of the Bank, advising inter
alia as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Following a meeting with Paola yesterday, we are now assured he is
prepared to accept our letter of offer of 22 September '89 . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	I have however discovered a flaw in my offer.  The latest approval contains
a multi-option facility but the letter of offer and the
previous letters on
which I also relied do not adequately cover these options (note present
drawings are bills and ODLs only).</i>
<P>

<i>	I believe an amending agreement or even a full facility agreement should be
now considered.  Could you advise? . . .'    </i>[Exhibit PX 618]
<P>

263	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth accepted that he first reviewed the offer
letter of 22 September before writing the minute,
then formed the view that
there was a flaw in the facility letter and the opinion that the flaw was such
that the offer letter was
inadequate.  He further agreed that the inadequacy
was such that he felt that the terms of the offer letter of 22nd September and
previous offer letters were inadequate to deal with the Multi Option Facility,
and that this was why he suggested in the last paragraph
of his memorandum to
Mr Smith, that an amending agreement or full facility agreement should be
considered.  [T 457]
<P>

264	On 25 October 1989, a meeting took place between Mr Plante and Messrs Owens
and Booth, following Mr Paola's announcement during
the previous week of an
intent to wind up ABE Fax.
<P>

265	The Bank's Call Report [PX 622] identified the purpose of the meeting as
`to discuss banking arrangements in light of Mr Paola's
announcement . . . to
wind up ABE Fax' and included the following:
<P>

	<i>`The possibility of winding up ABE FAX was first disclosed to the Bank on
12 October 1989.  The decision however was not made til
20 October 1989.  This
decision was based on the conclusions of recent investigations by both Mr Paola
and external accountants which
revealed that despite improved performance over
the past five months the company was unlikely to return satisfactory profits in
the
foreseeable future especially in view of outstanding claims of a certain
creditor who in Mr Paola's view was partially responsible
for ABE Fax's recent
performance . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Book debts to Mitsubishi presently amount to $3.045million and whilst Mr
Paola has negotiated a reduction to $1.208million it is
now Mr Paola's plan to
wind up the company before this payment falls due.</i>
<P>

<i>	To manage the winding up Mr Paola has retained the services of Brian Silvia
of Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Future Arrangements</cite>
<P>

<i>	Whilst no conclusions can be drawn at this stage it is possible that the
bank will be asked to continue funding the group at present
facility levels
($7.6million in total) over the remainder of the financial year.  Whether or
not the group can adequately service
this level of borrowings from the
remaining operations depends entirely on how the season progresses in
north-west NSW.  A continuation
of the current dry spell past mid-November will
necessitate a review of all the rural operations budgets and should this occur
it
is unlikely the Group will be able to service debts of this magnitude.  . .
.'</i>
<P>

266	Under cross-examination in relation to this document and the relevant
meeting, Mr Booth conceded that he knew at the meeting
that the Paola Group was
considering winding up ABE Fax;  that he knew that this was because an external
accountant's report had
revealed that although its performance had improved in
recent months, it was unlikely to return satisfactory profits;  that he knew
that there was a creditor who was causing `trouble';  that he knew that the
company had returned an operating loss as recorded of
$1.9million;  that he
knew in October 1989 that ABE Fax had been one of the two new businesses which
he had referred to in January
and September 1989 in his credit precis, the
other being the NRS business;  that he had recorded that those were in effect
the two
new businesses which it was hoped would replace the photocopier
business that had formerly been operated;   that he knew that the
only
operations producing any significant revenue were the ABE Fax operation, NRS
and the pastoral operation;  and that he knew in
October 1989 that there was
significant trouble in relation to one of the revenue producing businesses of
the Group.  He agreed that
he had recorded the view that whether or not the
Group could adequately service the level of borrowings, that is to say the
present
facility from the remaining operations, depended entirely on how the
season progressed in the north-west of New South Wales.  As
a general statement
he agreed that, when he used the words `the season progresses' he meant whether
it was a successful or unsuccessful
season for wheat and other rural products.
He agreed that his opinion in October as at the date of this meeting, was that
ABE Fax
was obviously in considerable trouble and not producing significant
revenue and that the ability of the Group to service its current
loans depended
on how the rural season `panned out'.  He agreed that in October 1989
notwithstanding the above difficulties `It never
crossed [his] mind to appoint
receivers to the Group or to recommend the same'.  His evidence was `No, we
would not have contemplated
it then'.  [T 458-460]
<P>

267	ABE Fax (by Mr Plante) wrote to the Bank on 26 October 1989 advising that
Mr Silvia of Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co had been appointed
to advise `in relation
to the trading and cash position difficulties that the company is currently
facing'.
<P>

268	Mr Plante advised that after receiving Mr Silvia's report, a copy of which
was enclosed, `we are of the opinion that a controlled
downtrade is no longer
feasible'.  Effectively the appointment of a receiver was viewed as the only
alternative left to the company.
<P>

269	Mr Silvia's report in the form of a letter from the National Consulting
Group of 26 October 1989, noted that Mitsubishi was
attempting to have a
provisional liquidator appointed to the company, the effect of which might be
to the detriment of the company's
secured creditor, being the State Bank.  The
recommendation was that the company approach the State Bank `as a matter of
urgency
and request the immediate appointment of a receiver'.  [PX 631]
<P>

270	On 27 October 1989, the additional facilities outlined in the Bank's letter
of 22 September 1989 were formally accepted by a
signed notice of
acceptance.
<P>

271	Mr Booth's evidence was that in and about November and December 1989, the
then existing Facility Agreement with the Paola Group
of Companies of
$7.634million was being overdrawn and that this, coupled with the receivership
of ABE Fax had several effects:
<P>

	(a)	first, by overdrawing the overdraft, penalty interest was being incurred
on the Paola accounts,  and
<P>

	(b)	second, the receivership of ABE Fax required the Bank to reassess its
security position and reconsider its exposure to the
entire Paola Group before
implementing a Bill Facility Agreement.
<P>

272	Mr Booth gave evidence that at about that time Mr Paola said to him `When
are you going to put us on a lower interest rate structure'
and that he replied
`We still have to sort out problems with the Bank's security arrangements, in
terms of the current position of
the Paola Group'.  [Para 28 of Mr Booth's
Statement of 20 November 1996]
<P>

273	Mr Booth's further evidence was that he was also concerned about a chain
reaction, where the collapse of one company may trigger
the collapse of others
within the Paola Group and that he wanted to ensure that the Bank was in a
position to cope with this if it
occurred.  [Statement para 29]
<P>

	<b>November 1989</b>
<P>

274	On 3 November 1989, Mr Booth recommended the appointment of a receiver to
ABE FAX, noting the lodgment by Konica as major unsecured
creditor of a Section
364 Notice, returnable on 16 November 1989.  Mr Booth's note includes the
following:
<P>

	<i>`We believe that ABE Fax is not in a position to defend the application and
accordingly the likely effect of such a move will be the
appointment by the
courts of a provisional liquidator.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the interests of the bank maintaining some control over the realisation
of ABE Fax's assets it is recommended that the bank commence
recovery action.
Such action to include the immediate service of a letter of demand in
accordance with the Bank's Solicitors' recommendations
then, if appropriate,
the appointment of a receiver/manager . . .'</i>
<P>

275	Exhibit PX page 654 makes plain that it was the Group's request that a
receiver be appointed to ABE Fax.
<P>

276	On 7 November 1989, the Bank forwarded a formal notice of demand to ABE Fax
identifying the facilities then in place, and identifying
clause 2 of the
Equitable Mortgage under which the moneys were payable on demand and clause
24.1 of the Equitable Mortgage under
which the Bank was entitled to demand
payment of the moneys secured by the Equitable Mortgage if a petition was
lodged for the winding
up of ABE Fax.
<P>

277	The Bank advised inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Under the Facility Agreement the Bank is entitled to declare the
facilities immediately due and payable should certain events occur
and be
continuing.  The Bank has determined that the events set out in sub-paragraph
(vi) and (vii) on page 5 of the Bank's letter
of 4 September 1987 have occurred
and are continuing.</i>
<P>

<i>	By virtue of the occurrence and continuance of the events of default set
out in the previous paragraph the obligations of the bank
under the Facility
Agreement to provide any further facilities to Fax are hereby cancelled.</i>
<P>

<i>	The bank hereby demands repayment under both the Facility Agreement and the
Equitable Mortgage for the facilities provided to Fax
. . . Unless the sum of
$1,515,405 together with interest costs and fees accruing from 2 November 1989
to the date of payment is
paid to the Bank . . . on or before . . . 8 November
1989 the Bank will pursue such rights and remedies as are available to
it.'</i>
<P>

278	The letter of demand was signed by both Mr Booth and Mr Swinburne.
<P>

279	By letter dated 8 November 1989, ABE Fax wrote to the Bank stating that Mr
Plante believed the company to be in default of its
borrowings from the Bank
and confirming that the company would not be able to comply with the request
for repayment of the facility
by 3pm on that date.
<P>

	<b>ABE Fax in Receivership</b>
<P>

280	On 10 November 1989, a receiver and manager (Mr Brian Silvia) was appointed
to ABE Fax.
<P>

281	It was put to Mr Booth in cross-examination that on the appointment of a
receiver to ABE Fax in November 1989, the receiver
opened a bank account in the
State Bank for ABE Fax In Receivership.  The answer was `I can say they would
have done'.
<P>

282	It was put to Mr Booth that it was normal practice for a Bank appointed
receiver to open an account in the Bank appointing him
or her for the benefit
of their use pending on transmission.  Mr Booth accepted that this was
normal.
<P>

283	It was put to Mr Booth at transcript 474 that the receivers of ABE Fax
received as time went by, considerable sums of money
from their efforts in
relation to the receivership and Mr Booth said that this had occurred from
realisation of assets by the receivers.
 He accepted also that those funds were
put into the receivers account for ABE Fax within the State Bank.  [T 474]  Mr
Booth also
accepted that funds received by the receiver were not deposited into
the ABE Fax account at North Ryde that had been used by the
Company prior to
the appointment of the receivership.
<P>

284	Mr Plante recalled that after ABE Fax had gone into receivership, he was
aware that ABE Fax was carrying a balance of drawings
which effectively gave
the Group a `credit' of unused drawings.  [Statement 27 October 1998, para
34]
<P>

285	Up until the end of 1989, many accounts had of course been prepared in
respect of different companies in the Group and in respect
of the Group itself
and Mr Plante had a role in relation to many of those if not all.  [T
241-242]
<P>

286	Under cross-examination, Mr Plante accepted that leaving aside ABE Fax
which had particular problems, all of the accounts were
prepared on the basis
that the company or group was a going concern which to his mind necessarily
implied that Currabubula Holdings
would be supporting the company or group.  [T
242]
<P>

287	On 15 November 1989, Mr Booth recommended that ABE Fax, then in
receivership, have a `W3 Watch List' classification.  Mr Booth
accepted that in
considering a recommendation for ABE Fax in this way, he did not think it
necessary to recommend a W3 classification
for other companies in the Group.
[T462]
<P>

288	That recommendation by Mr Booth was supported by Mr Owens as Acting Section
Head and confirmed by Mr Cambridge, then Chief Manager
of the Corporate Finance
Group.
<P>

289	Mr Booth accepted that in November 1989, there was a system in place for
watch list reporting.  He was taken through Exhibit
P17, a State Bank
confidential memorandum to managers, entitled `Lending - Watch List Reporting',
dated 16 March 1990 and accepted
that he would have had a document similar to
that to guide him in his recommendation for W3 status for ABE Fax.
<P>

290	Exhibit P17 includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>W3 Classification - Actual Problem Loan</cite>
<P>

<i>	W3 accounts are those which have defined problems that have the potential
to jeopardise repayment.  The loan is under regular review
and corrective
action has been initiated.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Action Required</cite>
<P>

<i>	Appropriate action as described for W2 classification must have been
undertaken. </i>[I interpolate that this action for W2 classified accounts was
- "Evaluation of the risks should be undertaken and a recommendation
for
appropriate action implemented or made to line management."]
<P>

<i>	At this stage the account manager must recommend (or have recommended when
the account was categorised as W2) which of three broad
strategies are to be
adopted i.e.:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	request repayment or refinance;</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	attempt restructure of the loan;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	liquidate.</i>
<P>

<i>	Security documentation should have been checked for enforceability and
security valuations are to be updated wherever appropriate.
 Both aspects are
to be confirmed in watch list reporting procedure.'</i>
<P>

291	The W4 classification was, so Mr Booth accepted, where there was a
perception that the debt could be a doubtful debt for recovery
and the W5
classification was where the account has been classified as a bad and doubtful
debt.  Specifically, Exhibit P17 in referring
to W4 accounts read:  `W4
accounts are those which have been confirmed "non-performing" by line
management'.
<P>

292	Mr Booth agreed that the W3 classification he was recommending for ABE Fax
was simply that it was an account with defined problems
that had the potential
to jeopardise repayment leading to the loan being under regular review.  His
recommendation in November 1989
was not for a W4 or W5 classification for ABE
Fax and his superiors accepted his recommendation and confirmed it.  [T 463]
<P>

293	On 16 November 1989 the Regional Valuer, Mr Miller, prepared a document by
way of revised valuations of Currabubula Holdings
Pty Limited properties which,
in relation to Durhambone at PX 711, said:
<P>

	<i>`Said to comprise approximately 25,000 ha.  This aggregation of properties
has not been inspected by the writer however, it is known
to be first class
country with all necessary improvements with grain storage terminals adjacent
and nearby.  Mr Paola is attempting
to sell this holding for $17 million WIWO.
Due to his method of marketing a figure in this vicinity may even eventuate,
however,
for Bank purposes it would be wise to adopt a figure of $10 million
(ex stock and plant).  It is recommended that this amount be
adopted.'  [PX
712]</i>
<P>

294	Mr Booth recalled having paid fairly close attention to communications
about security values from Mr Miller.  [T 464]
<P>

295	By letter dated 23 November 1989 from the Bank to the Paola Group, the Bank
advised that its solicitor had recently recommended
a structural change to the
present facility arrangements and included in the proposal currently being
prepared, so the Bank advised,
would be:
<P>

	<i>`A requirement that all future facility arrangements be made through a
single borrowing entity.'</i>
<P>

296	The letter advised that in the meantime, Mr Booth had made arrangements for
overdraft limits to be increased in line with the
amounts approved, the
relevant approval constituting an increase from $4.7million to $6.1million.
[PX 718]
<P>

297	In being referred to this letter, Mr Booth gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	I want to suggest to you that that is another expression of your
concern that the offer letter of 22 September 1989 was not sufficient
to fully
deal with all the issues between the borrowing group and the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Are you asking that the letter being referred to individual companies
and individual facilities did not encompass a single facility
to the Group?  I
think I would agree with you on that, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.  Didn't you also feel that the arrangements put in place by the
letter of 22 September 1989 were not sufficiently detailed
for a multi option
facility?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>  [T 464]
<P>

298	By late 1989, a mini drought was experienced in the area serviced by NRS.
By this point in time debtors of NRS were increasing
and sales reducing.
<P>

299	In his statement of 5 November 1998, Mr Paola gave the following
evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Towards the end of 1989, the stock and station agent business operated by
Campbell, Rixon and Graham had closed.  The Group had also
closed the grain
trading division of Northern Rural Services at Moree and looking to reduce the
debtors of both those companies in
order to reduce the need for bank
funds.</i>
<P>

<i>	The bank was aware of a proposed restructure of Northern Rural Services
business which was taking place at about the end of 1989
which arose as a
result of a mini drought leading to a poorer than expected trading result . . .
the intention of the restructure
was to match trading stock levels to sales and
reduce the level of stock managed by ABE Pastoral Division on Currabubula lands
to
reduce the amount of demand on bank debt to reduce the debt to $7.5 million
by the end of May 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was becoming apparent at the end of 1989 that Northern Rural Services
may be a drain on the resources of the Group in that its
debtors were beginning
to increase in circumstances where the area was suffering a mini drought which
would affect peoples' ability
to pay.  The debtors in turn had to be funded by
increased borrowings from the bank.  This was part of the reason why the group
borrowing
increased to a level of $8.5 million in February 1990.'</i>
<P>

300	Mr Owens' comments on a corporate finance group submission of 27 November
1989 includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`As outlined in this submission, Mr Paola's ABE Fax business failed
absolutely and unsecured creditors will receive nothing, apart
from one
particular Japanese trading company which is in possession of a personal
guarantee from Mr Paola.  In effect, we are being
requested to fund Mr Paola's
liability in this regard.  He is attempting to retain his business reputation
by compensating unsecured
creditors in some way.  As these plans are yet to be
formulated he is unable to divulge details to us at this stage, but assures
us
that there will be no impact at all upon his borrowing arrangements with the
bank.  Whilst we feel he might have taken appropriate
action earlier, events
did appear to move very quickly and he made the necessary decision himself and
asked the Bank to appoint a
receiver/manager after first appointing Brian
Silvia to investigate the company, its value, prospects and options.</i>
<P>

<i>	The sale of ABE Fax and the aircraft should, in due course, remove what was
a very considerable drain on cash flow and management
resources.  With respect
to the remaining rural businesses capacity to generate sufficient cash flow to
service proposed borrowings,
the Regional Valuer has inspected relative budgets
and is confident that projections will be comfortably achievable.</i>
<P>

<i>	I take considerable comfort from Mr Paola's decision to personally
re-examine expenditure budgets for all his ongoing business operations
. .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Ultimately, sale proceeds of Durhambone should reduce borrowings to a level
which is very comfortably serviceable.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[PX 720/832]
<P>

301	Mr Cambridge, the chief manager corporate finance group added in
handwriting, the following to the submission at PX 720/832:
<P>

	<i>`The bank is going into a transitional phase while we await the
restructuring of Mr Paola's group.  Mr initial reaction was to decline
his
request for funds, but (illegible) this may have endangered the group's
situation.  Supported.'</i>
<P>

302	The credit precis, the subject of these remarks prepared by Mr Booth,
identifies the application for increased facility as a
proposed increase of the
`Multi-Option Facility' from $6.8million to $9 million resulting in a total
facility increase from $7.6million
to $9.5million.  [PX 833]
<P>

303	It seems clear enough from the Bank's internal document at PX 721/833 that
the Bank at this point in time was regarding the
facility as a Multi-Option
Facility.
<P>

304	The general remarks at PX 724/836 included the following:
<P>

	<i>`There is however another issue which will effect present funding
arrangements.</i>
<P>

<i>	A Japanese trading company by the name of Okura is another of the major
unsecured creditors.'  ABE Fax presently has outstanding
debts to the order of
$1.65million to Okura.  As a result of Mr Paola's longstanding relationship
with that company Mr Paola has
personally guaranteed this debt and consequently
has asked the Bank to consider funding the obligation under the existing
interlocking
security arrangements covering most of the companies of the Group.
Note, repayment is to be made by another of Mr Paola's companies
(ABE Holdings)
and there is no danger of it being deemed a preference payment by other ABE Fax
creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	The combined effect of the above will require a net increase of $1million
on present facility levels.  However in the intervening
period until the
remaining assets of ABE Fax can be realised an increase of $2.6million could be
necessary on the Multi-Option Facility.'</i>
<P>

305	Under the head `Projected Performance', the following appears:
<P>

	<i>`Adjustments to present budgets have been made as a result of:</i>
<P>

<i>	. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	 - Changes to expected farm returns</i>
<P>

<i>	Seasonal conditions presently being experienced in the North-West have
necessitated changes to the crop programme originally budgeted
for the farms .
. . The Bank's Regional Valuer has reviewed the budgets and has recommended a
downward revision of expected revenue
from $2.9million to $2.6million.  This
will result in operating profits for the Pastoral Division of around $300,000
for the year
ended 30 June 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	- Poorer than expected performance from NRS.</i>
<P>

<i>	Seasonal conditions have also affected sales of the farm supply division.
Current revenues are down 15% on budget and have resulted
in a break-even
result for the quarter to 30 September 1989.  Original budgets indicated an
operating profit of $400,000 over the
year.  Given a return to more normal
conditions it is expected that profits will return to budgetted [sic] levels
and a profit of
$300,000 will be achievable. . . .'</i>
<P>

306	The same document included inter alia the following:
<P>

Future Arrangements
<P>

	<i>`It is not expected that the Bank will be asked to provide facilities of
this magnitude in the longer term past 30 June next year.
 In recent
discussions Mr Paola has expressed concern about the level of debt the
remaining companies will be carrying.  To remedy
this situation he has
announced his intention to sell his major rural property, `Durhambone', which
was placed on the market two
weeks ago.</i>
<P>

<i>	Durhambone is a 25,000 ha prime farming property located near Collarenebri.
The Bank's Regional Valuer considers this property (ex
stock and plant) to be
worth at least $10million.  Whilst the complexities of marketing such a
property make it difficult to set
a firm sale date Mr Paola is confident the
property will be sold within 12 months.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the meantime Mr Paola </i><cite>has introduced stringent borrowing
controls on all his businesses including centralised account management and
purchasing and limitations
on authority of branches to make payment for goods
and services</cite><i> (existing decentralised borrowing arrangements are to be
replaced by a single centralised loan facility with each of the
divisions/borrowing
companies operating on an impress system).'   </i>[Emphasis
added]
<P>

307	The same document under the heading `Projected performance' included the
following:
<P>

	<i>A detailed analysis of the Group's budget and cash flow projections was
done in the review of September 1989.  These budgets have
been adjusted in view
of subsequent developments which are detailed below.  Overall however it is
expected the Group will achieve
at least a break-even result for the year ended
30 June 1990.</i>
<P>

308	It was pointed out to Mr Booth that the paper contained the above-described
references to projected performance for the Group
and he accepted that he
adjusted budgets that had been provided to him as a result of the matters he
set out and had noted immediately
the decision to wind up ABE Fax and then that
there was an expected sale of the jet aircraft for March 1990.  He accepted
that he
had then referred to seasonal conditions being experienced in the
north-west and was then asked as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	[As to the seasonal conditions] which you say necessitated changes to
the crop programme but they were changes which were deleterious
to the
profitability of those operations.  It wasn't an improvement in short?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I am not sure.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well if you read the rest of the paragraph to help you you will see that
there was a tour by the corporate finance group and the
valuer and then a
downward revision was recommended do you see that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The other matter was the poorer than expected performance from RNR that
you recall?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Revenues of 15% down on budget, Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Finally you note that the costs of borrowing had increased.  Now won't
you agree with me Mr Booth that notwithstanding all those
matters you
recommended the increase in the facility?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And I want to suggest to you that the reason why you did that was that
you were perfectly comfortable because of the value of
the securities being
provided by the Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I - no.  I can't agree.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you have enough confidence in the trading operations of the Group
producing enough revenue to service the debts as at 27 November
1989?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.'    </i>[T 466]
<P>

309	At transcript 467 Mr Booth accepted that he knew perfectly well that the
comfort which the Bank felt in approving the increase
at this time was based
upon the ability to sell assets to reduce debts and ultimately repay the Bank.
He also accepted that his November
1989 review concluded with his
recommendation for a loan quality rating of LQ2 which was made notwithstanding
all of the matters
referred to in the report, including NRS being down on
budget and the like.   [T 467]
<P>

310	In the same document under the heading `Risk Assessment', the `cons'
included:
<P>

	<i>`Should the companies of the group experience a further deterioration in
financial condition the Group will be unable to service the
proposed level of
borrowings from internally generated funds.  Should this occur however we are
confident that Mr Paola will be prepared
to renegotiate the sale of sufficient
assets to remedy the situation.'</i>
<P>

311	The document at PX 722 set out the financial position which included a
deficiency in working capital for the combined Currabubula
Holdings and Paola
Holdings companies of $3.335million which was up from a deficiency in 1988 of
$0.995million.
<P>

312	The recommendation in the document was that annual review of facilities `to
Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd, Paola Holdings Pty
Ltd and its subsidiary
companies' be noted and that approval be given for an increase in the Group's
Multi-Option Facility to $9
million making overall facilities $9,519,175.
<P>

313	The `Security' section of the document included a suggestion that existing
facility documents be replaced by a facility agreement
to be prepared by the
Bank's solicitor.
<P>

314	Annexure `C' to the document was described in the document as `Revised
Forecast Cash Flow'.  It had been received from the Group.
 Mr Booth accepted
that he had closely studied this cash flow forecast and had factored in the
conclusions he drew from that analysis
in his report.  He had no difficulty
understanding the document in the light of his training.  The document was in
the form set out
in Appendix 4.
<P>

315	It relevantly recorded total drawings in December 1989 of $8.241million and
total drawings in June 1990 of $6.616million.  It
showed a positive cash flow
from December 1989 through to June 1990.
<P>

316	Mr Booth was asked to look at the third last line from the bottom of the
page entitled `ABE Jet'.  He was asked to agree that
the figures on that line
represented the sale of the aircraft that was discussed in the body of the
credit paper proper.  He had
some difficulty in recollecting his understanding
at the time but did accept at transcript 471 that as at November 1989 he had no
expectation that the ABE jet operation was going to be a producer of
significant revenue from its own operations.  He had of course
recorded the jet
charter business as being wound down.  [PX 724]
<P>

317	Mr Booth accepted that it was his analysis of the cash flow projections and
the budgets he referred to in the paper that produced
his conclusion that a
break-even result was likely for the year ended 30 June 1990.  [T 471]  Mr
Booth could not immediately or quickly
reconcile the line entry for ABE Jet on
PX 731 with the passages in the text of his credit summary about ABE Jet.  [T
472]
<P>

318	The loan quality assessment sheet prepared at 27 November 1989 identified
the Group as having an assessed rating under the `Default
Risk' - (capacity to
service or repay debt) of LQ3.  The `Credit Risk' and `Management Rating'
remained LQ2 as previously.
<P>

319	In the result, the Group's Multi Option Facility was increased to $8.5
million making overall facilities:
<P>

	Leases	519,175
<P>

	Multi Option Facility	<u>8,500,000</u>
<P>

		9,019,175
<P>

320	The Credit Committee's decision is reported in PX 831 which reads as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`Credit Committee views the position of the account with concern;  and
after considering the submission it was RESOLVED to APPROVE:</i>
<P>

<i>	.	to note the annual review of facilities to Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd,
Paola Holdings Pty Ltd and its subsidiary companies;</i>
<P>

<i>	.	to provide an increase in the Group's Multi-Option Facility to $8.5
million making overall facilities as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>			AUD M</i>
<P>

<i>		Leases	519,175</i>
<P>

<i>		Multi-Option Facility	</i><cite>8,500,000</cite>
<P>

<i>			9,019,175</i>
<P>

<i>	SUBJECT TO:</i>
<P>

<i>	.	a complete review by 31 March 1990;</i>
<P>

<i>	.	LQ3 rating.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Cambridge advised members that the Bank's Senior Solicitor is to confirm
that the new security arrangements do not put SBN in
a position where SBN would
be vulnerable to preference claims.'</i>
<P>

321	Mr Booth recalled reading this document.
<P>

322	It was put to Mr Booth that the LQ3 rating was one which indicated that an
account bore close examination.  He could not recall
precisely what that rating
then meant.
<P>

323	It was put to Mr Booth that the Bank had procedures at all times while he
was an account manager for the classification of a
loan as `non-accrual' and he
agreed that classifying a loan as non-accrual meant that the Bank no longer
accrued interest on the
principal and interest then outstanding.  Mr Booth
accepted that if an account was classed as non-accrual then it was in serious
trouble.  He was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	If an account was classed as non-accrual?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That it is in serious trouble yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, and the Bank in effect is saying we can't expect the payment of any
more interest or principal perhaps as well by this borrower
and we should stop
treating ourselves as having earned interest on this loan?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't think that is accurate.  I think not expecting it.  It is
possible that it won't be received.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.  One hopes for the best and perhaps one sues the borrower and gets
all the money back, but would you agree with me classifying
a loan as
non-accrual means that certainly for the present time in terms of the Bank's
accounting and thus its own profit the Bank
treats the non-accrual loan as no
longer earning interest?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And none of the loans to these companies were ever classified as
non-accrual were they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't think so, no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	No and you would be likely to remember because you would have a role in
it wouldn't you that classification?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would have yes..'    </i>[T 475]
<P>

324	Returning to deal with the revised forecast cash flow document Annexure `C'
referred  to above, Mr Macfarlan QC cross-examined
Mr Paola, Mr Terrey and Mr
Hardy in relation to this document.  The cross-examination from time to time
treated also with a document
tabled on 23 January 1990 at a Paola Holdings
board meeting entitled `Paola Holdings Pty Limited/Currabubula Holdings Pty
Limited
- Cash Facilities 1989/90' which appears at PX 989.  Detail of this
further document is set out in Appendix 5.
<P>

325	Mr Macfarlan put to Mr Paola that the revised forecast cash flow document
Annexure `C' was an example of a document prepared
by the Group in late 1989
upon the basis that there had been a restructure involving ABE Holdings
conducting the pastoral operation.
 Mr Paola stated that it was intended that
this would take place.
<P>

326	It was put to Mr Paola that this was a document prepared in late 1989 by
the Group upon the basis that the pastoral division/operations
were being
conducted by ABE Holdings and Mr Paola accepted this proposition.  [T 86 and
87]
<P>

327	It was put to Mr Paola that the forecast cash flow document showed a
positive cash flow for the Group in the period from December
1989 through to
June 1990.  It was put that this appears from the total drawing of
$8.241million in December 1989 compared to the
total drawings of $6.616million
in June 1990.
<P>

328	It was also put to Mr Paola that if one added the December `bank' figures
shown for ABE Pastoral Division and ABE Head Office
the total was approximately
$3 million as compared with the total of the like figures for June 1990 which
was approximately $2.7million.
 It was put to Mr Paola that this indicated a
positive cash flow for ABE over that period of some seven months of some
hundreds of
thousands of dollars and he accepted this proposition.  [T87]
<P>

329	The cross-examination of Mr Terrey on the document dealt inter alia with
the proposition that there were many cash flow documents
which treated the
pastoral division as referable to ABE Holdings.  Mr Terrey's evidence was that
his recollection was that it was
the intention that some pastoral operations
were going to run through ABE Holdings but in fact he did not believe that this
had actually
occurred.  [T 252]
<P>

330	On being shown the minutes of a Meeting of Directors of ABE Holdings, held
on 23 February 1990, which resolved that the pastoral
operations be undertaken
by Currabubula Holdings thus rescinding the previous arrangement that they be
undertaken by ABE Holdings,
Mr Terrey agreed that he recalled this.  He was
then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And does that remind you that up until that date at least the pastoral
operations had been undertaken by ABE Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No it doesn't.  I take that that in fact retrospective to 1 July - in
fact right through - that they were undertaken by Currabubula
Holdings and
that's my recollection of how the accounts were reflected.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Could I be summarising the effect of what you said correctly by
suggesting that you're saying that you understood the decision
made on 23
February 1990 to be that retrospectively back to 1 July of the previous
calendar year the operations be treated as having
been conducted by Currabubula
Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's my understanding yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Despite the fact that in that period up until 23 February 1990 they had
in fact been conducted by ABE Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I take it that - I understand that the minute was dated 23 February
1990, and I take it that the minute reflected the retrospectivity
back to 1
July 1989.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well let me just ask you to postulate yourself being back at 1 February
1990.  If someone had asked you on 1 February 1990 which
company in the Group
conducts the pastoral operations you would have given the answer "ABE Holdings"
wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't say that I would, in as much as that minute may well have
reflected a decision that may have been taken some time previously
and was in
the minute as was recorded in February 1990.  As I said before, my
understanding was that it was the intention at some
stage that pastoral and
cash flow would reflect that there was some pastoral operations to be carried
out through ABE Holdings, but
my understanding is - and I believed the accounts
reflected it - that they were always shown as being conducted through
Currabubula
Holdings . . .'    </i>[T 251-253]
<P>

331	Mr Hardy was shown Appendix `1' to his fourth report, being a letter from
Mr Plante to Mr Booth of 21 December 1989 enclosing
a profit and loss account
for the period 1 July 1989 to 30 November 1989.  That profit and loss account
read as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Profit and Loss Account - 1 July '89 to 30 November '89</i>
<P>

<i>	Operating loss 1 July '89 to 30 November '89			($1,350,000)</i>
<P>

<i>	Add : ABE Fax accumulated losses 30 June '89			$3,357,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Less: Provision for payment to ABE Fax creditors
</i><cite>($3,000,000)</cite>
<P>

<i>									($993,000)</i>
<P>

<i>	Retained profits at beginning of the financial year
</i><cite>$3,461,000</cite>
<P>

<i>	Retained profits at 30 November '89				$2,468,000</i>
<P>

<i>	Note:  The operating loss of $1,350,000 for the period, consists mainly of
expenses incurred in preparing the farming operations
for lambing, shearing and
cropping.  Those costs are $61,000 below budget.</i>
<P>

<i>	Income from these activities will be received progressively from December
through to May.'</i>
<P>

332	Mr Hardy accepted that the profit and loss account showed a suggested
operating loss of $1.3 million for the five month period
to 30 November 1989.
He accepted that there was no projection contained in the profit and loss
account or in the letter in relation
to the full year.  He accepted also that
there was nothing in the letter or its attachment which would indicate to the
reader or
to Mr Booth at the Bank that the break-even projections that he
referred to in his November report, no longer represented a projection
for the
full year for the Group.
<P>

333	Mr Hardy was then tested in relation to documents received by the Bank.  He
referred to "the cash flow statement that the company,
that Mr Booth said he
relied upon in his November credit precis and the cash flow projection for the
period December to June 1990".
<P>

334	On then being taken to the adjusted forecast cash flows, Mr Hardy's
evidence was that this was the only document that he could
find where the Bank
had been advised of the trading loss through to November.  [T 365]
<P>

335	The cross-examination of Mr Hardy included the following:
<P>

	<i>`A.	Do you remember the question from which we were moving Mr Hardy,
namely, were you aware of any documents before the Bank which
indicated that
the break-even result referred to in the November credit precis was now
projected to be a loss, being some document
that was dated prior to 31 January
1990.  You have referred to the December document and you have now referred to
this cash flow
document?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Is that the sum total answer yes to my knowledge?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now in this cash flow document . . . what do you say that
indicates?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, it is a cash flow document.  It has income and expenses listed
there for the different companies.  That gives an indication.
 In fact in my
report I used the words "suggested the following profit and loss results"
because that is a cash flow statement, it's
not a profit statement, but it
suggests results that the company expects for that period.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But from a cash flow point of view it indicates that there is going to
be a considerable improvement in cash flow as between December
1989 and June
1990 doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes mainly, I think, from the sale of ABE Aircraft down the bottom.  So
the main improvement in cash is from asset sales, especially
asset sales that
are necessarily reflected in the figure above.  </i>[T 365 - 366]
<P>

336	At transcript 366, Mr Hardy's evidence was summarised in the
cross-examination in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Let me just try and summarise it.  The first document you referred to,
the December document, you agree didn't contain any full
year projections,
correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, it wasn't a projection.  That's the actual result from June to
November.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It didn't contain a full year projection did it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It wasn't inconsistent with the information recorded by Mr Booth in his
November credit precis that he expected the Group to break
even for the year
was it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't know that.  I don't know what year he had on the first part.  I
can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The December letter that we have gone to?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Doesn't indicate that the Group would not break even for the full year -
does it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, it didn't indicate it would.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And now the second document you have referred to, which is at 845, you
have agreed for one thing it's a cash flow?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And not a profit forecast?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the two don't necessarily go together?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the document doesn't purport to give any profit or loss figure for
the Group for the remaining seven months of the year does
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It suggests what the profit and loss would be.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well if there is anything in it Mr Hardy it is, at most, a suggestion,
it's no stronger than that is it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's indicative, is perhaps a better word, of what the profit or loss
would be for those companies.'   </i>[T 366]
<P>

337	At transcript 367, Mr Macfarlan addressed questions to Mr Hardy seeking to
put that the document at PX 845 is not inconsistent
with the projection of a
break-even profit result, being a projection made at or about the time the cash
flow was prepared.  The
cross-examination continues:
<P>

	<i>`A.	Are we talking about a break-even result for the year?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, you're referring to the document, the cash flow document from
December to June only?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Whether it is inconsistent or not with the break-even result for the
year, I need to understand how you arrive at the break-even,
his determination
of a break-even.  What I said in my report is that I couldn't see where the
company had represented to him that
it was a break-even result.  So I wasn't
sure whether Mr Booth determined that, or the company had represented to
him.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Let me ask you to assume that the company had informed him that the
company expected to achieve at least a break-even result that
year.  The cash
flow document at 845 that you have referred to was not inconsistent with that
inform, was it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If I was in the Bank's position I would have taken the loss
determined.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Was it inconsistent or not?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't answer that.</i>
<P>

<i>	His Honour:  Why can't you answer that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, because this is a cash flow projection for the remaining seven
months of  the year.  You would need to know what the profit
result is.  It's
indicative of profit.  That was what I was suggesting.  You would need to know
what the rest of the year was projected
to the Bank to see whether the two
combined to give the impression to the Bank that a break-even result was
expected.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That means it's neither consistent nor inconsistent until you get to see
some further material?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I think so.  What I said in my report is I was unable to determine
how this break-even proposition came about and who represented
this to see
whether it was a determination by the Bank.'   </i>[T 367]
<P>

338	At transcript 368 the following appears:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Let me ask you again.  In November 1989, if you were sitting in the
position of Mr Booth at the Bank and you were told by the
company that the
company expected a break-even result for the Group for the full year and you
were given a number of documents including
the cash flow, which is at 845, you
wouldn't have immediately jumped to the conclusion that the information that
the company had
given you about a break-even result was wrong, would
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not in November.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Nor would you have done so when you received the letter of December that
you had earlier referred to?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I would have.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I suggest you wouldn't because that related only to a six month period
and said nothing about the full year.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, generally, but when you add the two together, when you look at the
document for the actual results to November and when you
add it to the
projected budget, it suggested to me that a loss in excess of $1 was expected .
. .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Mr Hardy the information being the cash flow in the five months profit
and loss account came at different points in time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that would be one reason for not readily jumping to the conclusion
that they could be put together?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm not sure of the bank's practice and I'm not sure how they - my
understanding, the bank was in daily contact what the management
of this
account..  I'm not sure the internal workings of the bank.  All I can answer
is, if I receive that document, I would have
drawn superficially the conclusion
that I draw in my report and I would seek a clarification of it.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I will put it this way, you would have suspected that the company might
be going to incur a loss for the full year?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I would have enquired further if my perception previously had been
to break even and now I saw they were going to lose in
excess of $1 million, I
would have made further enquiries.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, a million dollars for five months?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I am not suggesting that.  When you added the two together, I still have
a position that is suggesting a loss in excess of a million
dollars for the
full year.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But you can't add a cash flow forecast to a profit and loss account can
you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	They are in the [sic] directly compatible, but, as I said they are
indicative.' </i> [T 368 and 369]
<P>

339	In being cross-examined on the document at PX 989, Mr Paola was taken to
the total figure for 31 January and asked whether there
was some discussion of
that figure at the meeting.  He could not recall.  He denied that there was
some discussion at the meeting
that the debt to the Bank would rise to some $9
million or be likely to do so by 31 January.  [T 105]
<P>

340	At transcript 106, it was put to Mr Paola that what had happened at the 23
January meeting was that he found that the cash requirements
of the company or
of the Group were considerably greater, that is some $9 million as against $8.3
million at the end of January and
he said that he did not believe that this was
so.  [T 106]
<P>

	<b>Letter of Comfort</b>
<P>

341	ABE Holdings wrote on 29 November 1989 to Peat Marwick Hungerfords in the
following terms:
<P>

	<i>`We hereby undertake to continue to provide financial support to our
related company ABE Jet Charter Pty Limited.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The letter falls short of creating an enforceable legal obligation.
<P>

	<b>December 1989</b>
<P>

<b>	Overdraft Limits increase to $6.8 million</b>
<P>

342	By letter dated 12 December 1989 the Bank wrote to the Paola Group,
advising that the relevant branches of the Bank had been
instructed to amend
their overdraft limits so that the total facility had become $6.8million as
opposed to the earlier $5.5million.
 [PX 829]
<P>

343	A note entitled `Addendum' appearing at PX 827, made by Mr Booth on 8
December 1989, comments in relation to the valuation position
inter alia, as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`The Bank's Regional Valuer has since advised valuations on these
properties totalling $2.3million.  This makes the total value of
property now
secured by the Bank $17.6 million and the loanable sum of all assets (as at 31
October 1989) $12.8 million.'</i>
<P>

344	Mr Booth accepted in cross-examination at transcript 473, that he had been
advised by Mr Miller by this point in time that the
total value of properties
secured to the Bank was $17.6 million.
<P>

	<b>Multi-Option Facility Increase to $8.5million</b>
<P>

345	On 13 December 1989 the Bank approved an increase in the Group's
Multi-Option Facility to $8.5million.  [PX 831]  The approval
was subject to a
complete review by 31 March 1990 and gave a credit rating of LQ3.
<P>

346	The 13 December 1989 document at transcript 831 includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Cambridge advised members [of the Credit Committee] that the Bank's
Senior Solicitor is to confirm that the new security arrangements
do not put
SBN in a position where SBN would be vulnerable to preference claims.' </i>
<P>

347	On 14 December 1989, Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co wrote to the Bank in their
capacity as receivers of ABE Fax.  In dealing with
a schedule of repayment of
Bank debt, they said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`To date the realisation of assets has produced a bank balance of
approximately $450,000 which is currently being held at call with
the Macquarie
Branch of the State Bank.  I enclose an initial repayment of your debt of
$150,000.'   </i>[PX 852]
<P>

348	That document suggested as Mr Booth accepted at transcript 476, that the
receiver had an account with the Macquarie Branch of
the Bank.
<P>

349	Mr Booth's cross-examination continued as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Do you see there that as at 14 December 1989 that account held
$450,000?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the receivers were sending a cheque to the State Bank for
$150,000?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It is the case that as the receivership went on from time to time
cheques would be paid across by the receiver from that account?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And when they were paid across they were credited, were they not, to the
North Ryde account of ABE Fax which had been its operating
bank account prior
to the receivership?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That would have been the case I think, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.  I don't know if you noted at the time but if you would turn to PX
859 please, you will see that there was a cash flow forecast
for receipts by
the receivers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Although I am not suggesting that this necessarily was written in stone
or proved to be completely accurate, the receivers were
advising you that they
expected money to come in in this cash flow up until the end of
February?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you knew that the receivers were confident of recovering significant
sums.  It records potential payments of $930,000?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And they did in fact recover significant sums on into 1990 didn't
they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

350	Mr Booth was also asked at transcript 477 whether he remembered that the
Credit Committee had expressed some concern about the
possibility of
preferences in relation to the Paola Group and he answered that he did not
recall this.
<P>

351	On 15 December 1989, Mr Booth prepared a handwritten inter-office
memorandum addressed to Mr John Lyel, Regional Lending Manager
at Tamworth,
attaching a copy of a submission approval of 13 December 1989.  In that note,
Mr Booth said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`The Bank's solicitors are presently investigating credit committee's
concerns regarding preferences and I am hopeful that favourable
acknowledgment
will be forthcoming.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the meantime I will be requiring Paola to meet initial drawings at
present levels.'    </i>[PX 831]
<P>

352	Under cross-examination Mr Booth had no recollection as to whether in
December 1989 he was discussing with the Bank's solicitors
the question of
preferences and the Paola Holdings Group.  [T 478]
<P>

353	On 21 December 1989, Mr Plante wrote to the Bank enclosing a consolidated
Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet for the
Paola Group and the
Currabubula Group.  The accounts showed an anticipated loss from 1 July 1989 to
30 November 1989 of $1.35million
and a provision of $3million for ABE Fax
creditors.  [PX 873]
<P>

354	Mr Booth accepted under cross-examination, that he examined the profit and
loss account and the balance sheet attached to the
21 December 1989 letter and
that since he had requested the information, he paid a considerable amount of
care to that exercise.
 His evidence included:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And you had asked for the consolidated profit and loss account for the
purpose of assessing how the Group was performing in its
trading operations and
how the picture looked from an assets and liability perspective?</i>
<P>

<i>	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you looked at the profit and loss account appearing at PX 873 you
realised of course that it applied from 1 July to 30 November
1989?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you realised that the period had disclosed according to the group an
operating loss of $1.35million?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood, did you not, that when it said Paola Consolidated,
it meant the whole group including the Currabubula operations?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would have realised that it included the operations of the farm.
Whether that was Currabubula I'm not sure. </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . So it was your understanding, if I could put it this way, that all
revenue items earned either through the operations on
the pastoral properties
or otherwise, all revenue earned by the Group was recorded in this profit and
loss?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you immediately appreciated that a very significant operating loss
was being recorded?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you looked at the note you did note I suppose that income would be
received from rural operations from December to May :
Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you knew of course that that was with no detail being given a
projection of income from the pastoral operations referred to;
 it is a
projected figure of course December to May of the following year?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The words here were income from its activities be received
progressively.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, but you knew that it was a forecast or projection?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In terms of that statement . . .yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You had received of course other information from the Group including
the annexure C document about projected cash flow?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	To June 1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'  </i>[T 478-479]
<P>

355	Mr Booth was then cross-examined on the cash flow document which appears at
PX 845 and 849.  His evidence was :
<P>

	<i>`Q.	See that's a copy of the cash flow that we discussed yesterday and what
I wanted to ask you was whether when you got the profit
and loss accounts at PX
872 whether you went back and reconsidered the cash flow that appears at PX
849.  Did you do that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm not sure.  I would have considered documents that I had been given
in the past.  Whether it was this cash flow I can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	 . . . I want to suggest to you Mr Booth that the cash flow at PX 849 is
indicative - only indicative - of likely profit problems
for the Group in the
period from January to June 1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	You say it is indicative of?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	A likely profit problem for the Group for the period January to June
1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't see that.  Can you be more explicit.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, do you see that there is the line entry for ABE Jet that we spoke
of yesterday?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And do you see that the entries there for ABE Jet become positive from
February?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And won't you agree with me that your understanding in December 1989 was
that those positive cash flows would be derived from
the sale of assets?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think my comment yesterday was I wasn't sure and I didn't understand
those positive numbers that occurred for ABE Jet for those
following
months.'</i>
<P>

356	Also on 21 December 1989, ABE Holdings wrote to the Bank confirming that
Automated Business Equipment Pty Ltd was placed in
liquidation on 6 October
1989.  ABE Fax had in fact had a Receiver and Manager appointed on 10 November
1989.
<P>

357	The letter of 21 December 1989 [PX 875] stated:
<P>

	<i>`This is to advise that appointment may require other companies within the
group to complete some of the commitments of ABE Fax, eg
lease
guarantees.'</i>
<P>

358	At the end of 1989, the stock and station agent business operated by
Campbell Rixon was closed.
<P>

	<b>31 December 1989 - Group Structure</b>
<P>

359	Annexure `H' to Mr Booth's statement of 20 November 1996 records that by 31
December 1989, the Group structure had become as
follows:

<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

360	As earlier noted [Judgment para 106] ] the shareholding in Paola Holdings
stated in the above structure was incorrect.
<P>

361	Mr Booth was not certain of the date when he moved within the Bank from the
corporate area to a unit called Group Asset Management.
 He believed this was
possibly in 1990 or 1991.  Group Asset Management was a division of the Bank,
set up to engage in work outside
of primarily bad corporate lending.
<P>

362	Mr Booth accepted that the Group Asset Management Unit was established as a
result of a large increase in the Bank's potential
and actual bad debt problems
for corporate customers involving some hundreds of millions of dollars.  [T
415]
<P>

363	Mr Booth could not recall during the period when he was account manager,
whether he had had dealings with bank officers from
the Risk Policy Unit about
the Paola Account or whether or not he had ever sought or obtained from the
Risk Policy Unit, independent
advice about assessment of the Paola Group's
account.  [T 415]
<P>

364	Mr Booth accepted at transcript 416, that whilst he was account manager for
the Paola Group, Mr Paola bought and sold assets
and repaid debt to the Bank
from time to time from asset sales.  [T 416]

	<b>January 1990</b>

<b>	Forecast Deficiency in Paola Holdings Group</b>
<P>

365	On 5 January 1990, a meeting of directors of Paola Holdings took place at
which the directors present were Mr Cameron of Blake
Dawson Waldron, Mr
Herring, Mr Paola, and in attendance Mr Plante.
<P>

366	The meeting resolved that the Secretary be directed to investigate with the
Blake Dawson Waldron insolvency partner, Mr Harmer,
the following matters:
<P>

	<i>`- Pros and cons of the company appointing a liquidator versus an
appointment as a result of the section 364 notice issued by Mitsubishi.</i>
<P>

<i>	- The continuation of the action against Mitsubishi.</i>
<P>

<i>	- The security status of any group company which contributes to the
shortfall in the State Bank debt.'</i>
<P>

367	The secretary tabled a number of sets of accounts at the meeting and a
Forecast Reconciliation of Shareholders' Equity as at
30 June 1990 for Paola
Holdings Pty Ltd Consolidated.
<P>

368	The meeting noted that the Forecast Reconciliation had forecast a
deficiency of shareholders' equity of $1,060,686 in the group
`if a payment of
$1,750,000 was made to Okura under a personal guarantee provided by Mr Paola on
behalf of ABE Fax Pty Limited ($405,828
has already been paid)'.

information on individual companies at a board meeting
scheduled for 23

371	On 9 January 1990, Mr Paola made a note in his diary reading as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Decision made</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	to extend payment to creditors by 30 days and avoid the need for
additional bank facilities.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Repay suppliers by returning saleable stock which was not moving.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	Reduce ordering to replace stock items which were fast moving only.'
</i>[T 167]
<P>

	<b>Mr Taylor's Letter of Resignation</b>
<P>

372	By letter written on approximately 15 January 1990, Mr Ross Taylor, who had
been a founder of Northern Rural Services business
resigned as a director of
NRS and also resigned from his position as General Manager of NRS.
<P>

373	In his letter of resignation, Mr Taylor said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`I sincerely regret having to take this action.  However matters that have
taken place within this company and in particular the direction
that no
creditors are to be paid, left me with no alternative.'</i>
<P>

374	Mr Taylor indicated a preparedness to continue in the employment of NRS
otherwise than in a managerial capacity for four working
weeks.  [PX Volume 5,
1885]
<P>

375	Under cross-examination, Mr Paola was referred to Mr Taylor's letter.  The
cross-examination continued as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Did you, Mr Paola give a direction of the character referred to at the
end of the third paragraph, namely a direction that no
creditors are to be
paid?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	. . . that was one of the directions that I gave yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you did that in early or mid January 1990 didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . What was the direction that you gave?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well the direction I gave was that in the first instance where the
company was overstocked it had to return stock that would not
be required in
the next 30 days . . .  I can't be one hundred percent accurate of what I'm
saying but basically this is the substance
of it and that until we were
satisfied that all the stock that was returnable was returned there were no
creditors to be paid . .
at that point it was a temporary condition.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But a temporary condition brought about by a serious cash position that
NRS was in?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, that wasn't the consideration at all.  The consideration was that Mr
Taylor had and other managers had overstocked and this
was a discipline on the
management of Northern Rural Services to bring things into shape.  Now the fact
that they didn't want to
ring up their friends and ask them to take things back
and give a credit resulted in actions such as this, which Mr Taylor
subsequently
withdrew . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The reason for this was a cash flow problem wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	the main reason for this . . . was a discipline on the management to get
the stock into order . . .  The next reason why is that
we had a requirement on
the facility which was about to be put in place that meant we had to reduce the
overall borrowings by a million
dollars at the end of May and we were taking
action as early as we could . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 163 and following]
<P>

376	At transcript 174, Mr Paola gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	The upshot of your communications with Mr Taylor was that he resigned
as a director on about 17 January was it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But that he stayed on a general manager for a period of weeks
thereafter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I believe that he actually stayed until the end of February, possibly
end of March.  I'm uncertain of the date.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you made it clear to him in January, did you, that, despite his
reticence to do so, you as managing director required him
to convey that
information to the major suppliers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	To the suppliers, yes.  There was one company in particular that he was
concerned about.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes.  </i><cite>And as far as you know Mr Taylor did convey the
substance of that direction that you'd given to the suppliers</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was conveyed.  I think Mr Taylor was mainly responsible.  The other
managers I think had some involvement.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	As you understood it, someone on behalf of the company - probably in
many cases Mr Taylor -</i><cite> conveyed to the suppliers that there was going
to be a delay in payment;  is that right</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, let me just qualify what I'm saying here.  My understanding of it
was that </i><cite>the ones that were due for repayment at the end of January
would be notified</cite><i>, but not necessarily would everybody be told.  It
was just a matter of as required.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The major suppliers of yours were ones who supplied every month were
they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The major suppliers are not necessarily every month.  In the case of
fertiliser, for instance, there are two gaps, which is preplanting
time of
winter and summer crops, where fertiliser is purchased in very big lots, but
for eight months of the year there are hardly
any fertiliser pack purchases.
Chemicals are similar.  The business is really based on planting time -
preplanting.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well you don't have any records from which you could determine or
provide information about when particular debts due to particular
suppliers
were due at about this time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not in front of me no . . .'    </i>[emphasis added]
<P>

377	Mr Paola under cross-examination, gave evidence that the note in his diary
was for the benefit of his meeting with Mr Taylor.
 He then gave the following
evidence:
<P>

	<i>`. . . my discussion with Ross Taylor was - and this formed the notes for
that discussion - they were all in relation to the overstocked
position.  There
was the other motivation to reduce the borrowings or limit the borrowings of
the Northern Rural Services, but that
wasn't an overall group thing, it was
purely Northern Rural Services that we were discussing.  There was one
particular aspect which
was the Moree Branch which had gone beyond any
reasonable stock levels and the purpose of that meeting was simply a discipline
on
the management of Northern Rural Services.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 166]
<P>

378	At transcript 167, Mr Paola was asked what Mr Taylor had said to him, if
anything, about his reasons for resigning as a director
and answered as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`Yes.  One of the reasons was - well the reasons were : one, that he didn't
agree with the delaying payments to creditors and suppliers.
 His second reason
that he gave was there was a particular supplier that he had been paying
outside the normal terms of credit that
we had with them.  By that, he was
paying far too quickly because of the friendship that he had with this
particular supplier and
the supplier's cash flow difficulties.  They were a
couple of the reasons that I recall.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Transcript 167]
<P>

379	Under cross-examination, Mr. Hardy gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	If a direction of the sort referred to in Mr Taylor's letter had been
given, news of that would have travelled very quickly around
the community
wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Depends on how it was delivered.  If it was - I mean what normally
happens . . . what normally happens where a company is taking
that action is,
if your suppliers are not paid in 30 days, you just don't pay them on the 30
day figure.  They might ring up in a
couple of weeks saying "Where is our
cheque".  You might say "It's coming".  It's something that you just don't
magnify to your suppliers,
so I guess it is dependent on how well that was
carried out by management as to whether that was a distinct view out there in
the
community or not.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, if it leaked outside the company, you would expect it to spread
very fast, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If it is - if the major suppliers were aware of that direction, that a
formal direction had been given for not paying in 30 days,
I think there would
be - the salesmen of those suppliers would probably like to talk a fair bit.
So it depends on how well it was
delivered, I guess . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . You said a few moment ago that it depends on how well it is
delivered?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What were you referring to being delivered would depend on . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That advice from - that I read from Mr Paola not to pay creditors for
another 30 days.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	How that advice was delivered to whom?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	To the suppliers.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes I understand.  You have assumed, have you, that it was delivered to
the suppliers in some method in your answer?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I believe that this isn't a formal message that's delivered to the
suppliers like that.  It's something that's managed by the
company to try to
not tell them, if I was in that position to try. . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I rather understood what you have been saying to me is this, correct me
if I am wrong, you don't know how, or when or whether
by word of mouth, or
simply because they weren't paid in time, any particular creditor may have
learned, if at all, that there had
been some sort of direction given about
delaying payment or not paying, is that what you have been saying?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes that's what I am saying. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Mr Hardy, what I want you to assume is that the creditors or some of
them, came to know of that direction being given, you do
agree, I think you
have agreed, that words would spread quickly through the community, if that
were the case.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If the direction was known, I think the words could spread quickly
amongst other suppliers.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It would spread quickly around the community, wouldn't it, in your
view?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not - by itself its not revolutionary news, so, no, I think that sort of
news would only be limited to suppliers to creditors,
to people who deal with
that sort of - it would have to be people not being paid for a lengthy period
of time before people start
talking about.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If a direction were given as suggested by Mr Taylor's letter, namely, a
direction simply not to pay creditors, you would agree
wouldn't you, that if a
supplier became aware of that, that would be news likely to spread very quickly
through the community.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And if going back to the type of directions suggested by Mr Paola's
diary, you remember those directions, not to make payments
to creditors for 30
days?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If that had been accompanied by the company returning stock to suppliers
and reducing its orders, words, in your view, would very
quickly have got
around, at least amongst suppliers?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It depends on how its done.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, if the stock was being returned and orders were being reduced and
payments were not being made, it wouldn't take a very
perspicacious supplier
long to realise the problem?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I am trying to recall the words Mr Paola used.  I thought what he said
was: "To return slow moving stock, to reorder in the areas
of fast moving stock
and the third point is to delay creditors' payments by 30 days.  In those
circumstances that would not be unusual
to return.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Let me remind you of what he said.  The first entry related to payments;
the second was repay suppliers by returning saleable
stock which was not
moving;  three, reducing orders to replace stock items which were fast moving
only.  Now, if that was what the
company came to do, it would not take a very
perspicacious supplier long to realise that the company had a problem, would
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I disagree.  I don't - I mean, I would consider that as a prudent
business.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Prudent business if you are in financial trouble?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, probably prudent.  Some of it is prudent business.  The issue
relating to the stock would be prudent business.  The issue
in relation to
delaying creditors, payments 30 days would indicate there are cash flow
difficulties.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So also would be the return of stock to effect payment on account,
wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It depends on the magnitude of it.'    </i>[T 353 - 356]
<P>

380	On 15 January 1990, Mrs Lyn Paola was appointed as a director of NRS.
<P>

381	By letter dated 15 January 1990, Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co wrote to the
State Bank with respect to ABE Fax (Receiver and Manager
appointed) by way of
further reporting on the progress of the administration of ABE Fax as at 9
January 1990.  [PX 948].
<P>

382	On 16 January 1990, Mr Booth had a meeting with Mr Paola.  Mr Booth's
summary includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`. . . we were informed of additional steps being taken to contain levels
of debt within the group.</i>
<P>

<i>	In summary, Mr Paola has extended the list of possible asset sales to
include all but his home property (Currabubula).  His </i><cite>strategy is to
reduce bank debt to less than $5million as soon as possible</cite><i> and
assets will be realised until this is achieved.</i>
<P>

<i>	Judging by the levels of interest being shown, Mr Paola predicts that the
jet aircraft will be the first asset to sell (expected
by end February 1990).
This will realise some $800,000 (after prior commitments).  He believes that
the next asset in line to sell
will be Northern Rural Services Pty Limited, the
Group's farm service and supply organisation.  Whilst only recently listed for
sale
the organisation is, according to Mr Paola being favourably considered by
at least two organisations (Dalgety and Primac).  Mr Paola
is hopeful the sale
of NRS will realise a net $3million.</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale proposals for Durhambone (the Group's largest property) are continuing
but with the asking price presently set at $15million
(bank's valuation is
$10million) Mr Paola is not confident the property will sell quickly.  To speed
up the process, it is proposed
to list the property for auction in late April.
The sale price of Durhambone is supported by the property's potential to
produce
a $5million wheat crop.</i>
<P>

<i>	Most recently Mr Paola has received enquiries for the `Breeza' properties.
Whilst it is too early to gauge the level of interest,
Mr Paola will sell if a
realistic offer materialises.  (Bank's valuation is $3.3million).'
</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

383	During the same meeting, Mr Paola requested an alteration to present
facility arrangements, namely the interest payment requirements
of the cash
advance option which at that time required interest payable monthly in arrears.
Mr Booth's note of the meeting includes
the following:
<P>

	<i>`As the </i><cite>Group's revenue base is now substantially reliant on the
properties</cite><i>, Mr Paola has asked that interest payments under this
option be allowed to occur at intervals more in line with Group's cash flows
(proceeds of crop and wool sales tend to occur at half-yearly
intervals).</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Booth's recommendation was that the interest requirement for cash
advance drawings be amended to allow interest to be payable
at maturity of any
draw-down or roll-overs on the basis that drawings under that option be limited
to 185 days or such other tenor
as approved by the chief manager corporate
finance group.'  </i> [Annexure H to Mr Booth's first statement of 20 November
1996]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

384	Mr Swinburne supported Mr Paola's request to enable interest payment dates
to more closely align his revenue streams by a note
of 17 January 1990.  [PX
966]  That note which Mr Booth read [T 488], includes:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Paola is very concerned about the level of his borrowings and
recognises that this is primarily the result of the failure of ABE
Fax.  The
situation has been compounded by high interest rates and a smaller than
expected wheat crop.</i>
<P>

<i>	Never the less the Paola Group has a diverse asset base which is
conservatively valued at $30million.  The pastoral division which
is now the
major source of income is not capable at present of supporting a debt of
$8million at current high interest rates.  The
immediate objective is to
substantially reduce that debt level through the sale of assets.  Mr Paola is
very confident that the range
of assets presently on the market will achieve
tangible results commencing as early as next month with the sale of his jet
aircraft.'
 </i>[PX 966]
<P>

385	By letter dated 18 January 1990, the State Bank wrote to the Managing
Director, Paola Holdings and Currabubula Holdings, advising
that approval had
been given to increase the existing Multi Option Facility from $6.8 million to
$8.5 million.  [PX 956]  The letter
appears to be almost word perfect to that
of 1 February 1990 appearing at PX 1047.  Mr Booth recalled that the later
letter had been
sent as it appeared that Mr Paola made a request to vary
facility arrangements. [T 487]  This appears to be the explanation as the
handwritten words `Pyojit Pty Limited' are added under the list of borrowers on
PX 1047, being the only change to the letter in fact
sent.
<P>

386	On 19 January 1990, ABE Holdings wrote to Mr Swinburne outlining the way in
which the Group proposed to structure the new facilities.
 The new overdraft in
this letter is identified at $8million.  Mr Booth saw the letter on or about 19
January.  [T 482]
<P>

387	The proposal in the letter was that as the ABE Fax overdraft decreased, the
excess limit would be transferred to other companies.
<P>

388	Mr Booth accepted under cross-examination at transcript 483, that in fact
there had been an agreement reached between himself
and Mr Plante that as the
ABE Fax overdraft decreased the Group could transfer the excess limit to other
companies in the Group.
<P>

389	At transcript 484-485, Mr Booth accepted in cross-examination that from
time to time the receiver of ABE Fax paid funds to the
Bank.  He was asked and
answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And those funds were transferred from an account of the receiver to ABE
Fax account in the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Are you saying that the funds provided by the receiver from the
receiver's account were put to the old ABE Fax debt?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, to reduce the debt?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now from time to time of course you understood there was a balance of
cash in the receiver's Fax account?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood from time to time the cash would be paid across to
reduce the overdraft limit in the Fax account?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think that's the same answer as before, yes. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you have any recollection now of discussions with Mr Plante about
whether moneys received by the receiver would be taken into
account in
determining the extent of the group's use of its facilities with the
Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I want to suggest to you that you had a discussion with Mr Plante in
which you agreed that the computation of the group's use
of its facilities with
the Bank would include consideration of money received by the receiver of ABE
Fax?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I disagree with that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In disagreeing with that do you accept that there was an arrangement
whereby the Bank would consider the balance in ABE Fax's
account, meaning the
one that operated prior to going into receivership, that the balance of that
account would be considered when
the Bank was assessing the use of the
facilities by the group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Are you asking that the old debt that was held in the old account was
still considered part of the group debt?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, it was.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And funds as they came across would be recognised as having reduced
that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	As they were received yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What I want to suggest to you, just to make it clear - and I think it is
clear now - I want to suggest to you that that arrangement
extended to moneys
held by the receiver for the State Bank in the receiver's account for ABE
Fax?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I disagree.  Those moneys were not held for the Bank.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you recall having any discussion with Mr Plante one way or the other
about that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No there was no discussion with him.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You're quite sure about that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm quite sure.'   </i>[T 486]
<P>

390	On 19 January 1990, Mr Cambridge, the Chief Manager, Corporate Finance
Group, refused the recommendation to amend the Paola
Group interest dates from
monthly in arrears to six months.  In his statement of reasons, he added `I see
no need to penalise the
bank, which is what we would be doing by changing the
interest payment cycle, to accommodate Mr Paola's problem'.  Mr Cambridge did,
however, approve allowing draw-downs under the fixed rate option of the
multi-option facility up to two years from 19 January 1990,
subject to the
borrower meeting break costs should the facility be repaid early, acknowledging
that the current interest rates were
a major factor facing Mr Paola's workout.
[PX 967]
<P>

391	On 23 January 1990, a further Paola Holdings board meeting was held at
which were present Mr Cameron, Mr Herring, Mr Paola,
and which Mr Plante
attended as secretary.
<P>

392	The minutes of this meeting record the tabling by the Secretary of Paola
Holdings Consolidated estimate of Shareholders' Equity
at 31 December 1989
which appears at PX 985.  The minutes also record that Mr Paola was `asked to
consider what assurances he could
provide as to the satisfaction of liabilities
of the group, in particular to confirm that Okura, a major creditor, was
prepared to
await the sale of Durhambone and not to press for payment at that
stage'.
<P>

393	In relation to ABE Holdings, the directors resolved that the Secretary be
directed to examine the ramifications of `either transferring
the pastoral
division back to Currabubula Holdings or, alternatively, to receive a
management fee from that company in order to eliminate
any deficiency in ABE
Holdings Shareholders' Equity'.  [PX 983]
<P>

394	The above described resolution appears plainly to recognise that ABE
Holdings had a deficiency in shareholders' equity.
<P>

395	One of the documents tabled at the meeting is that already appended as
Appendix 5.
<P>

396	It was put to Mr Paola under cross-examination at transcript 104 that at
the time the document was tabled he understood it to
indicate the total level
of facilities that would be drawn or required to be drawn from time to time by
the Group from the Bank.
 He could not recall the document specifically and
endeavoured to put off an explanation of the document until Mr Plante would
give
evidence.  He did accept in cross-examination that the document purported
to be a cash facilities document but did not accept that
it was a cash flow as
he understood it.  He denied that there was some discussion at the meeting that
the debt to the Bank would
rise to some $9 million or be likely to do so by 31
January 1990.  [T 105.40]
<P>

397	He accepted that it appeared, looking at the handwriting near the figure
$9,069,000 that there was some discussion at the meeting
to the effect that the
limit would be, that is the bank facility limit would be $8.5million by then
but the actual facilities required
would be some $9 million.  He then indicated
that he could not answer on that matter.  [T 105.45]
<P>

398	He could not deny that there was a discussion to this effect at the meeting
but accepted that the last information he had given
to the Bank suggested that
there would be a peak of $8.5million in the facilities required as at January,
which information had been
given as he recalled in November.  [T 106.15]
<P>

399	He did not accept the proposition put to him that what had happened at the
23 January meeting was that he had found that the
cash requirements of the
Company or of the Group were considerably greater, that is some $9 million as
against $8.3million at the
end of January.  [T 106.34]
<P>

400	It appears that the summary of cash facilities at PX 989 contemplated the
Okura debt being paid out of bank funds.  That document
as will be noted,
records the current facility at $5.5million and recorded the estimated debt to
the Bank as at 31 January 1990 at
$9.069million which is to be compared to and
is higher than the figure shown on the October/November 1989 cash flow,
previously submitted
to the Bank at $8.3million as at January 1990.  [See PX
989 as compared to PX 843]
<P>

401	Mr Cameron's notes of the board meeting of 23 January 1990, appear at PX
991 and include the following:
<P>

	<i>`Paola - not as bad as it appears . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Problem is under-viability of heavy borrowing . . .'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Questions as to Paola Group's Continuance as a Going Concern</b>
<P>

402	By letter dated 31 January 1990, KPMG Peat Marwick (Mr Hardy), wrote to
Paola Holdings.  In this letter Mr Hardy advised Paola
Holdings that the Paola
Group may not be able to continue as a going concern.  Under cross-examination,
Mr Paola gave evidence that
he believed he received the 31 January 1990 letter
from Peat Marwicks within a few days of 31 January 1990.  [T 108]  The letter
further noted that the Group would have a negative cash flow of $1.5million and
that Currabubula Holdings refused to support the
Group.  The letter is
particularly important in the light of evidence given by Mr Booth that the
first time he saw the letter was
in April 1990 and that at no time did Mr
Paola, Mr Plante or Mr Terry discuss the matters set out in the letter with
him.  His evidence
was that had he seen the letter, he would have withdrawn his
recommendation that the facilities be increased.
<P>

403	Bearing in mind the importance of the letter, it is set out hereunder in
full:
<P>

	<i>`'We have been provided by you with group accounts for Paola Holdings Pty
Limited and subsidiaries for audit for the year ended 30th
June, 1989.</i>
<P>

<i>	The group accounts comprise the consolidated accounts of Paola Holdings Pty
Limited and subsidiary companies excluding the accounts
of A.B.E. Fax Pty
Limited ("the Paola Group"), together with the separate inclusion of the
accounts of A.B.E. Fax Pty Limited ("FAX").
 The accounts of FAX have not been
consolidated in the group accounts of Paola Holdings Pty Limited since a
Receiver was appointed
to FAX on 10th November, 1989 and the Receiver has
estimated FAX will have a deficiency of net assets of approximately $5.6m.
</i><cite>You have advised us that the Paola Group does not intend to provide
continuing financial support to FAX</cite><i> and hence it is inappropriate to
consolidate the accounts of FAX in the consolidated accounts of the Paola
Group.</i>

<i>	Subject to the exclusion of the FAX accounts from the Paola Group accounts,
</i><cite>the Paola Group accounts have been prepared on the basis of the going
concern convention of accounting.  For the reasons set out below
we have formed
the opinion that this may not be appropriate for the Paola Group
accounts</cite><i>.  Our assessment of the position for your review is as
follows:</i>
<P>

<i>		$</i><cite>000</cite>
<P>

<i>	(i)  The net assets of the Paola Group (excluding assets of or claims on
FAX)</i>
<P>

<i>	as detailed in the group accounts as at 30th June, 1989 are	919</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)  We sought to review budgets and profit forecasts of the Paola group
for</i>
<P>

<i>	the year ending 30th June, 1990.  The group's projections indicate a
projected</i>
<P>

<i>	loss for the year of $475,000.  We have reviewed the projections and have
had</i>
<P>

<i>	the benefit of reviewing actual trading results to November/December, 1989.
</i>
<P>

<i>	On the basis that A.B.E. Jet Charter Pty Limited has not yet sold the jet
aircraft</i>
<P>

<i>	owned by it, the lease portfolio of A.B.E. Credits Pty Limited has not been
sold</i>
<P>

<i>	(or the company sold by the group) and the new refinancing loan
arrangements</i>
<P>

<i>	with the State Bank we have estimated the group loss to be, as set out
below;	(1,044)</i>
<P>

<P>

<i>	We are unsure of the specific nature of the liabilities that may arise from
the receivership of FAX.  We have previously requested
that directors provide
us with their assessment of these liabilities, whether contingent (leases) or
current (shortfall of secured
creditor).  Further we require your advice on
what effect the letter of comfort, dated 29th November, 1988, issued by A.B.E.
Holdings
Pty Limited to the firm in respect of FAX, may have on the group's
affairs.  We note that a similar letter has been issued in respect
of A.B.E.
Jet Charter Pty Limited dated 29th November,1989.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>The cash flow results of the above projections would indicate a
negative cash flow to the group of approximately $1,500,000 (items
(ii) &amp;
(iii) during the 1990 year which would require the support of shareholders or
third party creditors</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	We understand the Paola group has received additional bank overdraft
finance based on security over freehold properties provided
by Currabubula
Holdings Pty Limited, a company owned by the Paola family.  This security is
not available to other group creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	In view of the above projections </i><cite>we have sought advice as to
whether Currabubula Holdings Pty Limited would provide agreements of financial
support to the Paola group
of companies.  We have been advised that such
agreement of support will not be given</cite><i>.  Accordingly it is necessary
to review the financial state of affairs of the Paola Group as an independent
group without the financial
support of any other party.  We have formed the
view that </i><cite>on this basis the Paola Group may not be able to continue
as a going concern</cite><i>.  In view of this assessment we have prepared our
audit report on the group accounts on this basis and attach a copy of the
proposed
report for your consideration.</i>
<P>

<i>	After you have had an opportunity to consider the contents of this letter
we should be grateful for your advice on the matters raised.</i>

404	In paragraph 7 of his statement of 14 May 1998, Mr Booth had given some
evidence in relation to a copy of the 31 January 1990
letter which was annexure
`H' to the statement.  That annexure comprised only the 3-page letter.  In fact
the materials in evidence
at PX 1026 and following include a version of the
3-page letter to which is appended a 2-page document across which a stamp
reading
`Preliminary Draft for Discussion Purposes Only' prominently appears.
The draft reads as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Because of the material uncertainty referred to above, we are unable to
form an opinion as to whether the consolidated accounts of
Paola Holdings Pty
Limited and subsidiaries (excluding A.B.E. Fax Pty Limited) are properly drawn
up in accordance with the Companies
(New South Wales) Code and so as to give a
true and fair view of:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the state of affairs of the group at 30th June, 1989 and the result of
the group for the year ended on that date;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	the other matters required by section 269 of that Code to be dealt
with in the accounts;</i>
<P>

<i>	or whether the accounts have been drawn up in accordance with Australian
Accounting Standards and applicable Approved Accounting
Standards.</i>
<P>

<i>	A qualified audit report has been issued on the accounts of A.B.E. Jet
Charter Pty Limited and A.B.E. Fax Pty Limited for the year
ended 30th June,
1989.  The particulars of these qualifications are as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	The accounts of A.B.E. Jet Charter Pty Limited have been prepared on a
going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal
business
activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the
ordinary course of business.</i>
<P>

<i>	The company incurred an operating loss of $928,310 during the year ended
30th June, 1989, and as at that date the company's current
liabilities exceeded
current assets by $509,890 and total liabilities exceeded total assets by
$730,457.</i>
<P>

<i>	Subsequent to balance date the company has continued to trade at a loss and
the company's principal asset, a jet aircraft, is listed
for sale.  The
directors believe the aircraft will realise its book value on sale.  The
company has received a letter of undertaking
from a related company, A.B.E.
Holdings Limited, to continue to provide financial support.  We are unable to
determine whether that
letter is a legally enforceable commitment of the
related company.  Further, we are unable to determine, based on profit
forecasts
and other information provided by the directors of the related
company, whether that company could meet the demands made upon it
under the
letter of support, if required.</i>
<P>

<i>	The accounts of A.B.E. Fax Pty Limited have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal business
activities and
the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course
of business.</i>
<P>

<i>	The company incurred an operating loss of $2,151,616 during the year ended
30th June, 1989, and as at that date the company's current
liabilities exceeded
current assets by $3,644,444 and total liabilities exceeded total assets by
$3,764,372.</i>
<P>

<i>	Subsequent to the 30th June, 1989 the company continued to incur operating
losses and a Receiver was appointed on10th November, 1989.
 At that date, a
"Report as to Affairs" was completed by the Receiver which disclosed an
estimated deficiency in net assets of $5,639,912.
 Accordingly, the company has
incurred a loss of $1,875,540 from the 30th June, 1989 to 10th November, 1989.
We are unable to determine
what proportion of this loss relates to either
trading or the write down of assets to their realisable value.</i>
<P>

<i>	Furthermore, the directors have not made any provision for any losses which
will be incurred on realisation against the amounts that
the assets are
currently recorded in the balance sheet, reclassified non-current liabilities
as current and provided for closure
costs and contingencies that could be
expected to crystallise on cessation of the company's operations.'</i>

<P>

405	In paragraph 7 of his statement of 14 May 1998, Mr Booth had said:
<P>

	<i>`The first time that I saw that letter [being annexure `H' to his
statement] was in April 1998.  At no time did Paola, Plante or Terrey
discuss
with me the matters which are set out in that letter.  The letter makes
reference to matters which are contrary to the understanding
that I had between
October 1989 and February 1990 of the position of Paola Holdings' companies.
</i>[I interpolate that this sentence was only admitted as indicating a
reference to what follows in the following two sentences.]  <i>In particular,
the letter states that the Paola Holdings Group would have a negative cash flow
during the 1989 to 1990 year of $1.5
million whereas the documents presented to
me by Mr Paola indicated a positive cash flow of for the first six months from
January
to June 1990 of $1.6 million.  The letter also states that Currabubula
Holdings had refused to provide financial support to the Paola
companies, and
that the Paola companies might therefore not be able to continue as a going
concern . . . If I had seen this letter
or been informed of the matters set out
in it I would have withdrawn the submission which I had made in support of the
application
for the increase in facilities and I would not have signed the
letter of offer dated 1 February 1990 . . . If I had seen the letter
after 1
February, I would have withdrawn the offer or recommended that the increase in
facilities be withdrawn.'</i>
<P>

406	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth recalled that he had expressed two views
in relation to the letter.  `One was surprise on
the profit position of the
Group and a statement that Currabubula would not be made available to support
the position of the other
companies'.  [T 490]
<P>

407	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth accepted that he appreciated that the
letter was a letter from the auditor raising concerns
about the Group and that
he knew that the accounts of the Company were prepared by the Company and not
by the auditor.  He accepted
that he knew that the underlying information was
marshalled by the Company and put into the final accounts and that it was
common
for auditors to have discussions with the audited company and its
management about concerns which the auditors had about certain
matters.  On
being shown the document entitled `Preliminary Draft for Discussion Purposes
Only', Mr Booth indicated that he was not
certain whether that additional
document was part of the material that he was aware of when he made his
statement of 14 May 1990.
 However, he said `given that this was the only part
of the document annexure to the statement, I'm concluding that was the case'
-
suggesting as I understood him that although he was not certain, his conclusion
was that he had made his statement of 14 May 1990
without being aware of the
2-page `Preliminary Draft for Discussion Purposes Only' document.  [T 490-493
generally]
<P>

408	Mr Booth's reading of the letter was that it was a fairly conclusive
statement that the auditors were going to give an opinion,
that the opinion was
not as a going concern.  His view was that the letter did not seem to invite
further discussion on the topic
and it was upon that basis that he made his
statement on 14 May.  [T493]
<P>

409	The cross-examination continued:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And its on the basis that further discussion wasn't being invited, as
you understood it, that you gave the opinion that you would
have withdrawn the
offer, as you put it, of the increase facilities?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Putting myself as the account manager at the time, had I received this
letter I believe that's what I would have done.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	As I say, that's because you formed the view the letter didn't invite
further discussions of the matters referred to therein.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's my reading of it. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And I suppose you noticed . . . the reference to ABE Jet intending to
sell the aircraft . . . ?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The words in that point are on the basis that ABE Jet had not yet sold
the jet aircraft.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes and you knew though they were trying to sell the aircraft?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you knew they were relatively confident that the aircraft would be
sold in the first half of 1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That was the information we were receiving yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So don't you think if you'd received this letter, . . . .you might have
talked to Mr Paola upon the basis upon which they thought
they'd be able to
sell the jet?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's not a question I can answer with a yes or no. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Yes, we would have spoken to Mr Paola but not, I think, with the current
offer still in place.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But you wouldn't withdraw the offer would you?  You wouldn't prevent it
being put into effect because it was an approval of the
Credit Committee,
without first making serious efforts to talk to the management of the customer
about the matters set out in the
letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And did you see . . . that the Group, Paola Holdings including ABE
Holdings, would incur liabilities out of the guarantees given
to the creditors
of Fax;  did you notice that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . Do you see . . . an additional $500,000 figure there was being
discussed in relation to claims by creditors of Fax.  Do
you see that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood when you read that last year that they were claims
made against ABE Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood didn't you at least at the time you made your
statement that in February 1990 Mr Paola was proposing a mechanism
to the Bank
to quarantine the Group from claims from those very creditors?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	You're talking here of the meeting of 12 February?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Didn't you think then, before you made your statement on 14 May last
year that in relation to that figure also you would have
had to have talked to
Mr Paola?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Prior to that meeting yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And in relation to whether or not you would withdraw the offer,
certainly if you learned of this letter after the meeting you'd
think  well,
hang on, that's what Tony Paola was talking about, I'd better talk to him
further before I take any dramatic action
on this auditor's letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	This is a very difficult issue for me to answer.  It's a hypothetical
situation.  Can I rephrase what I had said earlier, the
Bank would not have
approved the settlement of that facility on the disclosure given in that letter
without significant variations
to the arrangements for those facilities.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . You knew didn't you in the early part of 1990 that Mr Swinburne
had formed the view - and you agreed with it apparently
- that this Group could
not service its then debt level with the Bank from its operations you knew
that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You knew from December that a $1.3 million loss had been made to the end
of November?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You hadn't been told anything up to and including 12 February to suggest
that that picture had in some way got significantly better?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You knew that the Group could only satisfactorily operate if it sold
assets and reduced debt levels to levels that it could service
from its
operating income;  you knew that didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That was our view yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And there is nothing in this letter I suggest to you that changes that
perception of the Group - nothing at all?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	But for one very significant issue.  We now have an independent
accountant in informing us officially.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Informing you officially of what?  You never got this letter.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well you asked me what I would have done had I got this letter . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	So you say of course the view expressed in your statement had you seen
it is on the basis that you were provided it by the auditor?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes . . . the emphasis being on the provision of an official
notification by an independent authority yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because until it was so provided, especially when you've seen the
discussion payment element, you would accept, wouldn't you,
that it's a private
communication between the auditor and the client about a possible qualification
to the accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I agree that it's a private communication between the auditor and the
client about a possible qualification to the accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I agree that that it's a private communication.  I think "possible" is
not an accurate word in that instance . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you notice when you carefully read this letter before making your
May 1998 statement that it referred on two occasions to
support from the Paola
Group, or from Currabubula Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I recall that it referred to support from Currabubula.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you noticed I suppose that the auditors were saying in effect
without a guarantee of that support the Paola Group may not
be able to continue
as a going concern?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You say that you would have taken the action his Honour has referred you
to in paragraph 7 had you seen this letter, and you've
said the basis of that,
but you, of course, took action to secure the interests of the Bank, that was
your job?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You weren't a flag bearer for other creditors or other people Mr Paola
did business with, your concern was with the position of
the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You knew that the auditors' concern addressed only the Paola Group
proper - Paola Holdings and its subsidiaries didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	My reading of this letter was it included all companies other than
Currabubula Holdings.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And it was your understanding certainly in February 1990 that the Bank
had security over Currabubula's properties to which it
could look if it had
to?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And therefore won't you agree with me that the basis of concern
expressed by the auditor in the paragraph "in view of the above"
was really
only of academic interest at best to the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	. . . I can only repeat what I've already submitted.  The Bank had it
seen this letter would have reacted.  Without going into
great length as we are
now about what the possible interpretations of the paragraphs were, an auditor
was saying that the Group could
possibly not meet its commitments, that that
would have raised alarm bells.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That's something that you of course knew in January from Mr Swinburne's
note - you knew it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Knew it?  I don't know if "knew it" was an accurate word, certainly
suspected it;  were concerned about it, yes.'   </i>[T 493-498]
<P>

	<b>February 1990</b>
<P>

410	On Mr Paola's evidence in February 1990, he became aware that Fernbank
Industries intended to set its shareholding in U-Bix
(N.Z.).
<P>

	<b>1 February 1990 - Facility Letter - Increase to $8.5million</b>
<P>

411	By letter of 1 February 1990, the Bank wrote to Paola Holdings and to
Currabubula Holdings offering to extend its facility to
$8.5million together
with a facility for leases of $500,000.  That letter, which for the first time
included ABE Fax, ABE Travel,
Franxton and Pyojit in the list of borrowers, is
set out in Appendix 6.
<P>

412	In early February 1990, Mr Diamond was asked by Mr Peter Terrey of ABE to
approach, on behalf of ABE Holdings as guarantor,
Mitsubishi, a major
contingent creditor of ABE Fax, with a view to compromising its claim.  That
approach proved to be unsuccessful.
<P>

413	Following that meeting with Mitsubishi, it became apparent on Mr Diamond's
evidence, that the contingent liability of ABE Holdings,
the detailed affairs
of which at that time he was not completely aware, was becoming a real issue
affecting ABE Holdings.  He was
then asked by officers of ABE Holdings to
assist in determining a strategy to protect the company and the secured
creditors in the
first place from the contingent unsecured guarantee claimants
flowing from ABE Fax to ABE Holdings.
<P>

414	He gave evidence that in that regard he had met with Mr Paola and Mr Terrey
on a number of occasions to discuss various strategies
in the early part of
February 1990.
<P>

415	His evidence was that the strategy which was determined, was effectively
that set out in the letter of 13 February 1990 from
Ferrier Hodgson to the
State Bank.
<P>

416	On 5 February 1990, a meeting of the directors of Paola Holdings took
place.  At this meeting the letter from the auditors was
tabled.  The minutes
record the auditors' expressing an opinion in the letter that the going concern
convention may not be appropriate
for the audit report in respect of the 1989
year, and that the directors `discussed some of the options available to
rectify the
problem'.  The minutes include the following:
<P>

	<i>`The directors discussed some of the options available to rectify this
problem, including a letter of support from Currabubula Holdings
and the sale
of ABE Jet Charter Pty Limited to Currabubula Holdings.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was noted that the auction of Durhambone was set down for 4 April and
that Okura Australia was seeking head office approval to
defer their claim at
present.'  </i>[PX 1075]
<P>

417	On 5 February 1990, Mr Cameron and Mr Herring both resigned as directors of
Paola Holdings and on the same day Mr Hardy was
advised by Mr Richardson of
KPMG Peat Marwick, Sydney, that there would be no guarantee from Currabubula to
support the Paola Group
as the `other' shareholders of that company would not
agree.  Mr Hardy's note of 5 February 1990, appearing at PX 1078 and 1079,
includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`John Richardson met with Tony Paola and Duncan Plante in Sydney today to
discuss letter to directors and qualification.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Basically, they wanted . . . take appreciable action to avoid
qualification, if possible.  The other directors had recommended
a conservative
approach (?) but Tony believed problems could be solved.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Could not give a guarantee from Currabubula to this Group as the `other'
shareholders of that company would not agree.  (Who are
they?)'</i>
<P>

	<i>[This does not make sense as they did it with the Bank?]</i>  PX 1078
<P>

418	On 7 February 1990, the Paola Group companies accepted the letter of offer
to extend the facilities.
<P>

	<b>12 February 1990</b>
<P>

419	Mr Booth's evidence was that the drawings of the Paola Group exceeded
$8.5million on or about 12 February 1990 at which time
the account was
overdrawn and outside of even the revised facility.  His evidence was that the
drawings of the Paola Group were monitored
closely by him at that time and he
would review the total drawings each day.  His evidence was that the figures
were a day old because
the accounts would be updated each night to take account
of the transactions that occurred during the day and that for this reason
he
would have learned that the account became overdrawn on 12 February 1990, on
the following day, being Tuesday 13 February 1990.
 [Statement 20 November 1996
para 34]
<P>

	<b>Meeting of 12 February 1990</b>
<P>

420	On 12 February 1990, a meeting took place between Mr Paola and Mr Plante
and representing the Bank, Messrs Booth, Swinburne
and Ms Osborne.  Mr Diamond
of Ferrier Hodgson was also present as was Mr White of Blake Dawson Waldron.
<P>

	<b>Evidence of Mr Paola</b>
<P>

421	Mr Paola had in his first statement stated that the meeting took place on
13 February 1990.  In evidence, he accepted that the
meeting in all likelihood
took place on 12 February 1990.
<P>

422	In his statement, he had stated that the purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the options open in relation to the imminent
claims against ABE
Holdings and that it was proposed that Currabubula Holdings was to purchase all
the plant and equipment and land
of ABE Holdings at book value in order to
protect the assets of the company.
<P>

423	In his statement, he had asserted that he recalled saying to the Bank at
the meeting words to the effect:
<P>

	<i>`If you don't like the idea of putting ABE Holdings into receivership we
won't do it.  Currabubula will give it the support it needs.'</i>
<P>

424	He had also said in his statement that during the course of the meeting,
there was considerable discussion as to whether the
suggestion was to be
actioned.  He recalled in his statement that at the end of the meeting he had a
conversation with Mr Swinburne
in which words to the following effect were
said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Paola:	Jim what do you think?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	It sounds alright Tony we will just have to sit down and talk
about it amongst ourselves now.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	Just keep in mind that if the bank for some reason doesn't want
us to do it, then we won't.  What we're doing is purely
trying to protect the
assets and not pay the full amount on leases for premises we no longer
occupy.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	She'll be alright Tony just leave it with us.'</i>
<P>

425	In his evidence in chief, Mr Paola said as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	. . . I want you . . . to recall . . . the conversation that took place
at that meeting as best you can . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I said that we wanted to put a proposal to the Bank which involved ABE
Holdings and that Ferrier Hodgson's representative would
explain the mechanics.
I further said that this was a proposal and we were seeking the Bank's
approval.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Diamond said words to the effect that they had come to the conclusion
that the best way to achieve our objectives was to put a
- for the Bank to put
a receiver into ABE Holdings and Diane Osborne said after Mr Diamond completed
his explanation that - she said
something like, "What you are asking us to do
is agree to us, your company in committing a fraud on the unsecured creditors
of ABE
Holdings".  I said "No, that's not what we're trying to achieve but just
simply - but we are looking to isolate - isolate ABE Holdings
so it doesn't
have any - doesn't have to pay those creditors which are flowing through from
guarantees provided by - provided on
behalf of ABE Fax".</i>
<P>

<i>	I then further said "Of course we are not looking to do anything which the
Bank is not happy with and we wouldn't do this if the
Bank doesn't agree.
Currabubula Holdings would continue to support ABE Holdings".</i>
<P>

<i>	At the end of the meeting, I can recall on the way out that I said words to
Jim Swinburne "Jim, if for some reason the Bank doesn't
want to do this, then
we won't do it" and he said words to the effect that "She'll be right Tony.
Just leave it with us.  We will

you" and the meeting ended.'  </i>[T 50]

	<b>Evidence of Mr Booth</b>
<P>

426	Mr Booth gave evidence on statement that he did not recall Mr Paola stating
words to the effect that if the bank did not like
the idea of putting ABE
Holdings into receivership this would not be done or that Currabubula would
give ABE Holdings the support
it needed.
<P>

427	Mr Booth's evidence was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`At the meeting, I recall that the Bank was informed that ABE Holdings, a
holding company for several other important companies within
the Paola Group of
Companies, was insolvent.  The representatives of the Bank were informed that
it had approximately $1million shortfall
from total debts to the Bank of
approximately $4.8million.  A request was made to place ABE Holdings into
receivership.  I recall
there was discussion about creditors to whom ABE
Holdings had a liability by reason of it guaranteeing the debts of ABE Fax,
however
I cannot recall the size of the debts referred to at the meeting.
These debtors could take steps to wind up ABE Holdings.  It was
proposed by
Paola or his representatives that all the assets of ABE Holdings be sold to
other members of the Paola Group of Companies
at market value prior to placing
the Company into receivership.  We were also told that a report from Ferrier
Hodgson would be submitted
to the Bank within the next day.'   </i>[Para 36
Statement of Mr Booth of 20 November 1996]
<P>

428	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth gave the following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And I just want to ask you a number of questions about what was said at
that meeting [the 12 February 1990 meeting] if you can
recollect.  Now during
the course of that meeting I want to suggest to you that the position of ABE
Holdings was obviously discussed?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the idea of putting ABE Holdings into receivership was raised with
the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>Now I want to suggest that Mr Paola said words to the effect,
if the Bank didn't like the idea of putting ABE Holdings into receivership,
he
wouldn't do it.  And that he said "Currabubula will give it the support it
needs" do you recall that</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>I can't recall those words, no</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>But it certainly possible, isn't it, that Mr Paola said
something to that effect?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>He could have, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now, do you recall any discussion between Mr Swinburne and Mr Paola at
the end of the meeting?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you don't recall being party to any discussion between Mr Swinburne
and Mr Paola as the meeting was breaking up?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh, no, no recollection.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now, do you recall whether there was any discussion of the position of
unsecured creditors of ABE Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think there was.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And do you remember Ms Osborne saying anything about their
position?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can I put something to you and see if it stirs any memory.  Would it be
the case that Ms Osborne said something like "What you're
asking us to do is to
agree to your company committing a fraud on the unsecured creditors of ABE
Holdings"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't think so, I think - no, I can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And I want to suggest to you that at some stage Mr Paola said - in the
context of unsecured creditors - "no, that's not what we're
trying to achieve,
but simply we are looking to isolate ABE Holdings so it doesn't have to pay
those creditors which are flowing
through from guarantees provided on behalf of
ABE Fax"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Again, I can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But it's your recollection, isn't it, that the thrust of what you were
being told at the meeting by Mr Paola was that they wanted
a receiver appointed
to ABE Holdings to isolate that company from claims of contingent creditors in
relation to guarantees given
by ABE Holdings for some of the debts of ABE Fax .
. .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The question is that did Mr Paola wish the Bank to appoint its receivers
to ABE Holdings because of claims by creditors of ABE
Fax that had rights
against ABE Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes that's a much better way of putting it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think the answer is yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	</i><cite>And I want to suggest to you that Mr Paola made it entirely
clear that he wouldn't press the issue of an appointment of a receiver
to ABE
Holdings if the Bank wasn't perfectly happy with that course of
action?</cite>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes, the answer is yes</cite><i>.'  </i>[T 488-489]
[Emphasis added]
<P>

429	A later information paper written by Mr Booth stated inter alia in relation
to the 12 February 1990 meeting, the following:
<P>

	<i>`During a meeting with Paola Group Management on 12 February 1990 we were
advised of concerns held for potential claims by creditors
of ABE Fax whose
arrangements give them recourse to ABE Holdings.  (These creditors are
primarily lessors of equipment to ABE Fax
whose lease documents contain
guarantees from ABE Holdings).  Whilst offers had been made by other Paola
companies to continue meeting
the lease commitments it appears these offers
will not be accepted and the leasing companies will shortly foreclose.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst the amount involved is less than $500,000, Mr Paola does not want to
allow claims to be made in ABE Holdings.  In a report
prepared by Ferrier
Hodgson (who is advising Mr Paola) it was reported that whilst the company's
assets exceed liabilities, a large
proportion of the assets are in the form of
inter company loans which will not be readily repayable.'   </i>[PX page

<P>

	<b>Ms Osborne's Note</b>
<P>

430	Ms Diane Osborne's note of the 12 February 1990 meeting, Exhibit PX pages

<P>

<i>	</i>To my mind there is nothing in the note which is materially
inconsistent with Mr Paola's evidence as to the events at the meeting.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Evidence of Mr Swinburne</b>
<P>

431	In his statement of 18 November 1996, Mr Swinburne gave evidence that he
recalled attending a meeting at which Mr Paola, Mr
Silvia and others were
present at or about 12 February 1990.  He recalled that at the meeting he and
other bank officers present
were informed that another company in the Paola
Group company ABE Holdings was probably insolvent because of the guarantees he
had
given to the creditors of ABE Fax Pty Limited.  He could not recall Mr
Paola saying words to the effect:  "If you don't like the
idea of putting ABE
Holdings into receivership, we won't do it.  Currabubula will give it the
support it needs".
<P>

432	In so far as Mr Paola had given evidence as to the conversation he had with
Mr Swinburne at the end of the meeting referred
to above, commencing "Jim, what
do you think" and finishing "with us", Mr Swinburne in his first statement said
that he did not recall
specifically this conversation but "certainly do not
believe I said . . . `she'll be alright Tony, just leave it with us'".  His
recollection was that he said very little during the meeting and that what he
said was very non-committal.  This was because he regarded
the news of the
second company being possibly insolvent which was a more significant company in
the Group as a very serious matter.
<P>

433	In his second statement, Mr Swinburne in relation to the 12 February 1990
meeting, gave evidence that he recollected that at
the meeting Mr Paola and/or
Mr Silvia had said to the bank officers who were present words to the effect
"ABE Holdings Pty Limited
is insolvent".
<P>

434	Under cross-examination, Mr Swinburne accepted that he did not have a
precise recollection of everything that was said at the
meeting.  He was
asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And is your recollection generally poor, apart from the words "ABE
Holdings Pty Limited is insolvent", do you have any other recollection
of what
was said?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I recall it was a reasonably long meeting.  It wasn't short.  But the
significance of insolvency was the issue that was uppermost
in my mind.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And in the meeting I want to put this to you and see if it rings a bell.
Did Mr Paola say words to the effect to the bank officers:</i>
<P>

<i>	"If you don't like the idea of putting ABE Holdings into receivership we
won't do it.  Currabubula will give it the support it needs."</i>
<P>

<i>	I don't recall that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You wouldn't deny it was said though;  you just have no
recollection?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I can't deny it but I don't recall it.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 532]
<P>

435	Also under cross-examination, it was pointed out to Mr Swinburne that in
paragraph 11 of his first statement, he had only specifically
taken issue with
Mr Paola's evidence that, at the end of the meeting Mr Swinburne had said to Mr
Paola "She'll be alright Tony, just
leave it with us".  It was put to Mr
Swinburne at transcript page 533 that he did not take issue with the first part
of Mr Paola's
evidence of what had been said between himself and Mr Swinburne
because Mr Swinburne is not in a position to deny that this may have
been said.
Mr Swinburne accepted that he thought this was true.  [T 533]
<P>

436	In short, Mr Swinburne could not deny that Mr Paola had said "Jim what do
you think" and Mr Swinburne had said "It sounds alright
Tony we will just have
to sit down and talk about it amongst ourselves" and Mr Paola had then said
"Just keep in mind that if the
Bank for some reason doesn't want us to do it,
then we won't.  What we're doing is purely trying to protect the assets and not
pay
the full amount on leases for premises we no longer occupy".
<P>

	<b>Evidence of Mr Diamond</b>
<P>

437	Mr Diamond in his statement gave evidence that the minutes of the 12
February 1990 meeting taken in Ms Osborne's handwriting,
reflected to the best
of his recollection the gist of what was said at the meeting.
<P>

438	In his statement Mr Diamond had further stated as follows:
<P>

	<i>`I recall at that meeting Paola said words which I do not recall but effect
(sic) of which were that it was indicated ABE Holdings
was insolvent and in
order to best protect the position of the bank and the company it was
recommended that a receiver be appointed.
 Mr Paola also indicated he did not
wish to do anything that was out of step with the bank and did not wish to
precipitate an action
from the bank which was inconsistent with his best
interests or the interest of his companies . . .    At the meeting . . . Mr
Paola
suggested that I would prepare a report and I agreed to assist the bank
to consider what avenue it would take.'  </i>[Statement para 20]
<P>

439	Under cross-examination Mr Diamond said that he could recall the atmosphere
of the meeting and recalled there having been discussed
at the meeting a
proposal put on behalf of the Paola Group which involved the sale of certain
assets to Currabubula.  The other part
of the proposal raised for consideration
at the meeting which he could recall was:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Paola was explaining to the Bank that his Company, ABE Holdings, was
insolvent and that the Bank should, in his opinion, take
action to protect its
position by the appointment of a receiver and following on from such an
appointment, he canvassed the concept
of acquiring some of the assets at a
later time from the receiver to enable him to retain control of his
assets.'</i>  [T 228.25]
<P>

440	Under cross-examination, Mr Diamond said that he recalled something being
said by Mr Paola to the effect that he wouldn't go
ahead with the proposals if
the Bank was not happy with them.  He was then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And is that really the extent of your recollection about what was said
at the meeting"</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's the content of what was said at the meeting, yes as I recall . .
.'     </i>[T 228]
<P>

441	Mr Macfarlan did not put to Mr Diamond that this recollection was incorrect
or that Mr Paola had not said that he would not
go ahead with the proposals if
the Bank was not happy with them.
<P>

442	It will be noted from the above extract from Mr Diamond's statement that in
paragraph 20 of his statement he had used the words
`Mr Paola also indicated he
did not wish to do anything that was out of step with the Bank and did not wish
to precipitate an action
from the Bank which was inconsistent with his best
interests or the interest of his companies'.
<P>

443	Mr Diamond, having given an answer to the effect that what was really the
extent of his recollection about what was said at
the meeting was something
being said by Mr Paola to the effect that he wouldn't go ahead with those
proposals if the Bank wasn't
happy with them, was not further tested on his
evidence that Mr Paola had referred to not wishing `to precipitate an action
from
the Bank which was inconsistent with his or his company's interests'.
<P>

444	Mr Diamond was also asked to explain what he had meant when he had referred
to the gist of the proposal as being `to protect
the viable assets of the Group
on behalf of the secured creditor and the Group from the effective unsecured
claims'.  His answer
was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`. . . The proposal which was made in that report was made in the context
where one of the unsecured creditors - a major contingent
unsecured creditor
was threatening to wind up the company - that would give rise to, if it was
left to run its course - because I
didn't believe anybody had the cash to pay
them or the desire to pay them at that time, in priority to the Bank - that
would give
rise to the appointment of a liquidator to ABE Holdings and the gist
of the report was to provide the company and the Bank with a
mechanism whereby
it, as the secured creditor and having a priority position as a secured
creditor, could control the sale process
as opposed to an external party who
was not their agent, but who would be the agent of the unsecured creditors
taking control for
the purpose of sale.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Evidence of Mr Plante</b>
<P>

445	Mr Plante had, in his statement of 27 October 1998, also recalled the
relevant meeting as taking place on 13 February 1990.
 In his statement, he had
said:
<P>

	<i>`At that meeting a proposal was floated to the State Bank that ABE Holdings
Limited which was a member of the Group, should have a
receiver appointed to
the company to quarantine it from potential creditors' claims arising from
guarantees it gave in support of
ABE Fax Pty Limited.  I recall conversations
took place to the effect that the proposal was part of the same restructure
which involved
ABE Fax Pty Limited.</i>
<P>

<i>	I recall words were said to the State Bank to the following effect by
someone present:</i>
<P>

<i>	"We just want to take ABE Holdings out of the group equation and we are
just bouncing this idea off you.  What do you think?"</i>
<P>

<i>	I recall that the representations of the State Bank responded to that
question to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	"We will be thinking about it."</i>
<P>

<i>	I do not now recall the words spoken at the meeting but recall that the
meeting proceeded on the basis that the bank was aware of
the cash issues and
the trading position of the group that I have described above and that the
meeting was discussing how to best
work over the problem to protect the Bank in
its secured position, keep the group viable and to meet continuing obligations.
It was
in that context that this proposal was floated.'</i>
<P>

446	Mr Plante was not cross-examined on his recollection of the events at the
meeting.
<P>

447	Ultimately, there was no serious divide as to what had in fact occurred at
the meeting.  Mr Paola's evidence was in the main,
not inconsistent with that
given by Mr Plante or Mr Diamond.  To the extent that Mr Paola's evidence as to
the events at the meeting
is inconsistent with that given by any of the
witnesses who gave evidence as to these events, I accept Mr Paola's evidence as
to
what occurred.
<P>

	<b>13 February 1990</b>
<P>

448	By letter dated 13 February 1990, ABE Holdings wrote to the Bank, attention
Mr Booth, as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Following a recent examination of the accounts of ABE Holdings Limited as
at 31 December 1989, the directors of the company have
determined that the
company is insolvent.</i>
<P>

<i>	That insolvency is before consideration of contingent liabilities which
might amount to $500,000.</i>
<P>

<i>	The directors have therefore directed me to request that the State Bank
appoint a receiver to the company and this letter is to request
that Mr Brian
Silvia be appointed as the receiver.</i>
<P>

<i>	As discussed at our meeting yesterday it is important that such an
appointment be made as soon as possible.</i>
<P>

<i>	Please let me know if you require further information.'</i>
<P>

449	The letter was signed by Mr Plante as Company Secretary.
<P>

450	On the same day, Ferrier Hodgson wrote to the Bank, attention Ms Osborne.
The terms of the letter are set out in Appendix 7.
<P>

451	An information paper written by Mr Booth, appearing at Exhibit PX page 150
records that the Ferrier Hodgson letter was served
upon the Bank on 14 February
1990.  The plaintiffs however accept that both letters were served on the Bank
on 13 February.  [T 498]
 The difference is immaterial.
<P>

452	Under cross-examination, Mr Booth at transcript 499 recalled that when he
had received and read the letter from Ferrier Hodgson,
he formed a view that
there was concern about the loan recorded to Paola Holdings.  He was asked
whether he remembered that at the
time he read the letter, the restructure of
the Group in June 1989 whereby large amounts of inter-company debt had been
extinguished.
His answer was 
<P>

	<i>`Whether I remembered it specifically at the time, no.  I think my
recollection was more along the lines that were a number of inter-company
debts.  I was aware that a number had been forgiven.  I was therefore from that
point on not sure what the actual situation was between
the company.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	. . . Well would this be an accurate summary of your understanding of
the inter company debt forgiveness that we're speaking of
: that it was
designed to remove debts owed by Currabubula Holdings to operating companies
within the Paola Holdings Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I honestly can't remember but I suspect that that may have been the case
. . .'   </i>[T 499]
<P>

453	Also Mr Booth as at 13 February 1990 understood that Paola Holdings Pty
Limited was still only a passive holding company.  [T
500]
<P>

454	At transcript 500, under cross-examination of Mr Booth, the following
appears:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	What I want to suggest to you is when you read them </i>[the two 13
February letters]<i> it was clear in your mind that they were part of Mr
Paola's proposal on 12 February 1990 for the appointment of receiver to ABE
Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you knew that that proposal, in term, had been advanced on the basis
that if the Bank didn't go along with it the proposal
would not be pressed and
Currabubula would provide financial support to ABE Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I don't think so.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I want to suggest to you that you knew that the letters were advanced in
that context?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't think so.'    </i>[T 500]
<P>

455	It was suggested to Mr Booth in cross-examination that when he spoke to Mr
Stenhouse, the Company Solicitor, the discussion
was on the basis that a formal
statement of insolvency had been made by ABE Holdings.  Mr Booth's answer was
that he believed that
that was what the letter of 13 February was as well.
<P>

456	It was suggested to Mr Booth at transcript 501 that the discussion was on
the basis that there had been a formal statement of
insolvency about ABE and he
accepted that the Bank had been formally notified of the insolvency.
<P>

457	Mr Booth then accepted that his perception was that the notification had
become formal.  [T 501]
<P>

458	The cross-examination continued:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You knew didn't you on 12 February that there was a high likelihood
that without the financial support of Currabubula Holdings,
ABE Holdings would
be insolvent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I didn't know.  I wasn't sure.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you say you weren't sure you were pretty much convinced that was
the case weren't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No I wasn't sure.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I suggest to you that you spoke to Mr Stenhouse not because something of
striking significance had been told to you - that is
the insolvency of ABE
Holdings - but for legal advice about the formal communication of that position
to the Bank?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	My answer is I spoke to him for both purposes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I suggest to you that Mr Stenhouse said that the formal notification
meant that there shouldn't be further operations on the existing
accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	We sought advice in response to that formal notification.  I think that
was one of the issues . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You were advised by Mr Stenhouse that to remove any risk of payments
made by Group members to the Bank being found to be preferences,
there
shouldn't be any further operations on the Number One accounts, as they came to
be called, and that new accounts should be
opened?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And they should operate on a credit basis?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In your experience with the State Bank did you ever encounter a case
where an operating company in a group came to the Bank and
said it was
insolvent and the Bank then opened new accounts for it to trade in
credit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Perhaps not before, but certainly since.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I want to suggest to you that certainly at that time that was in your
experience unique?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's the first time I was directly involved in anything like that
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because, just moving ahead slightly, when the Number Two accounts were
set up the companies operated freely on them as long as
they were in
credit?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the Bank didn't try and force the transfer of moneys in credit in
the Number Two accounts back into the Number One accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And indeed the Bank in relation to sums of money approaching $150,000
permitted the reverse;  that is, to say the transfer of
moneys put into the
Number One accounts after 15 February into the Number Two accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I can't recall the amounts but I agree it did occur.'  </i>[T 502]
<P>

459	Mr Diamond gave evidence under cross-examination in relation to the Ferrier
13 February 1990 report to the Bank, inter alia
in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And amongst the assets of ABE Holdings appearing in that Statement of
Position was the item "loans to related companies"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Having a book value of $5.725million and an estimated realisable value
of $625,000?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The total estimated deficiency shown in respect of that Statement of
Position was $874,000?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And there is an explanation is there not on page 1107 of the item
relating to shares in related companies?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	1106 - loans to related companies, correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And amongst those loans was one recorded in the books to Paola Holdings,
$4.454million?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the conclusion expressed by this Statement of Position was that that
had an estimated realisable value of nil?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'      </i>[T 230.40-.57]
<P>

<i>	`Q.	And a reader of this statement of position of ABE Holdings Limited
could reasonably come to the conclusion that the view was
being expressed by
this document that Paola Holdings Pty Limited was worthless?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, potentially.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Perhaps let me put another alternative before you agree to that - or
that the loan was irrecoverable for some other reason such
as the lack of legal
enforceability?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Or if I could suggest that the recoverability was, in the context of
this report, circular and didn't add anything to the equation.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes, well perhaps you could just explain that.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Because Paola Holdings . . . had loan accounts coming in the other
direction, so it had debits and credits through - within the
Group, which on a
net group basis didn't add anything to it.'    </i>[T 231 lines 1-21]
<P>

460	Mr Diamond under cross-examination said that the purpose of the report `was
to advise the Bank that the Company was insolvent
and could not meet its
creditors.  It didn't have sufficient liquidity to meet its creditors, and for
that reason was under attack
by a contingent creditor, being a guarantee for a
creditor of ABE Fax, so I was trying to convey to the Bank that if they did not
take control of the process, the process would go to the appointment of a
liquidator, who would be the agent of the Company and the
unsecured creditors
and not of the Bank.  And therefore, that was the thrust of this report.'
[T231.50-232.5]
<P>

461	In his statement, Mr Diamond had stated:
<P>

	<i>`Regarding the Statement of Position in relation to Paola Holdings . . .
the insertion of a nil estimated value of Paola Holdings
does not say anything
either for or against the solvency of Paola Holdings.  Since Paola Holdings is
part of the Group of Companies,
it had circular dealings with the other Group
companies, Currabubula Holdings and the Bank.  Because of the circularity, it
did not
add anything to the net estimated realisable value of the particular
asset being a loan from ABE Holdings to Paola Holdings.  [Para
27]</i>
<P>

<i>	The Statement of Position does not say either way whether or not Paola
Holdings was able to pay its debts as they fell due because
the Statement of
Position was prepared for the purpose of determining the solvency or otherwise
of ABE Holdings only.  The effect
of the Statement of Position is to say that
ABE Holdings in the absence of third party support being provided by way of
security
and cash was unable to pay its debts as and when they fell due.'
</i>[Para 28]
<P>

462	Mr Diamond also accepted under cross-examination as to the Statement of
Position, that what it purported to be was an expression
of view about the
financial situation of ABE Holdings when looked at in isolation and that no
distinction was sought to be drawn
in the lists of assets and liabilities
between ones that were current and ones that were long term.  He also agreed
that the conclusion
expressed in the Statement of Position was that there was
an estimated deficiency approaching a million dollars and that there would
have
been no such deficiency for ABE Holdings if the debt owed to it by Paola
Holdings had been recoverable.  He also agreed with
the proposition that the
recoverability or otherwise of Paola Holdings' debt was a matter of
considerable importance in determining
what the bottom line position would
appear to be from this statement.  [T 232-233]
<P>

463	He was also asked and answered the following questions:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And do you not accept that to look fairly at the position of ABE
Holdings in isolation one would need to form a view about the
recoverability or
otherwise of the loan due to it from Paola Holdings?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And would you not agree that the view expressed about that issue in this
document is that the loan had a nil realisable value?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Within the context of this report, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And would you not agree that a reader of this statement could
justifiably reach the conclusion that the author of it was expressing
the view
that Paola Holdings was worthless?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	One could come to that conclusion, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well there's nothing on the face of this document anywhere is there to
suggest that the conclusion would be unjustified?   . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No there's not.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the same considerations apply don't they in respect of the item ABE
Jet Charter Pty Limited which is shown there in the list
of loans to related
companies?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's correct yes.'     </i>[T 233]
<P>

	<b>14 February 1990</b>
<P>

464	Mr Booth's evidence was that as at 14 February 1990 the facility for the
Paola Group was still overdrawn and stood at $8,535,577.18
and that he had a
meeting with Mr Paul Stenhouse on that day.  To the best of his recollection,
he was at the meeting together with
Mr Swinburne and Mr Owen.
<P>

465	Mr Booth's evidence was that the Bank did not at that stage rely upon the
default of ABE Holdings to call up the entire amounts
then due and owing.
[Paras 40 and 41 Statement of 20 November 1996]
<P>

466	In the same information paper already referred to, Mr Booth said at PX
1150:
<P>

	<i>`On Wednesday 14 February 1990 Ferrier Hodgson served us a letter stating
inter alia that ABE Holdings was insolvent and requesting
the Bank to appoint a
receiver to that Company.  That request was not complied with for the following
reasons:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Because of the interlocking nature of our security and of the inter
company commitments such action we believe would have made
it necessary for the
Bank to place all group borrowing companies and group companies providing
security to the Bank in receivership
also.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Some concern expressed by the Bank's solicitors that our placing ABE
Holdings in receivership could leave the Bank open to charges
of deliberately
acting to thwart the claims of other creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	Our understanding that, even though we are aware that its liquidity
position is tight, the Paola Group is solvent.  Proposed sales
of our security
over the next few months should comfortably repay the Bank and all known
creditors</i>
<P>

<i>	However, the </i><cite>formal</cite><i> statement of ABE Holdings'
insolvency naturally meant that we had to immediately freeze all group accounts
and operate separate working
accounts on a strictly credit basis.</i>
<P>

<i>	At one point during these recent developments we became concerned as to the
group's solvency.  We had heard several rumours that
section 364 notices had
been taken out against various group companies.  After discussion with Mr Paola
late last Friday we became
satisfied that his creditors are all paid up
according to arrangements and therefore these rumours were without
substance.</i>
<P>

<i>	In conclusion, we see no reason for the Bank to initiate any receiverships
at this time.  Nevertheless, should the leasing creditors
of ABE Holdings be
successful in winding up the company or if it is placed in voluntary
liquidation, we may have to assume control
per medium of receivership.  Mr
Paola is however, extremely confident this will not happen.  He assures us he
will be able to pay
these creditors before they are able to complete any
action.  We therefore propose to take no action for the present other than to
monitor the position closely.</i>
<P>

<i>	CASH FLOW/ASSET SALES</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst the present level of debt is not in excess of approved limits,
drawings did exceed $8.5million over the latter half of last
week.  The
situation however, was remedied when all the above overdrawn accounts were
placed in reduction and all cheques subsequently
presented were
returned.</i>
<P>

<i>	The approval of 13 December 1989 included cash flow projections to June
1990.  The total debt projected for end February was $7.65million.
 This
however, was dependent on the sale of two assets (a small property and the jet
aircraft) the net proceeds of which would have
amounted to approximately $1
million.  Neither of these assets have as yet been sold.  The jet however is
still expected to sell
by the end of the month but at a reduced price.</i>
<P>

<i>	In view of all of the above developments revised cash flow projections have
been requested.  In the meantime preliminary figures
released on Friday
indicate the group will be able to continue to trade.  Net cash inflows
expected this month and in March amount
to $330,000 (jet sale not included).  A
further $1.2 million is expected over the remaining months to June 1990.
Offsetting this
of course, will be the need to provide for payments to the ABE
Fax creditors who were the cause of the present difficulties and whose
commitments were not included in the projections.  In view of our reluctance to
comply with Mr Paola's request we should now be prepared
to continue to fund
the group's cash flow requirements which will likely now include provision for
payment to these creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	Above all however it is noteworthy that </i><cite>we are now looking to the
sale in April of the property `Durhambone'</cite><i> (bank valuation
$10million) to significantly reduce present debt.'    </i>[PX 1151]  [emphasis
added]
<P>

467	Under cross-examination, the following was put:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Does the use of the word "formal" by you there, jog your memory that
you were well aware that ABE Holdings could be insolvent,
but it was the formal
statement of it that caused you to take action?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why do you, looking back now, think you used the word "formal"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That it was provided by an independent matter.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well is that a formal statement?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That was my definition of it in that case . . .'</i>  [T 504]
<P>

468	The information paper appears to have been addressed and/or copied to
Messrs Swinburne and Cambridge and to the creditor committee
and to the agenda
clerk.  [See Exhibit PX page 1148]
<P>

469	Mr Booth had no recollection of Mr Paola or any other person raising with
him the use of the words `in liq' on statements sent
to companies in the Paola
Group of Companies at any time relevant to these proceedings.  [Statement 20
November 1996 para 48]
<P>

470	Mr Booth's evidence was that even prior to the Bank being informed of the
insolvency of ABE Holdings Limited, the Bank had been
pressing Mr Paola to
reduce the Paola Group of Companies' indebtedness to the Bank.  In that regard
he referred to the facility letter
of 1 February 1990 requirement for the Group
debt to be reduced from $8.5million to $7.5million by 31 May 1990.  His
evidence was
that Mr Paola had been telling him for approximately 4 or 5 months
prior to February 1990, that he was intending to sell the Durhambone
property.
This, as Mr Booth recalled, was a large property and its sale he believed would
very substantially reduce the indebtedness
of the Paola Group of Companies to
the State Bank.  Accordingly, his evidence was that the Bank was very keen for
Paola to realise
the Durhambone and other assets.  [Statement 20 November 1996
para 49]
<P>

471	Mr Stenhouse gave evidence that although he may have attended the meeting
together with Mr Booth, Mr Swinburne, Ms Osborne,
Mr Paola and Mr Diamond and
others, he has no recollection of doing so or of the events described in
paragraphs 35 and 36 of Mr Booth's
statement.
<P>

472	In a supplementary statement, Mr Stenhouse gave evidence that on many
occasions whilst he was employed by the State Bank, he
was asked to advise by a
Bank Officer as to what he should do following upon receipt of information
indicating that a customer was
insolvent.  Mr Stenhouse gave evidence that it
was his practice to advise that no further drawings should be allowed on
existing
operational accounts and any further deposits should be made to new
accounts, against which drawings could be made.  His evidence
on statement was
`I am aware that it was the Bank's practice in such circumstances to mark the
`frozen' accounts as `in liq' or `in
reduction' on the bank statements and
other documents relating to them'.  [PX D17A]
<P>

473	Under cross-examination, Mr Stenhouse was shown PX 2388, being a Bank
document entitled `Lending Administration - In liquidation'.
 Across the top of
this document, as admitted into evidence, are the handwritten words `1990
Instructions'.  Mr Stenhouse recalled
seeing this document before and accepted
that it was an instruction of the Bank relating to the placing of overdrawn
accounts in
liquidation.  It was an instruction with which he recalled being
familiar.  It was an instruction which applied, he accepted to his
thinking,
when a Bank Officer advises or seeks advice about an insolvent company.  His
evidence was that he was intending to rely
upon this instruction when he spoke
of Bank practice in his statement.  He could not, however, indicate any part of
the document
which referred to insolvent companies.  He was then confronted in
cross-examination with a page of the document at PX 2392 reading,
inter
alia:
<P>

	<i>`Advice to borrower.</i>
<P>

<i>	The borrower, except in the case of insanity, is to be advised promptly
when his/her account has been placed "in liquidation".  Where
the advice has
been conveyed verbally it is to be confirmed by letter which should
cover:</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Overdraft account placed "in liquidation"</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Future banking operations to be transacted through a Number Two or
Working Account.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Number Two or Working Account to be conducted on a credit basis.'</i>
<P>

474	Mr Stenhouse accepted that these were the Bank's instructions, including
that advice should be conveyed verbally or by letter
and that the letter was to
say the overdraft account had been placed in liquidation.  It was put to Mr
Stenhouse that in fact the
placing of the words `in liq' on a bank account
would be a very rare event but he said this was not the case to his knowledge.
He
was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And would you agree with me that the Bank's policy contemplated the
borrower being advised, not by some notation on the statement,
but by a letter
clearly referring to the account being placed in liquidation.  Would you agree
with that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In terms of that, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But your advice as an experienced man, familiar with the Bank's
instructions in 1990, would have been, wouldn't it, write the
customer a letter
clearly explaining that the account has been placed in liquidation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That's putting words in my mouth.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well that's the essence of cross-examination, I'm afraid.  Do you agree
with it or not?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes in principle.'    </i>[Transcript 554]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>15 February 1990 and the `Freezing Letter'</b>
<P>

475	Mr Booth accepted at transcript 504 that there were a number of cheques
drawn on the Number One accounts which were presented
after the freezing date
which were not immediately paid.  [T 504-505]
<P>

476	On 15 February 1990, Mr Booth forwarded to Mr Plante a facsimile enclosing
copies of a number of cheques `returned'.
<P>

477	The materials enclosed under cover of this facsimile appear at PX
1153-1160.
<P>

478	Copies of a number of the cheques are legible and copies of other of the
cheques are difficult to decipher as to all details.
 It does appear, however,
that a number of the cheques can be correlated with cheques originally part of
the first part of Schedule
1 in the summons filed on 23 December 1995 and not
pressed in the final summons on the cheque dishonour cause of action.  Hence,
in respect of the cheques originally pursued on the dishonour cause of action
and said to have been presented on 13 February 1990,
it seems clear that
although presented on 13 February 1990, cheques numbered 563607, 563627,
563619, 563610 and 563632 were all dated
31 December 1989.  It also seems clear
that of the cheques presented on 13 February 1990, cheques numbered 563681,
563678 and 563673
were all drawn on 30 January 1990.  In short, it appears that
ABE Holdings had held back a number of cheques.
<P>

479	At approximately 3pm on 15 February 1990, Mr Booth forwarded a further
facsimile to the managers, Tamworth, Moree, Narrabri,
Gunnedah and Macquarie
Centre.
<P>

480	The message read:
<P>

	<i>`As advised in my telephone calls today all current accounts for the Paola
Group of Companies are to be frozen forthwith.  For details
of accounts see
attached listing (note ABE Travel which is in credit is not to be included for
this action).</i>
<P>

<i>	A request to open number 2 accounts for certain of these entities is
attached.  Could the relevant branches arrange new accounts
as requested.  I
believe specimen signatures are already held.</i>
<P>

<i>	Note:	1.	All further drawings on the existing current accounts are to be
returned.</i>
<P>

<i>		2.	All the new number 2 accounts are to be operated on a credit basis
only.'    </i>[PX 1163]
<P>

481	At approximately 5.30pm on 15 February 1990 a letter was forwarded by Mr
Booth by facsimile to the Paola Group - addressed to
the Managing Director,
Paola Group of Companies;  reading as follows:
<P>

	<i>`As advised in our telephone conversation with Duncan today all current
accounts operated by the companies of the Paola Group (see
list attached) have
been frozen.  No further drawings are to occur on any of these accounts.</i>
<P>

<i>	The above action was necessary in order for the Bank to "crystallise"
present debt levels in view of the disclosure of 13 February
1990 regarding the
solvency of ABE Holdings Limited.</i>
<P>

<i>	I should add that it has already been necessary to return certain cheques
presented to the Bank on 14 and 15 February 1990 in order
to keep overall
drawings of the Group within the $8.5million limit.</i>
<P>

<i>	Your request that the Bank appoint a receiver to ABE Holdings is presently
being considered.  In the meantime, in order to enable
the Paola Group to
continue to trade, it was recommended to Duncan that new accounts be opened and
this is now being carried out
in accordance with Duncan's faxed request (please
note these accounts are to be operated on a credit basis only).</i>
<P>

<i>	Discussions as to how the Bank will respond to your request (to appoint a
receiver to ABE Holdings Limited) and how the Bank will
fund the Paola Group in
the immediate future will be made following a further meeting with Ferrier
Hodgson &amp; Co which is presently
planned to take place tomorrow.</i>
<P>

<i>	We will contact you as soon as possible after that meeting to relay our
decisions.'</i>
<P>

482	The letter was signed by Mr Booth and was copied to Mr Plante;  the
facsimile to Mr Plante requesting him to relay the letter
to Mr Paola.
<P>

483	The list attached to the letter was headed `Detail of Current Accounts
Frozen as at 15 February 1990' and named the accounts
as those of ABE Jet
Charter;  ABE Holdings (Office);  ABE Holdings (Pastoral);  Currabubula
Holdings;  Piojit;  Northern Rural Services
Tamworth;  Northern Rural Services
Narrabri;  Northern Rural Services Gunnedah;  Northern Rural Services Moree.
<P>

484	A note at the end of the attachment reads:
<P>

	<i>`Note:</i>
<P>

<i>	- Current account for ABE Fax . . . is already frozen</i>
<P>

<i>	- Current account for ABE Travel is in credit funds and is therefore not
included.'</i>
<P>

485	Schedule 1 to the amended summons identifies the detail of cheques said to
have been drawn by Currabubula Holdings and by NRS
on its accounts at Narrabri,
Moree, Tamworth and Gunnedah, all of which are alleged to have been presented
on 15 February 1990.
<P>

486	By letter also dated 15 February 1990, ABE Holdings (Mr Plante) wrote to Mr
Booth in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`Further to our telephone conversation earlier, would you please open the

be required.</i>
<P>

<i>	Could you also direct all branches to charge monthly direct debits to the
new accounts.'</i>
<P>

487	Mr Paola gave evidence that on 15 February 1990 he had a telephone
conversation with Mr Swinburne to the following effect:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Paola:	Jim, Duncan [referring to Duncan Plante] rang me last night
telling me that the bank accounts had been frozen.  What's
it all about?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	Well the bank's taken the action and decided to freeze all
your bank accounts.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	For what reason?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	Because of your disclosure.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	What disclosure.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	That ABE Holdings is insolvent.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	But you knew that Jim.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	Yeah but we hadn't seen it in writing before.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	Jim you realise of course what you have just done to us.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:</i><cite>	Yes we realise it was a grave step to
take</cite><i>.  What are you going to do now Tony?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	Where are we going to bank the money that comes in to pay our
suppliers?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	Look you'd better get someone in to come and see us about
setting up new accounts so you can bank your money so you
can trade and pay
your bills.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	What's wrong with banking them in the old accounts and just using
that limit as a base?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	No you can only bank money into those accounts but you can't
draw on them.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Paola:	Jim we are paying interest, we are below the limit, we've got a
viable business.  From what basis can they come to that
decision.  The bank is
over-secured to hell.  How can you let them make that decision?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Swinburne:	Look Tony, they may have made a  mistake, call in and see
them and set up some new accounts so you can carry on and
we might be able to
get this straightened out.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Statement 31 October 1996, paragraph 51]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

488	Mr Swinburne gave the following evidence in cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	. . . Now I want to suggest to you that you did say those words, "Look,
Tony, they may have made a mistake.  Call in and see them
and set up some new
accounts so that you can carry on . . .'</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't recall saying that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Is it possible you said it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's possible that I was talking in terms of coming into the Bank to
organise the accounts, but not the suggestion that the Bank
has made a
mistake.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It is possible though isn't it, you would have said that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't believe so because at that stage I would have been acting under
advice, including legal advice from the Bank.  So I would
then have been
precluded from making a statement of that nature.</i>
<P>

<i>	His Honour.	Q.	It is not suggested that you said to Mr Paola that they had
made a mistake, just they may have had a mistake do you
follow?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I feel, your Honour, that at that stage having been through a fairly
lengthy and serious internal discussion with the Bank that
had more or less
issued instructions as to what we were to do.  We were at that stage, following
those instructions.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Ryan Q.	It's not possible you would have said it just to temporarily
placate Mr Paola while he set up his Number Two accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't believe so.'     </i>[T 533 and 534]
<P>

489	Mr Swinburne's evidence was that after the meeting of 12 February and after
inspecting the letters of 13 February, he turned
his mind to the question of
whether there had been a default or an event of default on the part of the
customer.  His evidence was
that he formed the view `that notification of
insolvency was a serious event' and that he then sought advice within the Bank
as to
what course of action he should follow.
<P>

490	Mr Swinburne's evidence was that he formed the view that Notice of
Insolvency was an event of default.
<P>

491	Mr Swinburne recalled the letter sent by the Bank on 15 February which
referred, amongst other things, to the freezing of various
accounts and
although he could not recall exactly whose decision it was to send that letter,
he recalled that it was a decision of
a meeting.  He was not able to recall
exactly who was present at the meeting but he believed that at least one of the
Bank's solicitors
was present, he thought this to have been Diane Osborne but
he could not be certain.  He recalled that there were several other persons
at
the meeting and believed that Mr Booth was present.  He could not recall
whether or not Mr Stenhouse was there but recalled that
there were four or
perhaps five persons at that meeting.    [T 531]
<P>

	<b>16 February 1990</b>
<P>

492	The plaintiffs allege that on 16 February 1990 the Bank dishonoured a
number of cheques presented to the Bank on 15 February
1990.
<P>

493	The plaintiffs also allege that cheques presented on 16 February and
thereafter were dishonoured during ensuing months.
<P>

494	From 15 February 1990, the bank statements referred to in paragraph 36,
were sent by the Bank to various group companies including
NRS and Currabubula
with the words `in liq' appearing at the end of the balance column.
<P>

495	Mr Paola gave evidence by statement that bank statements bearing the words
`in liq' were received from about 16 February 1990
and that some were sent by
facsimile and other by ordinary mail.
<P>

496	In relation to the bank statements which were faxed to the general office
at NRS, being where Mr Paola said the bulk of the
statements were sent, his
evidence was that his first knowledge of those statements was on attending the
offices of NRS which he
believed was on 16th February.  At that time Mr Greg
Giblet, the Tamworth agronomist for NRS, brought the receipt of the bank
statements
to Mr Paola's attention and he then physically examined the
statements in the presence of Mr Giblet.  He then had a number of discussions
with particular employees of NRS, namely Mr Giblet and Mr Taylor and with Ms
Thornton and Mr Plante who were employed by the Group
and with other persons
including NRS managers.
<P>

497	His answer, recorded at page 52 of the transcript reads inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`I had a conversation with Mr Giblet.  Mr Giblet's words - Mr Giblet said,
"Anyone can see that you're in - you're in liquidation",
I believe it was.  I
said, "What? How could you say that" and he said "Well, you only have to walk
in there to see what problems
you've got".</i>
<P>

<i>	We walked into the computer - into the fax room and Mr Giblet picked up
</i><cite>a handful of statements.</cite><i>  All of them had the words "in
liq".  I said "This can't be right".  He said "Well its there and all the
companies are in the same
- in the same boat".</i>
<P>

<i>	I said "But we are not in liquidation".  He said, "Well, the Bank doesn't
lie and I would rather believe them than you" and that
was pretty much the
conversation with him.</i>
<P>

<i>	I then had a conversation with Mr Plante, said - I said, "Duncan, do you
know anything about these".  He said, "Yeah, yes, I saw
those" and that was
basically the end of the conversation with him.</i>
<P>

<i>	The conversation with Ross Taylor was, "Ross, I guess you have seen these".
He said, "Yes, I have seen those".  He says, "And like
I told you last night,
we have got problems with the staff because of the - because of the frozen
accounts and cheques" and at that
point, he mentioned something about the
cheques that were bounced, suppliers had been calling him and I said, "Look,
Ross, I will
try and do something about finding out what in the hell is going
on here so please don't - don't panic".  He says, he said words,
"I think you
will find it might be a little bit late now" so I then tried to call the
managers of the various branches.  On the way
towards the phone, I ran across
Janet Thornton . . .'    </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

498	At this stage in his evidence in chief Mr Paola broke down and the Court
adjourned for a short time.
<P>

499	The evidence continued at page 55 inter alia as follows:
<P>

	<i>`On the way to the phone I spoke to Ms Thornton, I said that "Janet, there
is no truth in this.  Don't be concerned about it".  I
then rang the branch
managers of NRS and explained the situation to them, and that's basically what
happened.'</i>
<P>

500	Mr Paola's evidence was that the branch managers of NRS whom he telephoned
were the branch managers of Gunnedah, Narrabri and
Moree and in each case he
spoke to the three individuals who ran those branches and that at that point in
time he did not believe
that they had received copies of bank statements. 
<P>

501	Mr Paola's evidence was that Mr Steve Thornhill was, as at 15 February
1990, the Administration Manager of Tamworth at NRS and
that he resigned on
that day.
<P>

502	Mr Paola had, in his first statement of October 1996, given evidence that
Mr Giblet stated to Mr Paola that he was worried that
Mr Paola would let down
the Agro Services accounts because Mr Giblet had said : "You're in financial
strife", then suggesting that
anyone with brains would know as all one had to
do was walk into the fax room and see.
<P>

503	In his first statement, Mr Paola had given evidence that he then informed
Mr Giblet, after he looked at the bank statements:
 "This is wrong.  None of
these companies are in liquidation".  Mr Giblet responded:  "Yeah, Banks don't
make those sorts of mistakes,
Tony, and I would rather believe them than
you".
<P>

504	In relation to Mr Giblet, his role within NRS had been as agronomist,
operating from the Tamworth Branch to look after the larger
clients of that
branch.  The night before Mr Paola had been referred to the facsimile room by
Mr Giblet, Mr Paola had had a heated
discussion with Mr Giblet following Mr
Paola having learned that Mr Giblet had started making contact with clients in
order to set
himself up in business with accounts which belonged to NRS.  This
was reported to Mr Ross Taylor.
<P>

505	In his first statement, Mr Paola had said that on about 16 February he
spoke with Mr Plante, who said to him words to the effect:
 "I've been through
a liquidation before, Tony.  I don't want to go through another one.  I am
resigning" and that Mr Plante in fact
resigned from the company on about 27
February 1990.  In giving evidence in chief, Mr Paola placed his conversation
with Mr Plante
as occurring after he had spoken with Mr Giblet.  At transcript
page 52, Mr Paola recalled his conversation with Mr Plante as one
in which he
had said "Duncan do you know anything about these" and Mr Plante had said
"Yeah, yes, I saw those" and that was basically
the end of the conversation
with Mr Plante.
<P>

506	In giving evidence in chief, Mr Paola also set out a conversation which he
recalled having with Mr Ross Taylor.  In his statement,
he had said that he had
had conversations with other members of NRS including Mr Taylor to the effect
that the statements of `in
liq' on the bank statements were incorrect and that
the companies were not in fact in liquidation.
<P>

507	Mr Paola's evidence was that on or about 16 February, after learning that
the Bank had summoned cheques, he instructed Ross
Taylor, Duncan Plante and he
believed Dave Stefferson, to identify the cheques and to call the people
concerned to let them know
that the cheques had been bounced by the Bank and
that we would be doing something about replacing those.
<P>

508	In cross-examination in relation to the freezing letter, Mr Paola accepted
that there was no written correspondence with the
Bank involving an assertion
on behalf of his Group that the Bank was wrong in the view it took that the
facility was duly drawn and
somewhat over the limit at the time the cheques
were dishonoured.  [T 139]
<P>

509	Mr Paola was then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And if the accounts were overdrawn you would accept that your company
wasn't entitled to draw any more on the account?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If the accounts were overdrawn the bank was entitled to withhold payment
on cheques, which would take the account over the limit,
yes.  They were
entitled to do that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood by this letter that the Bank was saying that if you
had any further funds coming in they could be put in fresh
accounts and they
could be drawn against?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I understand that all debtors' payments coming in from that day
were to be banked in different accounts, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood that they could be drawn against?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, with credit funds it's not a matter of understanding, we could
have banked those anywhere.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And there wasn't any particular problem you saw in that procedure that
was proposed by the Bank, was there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There was no problem with that procedure no.'  </i> [T139 - 140]
<P>

510	In giving evidence in chief, Mr Paola said that he personally spoke to a
number of suppliers.  As to Australian Wire Industries,
he said in evidence in
chief that the conversation took place within the days following the 16th
February and that he had asked why
the company was not supplying NRS and that
the person he spoke to who was responsible for supplying north west New South
Wales dealers
said:  "We've closed your account.  However you can buy on COD if
you wish".
<P>

511	Under cross-examination at transcript page 149 Mr Paola accepted that in
reality the conversation with Australian Wire Industries
took place
approximately two months later.
<P>

512	In giving evidence in chief, Mr Paola at transcript page 59, said that he
had spoken with Australian Fertilisers Limited within
days of the 16th
February.  However, at transcript page 146 he conceded that he had been
thinking in terms of 20, 21 or 30 days in
short, less than a month.  He
conceded that he could have been talking of approximately early March rather
than within days of 16
February.  [T 147]
<P>

513	In chief, Mr Paola gave evidence that he spoke to someone from Bettington
Commodities about supply to NRS and that he did so
`within days of 15
February'.  He recalled speaking to Mr David Bettington who said to him "Tony
we have had to close your account
because one of your cheques bounced.  We are
only a small company.  Is there any likelihood that we are going to get paid"
and that
Mr Paola had responded "David just leave it with me.  We have a
question and we are straightening it out".  His evidence in chief
was that this
account was never reopened and that Bettington Commodities had insisted on cash
from that point on.
<P>

514	Under cross-examination at transcript 148.26, Mr Paola conceded that the
conversation with Bettington Commodities was not within
days of 15 February but
embraced a period that could have extended up until 20 March.  Mr Paola said
that this conversation happened
on 20 March.
<P>

	<b>16 February 1990</b>
<P>

515	By letter dated 16 February 1990, Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co as receiver and
managers of ABE Fax forwarded to the State Bank a
cheque for $50,000 being in
further reduction of the debt owed to the Bank by ABE Fax.  [PX 1170]
<P>

	<b>19 February 1990</b>
<P>

516	On 19 February 1990, Mr Booth and Mr Swinburne signed a memorandum
addressed to the Manager, CFG Loans Administration and to
managers of Macquarie
Centre and Tamworth, confirming that all current accounts with overdrawn
balances had been placed in reduction
the previous week and that to enable the
Group to continue to trade, new accounts had been opened, in each case
identifying the old
account and the new account and asking branches to provide
full set-off between the old and new account numbers.  [PX 1171]

	<b>26 February 1990</b>

517	By letter dated 26 February 1990, Russell McVeagh McKenzie and Bartleet
&amp; Co., Barristers and Solicitors wrote to Mr Paola
as Managing Director of
ABE Telecommunications, giving advice on various legal issues which would arise
should he increase his shareholding
in U-Bix Business Machines Limited.
[Exhibit PX 1176]
<P>

	<b>27 February 1990</b>
<P>

518	On 27 February 1990, Mr Duncan Plante resigned as secretary of inter alia,
Paola Holdings and NRS.
<P>

	<b>March 1990</b>
<P>

519	Mr Paola at transcript 58 accepted that on 8 March 1990, the Group decided
to close the merchandising division of NRS in Moree.
 The reason was that there
was a requirement to reduce the cash that was being utilised throughout the
Group and that this was one
of the divisions that was not operating at an
acceptable level of profit and it was a cash drain on the business.  [T 58]
<P>

520	At transcript page 60, Mr Paola gave evidence that in February 1990 his
strategy as Managing Director in order to achieve the
reduction of the total of
the facility to $7.5 million by the end of May 1990 was:
<P>

	<i>`To reduce the stock and debtors, primarily to reduce the stock and debtors
of Northern Rural Services and Currabubula who had a substantial
livestock.
That was step number one as we saw that as being the easiest component to
achieve.  The second step was to refinance on
lease-back the premises that
Northern Rural Services occupied, and the third step of course was property
sales which we had already
put on foot.  But a combination of those we felt
would easily achieve that objective.' </i> [T 60-61]
<P>

521	Mr Paola's evidence as to his impressions when he first looked at the `in
liq' statements was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`. . . I looked at the statement.  On the statement there is an index of
abbreviations.  This abbreviation did not appear on the statement
so I wasn't
sure what it meant.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You are familiar with the expression "liquidator (the transcript should
read `liquidated') debt" aren't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm familiar with that expression yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And are you familiar with the expression "liquidator (again the
transcript should read `liquidated') company"?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Of course.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you know the word `liquidate' can be used with reference to a number
of different things?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I do . . . of course.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	When you looked at this statement you didn't think that the words "in
liquidation" were used, or "in liq" were used, with reference
to the company as
distinct from the debt, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	At the time I looked at the statement I looked at the abbreviation.  It
didn't appear on there, I didn't know what to think. 
I have never seen "in
liq" on a statement ever before.  I really had no idea at that point.  The man
caught me off guard.  I was
just stunned.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You did say to those to whom you spoke about these statements that the
company was not, in fact, in liquidation, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh this is right after the . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you say that or not?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I did yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you said that the statements . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Are wrong.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Were wrong?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I said that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And what you were saying that with reference to was any suggestion that
the company was in liquidation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, yeah, on thinking about it I thought "how can that possibly
happen", because there is no notices, there was nothing.  It
couldn't possibly
be that we were in liquidation.  But I'm not talking to business people, you
must appreciate that, we're looking
at the statement.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well Mr Giblet is a business person isn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Mr Giblet was an agronomist, a young man.  I don't know of any business
that Mr Giblet ever ran . . .'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 144-146]
<P>

522	Mrs Janet Hamblin gave evidence that in the first quarter of 1989, she
worked at Currabubula Station doing farm secretarial
work but that when Mr
Paola had had the Tamworth Northern Rural Service business working, to the best
of her recollection, in mid
to the second half of 1989, she came to work in the
Tamworth office and she was there every day.  Her work in the Tamworth office
was maintaining the books for Currabubula Holdings and she also looked after
ABE Finance and assisted Mr Plante, who was at the time
financial controller
for all of Mr Paola's other businesses.  Her work in relation to NRS involved
folding statements once a month,
answering the telephone on occasions and
serving out in the shop on occasions.  Mr Taylor, who was the General Manager
of NRS did
not have a secretary and she did a lot of secretarial work in the
sense of typing and related activities.  Her qualifications before
she
commenced the job included an Associate Diploma of Rural Business
Administration and she had undertaken a financial accounting
course at the
local technical college and other secretarial courses.
<P>

523	Her evidence was that in the period up to February 1990, the mood in the
office in which she worked was very positive.  Her
evidence included:
<P>

	<i>`It was very positive . . . I was working from the offices of Northern
Rural Services.  They were a new business.  Tamworth was at
that stage and
still is growing a bit, but new businesses were always good to have in the
town.  Prices were competitive.  People
were coming to the shop.  It was a very
positive happy, yes, happy place.  Everybody was very friendly and got on well
and enjoyed
themselves . . . we had a lot of people coming in and out.  That
was the start during one of the many droughts that we had so there
was a lot of
work supplying or selling stock feed to farmers and then the associated
paperwork with that.'      </i>[T 287]
<P>

524	Ms Hamblin recalled receipt in the office of bank statements bearing the
words or notation `in liq' and to the best of her recollection
such receipt
occurred in the early part of 1990.  She said that they came into the centre
part of the office and arrived in the only
facsimile machine in the office
which was in the centre of the office.  That was an area where, because a lot
of faxes were received,
namely orders, and a lot of the NRS's outside orders
were sent, all the paperwork went to.  Her evidence included:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	When they arrived and I am talking about the bank statements, did you
see Mr Taylor looking at the statements?</i>
<P>

<i>	A..	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you see whether Mr Taylor did anything with those statements?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	They were always to be left there.  He did look at them as did Steve
Thornhill and Natalie Sykes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you see Mr Taylor speaking to any members of staff while he was
holding the statements?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not long - just after Mr Thornhill and he went into his office and he
shut his door and that was something he never did unless
he wanted a private
conversation.</i>
<P>

<i>	. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You recall the statements coming in on this fax machine and this
conversation did you say between Mr Taylor and Mr Thornhill taking
place, but
you didn't hear what they said to each other?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I didn't hear what they said no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And they actually first spoke and then went into the room?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	As I tried to recall, they didn't both go there at the same time, so as
soon as Mr Taylor had seen it he went back to his office.
 Mr Thornhill then
followed him and they closed the door.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Mrs Hamblin, after the statements were received did you have a telephone
conversation or conversations with creditors of the business
about the position
of the Paola companies?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you remember when that conversation or conversations
occurred?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was only a day or two after the statements came because the cheques
started being dishonoured almost immediately and then obviously
any creditors
that we had paid when the cheques were dishonoured they started ringing.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you remember the names of any creditors or officers of creditors who
were ringing you up?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not precisely.  There were obviously fertiliser, one of the fertiliser
companies.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Was there more than one creditor?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you remember how many.  Could you tell his Honour . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	there would have been at least - we had creditors - we had a lot of
creditors obviously for the amount of stock that was in Northern
Rural
Services.  There would have been at least 10 or 12.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you remember any particular conversation or can you give his Honour
the substance of what was said in these conversations?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The substance - sorry - 10 years ago, I am sorry.  My memory is that not
- it is failing.  The substance of it was wanting to
know why the cheques had
been dishonoured and then wanting or demanding cash on delivery if they were to
provide any further goods.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Mrs Hamblin, following receipt of the bank statements in these
conversations did the mood or operation of the business change?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Could you tell his Honour in what way and what your observations about
how it changed?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It went from being very positive because there was a new business in
town and there was employment for a lot of people, </i><cite>to one of almost
dismay because there were going to be - automatically people started wondering
or worrying about their jobs . . .
They were worrying about the loss of their
jobs.  They were also worried about their name within the industry.  People
like Ross
Taylor was held in high esteem as was Steve Thornhill and they
worried about what impact that would have on their name in the town
and their
chance of future employment.'</cite><i>     </i>[T289]  [emphasis added]
<P>

525	Ms Hamblin was asked whether after the events she had given evidence of,
the conversation with creditors and the receipts of
the statements, she had
spoken to other business persons in Tamworth about Mr Paola's business.  She
said at transcript 290 that
within one or two weeks after the receipt of the
bank statements, she spoke to three or four companies including Tamworth
Cooperative,
Fielders Farm Centre.  The Cooperative was in direct competition
with NRS.  Doing the best she could to recall the substance of what
was said to
her, she said:
<P>

	<i>`A.	They were interested to see that Northern Rural Services were going to,
they would say go bust and it </i><cite>was just a general conversation about
it going bust </cite><i>and Tony's or the Company's lack of ability to pay its
bill.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the conversation that you say you think you had with someone from
Fielders, can you give us that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Along the general same lines.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the person from the Farmers Centre . . . that is Fielders.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes Fielders Farmer Centre.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you recollect whether you had other conversations about Mr Paola's
business with other people other than those you have told
his Honour
about?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you recollect the names of those people?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  There was one with a neighbour who also is a farmer, Mr Ernie
Ranclaud.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you recollect what Mr Ranclaud said to you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	He was another neighbour of Tony's and </i><cite>his words were along
the lines of Tony Paola has gone bust</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And can you recollect the names of any other persons you spoke to about
Mr Paola and his business in that period?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There were others but not offhand no.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	After February 1990 did you observe whether activity in the office was
as busy as it was in the early part of 1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.  It certainly wasn't.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you tell his Honour what you observed about the level of business
going on in the office?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It had diminished because the products had diminished.  We had no
ability, our cash flow was greatly reduced.  We had no ability
to supply or to
have the supplies necessary for farmers . . .'  </i>[emphasis added]
<P>

526	Ms Hamblin accepted under cross-examination that she was not involved in
the day to day operations of the Paola Group of Companies.
 She said that she
certainly did not remember learning of any decision being made within the Paola
Group that creditors of NRS not
be paid and she could not recall a stage which
Mr Taylor became very upset and complained of being told not to pay creditors.
Mr
Taylor had not confided to her about business matters relating to NRS.  She
did not recall that at the beginning of 1990 and in particular
in January, very
difficult trading conditions were experienced by NRS.  She denied that the
events concerning the creditors speaking
to other persons that she had
mentioned could have occurred in January 1990.  When asked why, she had said
that it could not have
occurred in January 1990 with such definiteness, her
answer was `Because the phones - I would have had no need to answer those phone
calls prior to when it was so busy that everybody was answering phone calls and
that happened<u> after the bank statements arrived'</u>.  [T 294]  [Emphasis
added]
<P>

527	Ms Hamblin accepted in cross-examination that the conversations she had
described about creditors being anxious about their
debts would be the sort of
conversations that she would expect to occur if creditors had been told that
their debts were either not
going to be paid or going to be delayed in payment.
[T295]
<P>

528	On being shown the bank statements, she was asked whether she had ever
heard of the expression in relation to a debt, of liquidating
a debt and
answered in the negative.  She had not heard of that expression back in 1990
and she was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	So what did you make of the form of statement when you first saw
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>That the company was in liquidation</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It didn't say that in relation to the company did it, the company's name
. . . the words in liq . . . didn't appear next to the
company's name did
they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I wasn't aware that they had to.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You were confused when you saw the statement;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>No, no.  Automatically I saw that statement it said ABE
Holdings was in liquidation</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well did a statement that the companies were in liquidation
</i><cite>seem very confusing to you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because you knew the companies weren't in liquidation didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I suppose you asked either Mr Plante or Mr Taylor did you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Mr Plante.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You asked Mr Plante and he said that the companies weren't in
liquidation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>He appeared as confused as I.</cite>
<P>

<i>	Q.	He told you that the companies weren't in liquidation didn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'  </i>[emphasis added]
<P>

529	Later in her cross-examination Mrs Hamblin was asked the following
question:
<P>

	<i>`And you don't know whether the trouble started in January, February or
March?'</i>
<P>

530	Her answer was effectively that she counted the trouble starting as when
the bank statements came out with the words `in liq'
on them and people started
looking elsewhere for employment.
<P>

531	She recalled creditors talking to her on the telephone about dishonoured
cheques and not about bank statements because as she
recalled it, they would
not have been aware of the bank statements.  [T 298]
<P>

532	At transcript 299 the following evidence was given by Ms Hamblin:
<P>

	<i>`His Honour Q:	    . . . The question is this, you used the words "the
trouble".  At any time before, as you best recollect it, these
bank statements
were arriving with the words "in liq" did you observe any difficulties with the
NRS business insofar as you were
involved in answering telephones or otherwise
having a somewhat, I understand, limited involvement including sometimes being
in the
shop . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.'</i>
<P>

533	On 16 February 1990, ABE Holdings (Mr Plante) wrote to the State Bank
referring to an earlier discussion of the same day, identifying
a number of
cheques which had been drawn on accounts which the bank had frozen and asking
the Bank to pay them from the new number
two accounts.  The accounts in
question were in the names of Piojit and NRS.  [PX 1169]  The letter also asked
the Bank to note that
the Northern Rural Services cheques were drawn on the
Moree Branch.
<P>

534	As earlier pointed out, on or about 16 February 1990 Mr Plante said to Mr
Paola words to the effect:
<P>

	<i>"I've been through a liquidation before.  I don't want to go through
another one.  I am resigning."</i>
<P>

535	Approximately eleven days later, on 27 February 1998 Mr Plante resigned.
<P>

	<b>March 1990</b>

536	On 2 March 1990, Paola Holdings (Mr Paola) wrote to Mr Booth asking that
the Bank convert the frozen bank accounts `to the new
lower interest facility'
- this was a reference to the term facility.  [PX 1199]
<P>

537	On 5 March 1990, ABE Holdings wrote to the Bank pointing out that the Bank
had in certain instances, ignored the fact that a
set-off should be allowed on
credit funds in the number two account.  The earlier letter from Paola Holdings
to the Bank of 2 March
1990 had awaited confirmation that credit balances in
new accounts would be off-set against old accounts before interest was
calculated.
<P>

538	By letter dated 6 March 1990 from the Bank to the Paola Group, the Bank
confirmed the set-off arrangements having been arranged
between the old and new
current accounts of each of the companies for whom new current accounts were
opened.  [PX 1203]
<P>

539	From time to time, amounts were deposited inadvertently into old accounts
and the Bank arranged to transfer those deposits to
the new number two account.
An example of this occurred in early March 1990 in relation to an amount of
$178,634 deposited to the
account of Currabubula Holdings and by arrangement
with the Bank, transferred to Currabubula Holdings number two account.  [PX

	<b>7 March 1990 - Part Facility converted to Term Loan $7 million</b>
<P>

540	On 7 March 1990, the facilities were converted to a term loan of $7
million, - the draw down being effected on that date.  [PX
1208] $1.5million of
the Multi Option Facility was distributed amongst the current accounts operated
by the Group.  [PX 1217]
<P>

541	The term loan draw-down was for a term of 180 days to 3 September 1990 as
confirmed in the letter from the Bank to the Paola
Group of 7 March 1990.  [PX

	<b>8 March 1990</b>
<P>

542	A memorandum from Mr Booth to managers of the Bank's branches at Moree,
Narrabri, Gunnedah, Tamworth and Macquarie Centre of
8 March 1990, confirms
that in accordance with the approval of 13 December 1989, there was at that
time $1.5 million `of the Multi-Option
Facility' to be distributed amongst the
current accounts operated by the Group.  The memorandum identifies the new
overdraft limits
totalling $1.5 million by account and company detail.
<P>

	<b>9 March 1990</b>
<P>

543	By letter dated 9 March 1990, Mr Plante wrote to the Bank confirming that
there were still some deposits being credited directly
to the frozen bank
accounts and asking the Bank to arrange for all such deposits to be immediately
transferred to the new Number
Two account as they were received.  In
particular, a deposit of about $50,000 was indicated as expected to be lodged
in the Currabubula
account on 19 March and a request was made that the deposit
be transferred to the relevant Number Two account.  [PX 1218]
<P>

	<b>29 March 1990</b>
<P>

544	A letter dated 29 March 1990 from the Bank to the Paola Group, was admitted
into evidence as PX 1239.  A handwritten note across
the top of the page reads
`not sent'.  Whether the letter was ultimately sent or not it is signed by Mr
Booth and by Mr Swinburne.
 It refers to the various discussions in February
concerning the Group's request that the Bank appoint a receiver for ABE
Holdings.
 The Bank indicated that in answer to the request it was not prepared
to comply at that time and listed the reasons why this had
been the case.  In
giving the reasons, the letter states inter alia as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Firstly, because of the interlocking nature of our security and of the
significant inter-company commitments that were evident in
the accounts of ABE
Holdings the appointment of a receiver to ABE Holdings at that time would, we
believe, have made it necessary
for the bank to place all group borrowing
companies and group companies providing security to the bank in receivership
also.</i>
<P>

<i>	Further to this, some concern had been expressed by the bank's solicitors
that our placing ABE Holdings only in receivership could
have left both the
bank and yourself open to charges of deliberately acting to thwart the claims
of other creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	Finally, whilst it was agreed the company (and the group as a whole) was
experiencing liquidity difficulties it was our understanding
that asset sales
planned for the ensuing months would comfortably repay the bank and all known
creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	Unfortunately being formally notified that ABE Holdings was `insolvent' did
necessitate the bank having to take action in the form
of placing all overdrawn
current accounts operated by group companies in reduction.  This had to be done
without warning or delay.
 We nevertheless regret having to have taken this
action.  </i><cite>We are of course well aware of the inconvenience this must
have caused</cite><i>.'  </i>  [Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>4 April 1990</b>
<P>

545	By letter dated 4 April 1990, Mr Plante wrote to Mr Booth confirming that
although the Group had still not received a formal
response to its letter of 13
February, Mr Booth had advised verbally that the Bank was not prepared to
appoint a receiver to ABE
Holdings Limited.  Mr Plante confirmed that the
directors of ABE Holdings Limited believed that the company should be placed
into
voluntary liquidation and advised that the directors intended selling most
of the assets of ABE Holdings at a total price at least
equal to market value
to Currabubula Holdings. [PX 1244]
<P>

546	On 4 April 1990, the auction which was to have taken place on that day of
Durhambone was postponed to 25 May.
<P>

	<b>11 April 1990</b>
<P>

547	On 11  April 1990 the Bank, having received a further request for advice as
to whether it had an objection to the appointment
of a liquidator to ABE
Holdings, responded by advising that under existing interlocking security, ABE
Holdings Limited would remain
liable inter alia for any debts of Currabubula
Holdings to the Bank as well as for group debts to the Bank.  The Bank advised
that
proceeds of sale of any assets which might have remained in ABE Holdings
would be applied in reduction of group liabilities and generally
stated that
decisions, the subject of communications, were a matter for the companies'
directors.
<P>

548	An office minute position paper dated 20 April 1990 signed by Mr Booth on 3
May 1990, deals with a meeting held with Tony Paola
and Peter Terrey on 1 May
1990 (probably a mistake for 1 April 1990), to learn of developments within the
Group over the past two
months.  The document dealing with the sale of
`Durhambone' states that due to recent heavy rains in the area, the planned
action
of Durhambone has been delayed one month to 27 May 1990.
<P>

549	Mr Booth recalled many conversations with Mr Paola from May to September
about the sale of Durhambone and accepted as correct
the proposition that the
Bank insisted that Durhambone be sold as soon as possible.  [T 507]  He thought
that `the bank began writing
round as early as May 1990'.  [T 507]
<P>

550	The position paper at PX 1283 stated inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Should the sale of Durhambone not occur, the Paola Group's liquidity
problems are set to worsen. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	In subsequent discussions with Mr Paola the following
</i><cite>directives</cite><i> have been given:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	The Bank is not prepared to provide any additional funding and all
present loan facilities are to remain in reduction.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	All other current accounts are to continue to be operated on a strict
credit basis.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	The sale of Durhambone should be pursued as a matter of urgency.'
</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

551	Mr Booth accepted at transcript 507, that he had given a `directive' to Mr
Paola in respect of the sale of Durhambone and had
used that word in his own
note summarising the requirement.
<P>

552	The position paper concludes with the words `In the meantime it is
recommended the account be reclassified RR50 (the Group is
presently rated
RR40).  A further report on the status of the account will be prepared at the
end of the month recommending appropriate
action'.
<P>

553	Mr Booth was shown in cross-examination a banking manual/document extract
dealing with risk rating system issued in July 1992.
 He accepted that
generally there was a system within the Bank by May 1990 of a formal risk
rating for clients' accounts and that
his risk rating recommendation was made
on the basis of a document similar to the July 1992 document.  The July 1992
document at
page 100 stated inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`The risk rating is with regard to:</i>
<P>

<i>	.	Facility conduct</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The strength of the repayment source and capacity to service.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The financial standing of the client.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The security position.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The client management strength.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Exhibit P21]
<P>

554	The same document identified there being eight categories in the Bank risk
rating system described as:
<P>

	<i>`RR10	Highest quality</i>
<P>

<i>	RR20	Strong</i>
<P>

<i>	RR30	Satisfactory</i>
<P>

<i>	RR40	Watch list</i>
<P>

<i>	RR50	Deteriorating</i>
<P>

<i>	RR60	Substandard </i>
<P>

<i>	RR62 	Non-accrual,</i>
<P>

<i>		substandard</i>
<P>

<i>	RR70	Doubtful </i>
<P>

<i>	RR72 	Non-accrual,</i>
<P>

<i>		doubtful</i>
<P>

<i>	RR80	Loss</i>
<P>

<i>	RR82	Non-accrual, lost provision.'</i>
<P>

555	The same document at page 209 gave the policy in relation to risk rating
responsibility as `you are responsible for insuring
risk ratings are kept
current in relation to all accounts under your control'.
<P>

556	Under the heading `RR40 - Watch list rating' the following inter alia,
appears:
<P>

	<i>`An account will be transferred to the Watchlist rating under a number of
different circumstances.  Often it is an emerging problem
which requires
investigation with the expectation that the problem will be resolved and moved
off the list.  It will usually be a
potential problem which requires above
normal monitoring.  The account is unlikely to be on the watch list for more
than 90 days.
 Its rating would be reclassified if this were the case . .
.'</i>
<P>

557	Under the heading `RR50 - Deteriorating - Possible Problem Loan' the
following inter alia, appears:
<P>

	<i>`Deteriorating accounts result when Watchlist loans do not improve.  These
accounts have breached facility requirements, or the strength
of cash flow has
weakened such that the ability to service is likely to be impaired.</i>
<P>

<i>	Often the potential problems which caused the RR40 classification have
worsened and jeopardised the Bank's prospects for repayment.
 The Bank however,
is not looking to exercise its security nor does it expect a loss to occur.
RR50 accounts require remedial action.</i>
<P>

558	It was put to Mr Booth that notwithstanding everything he had been told on
12 February 1990, notwithstanding the Ferrier Hodgson
and the ABE Holdings
letters, at least until May 1990 the beginning of it, he was content that the
account remain or be classified
RR40 Watchlist.  This was the case according to
his note on 3 May.  [T 508]
<P>

559	The transcript then includes:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You recommended the account be reclassified RR50 deteriorating?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What I'm saying to you is notwithstanding all those matters I raised
with you but a moment ago you were content until 3 May not
to recommend a
reclassification for a worse rating than RR40?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That wouldn't necessarily be true, no.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>However Mr Booth did accept that he took no steps to seek a
reclassification from RR40 until 3 May 1990.  [T 509] 
<P>

560	In cross-examination Mr Booth's attention was drawn to the section in the
document under the heading `RR40' which envisaged
the transfer to the Watchlist
when there was an emerging problem which required investigation with the
expectation that the problem
would be resolved and moved off the list.  It
would usually be a potential problem requiring above normal monitoring.  Mr
Booth was
then asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Now won't you agree with me that that is to be distinguished from the
RR50 rating which is described two pages further on, do
you see that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes. . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well you knew there was a system in the Bank for risk rating at least in
1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You knew it was your duty to apply it as carefully and properly as you
could?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Would you agree with me that at least until 3 May you recommended a risk
rating for this account which contemplated there would
be no loss at all of the
Bank's principal and interest?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I'm very concerned about making judgments on this particular risk
rating.  I noticed that in my submissions of December '89 referred
to a
different risk rate;  the LQ2 and 3 still applied in those times.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the Watchlist we looked at?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was, was it.  I'm trying to remember.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Both?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The Watchlist was a written note below . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	What I'm getting at is I'm still not sure how that 40 was first arrived
at and that would help me answer this question . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can I ask you to go back to volume 2 to page 729 -</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yeah, this 729 refers to W1, W3, we're now talking risk rating systems.
I think - I can't prove it - but I think the risk rating
system was new at that
time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well you think the watch list system may have continued to some time in
1990 when the new risk rating system was introduced?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I suspect so.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Now of course when a new system was introduced I suppose which required
classification of accounts, somebody - and I suggest it
was you - had to work
out which new appellation should apply to the risk rating?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'</i>  [T511]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>4 May 1990</b>
<P>

561	On 4 May 1990, Mr Owens forwarded a memorandum to Mr Swinburne attaching a
number of papers and details and referring to `our
strategy to encourage Mr
Paola to sell assets and pay out his creditors and reduce his debt'.  Mr Owens
said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`To be realistic, there are only three things that can happen as far as I
can tell.</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Mr Paola succeeds in putting off his creditors for long enough to sell
assets (other than those securing our debts, of course).
 His arrangements with
them might be expected to involve his giving specific charges until sales can
be arranged.  </i><cite>We should expect that he would `take a bath' on these
sales</cite><i>, but in my opinion he should pursue them as a matter of extreme
urgency.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Mr Paola's creditors force him into bankruptcy and his group into
liquidation.  This would be a disaster for him;  much of what
he has worked to
build would be lost, with asset values being what they are at present.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	We agree to provide additional funds (i.e. a `rescue' package) ($3.5
million? bringing our total debt to $12 million?)  Most of
additional security
to be put up would be broadacres - which would give us little extra comfort in
today's market (a `dog' of a deal,
in my view).</i>
<P>

<i>	It goes without saying that we would have to virtually control the group's
financial function:  very expensive.</i>
<P>

<i>	We have commenced an interim strategy to:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	</i><cite>Have all debt accounts work in reduction</cite><i> (No "2"
accounts to work strictly in credit - we returned a cheque `</i><cite>present
again'</cite><i> on my instructions during your absence and, presumably, Paola
is now in no doubt what we mean).</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Get details of all his unencumbered assets plus his full
asset/liability/income/expenses position so that we can work with him
in
selling assets (clearing debts).</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	A letter is to be sent to him on Monday to leave him in no doubt as to
how serious we regard his position and the urgency of action
needed to sell
assets.  We shall also include an </i><cite>instruction</cite><i> to him that
`Durhambone' must be sold within two months (he simply has to meet the market).
Allan has drafted the appropriate letter.
. . .'    </i>[PX 1289]  [emphasis
added]
<P>

562	The same document signed by Mr Owens at PX 1291 includes detail of Mr Owens
having been requested by Mr Paola during Mr Booth's
absence, to provide the
Bank's written acknowledgment that it would raise no objection to the
appointment of a voluntary liquidator
to ABE Holdings Limited.  Mr Owens'
comments are that he could find no valid reason for the Bank to object but did
not and still
does not believe that customers understand fully the
ramifications of such proposed actions.  According to Mr Owens' note in
response
to his questions, Mr Paola stated:
<P>

	1.	That he would pay out all unsecured creditors of ABE Holdings.
<P>

	2.	That all assets of ABE Holdings would be transferred to Currabubula
Holdings as with the Bank's debt.
<P>

	3.	That as a result of 1 and 2 the liquidation of ABE Holdings would become a
procedural matter only.
<P>

563	Mr Owens notes that Mr Booth has informed him that Mr Paola does not have
the cash to pay out these creditors.  Mr Owens notes
that he is not sure
exactly what Mr Paola plans to do about them but is sure that Mr Paola intends
to pay them eventually.  Mr Owens
adds:
<P>

	<i>`How can we allow the transfer of our debt and the assets of the holding
company to another group company in what we now know beyond
reasonable doubt to
be a deliberate manoeuvre to defeat the legitimate claims of unsecured
creditors?  If he insists upon proceeding,
would not the bank have no option
other than to place all or most group companies into liquidation and/or
receivership to protect
its own position from potential litigation initiated by
unsecured creditors?  I'm sure it won't come to that but, unless I have
completely
misunderstood the situation, voluntary liquidation of ABE Holdings
Limited is no answer at all.'  </i>[PX 1291]
<P>

564	It appears that heavy rains in the area delayed the planned auction of
Durhambone from 3 May 1990 by one month to 27 May 1990.
<P>

565	Mr Booth of the Bank wrote to the Paola Group on 4 May 1990 to confirm the
Bank's position in regard to a number of matters
raised in discussions over the
past weeks.  The letter stated inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`The Bank is also viewing with concern the general cash position of the
group and that no significant steps have as yet been taken
to reduce borrowing
levels.  Terms and conditions of the existing approval require a reduction in
overall bank debt to $7.5 million
by end May 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>All borrowing facilities are to continue in reduction at least
until this level of debt is achieved</cite><i> and all other current accounts
are to continue to operate on a strict credit basis.  Cheques presented on
these accounts will only
be honoured if sufficient `cleared' funds are held
within the accounts on which they are presented.</i>
<P>

<i>	According to cash flow projections provided by you it appears that subject
to any significant immediate asset sales a reduction of
bank debt can only be
achieved in the short term if other arrangements are made with Okura and all
vendor finance creditors, payments
to whom are programmed to occur over the
next month . . .  With regard to the sale of Durhambone the auction for which
has been delayed
until 25 May 1990, whilst the need for delay due to poor
seasonal conditions is accepted, the sale of the property, at the earliest
possible convenience, is strongly urged.  The bank expects to receive news of a
completed sale by end June 1990</i><cite>.  All proceeds of this sale will of
course be required in permanent reduction of bank debt</cite><i> . . .'
</i>[PX 1305 and 1306]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

566	Paola Holdings wrote to the Bank on 7 May 1990 stating inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`I understand that the State Bank is committed in its resolve that the
Paola Group facility be reduced to $7.5 million at the end
of this
month.</i>
<P>

<i>	Bearing in mind the Bank's stance, positive action has been taken to effect
asset sales, indicated by yourself as being the Bank's
preference.  Asset sales
currently being proposed are:</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of NRS building Narrabri</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of NRS Narrabri</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of NRS building Tamworth</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of NRS Tamworth</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of NRS Gunnedah</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of Durhambone property</i>
<P>

<i>	Sale of Elimatta property'</i>
<P>

567	In relation to Durhambone, the Group advised inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`The auction for Durhambone is not set down for 25 May.  As indicated to
you last week, it is not expected that the property will
sell.  However, it is
our commitment that this property be sold as soon as possible, ensuring that a
realistic price is attained,
avoiding at all costs a "fire sale".  To this end
</i><cite>confidence in the group's overall financial position will need to be
restored in the market place, particularly the country areas</cite><i>.'
</i>[PX 1308] [Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>9 May 1990</b>
<P>

568	On 9 May 1990, the Bank wrote to Paola Holdings reiterating previous
advices `that the undertaking given to the Bank to the
effect that Durhambone
was to be sold with total proceeds reducing the Bank's debts by 30 April 1990
has not been complied with.
 The market price must be met'.  [PX 1311]
<P>

	<b>23 May 1990</b>
<P>

569	On 23 May 1990, Mr Paola wrote to the Bank to express the Group's concern
at developments that had taken place over recent weeks
and outlining events
between May 1 and May 22.  The letter inter alia stated that the Group believed
that the Bank's stance was totally
unreasonable given that no claim had been
made that the Group was in default of its obligations and that it had been a
client of
the Bank for a number of years.  [PX 1320]
<P>

	<b>May/June 1990 - Sale of Portion of NRS businesses</b>
<P>

570	In May/June 1990, the Gunnedah, Narrabri and Tamworth businesses of NRS
were sold and sale proceeds were $691,000.00.
<P>

	<b>July 1990 - Sale of Durhambone East</b>
<P>

571	In mid-1990, Durhambone East was sold and although marketed at the same
time, Durhambone West failed to sell.  Durhambone West
ultimately sold in June
1994 to the same purchasers who had purchased Durhambone East.  Durhambone East
with `Oreel', `Belarra' and
`Braeside' were sold.  Detail at PX 1404 is given
as:
<P>

	Land	$3,550,000

572	 Durhambone West sold for $1,304,000.  Details are also furnished in Mr
Spackman's several reports.
<P>

	<b>August 1990</b>
<P>

573	Leman Enterprises was incorporated in New Zealand for the purposes of
acquiring the shareholding in U-Bix.
<P>

574	On 17 August 1990, Mr Booth and Mr Terrey met to discuss the distribution
of the proceeds of Durhambone East.  A request was
made that a part of the sale
proceeds of Durhambone East be released for `working capital requirements of
$1.205 million'.  That
request appears as part of a document at PX 1507.  The
analysis of working capital requirements the subject of the request, includes
an entry `Down payment - U-Bix shares, $390,000'.
<P>

575	Mr Booth's summary of the 17 August meeting comprises the August 1990
section of a note entitled `Recent Events' dated 31 August
1990.  The note
reads inter alia:
<P>

	<cite>`Recent Events</cite>
<P>

<i>	November 1989 - Appointment of receivers to ABE Fax Pty Limited by the Bank
at the request of Mr. Paola.  As at 27.8.90 Bank debt
outstanding in ABE Fax
consisted of an overdrawn account balance $266,425.00.  According to the
receivers (Ferrier Hodgson) there
is insufficient realisable assets in ABE Fax
to meet this commitment.  We will therefore be relying on the other entities of
the
group to repay.</i>
<P>

<i>	April 1990 - Request by Mr. Paola for the Bank to appoint receivers to ABE
Holdings Limited.  This was denied on the grounds that
receivership of ABE
Holdings would (in our view) have precipitated a liquidation of the entire
group.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whilst the company was no doubt facing liquidity difficulties ABE Holdings
was at the time the primary holding company of all Mr.
Paola's rural
operations.  It was also our view that the primary motive for this action was
to thwart the claims of certain contingent
creditors (unpaid ABE Fax creditors
who had been guaranteed by ABE Holdings).</i>
<P>

<i>	The Bank however was compelled to respond by </i><cite>placing all
overdrawn current accounts in reduction</cite><i>.  That arrangement is
continuing.</i>
<P>

<i>	May 1990 - </i><cite>Pressure brought to bear to ensure sale of
"Durhambone</cite><i>".  Mr Paola had previously undertaken to sell this
property in order to reduce Bank debt which he had agreed for some time is
excessive.
 </i><cite>Whilst not a condition of the current approval our
increasing concerns for the Group's liquidity position resulted in pressure
being
brought to bear to ensure the sale</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	- Multi Option Facility reduction from $8.5 million to $7.5 million in
accordance with the approval dated 13 December 1989.  This
was achieved
primarily via the sale by Mr. Paola of the business of Northern Rural Services
Pty Limited.  (Mr Paola's farm service
and supply organisation) and of the last
remaining jet aircraft.</i>
<P>

<i>	June 1990 - Details of proposal to sell 2/3 of Durhambone Station disclosed
indicating a total sale price of $5.4 million, $4.5 million
of which would be
received at settlement in late August;</i>
<P>

<i>	- Revised cash flow projection produced indicating Group Bank borrowing
requirements of less than $2.5 million by end September 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	July 1990 - NW Region approached to consider taking over administration of
the Paola Account.  The Region is prepared to do so once
debt is reduced to the
abovementioned $2.5 million mark.  (Note, as a result of the abovementioned
sales/liquidations Paola Group
operations are now primarily farming oriented
albeit on significant rural holdings in North West of New South Wales).'</i>
<P>

<i>	`August 1990 - Revised cash flow projections indicate borrowing
requirements to the order of $4.5 million (increase due largely to
continuing
difficulties in harvesting crops from properties still flooded and failures to
sell other properties namely the premises
of NRS.  Requests to allow part of
the proceeds of the Durhambone sale (now imminent) to meet other commitments
are being denied.
 This is the basis behind Mr Paola's recent
complaints).</i>
<P>

<i>	`</i><cite>Concluding Remarks</cite>
<P>

<i>	The administration of this account has never been an easy task.  Mr Paola's
entrepreneurial style has resulted in the Paola Group
lending requirements
being very unpredictable and facility planning and administration difficult.
Management of this account has
since been made all the more difficult as a
result of recent events which have led to concerns being raised for the manner
in which
Mr. Paola wishes to deal with his creditors (including the Bank) and
the need for the Bank of late to return cheques presented on
accounts overdrawn
without arrangements (as those accounts are domiciled at Tamworth this must
also be affecting the Region's readiness
to accept this account).  Mr Paola has
not yet been asked to take his business elsewhere.  Given however the
inordinate amount of
time that is continuing to be required for this account
that option is now being seriously considered and will be dealt with in a
review of the account to be conducted next month.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Annexure `Z' to Mr Booth's first statement]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

576	Mr Terrey gave evidence that at his meeting with Mr Booth on about 17
August 1990, he said to Mr Booth "We need the funds and
the proceeds (at which
time he showed Mr Booth a document dated 17 August 1990) to meet our specific
commitments except for the $390,000
for the purchase of U-Bix shares.  We need
the other money to continue trading basically.  The Group can't pay these
commitments
from its cash flow".
<P>

577	Mr Terrey's evidence was that at the time, the Group commitments included a
commitment to repay vendor finance owing on properties
purchased by the Group
previously, ABE Holdings guarantee commitments arising from the ABE Fax
business and interest on bank borrowings.
<P>

578	Mr Terrey's evidence was that it was likely that the failure to meet any of
these commitments, including the commitment to pay
ABE Fax's guarantees, could
have led to an application for the winding up and dissolution of any one of the
companies in the Group.
<P>

579	Mr Terrey's evidence was that at the meeting he said to Mr Booth words to
the effect:
<P>

	<i>`The group relies on the cash flow from the harvesting operations to meet
its commitments outside of the Bank funds.  We have vendor
finance commitments
on some properties, ABE guarantees and interest owed to the Bank.  The group
can't meet these commitments from
its own cash flows at the moment but the
coming crop will be able to meet a large part of them.  The Group needs part of
the Durhambone
sale to meet these expenses.  The coming harvest is important to
maintain the group's future cash flow according to the projections
we've given
you before.  We can't get the harvest unless we pay the contractors.  As you
know the very nature of rural operations
is that there is a very large up front
payment and commitment in respect to sowing, preparing and harvesting and the
proceeds of
sale are not released until the actual harvest and sale of the
crop.  That's why we need the funds released.  Can you agree to the
proposal?'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>20 August 1990</b>
<P>

580	By letter dated 20 August 1990, the Bank wrote to the Paola Group referring
to the imminent sale of much of Durhambone which
it was understood would
realise a total of some $5.4 million, $4.5 million of which was to be received
on the following day at settlement.
<P>

581	The Bank did not accede to the proposal that proceeds of Durhambone to be
paid to the Bank be reduced by $390,000 saying:
<P>

	<i>`With regard to the proposal to acquire a significant shareholding in U-Bix
N.Z., we believe this to be an entirely new issue which
will involve separate
detailed consideration of both the transaction and its future cash flow effect.
The envisaged payment does
not follow the intent of the original transaction
and therefore we cannot agree to the proceeds of Durhambone being reduced by
$390,000.'
 </i>[PX 1512]
<P>

	<b>23 August 1990</b>
<P>

582	On 23 August 1990, Mr Terrey prepared an alternative proposal to deal with
the concerns raised by Mr Booth.  The proposal related
to the sale of part of
the Durhambone property.  The property was due to settle on 31 August 1990 and
conversations were taking place
between the companies and the Bank at the
time.
<P>

583	By letter dated 23 August 1990, Mr Paola wrote to Mr O'Neill, the Chief
Executive of the State Bank seeking an urgent meeting
with him to discuss:
<P>

	<i>`(a)	The Bank's total unwillingness to consider what, on objective grounds
are reasonable propositions for continuing reduced facilities
following the
agreed sale of certain rural assets and the application of proceeds as agreed
to the Group's facilities.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The Bank's demands for the wholesale reduction or elimination of our
facilities involving the sale of rural properties, buildings,
crops and other
assets.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	The conduct of officers of the Bank involving the dishonour of various
cheques of companies in the group which, understandably,
has caused
considerable damage to those companies while, at the same time, other accounts
of those companies with the Bank stood
in credit;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	The recent decision of officers of the Bank </i><cite>without notice to
us to alter established practice with regard to the administration of the
group's banking facilities, thereby causing
further damage to the
group</cite><i> . . .'  </i> [PX 1525]  [Emphasis added]

	<b>27 August 1990</b>
<P>

584	By letter dated 27 August 1990, Mr Booth and Mr Swinburne wrote to Mr Paola
advising that they had been asked to reply to his
letter to Mr O'Neill of 23
August.  This response inter alia stated:
<P>

	<i>`You have on several occasions confirmed your intentions to significantly
reduce debt through the sale of assets.  Durhambone was
central to that plan.
However, your several cash flow projections over the past three months have
fallen well short of being realised.
 Despite this, you now appear to be
inferring that the bank has agreed to accept less than the full proceeds of
sale of assets.</i>
<P>

<i>	The matter of the dishonour of some cheques is in accordance with our
letter to you of 4 May 1990 which required all current accounts,
not already
overdrawn, to operate on a strict credit basis.  The fact that some other
accounts may have been in credit at the time
cheques drawn on other accounts
were dishonoured is not relevant for various legal reasons . . .'    </i>[PX
1533]
<P>

	<b>30 August 1990</b>
<P>

585	On 30 August 1990, a settlement of part sale of Durhambone was postponed by
Mr Paola because the Bank would not agree to the
disbursement of funds to
provide for costs of his Group.
<P>

586	On 31 August 1990 Mr Paola directed that the settlement of sale of part of
the Durhambone property be postponed for the above
reasons.  The Bank made it
clear from its correspondence that the full proceeds of sale of Durhambone were
to be applied to reduce
the Bank debt.
<P>

587	This was unacceptable to the Paola Group as the sale proceeds of Durhambone
were said to be required for the continuing operations
of the company and to
meet specific commitments of the company.  These commitments included
commitments to the Bank as to interest
and the commitment set out in the
company's letters of 17 August 1990 and 24 August 1990 to the Bank.
<P>

	<b>3 September 1990</b>
<P>

588	The fixed term loan facility was due to expire on this date.  Mr Terrey
requested the Bank to roll over $3,050,000 in the name
of Currabubula to expire
on 3 December 1990.
<P>

	<b>4 September 1990</b>
<P>

589	Following the postponement of the settlement of the Durhambone property, Mr
Terrey attended a further meeting with the State
Bank on 4 September 1990 where
the issue of the release being provided by the Paola Group was raised for the
first time by Mr Booth.
<P>

590	On 4 September 1990, the Bank's solicitor Mr Stenhouse, wrote to Blake
Dawson Waldron confirming that settlement which was to
have taken place of the
sale of Durhambone on 31 September did not proceed as the Bank was not prepared
to hand over release documentation
without receipt of the full net proceeds of
sale of the property.  The letter advised that the Bank would still be looking
to receive
full net proceeds of sale at any future contemplated settlement and
in addition would require a deed of release from Currabubula
Holdings in
relation to any contemplated legal action against the Bank.  The letter
enclosed a draft of such deed of release.   [PX
1570]
<P>

591	The Bank's request for a release was thus made in circumstances where the 4
September 1990 meeting was held between representatives
of the Paola Group and
representatives of the Bank.  The meeting is summarised in a record of meeting
signed by Mr McLennan at PX
1581 and 1582 which stated inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`The meeting was called by us to effect a resolution to the matter of
disbursement of funds from the partial sale of Durhambone. 
It should be
recalled that as far back as May 1990 the Bank had insisted that all the
proceeds from the sale of Durhambone were to
be utilised in reduction of the
group's debts.  It is only now that Paola wants a number of disbursements made
primarily:</i>
<P>

<i>	Vendor finance of 	- $242,148.33 </i>
<P>

<i>	- $422,000.00</i>
<P>

<i>	- Purchased shares in U-Bix N.Z. - $390,000</i>
<P>

<i>	In previous conversations our intentions remained solid in that we sought
all the funds.  In his attempt to resolve the matter Paola
had his lawyer Peter
Stapleton of Blake Dawson Waldron instigate legal proceedings against the Bank
if it did not comply with his
request for his proposed disbursements.  In fact
settlement of part of Durhambone was deferred on this very matter.</i>
<P>

<i>	After much discussion and evaluation with Messrs Terrey and Stapleton, it
was agreed to comply with Paola's demands with the exception
of the $390,000.
In coming to this conclusion we took into consideration the following
facts:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	If settlement did not proceed the Bank would not have its debt reduced
by $3.4 million and Paola's debts would be unacceptably
high levels for a
further extended period.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	The Bank would be involved in a litigious position with what we believe
to be an emotionally charged situation and could drag
on for some time.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	Durhambone if sold later probably would not achieve values being
received now, in fact it would be sold at potentially deflated
prices.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	Should debt remain at present levels it would be increasingly difficult
for Paola to service interest costs . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Paola's methods in seeking a resolution to this issue leave a lot to be
desired.  He has made baseless accusations in the media (The
Land) about the
Bank, he has refused to meet personally, he has threatened legal action and in
fact instructed his lawyers that if
we had not agreed to this request he would
proceed with litigation.  His business acumen has become very irrational and
one gets
the impression he is experiencing severe credit pressure.  It was
mentioned at the meeting that we believed the time would come when
Paola should
consider seeking alternative financing for his group.'   </i>[PX 1582]
<P>

592	Following that meeting, Mr Terrey received the letter dated 4 September
1990 from the Bank.  In that letter the Bank confirmed
that following
discussion, it had agreed to comply with the Group's request to disburse the
funds in accordance with the particular
schedule provided by Mr Terrey.  The
Bank completed this letter by stating:
<P>

	<i>`I might add that this was in total contravention to the Bank's intentions
conveyed to you as far back as early May 1990 and on a
number of other
occasions since wherein the Bank sought all proceeds from the sale to be
utilised in the reduction of your Group's
debts.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was further agreed with Mr Terrey that the Bank would only comply with
this request on the basis that:</i>
<P>

<i>	I.	The properties known as "Willow Vale", "Woodleigh", "Bungaloon" and
"Mill Ridge" would be mortgaged to the Bank once they become
unencumbered
and</i>
<P>

<i>	II	All current and proposed litigation against the Bank be immediately
withdrawn.</i>
<P>

<i>	In agreeing to these requests, it cannot pass without stating that the
methods employed by you in seeking a resolution to this issue
have left us with
a great deal of discomfort and do not fall within the precinct of what we
believe to be a mutually beneficial customer/banker
relationship.'</i>
<P>

593	On 4 September 1990, Blake Dawson Waldron amended the draft Deed of Release
on behalf of the first plaintiff and provided the
Bank's solicitors with
revised figures for inclusion in that document.
<P>

	<b>6 September 1990 - Deed of Release</b>
<P>

594	On 6 September 1990, the Deed of Release was executed.  It is set out in
Appendix 8
<P>

	<b>Sale of Durhambone</b>
<P>

595	Mr Booth under cross-examination accepted that in relation to the
decision-making process within the Bank which led to the decision
that the Bank
would insist upon retaining the entirety of the proceeds of sale of the
Durhambone property, he would have written
a recommendation although he would
not have acted without approval of his superiors, and in making that
recommendation he did not
he said, have occasion to examine any security
documents relating to Durhambone.  [T406]
<P>

	<b>12 September 1990</b>
<P>

596	Under cross-examination, Mr Paola accepted that the Durhambone East sale
settled in early September 1990.  He recalled that
the upshot of his
discussions with the Bank was that it was not content to allow funds to be
withheld from the proceeds of that sale
for the purpose of his Group purchasing
shares in U-Bix.
<P>

597	Mr Paola was shown a letter written on about 12 September 1990 by Mr Terrey
with Mr Paola's authority to Blake Dawson Waldron.
 The letter appears at PX
1614.  The letter requests Blake Dawson Waldron to instruct solicitors in New
Zealand to acquire a shelf
company in New Zealand in relation to U-Bix, New
Zealand, and inter alia states as follows:
<P>

	<i>`We confirm the funds are in a short term deposit account awaiting payment.
We believe payment should be made simultaneously to the
signing of the
agreement and subject to written approval being granted from the OIC.'</i>
<P>

598	That letter was written in relation to the possible purchase of shares in
U-Bix.
<P>

599	The letter makes plain that there were still unresolved matters which were
outstanding.  At transcript 197, Mr Paola accepted
that certain matters were
unresolved and he could not assist with identifying the significance of such
matters.
<P>

600	Mr Paola accepted that notwithstanding that he had known without doubt on
or prior to 6 September 1990 that the Bank was not
going to release funds for
purchase of U-Bix shares, within a week or so after that date Mr Terrey on his
instructions, gave instructions
to Blake Dawson Waldron to acquire a shelf
company which indicated that he had in mind that the purchase of U-Bix shares
could and
would proceed, notwithstanding that funds were not available from the
sale of Durhambone East.  
<P>

601	In relation to the statement in the letter written by Mr Terrey that the
funds that were required to provide the deposit, being
an amount of some
$A394,000 were in a short term deposit account awaiting payment, the following
evidence was given under cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Was it the fact that the funds that were required to provide the
deposit, being an amount of some $394,000 Australian dollars,
were in a short
term deposit account waiting payment depending inclusion of an
agreement?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, there is no truth in that statement.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Did you approve this letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Was it a statement you believe to be true when you approved the
letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, that was our attempt to hold on to those shares.  I must admit,
there were no funds on deposit for this purpose.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Are you saying it was a false statement?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In as much as the way it's expressed therein yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And was it a statement made for the purpose of deterring the prospective
vendor from selling to other people?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, they were not negotiating with other people at the time, but we were
buying time, there is no question about that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What do you mean by `buying time'?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, we were trying to stop them from putting - we were attempting to
retain the option on those shares at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that would have been the situation  you saw as to your group's
financial advantage?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, Mr Macfarlan this was a company that I founded . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Was it something that you saw as likely to be to your group's financial
advantage?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh absolutely.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the statement that was made in the letter that I've referred you to
was not only false, but it was false to your knowledge,
wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And it was made for the purpose of your group obtaining a distinct
financial advantage, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, you could say that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It was a lie made for the purpose of obtaining a financial advantage to
your company, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And are you accustomed to telling lies for the purpose of obtaining
financial advantage for your companies?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I'm not.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Why did you tell this one?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Because I didn't believe it was causing anybody any harm.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you regard that, as in general terms, a justification for telling a
lie?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, I don't.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, why did you regard it as a sufficient justification in this
case?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In this particular case you have to understand that it was a company
that I founded and there was a desire.  There was a desire
to rebuild what had
been basically destroyed.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Isn't it the fact that you did have funds available?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	We did not have funds available.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Were the funds in the No. 2 accounts at the Bank which would have  met
the description in that paragraph?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I don't believe so . . .'    </i>[T 195-196]
<P>

	The matter does not reflect well in terms of Mr Paola's conduct.  I do not,
however, view the incident as requiring a finding adverse
to Mr Paola's general
reliability on most matters as a witness.  Whilst it does not of course provide
any acceptable excuse for Mr
Paola's conduct, I accept that he did not believe
that he was causing harm to anyone on the occasion in question.  He was, I
accept,
desperate to keep open his options in relation to acquiring the U-Bix
shares at this time, when Group asset sales had fallen far
short of his
expectations.  He believed, I accept, that the Bank had acted and was acting
outrageously in relation to his requests
to release funds to permit the U-Bix
share purchase deposit to be paid.  Ultimately, the Court's assessment of Mr
Paola's credit
is determined upon a view based on his demeanour in the witness
box, based upon the whole of the evidence spanning his conduct over
a number of
years, based upon matching his evidence against that given by other witnesses
and importantly based upon the general
consistency of his evidence with
contemporaneous documents.
<P>

	<b>14 September 1990</b>
<P>

602	On 14 September 1990, share transfers were executed transferring the shares

Currabubula (1 share held in trust for Paola Holdings).
<P>

	<b>19 September 1990 and following - U'Bix Share Negotiations</b>

603	Mr Paola continued to negotiate for the purchase of the U-Bix shares during
this period notwithstanding that the Bank had indicated
that it would not make
finance available for this purpose.
<P>

604	Settlement of the Durhambone East sale took place in September 1990
<P>

	<b>11 October 1990</b>

605	The Paola Group wrote to the Bank about the U-Bix opportunity on this
date.
<P>

	<b>15 October 1990</b>
<P>

606	On this occasion, a meeting took place following which the Bank wrote to Mr
Paola.  At the meeting the Bank had been requested
to consider funding an
option to purchase shares in U-Bix.  The Bank advised Mr Paola that it was not
prepared to consider any amendments
to existing arrangements.
<P>

	<b>31 October 1990</b>
<P>

607	A provisional liquidator was appointed to NRS on 31 October 1990.  By this
time the only part of the business still operating
was the seed grading
business located at Moree.
<P>

	<b>28 November 1990</b>
<P>

608	Fernbank offered an option to Mr Paola for the purchase of 3,245,778 shares
in U-Bix at NZ$2 with the purchase of the shares
to be completed by 31 August
1991.  The option fee required was NZ$300,000.  Shares were then selling on
market for NZ$1.30.
<P>

<P>

610	Gabo was passed in at an auction at $5.6 million in February 1991.
<P>

611	Paola engaged Southpac Corporation to advise in the acquisition and
privatisation by Paola of U-Bix.
<P>

612	
<P>

A preliminary review dated 27 February 1991 by Southpac Corporation, stated
that Mr Paola was considering the acquisition of a 42
percent stake currently
held by Fernbank Industries Limited in U-Bix and also the acquisition of the
balance of shares, being 58%
held by institutions, members of the public and
staff of U-Bix.
<P>

613	The same Southpac Corporation report states:
<P>

	<i>`We have been informed that Mr Paola will realise free cash of NZ
$3.0million from the sale of an Australian property.  The sale is
due to take
place on or before 28 February 1991 with settlement due 60 days after sale.  In
addition, we believe that a further NZ
$3.0million free cash will be realised
from the sale of a second Australian property during the next 24
months.'</i>
<P>

614	At transcript 212, it was put to Mr Paola that in February 1991 he believed
that he had the financial means to purchase a 42
percent stake in U-Bix if he
considered that appropriate and if he could negotiate that purchase.  He
disagreed, stating that he
did not believe that he had the financial means but
believed at that point in time that there may still be possibilities of funding
it.  It was put to Mr Paola that he would not have engaged Southpac Corporation
unless he was confident that he had the financial
means to go ahead with the
purchase if he could negotiate it, but Mr Paola answered that he did not have
the financial means and
that the retainer of Southpac was predicated on a
management buy-out of the company.  [T 212]

	<b>March 1991</b>
<P>

615	In early March 1991, Heath Oliver &amp; Associates reported to Mr Paola,
advising that they were `pleased to accept a mandate
from Currabubula Holdings
. . . to assist Currabubula in arranging acquisition and working capital of up
to A$5.2 million'.
<P>

616	In mid-March 1991, Heath Oliver wrote to FAI Insurances Limited seeking to
interest that company in the proposal by Mr Paola
in relation to the subject
purchase.  Heath Oliver advised, inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Our client was a successful businessman in automated office equipment.  He
retired from the business to concentrate on building up
a number of rural
properties.</i>
<P>

<i>	A major institutional shareholder is in the position where it is forced to
dispose of 42% of an automated office equipment company
(the target).  Our
client has had a close business relationship with the target since 1981.  He
owns a small parcel of shares in
that company and has maintained a connection
with the business through a non-executive directorship and consulting
agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>	Our client wishes to acquire the institution's shares and proceed to make a
full bid for the target.  We have been informed that
a major bank has indicated
interest in providing the take-over finance.</i>
<P>

<i>	To enable the transaction to proceed our client wishes to borrow against
the equity in his rural properties which are valued in the
region of $15million
to acquire the institution's shares.'</i>

617	Ultimately, FAI Insurances were not prepared to proceed.
<P>

	<b>April 1991</b>
<P>

618	In early April 1991, Mr Paola gave instructions to Cavill White Securities
Limited, members of the New Zealand Stock Exchange,
to put a proposal for the
joint purchase of the shares.  That proposal by Mr Paola and the Maori
Development Corporation comprised
an offer for the 3,245,778 U-Bix shares to be
acquired as follows:
<P>

	<i>`1.	Maori Development Corporation offered to purchase for cash 1,298,311
shares (16.9% of the total shares on issue) at NZ$1.30 a
share.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Paola offered to purchase:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	For cash 246,154 shares at NZ $1.30;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	On a deferred payment basis, 1,701,313 shares at NZ $1.30.  This would
give the relevant Paola entity a total of 1,947,467 shares
(25.3% of the
total).'</i>

621	Cavill White Securities Limited on 6 May 1991, submitted a further offer to
DFC by way of the joint purchase, this time at a
price of NZ $1.40 per share.
The response of DFC was that this offer was too low.
<P>

622	In late May 1991, DFC rejected a further offer, this time made at NZ $1.55
per share.  A few days later, Cavill White Securities
wrote to DFC submitting a
further offer made on behalf of the Maori Development Corporation and the Paola
interests, this time at
NZ$1.80.  Mr Paola gave evidence that this offer was in
fact accepted and that the Maori Development Board decided that they would
take
the shares, disregarding Mr Paola's previous involvement.  Mr Paola was not
able to put forward any evidence of any acceptance
of the offer which had been
made for the purchase at NZ $1.80 per share.
<P>

	<b>July 1991 - U-Bix Shares Sold to Maori Development Corporation</b>
<P>

623	On 3 July 1991, U-Bix confirmed that the shares in question had been sold
to the Maori Development Corporation at NZ $2.00 per
share.  [PX 2044]
<P>

624	In essence, Mr Paola's cross-examination was directed at suggesting that he
was never prepared to pay NZ $2.00 for the subject
shares and that the real
situation involved offers being made from time to time well below the figure
that the vendor had indicated
that it wanted, although the offers had inched up
but ultimately always been insufficient to achieve a purchase.
<P>

625	Mr Paola put forward no evidence to suggest that any proceedings had been
commenced by his Group or himself against the Maori
Development Corporation to
pursue any claim which might otherwise have been held in relation to the
suggestion that the ultimate
purchase was in breach of any arrangement or
agreement with the Maori Development Corporation relating to the share
purchase.
<P>

	<b>Limitation and Standing Questions</b>
<P>

626	It is convenient before proceeding further, to turn to the limitation and
standing questions.
<P>

627	Currabubula Holdings was the sole plaintiff upon the filing of the Summons
on 23 December 1995.
<P>

628	Section C2 of the plaintiff's contentions pleaded the entry into of the
Facility Agreement on or about 1 February 1990 by `the
plaintiff together with
Paola Holdings, ABE Holdings, ABE Telecommunications, ABE Travel, ABE Jet,
Campbell Rixon, Franxton Pty Limited,
Pyojit ("the companies in the Paola Group
of Companies") . . .'
<P>

629	Paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 pleaded that `the plaintiff and other companies in
the Paola Group of Companies encountered identified
difficulties and lost
opportunities and were forced to sell assets in forced sale circumstances.
<P>

630	Paragraph 15 pleaded that `by reason of the provisions of the Facility
Agreement the plaintiff was forced to meet not only its
own liabilities to the
defendant but also the liabilities of other members of the Paola Group of
Companies to the defendant'.
<P>

631	Paragraph 16 pleaded that `the plaintiff is unable to recover moneys paid
out by it to the defendant for liabilities incurred
by other members of the
Paola Group of Companies'.
<P>

632	The plaintiffs claimed damages, interest and costs in the Summons.
<P>

633	By order made on 29 September 1997 Hunter J, upon application made by
Currabubula Holdings, granted leave to amend the summons
in terms of annexure
`E' to the affidavit of A. Koumoukelis of 15 September 1997.
<P>

634	The amendments are summarised in the judgment of Hunter J delivered on 29
September 1997.  Effectively, the three categories
of amendments were:
<P>

	(a)	Amplification and greater particularisation of Currabubula's damages
claim.
<P>

	(b)	Joinder of Paola Holdings as second plaintiff.
<P>

	(c)	Addition of causes of action by Paola Holdings.
<P>

635	The limitation and standing questions presently in focus deal only with
categories (b) and (c).
<P>

636	As Hunter J pointed out at pages 3 to 4 of his judgment, the proposed
amendments included alternative allegations, namely that:
<P>

	(i)	The defendant owed its obligations under the Facility Agreement to the
Paola Group Companies jointly.  [Paragraph 26]
<P>

	(ii)	The defendant owed its obligations under the Facility Agreement to the
Paola Groups severally.  [Paragraph 29]
<P>

637	The consequential claims, following the joint promisee allegation as well
as the several promisee allegation, were that:
<P>

	.	By reason of the breach of contract the Paola Group Companies had suffered
loss or damage.  [Paragraphs 27, 30]
<P>

	.	In the premises Currabubula was entitled to recover the entirety of the loss
or damages suffered by Paola Group Companies.  [Paragraphs
28, 31]
<P>

638	Section H of the contentions pleaded Paola Holdings' claim.
<P>

639	Paragraphs 42 to 47 read as follows:
<P>

	<i>`H Claim by Paola Holdings</i>
<P>

<i>	42.	Paola Holdings Pty Limited is duly incorporated.</i>
<P>

<i>	43.	Paragraphs 2-28 hereof are repeated.</i>
<P>

<i>	44.	In the premises, Paola Holdings Pty Limited joins with its
co-contractor Currabubula, in seeking to recover from the defendant
the
entirety of the loss or damage suffered by the Paola Group Companies . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>	45.	Alternatively, the defendant owed its obligations under the Facility
Agreement to the Paola Group Companies severally.</i>
<P>

<i>	46.	By reason of the defendant breach of contract, Paola Holdings Pty
Limited has suffered loss or damage in that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Paola Holdings Pty Limited lost the opportunity to refinance the debt
owed to the defendant without interruption to its business
or trade.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	NRS, which was owned by ABE Holdings Pty Limited, which in turn was
owned by Paola Holdings Pty Limited, was required to be sold
immediately on a
fire sale basis, resulting in a sale at an undervalue.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Paola Holdings Pty Limited lost the opportunity to acquire shares in
U-Bix (N.Z.) Limited . . . which shares would have been
resold at a substantial
profit which would have come to Paola Holdings Pty Limited in the first
instance.</i>
<P>

<i>	47.	Paola Holding is entitled to recover the loss or damage which it has
suffered by reason of the defendant's breach of the facility
agreement . .
.'</i>
<P>

640	In the amended summons, both plaintiffs claimed damages, interest and
costs.
<P>

641	Hunter J in his judgment said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`I think the significance of the amendments which are not in issue, namely
the alternative bases of claim by Currabubula as a joint
or several promisee,
is that the method of quantifying the damages claimed involves in each case
quantifying the damages suffered
by the Paola group.  That is best illustrated
by the claim in respect of the U-Bix share transaction in which the total
damages are
established and then apportioned as to one third to quantify
Currabubula's alleged loss.  That alternative basis of claim also gives
rise to
the question as to the nature of the damages that Currabubula is entitled to
recover as a joint promisee.  Arguably, Currabubula
is entitled to recover the
whole of the damages suffered by the Paola group as joint promisees, holding
that portion of recovered
damages suffered by others in the Paola group on
trust for those others (see Australian<b> </b>Securities Ltd v Western
Australia Insurance Co Ltd (1929) 29 SR 571 at 573; Cunningham v Fitzgerald

76-77.)</i>
<P>

<i>	The importance of those features on this application lies, in my opinion,
in the operation of Pt 20 r 1 of the Supreme Court Rules
which, so far as is
relevant, provides as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	"[20.1]	    General</i>
<P>

<i>	    1.  (1)  The Court may, at any stage of any proceedings, on application
by any party or to its own motion, order that any document
in the proceedings
be amended, or that any party have leave to amend any document in the
proceedings, in either case in such manner
as the Court thinks fit</i>
<P>

<i>	    (2)  All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of
determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending
on the
proceedings, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings, or of
avoiding multiplicity of proceedings."</i>
<P>

<i>	That discretion has been described as one "unfettered by any rules of
practice" and is of such a general nature as to permit the
raising of a statute
barred cause of action "whenever justice so requires" (see McGee v Yeomans<b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1 NSWLR 273</a> at 280 and Proctor v Jetway Aviation Pty Ltd<b>

the combined effect of Pt 20 r 1 and r 4 was to displace the rule in Weldon
v
Neal (1887) 19 QB Division 394 and proceeded on the premise of the
applicability of the principle of relation back of Baldry v
Jackson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%202%20NSWLR%20415" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 2
NSWLR 415.</a>  </i>
<P>

<i>	In this application Currabubula sought recourse to Pt 20 r 4(4) on the
basis that, as a joint promisee, Paola Holdings should be
joined as a plaintiff
(see Pt 8 r 3) and should be permitted to raise a claim by way of amendment
under Pt 20 r 4(4) based on its
entitlement to sue in an alternative capacity,
namely, that of a several promisee.  I do not think subrule (4) in speaking of
"capacity"
is addressing such a situation.  I think subrule (4) is concerned
with status of the party and not with that party's capacity to
formulate causes
of action on alternative bases.  Reliance was also placed upon the operation of
Pt 20 r 5.  That is the basis upon
which the expanded relief sought by
Currabubula has been shown to be justified.  It has no application to relief
sought by Paola
Holdings, in my opinion. </i>
<P>

<i>	It was also argued that Currabubula's case was in the nature of a
representative action within the ambit of Pt 8 r 13.  I do not
think that the
action as originally formulated in the summons or in the proposed amendments
falls within the category of a representative
action.  (See Carnie v Esanda
Finance Corporation Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d1995%29%20182%20CLR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-1995) 182 CLR 398).</a>  As a claim by a joint
promisee, the claim is simply a cause of action in which all co-promisees
should be joined.  The failure to
join co-promisees does not result in a
representative action on behalf of parties who should have been joined as
plaintiffs.  As
a claim by one of several promisees the damages sought to be
recovered are those only suffered by Currabubula and in respect only
of its
several cause of action.  The advantage sought to be derived by the applicant
from resort to Pt 8 r 13 lies in the contention
that the bringing of a
representative action has the effect of time ceasing to run under the statute
of limitations in respect of
the claims of the represented entities.  I am
satisfied that Currabubula's claim is not a representative action either as
originally
formulated or in the proposed amendment.</i>
<P>

<i>	Currabubula has also sought recourse to Pt 8 r 3 to have Paola Holdings
joined as a joint promisee.  I do not think it is doing the
applicant's case an
injustice, in that respect, in describing it as more in the nature of a device
than one seeking to remedy an
omission in the platform of Currabubula's cause
of action.  Pt 8 r 7, I think, makes it clear that a failure to join Paola
Holdings
to satisfy the requirements of Pt 8 r 3 is not fatal to Currabubula's
right of action as a joint promisee.</i>
<P>

<i>	However, I think there are quite special and distinctive features about
Currabubula's claim, as expanded, which calls for some favourable
response by
the court to this application to satisfy the requirement of justice.  As stated
earlier in these reasons, the peculiar
nature of the damages claimed by
Currabubula, whether as a joint or several promisee, for practical purposes,
requires Currabubula
to prove the whole of the damages which it could be said
were suffered by the Paola group, the only difference, in terms of recovery,
being the limitation of Currabubula's claim as a several promisee to
approximately one third of the damages relating to the U-Bix
share transaction
said to have been suffered by the Paola group, in particular, by Paola
Holdings.  In those circumstances I fail
to see what possible prejudice could
arise or any unfairness be occasioned to the State Bank by allowing the
proposed amendment,
notwithstanding that it includes claims by Paola Holdings
both as a joint promisee and as a several promisee.  As a joint promisee,
the
damages to be proved by Paola Holdings would be the same as those proved by
Currabubula in its joint promisee claim.  I think
the focal point in this
application is that the claim by Currabubula, whether as a joint or several
promisee, calls for proof of
damage suffered by the Paola group.  In the case
of the claim as a several promisee there is involved the further step of
dissecting
from the damage suffered by the Paola group the damage suffered by
Currabubula.  </i>
<P>

<i>	The claims by Paola Holdings as a several promisee in the proposed
amendment involve the same process of separating Paola's loss
from that
suffered by the Paola group:  a process indistinguishable from the exercise
required to establish the Currabubula separable
loss.  No question of prejudice
to State Bank through effluxion of time arises in the bringing of a separate
claim by Paola Holdings
at this stage of the proceedings.  It will have to meet
exactly the same evidence as it is required to meet in Currabubula's claim
as
amended in the uncontentious paragraphs of the proposed amendment.:  including
the evidence of the separable damages suffered
by Paola Holdings in relation to
the U-Bix share transaction from which are to be extracted Currabubula's loss.
It has not been argued
that Currabubula's derivative loss as a shareholder in
Paola Holdings is an unrecoverable head of damage.</i>
<P>

<i>	It has also been argued on behalf of Currabubula that, by reason of the
allegation in paragraph 24 of the proposed amendment, the
breach alleged
against State Bank was a continuing one between February 1990 and June 1992, so
that in any event, the claim by Paola
Holdings as a several promisee was not
statute barred in its entirety.  However, I think that, while that may be so,
and will achieve
the immediate objective of an amendment to include a cause of
action by Paola Holdings as a several promisee, its efficacy may ultimately
be
of limited value.  Similarly, the joinder of Paola Holdings to satisfy the
requirements of Pt 8 r 3 may have little utility, although,
I am prepared to
make such an order.  It should be noted that the application has been argued on
the basis that Paola Holdings consents
to being joined for the purpose of Pt 8
r 3.</i>
<P>

<i>	In any event, I think it should be made clear that, in granting leave to
amend in terms of the proposed amendment, if I had power
to do so, as an added
source of power I would exercise the general discretion to grant such leave
pursuant to Pt 20 r 1 with the
objective of ensuring that causes of action by
Paola Holdings as a several promisee would date from the institution of these
proceedings
and so defeat any limitations defence which may have been available
to State Bank if the cause of action was deemed to commence from
the date of
the amendment.  The difficulty in having recourse to Pt 20 r 1 for this purpose
of allowing the Paola Holdings amendments
lies in the provisions of Pt 8 r
11(3) which requires that the joinder of a plaintiff, except in the case of
joinder pursuant to
Pt 8 r 10 or Pt 20 r 4(3), neither of which exceptions
apply to this case, dates from the order of joinder.  If Pt 8 r 11(3) is to
apply, the result in this case borders upon the absurd.  As stated earlier, the
contentions to be raised by Paola Holdings under
the proposed amendments will
result in proving the same damages of the Paola group which Currabubula is
entitled to prove, indeed,
is required to prove both as joint or several
promisee.  Similarly, their respective claims for damages simply call for the
separation
out of those damages of the Paola group those damages respectively
peculiar to Currabubula and Paola Holdings.  When the basis of
the claim and
the capacity in which Paola Holdings sues is so understood, there is some
affront to one's sense of reasonableness,
dare I say justice, in being required
to treat Paola Holdings' cause of action, both as joint and several promisee,
as dating from
the date of the amendment.  Accordingly, although Currabubula
and Paola Holdings are clearly entitled to the amendments sought, in
the case
of Paola Holdings, </i><cite>notwithstanding the operation of Pt 8 r 11(3), to
the extent that it is within my power to do so validly</cite><i>, I would grant
leave so to amend upon the further power conferred by Pt 20 r 1 to the extent
that the amendment will operate from
the institution of proceedings as distinct
from the date of this order.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[See pages 7-19, Hunter J judgment]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

642	On 2 October 1997, the plaintiffs sought to propound short minutes of order
before Hunter J in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`The Court orders that:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Paola Holdings Pty Limited be joined as second plaintiff to the
proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	The first and second plaintiffs have leave to amend the summons in terms
of annexure marked E to the affidavit of AG Koumoukelis
sworn 15 September 1997
save for the proposed paragraph 27A(a).</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	The joinder of Paola Holdings Pty Limited have effect from [
]</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs of the plaintiffs' motion
and the defendant's costs of, incidental to and thrown
away by the subject
amendment.'</i>
<P>

643	In a short judgment delivered on 2 October 1997, Hunter J said as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`In this matter on 29 September 1997 I granted leave to the plaintiff to
amend the summons . . .   In doing so I expressed views concerning
the special
circumstances which I think were presented by this application.  The matter has
been listed today as a result of an inquiry
on behalf of the defendant as to
the form of order, and in that respect there has been submitted a minute of
order dated 2 October
1997 which I have initialled and placed with the papers.
It will be seen from those minutes that it is proposed that there be included
an order specifying the time from which the subject amendment is to take
effect.  </i><cite>I have deliberately avoided making any such decision in the
reasons for judgment</cite><i>.  I have expressed the view in those reasons
that the interests of justice call for the amendment to operate from the
institution
of the proceedings, while at the same time I think indicating the
difficulty confronting the making of such an order.  I think it
was also made
clear in those reasons that it is my view that the granting of leave to amend
will not affect the evidence to be led
in these proceedings.  That is so
whether the amendment operates from the institution of the proceedings or from
the date of the
order granting leave to amend, and that is so in relation to
any issue by way of a defence based upon limitations.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is my understanding that the defendant, in seeking clarification of this
aspect of the order, desires to give consideration to
seeking leave to appeal
from any order having the effect of dating the amendment to the time of
institution of the proceedings. 
In my view, it is quite inappropriate at this
stage of the proceedings to have that question determined by some appellate
procedure.,
having regard to the fact that, whether or not the amendment dates
from the commencement of the proceedings or from the date of the
order, the
evidence in this case will be unaltered.  I see no prejudice at all to either
party in declining to make any further order
other than that the plaintiff be
granted leave to amend the summons in terms of the annexure marked E to the
affidavit of Mr Koumoukelis
of 15 September 1997, and I confirm that order.  I
think </i><cite>the question that the defendant seeks to have aired at this
stage can be dealt with by the trial judge,</cite><i> and that question and any
other question that might be the subject of appeal can be dealt with
appropriately at that time.'</i>  [Emphasis added]
<P>

644	In the result, the formal order simply granted leave to the applicant to
amend in terms of the annexure to Mr Koumoukelis' affidavit.
<P>

645	In final submissions at the hearing, the plaintiffs sought an order, `if
otherwise necessary . . . backdating the date of [Paola's]
joinder to the date
of commencement of the proceedings, if the Court forms the view that Hunter J
did not deal with that issue in
any conclusive way'.  [Submissions in reply
paragraph 34]
<P>

646	Hunter J clearly left that matter open for determination by the trial Judge
in his reasons delivered on 2 October 1997.
<P>

647	Hunter J discusses the relevant rules of the Supreme Court in relation to
the application.  These are Part 8 rules 2, 3, 8,
10, 11 and Part 20 rules 1
and 4.
<P>

648	Part 8 rule 11(3) is of crucial significance in the scheme of these rules
in relation to the present question.  This provides:
<P>

	<i>`Where in any proceedings a party is added otherwise than pursuant to an
order made under Rule 10 or Part 20 Rule 4(iii), the date
of commencement of
the proceedings so far as concerns him shall be -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	where he is added as a defendant - the date on which the amendment
adding him as a defendant is made or the date of entry of
his appearance or the
date of filing his defence, whichever is earliest;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	otherwise - the date on which the amendment adding him as a party is
made.</i>
<P>

649	Plainly Part 8 rule 10 dealing with death or bankruptcy of a party or
transmission of the interest or liability, was inapplicable.
<P>

650	As Hunter J held, Part 20 rule 4(3) was inapplicable.  Part 20 rule 4(3)
deals with situations in which there is a mistake in
the name of a party and
the Court is satisfied that the mistake was not misleading nor such as to cause
reasonable doubt as to the
identity of the person intended to be made a
party.
<P>

651	Part 20 Rule 1 is the general provision dealing with the Court's power to
amend.  Part 20 Rule 1(i) provides:
<P>

	<i>`The Court may, at any stage of any proceedings, on application by any
party or of its own motion, order that any document in the
proceedings be
amended, or that any party have leave to amend any document in the proceedings,
in either case in such manner as the
Court thinks fit.'</i>
<P>

652	Rule 1 Sub-rules (2), (3), (3A) and (4) are then machinery provisions
identifying amendments said to be `necessary' for the
purpose of determining
the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceedings or of
correcting defects or errors
in the proceedings or of avoiding multiplicity of
proceedings and also deal with where there has been a mistake in the name of a
party.
<P>

653	Importantly, Part 20 Rule 1(3A) provides:
<P>

	<i>`An order may be made, or leave may be granted, under sub-rule 1
notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment is, or would be,
to add or
substitute a cause of action arising after the commencement of the proceedings,
but in such a case the date of commencement
of the proceedings, so far as
concerns that cause of action shall, subject to sub-rule 4, be the date on
which the amendment is made.'</i>
<P>

654	Hunter J appears to have had some doubt as to whether or not the Court had
power to grant leave to amend pursuant to Part 20
rule 1 so as to ensure that
causes of action by Paola Holdings as a several promisee would date from the
institution of the proceedings
and thus defeat any limitations defence which
may have been available to the Bank if the cause of action was deemed to
commence from
the date of amendment.
<P>

655	For that reason his Honour indicated that if `it is within my power to do
so validly I would grant leave so to amend upon the
further power conferred by
Part 20 Rule 1 to the extent that the amendment will operate from the
institution of proceedings as distinct
from the date of this order'.
<P>

656	Before the enactment of Part 8 rule 11 in 1989 (an amendment made following
the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Fernance v Nominal Defendant</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 710)</a>, questions arose as to whether there was power to add
parties both under Part 8 and under Part 20.  See <i>Qantas Airways Ltd v AF
Little Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 NSWLR 34</a> at 45; <i>Australian Coastal Shipping
Commission v Curtis Cruising Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20734" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 734</a>;  <i>Fernance
(supra).</i>
<P>

657	In my view, the Court's power to add new parties must be exercised within
the constraints and subject to the provisions of Part
8 rule 11(3) of the
Rules.
<P>

658	The same view was expressed by McLelland J (as his Honour then was) in
<i>Wenham v General Credits Ltd</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South
Wales, 16 December 1988).  In that case, an application was made to join two
additional plaintiffs
to existing proceedings.  At the time, Part 8 rule 11(3)
of the Supreme Court rules provided:
<P>

	<i>`Subject to sub-rule (2), where a party is added pursuant to an order under
rule 8 or rule 10, the date of commencement of the proceedings
so far as
concerns him shall be the date of filing of the originating process amended so
as to add him as a party or, where an amended
originating process is not filed,
the date of the amendment adding him as a party.'</i>
<P>

659	McLelland J said:
<P>

	<i>`<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a>.  In my opinion, except to the limited extent
permitted by Pt20 r4(3) (which has no present application), and subject to the
question
of the existence of any inherent power in the Court to grant leave to
a non-party to intervene (which has no present relevance),
</i><cite>the
Court's power to add new parties must be exercised within the constraints, and
subject to the provisions, of Pt8 of the Supreme
Court Rules</cite><i>.  The
rules in Pt8 permitting the addition of new parties are r8 and r10.  Pt8 r11(3)
provides, subject to a presently immaterial
qualification, that "where a party
is added pursuant to an order under r8 or r10, the date of commencement of the
proceedings so
far as concerns him shall be the date of filing of the
originating process amended so as to add him as a party or, where an amended
originating process is not filed, the date of the amendment adding him as a
party".  The position would probably be the same even
without an express
provision to this effect - see Ketteman v Hansel Properties  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20AC%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] AC 189.</a>
Accordingly the amendment of an originating process by the addition of a party
pursuant to Pt8 does not relate back to the date of
commencement of the
proceedings for the purpose of a statute of limitations, unlike an amendment
under Pt20 (as to which see Baldry
v Jackson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20NSWLR%20415" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 2 NSWLR 415</a>, McGee v
Yeomans  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NSWLR 273</a>, Proctor v Jetway Aviation  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20NSWLR%20166" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 NSWLR
166).</a></i>
<P>

<i>	It follows that the addition of either Aston or RAW as a party to permit
the proceedings to be enlarged to include a claim by or
on behalf of it would
be futile if such a claim would be statute barred if brought now.'   </i>[at
page 8]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

660	To my mind it is quite clear that the effect of the amendment procured from
Hunter J so as to join Paola Holdings as an additional
plaintiff to the
proceedings, is that the amendment takes effect not from the date the original
summons was filed, but from the date
of the joinder.  In this way, the general
power of amendment afforded by Part 20, cannot be invoked to circumvent Part 8,
dealing
specifically with the relevant date of joinder.
<P>

661	In so far as the plaintiffs have pleaded that Currabubula is entitled to
bring the proceedings as a trustee for the other Paola
companies, in my
judgment there is no evidence, either oral or written, that a trust existed and
no basis on which a constructive
trust would be imposed.  As <i>Trident General
Insurance Co Ltd v McNiece Bros Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 107</a> makes plain, the
basis on which the implication of a trust may in certain circumstances be
found, rests on the fact that the person
for whose benefit the contract has
been made, that is to say the beneficiary, would not otherwise have had a cause
of action for
the very reason that the beneficiary is not a party to the
relevant contract.
<P>

662	Nor is Currabubula Holdings able to maintain the proceedings in a
representative capacity as it seeks to do in paragraph 27A
of the amended
summons.  A representative action cannot confer a right on a party which that
party would not have been entitled to
maintain in a separate action.  There is
further no joint right but a joint and several right.  Currabubula therefore
requires to
establish its own loss and its claim to sue representing all Group
companies or as a trustee for all Group companies is rejected.
<P>

663	I dismiss the application made in the plaintiffs' submissions in reply.
<P>

664	In the result, Paola Holdings' claims in these proceedings take effect from
the date of joinder of Paola Holdings.
<P>

	<b>DEALING WITH THE CASES</b>
<P>

<b>	The Group's Proposals to the Bank</b>
<P>

665	Before turning to deal with the issues before the Court it is convenient to
make clear one matter which was not an issue.  I
refer here to the fiduciary
obligations of directors of the Group to outside creditors.  It is important to
bear in mind that the
Court, in assessing the events of mid February 1990, is
not called upon to deal and does not deal with the content, nor application,
of
those principles to proposals put to the Bank by the Group.
<P>

	<b>Overview of the Plaintiffs' Submissions</b>
<P>

666	The plaintiffs submit that in essence the case is a simple one which
centres upon alleged breaches of contract by the Bank and
damages said to flow
therefrom.
<P>

667	The plaintiffs point out that in dealing with that case the Bank has raised
a large number of defences, many of which centre
upon the idea that it is
relevant to the issues that the Bank, as at February 1990, had a right to
terminate the facility agreement
for various events of default.  The plaintiffs
in submissions address those defences but submit that the Court should find
that the
Bank has not made them out and further submit that those defences are
ultimately irrelevant to the real issues.
<P>

668	The plaintiffs submit that it is clear and accepted by both sides that the
facility agreement was never in fact terminated.
 Accordingly, on the
plaintiffs' submission, at best the Bank enjoyed a right to terminate the
facility agreement in February 1990
had it chosen so to do.  It chose not to
terminate the agreement.  The plaintiffs then submit that this was an
unequivocal act of
election which bound the Bank.  The plaintiffs submit that
the Bank could not and indeed did not purport to simply save up any breaches
in
February 1990 for later use if the Bank saw fit.  The plaintiffs submit that
the Bank decided for its own reasons to continue
with the facility agreement
and to insist upon performance of its terms.  The plaintiffs point as a graphic
example of this, to the
ongoing requirement that the Group reduce the
outstanding amount of the facility to $7.5 million by May 1990.  The plaintiffs
submit
that another example of this was the translation of $7 million of the
facility into a term loan in March 1990.
<P>

669	On the plaintiffs' submissions, it follows that an enormous amount of
evidence, and in particular cross-examination, relating
to the position of
group companies over the 1989 to 1990 financial year, becomes completely
irrelevant.  The plaintiffs deal with
that evidence in submissions, but in the
final analysis submit that this material has nothing to do with their breach of
contract
case.
<P>

670	The plaintiffs accept that there are real issues in relation to the quantum
of loss suffered but submit that when the plethora
of defences thrown up by the
Bank are set aside, there is simply little or no issue as to the breaches of
contract alleged.
<P>

671	The plaintiffs submit that their new Number 2 accounts cannot be regarded
as forming any part of the facility.  The submission
was that the plaintiffs
needed no assistance from the Bank if the plaintiffs were merely spending their
own funds which may just
as easily have been deposited with another bank or
building society or been retained in cash.
<P>

672	With respect to the issue of loss, the plaintiffs submit that there is an
air of unreality about much of the Bank's argument.
 The first is that
`freezing' the trading account of operating companies, and in particular NRS,
causes no loss or difficulty to
such companies.  The plaintiffs submit that
such an argument flies in the face of the very reason why such companies obtain
credit
in the first place and is commercially unsound.  There was, so the
plaintiffs submit, a very real, immediate and permanent effect
upon NRS caused
by the Bank freezing the accounts by the sending of the `in liq' statements and
resulting from the dishonour of the
cheques.  Mr Ryan's submissions were that
the Bank's actions `had a calamitous effect' on NRS.  The submission was that
the natural
and probable result of the Bank's action was to cause the `almost
instant demise' of NRS as a trading entity.  Staff had left.  Customers
[that
is the retailers and wholesalers supplying to the Group] refused to supply
goods on credit.  At the same time NRS is said to
have been unable to put
farmers who purchased from NRS on to cash terms.  Hence Mr Ryan submitted that
the Bank's actions had had
a significant, immediate and permanent effect upon
NRS.
<P>

673	The plaintiffs further submit that the Bank witnesses accept that there was
unrelenting pressure upon Mr Paola to dispose of
Durhambone at any price from
the date of the `freezing' to the completion of the sale in September 1990.
The submission is that the
sale of Durhambone in 1990 must be seen in the
context of it having become common knowledge that the Bank had `closed down' Mr
Paola.
 On the plaintiffs' submissions, even on the evidence of Mr Spackman,
the Bank's valuer, there was a shortfall between the forced
sale value struck
by him and what was actually achieved for the Durhambone land.  Further, so the
plaintiffs submit, the Bank insisted
upon the provision to it of the proceeds
of sale of stock, plant and the sum provided for crop preparation, when it was
not entitled
to such funds under any of its securities.
<P>

674	The plaintiffs submit that the loss claimed in respect of the alleged sale
at undervalue of Gabo is a further natural and probable
consequence of the
other breaches of contract.  The submission is that had NRS and Durhambone been
sold for proper value, there would
have been no extant Bank debt and hence Gabo
would not have had to be sold.
<P>

675	As to the U-Bix transaction, the plaintiffs accept that there are real
issues as to the quantum of loss suffered which are dependent
upon
considerations of when and under what circumstances Mr Paola would have sold
the U-Bix shares, but submit that the Court ought
find, without difficulty,
that Mr Paola genuinely wished to acquire those shares, and was prevented from
so doing by the refusal
of the Bank to release the A$390,000 from the proceeds
of sale from Durhambone, its plant, equipment and the payment for crop
preparation.
<P>

676	Ultimately, the plaintiffs' submission is that much of the Bank's stance in
the case is based upon a `confess and avoid' approach
to the case, in
circumstances where the Bank did not purport to actually avoid liability to the
plaintiffs.
<P>

	<b>Overview of the Defendant's Submissions</b>
<P>

677	The defendant's submissions were in summary as follows:
<P>

	1.	The actions of the Bank did not constitute breaches of the agreement.
<P>

	2.	There were, in any event, events of default by the plaintiffs entitling the
Bank to take the actions that it did.
<P>

	3.	Those actions did not, in any event, cause the losses complained of:
<P>

	(i)	Mr Paola had decided to sell NRS and Durhambone before the Bank's action
and had in fact already had them on the market for
some time.
<P>

	(ii)	The purpose of their sale was to raise funds to:
<P>

	(a)	service the Bank debt;
<P>

	(b)	reduce the Bank debt to $7.5 million by the end of May as was required by
the agreement;  and
<P>

	(c)	make further significant reductions to the Bank debt.
<P>

	(iii)	NRS and Durhambone would have been sold in any event at about the times
they were sold and for the amounts for which they
were sold.
<P>

	(iv)	Any loss on the sale of Gabo is too remote and is, in any event, the
result of the plaintiffs' not having accepted an offer
to purchase that
property made in February 1991.
<P>

	4.	Any loss in relation to the sale of the NRS business was incurred by NRS
not by either of the plaintiffs and so is not recoverable
in these
proceedings.
<P>

	5.	Any loss on Durhambone was released by the plaintiffs in the deed of
release.
<P>

	6.	The loss of profits on the U-Bix shares is not recoverable:
<P>

	(i)	The Bank was contractually entitled to refuse to release the $390,000.
<P>

	(ii)	The plaintiffs, in any event, released the Bank from any liability by
deed and there was no economic duress exerted on the
plaintiffs when they did
so.
<P>

	(iii)	The evidence does not show that the refusal by the Bank to finance the
purchase of the shares caused the plaintiffs to be
unable to purchase the
shares.
<P>

	(iv)	Currabubula Holdings had no beneficial interest in the company which was
to purchase the shares:  of the 100 issued shares
in that company, one was held
by Currabubula Holdings on trust for Paola Holdings and the remaining 99 were
held by Paola Holdings.
 Paola Holdings is statute barred in any claim it
makes.
<P>

	(v)	The claim is, in effect, a `loss of opportunity' claim where there is no
significant prospect that the profits claimed would
have been realised.
<P>

	(vi)	The loss of those profits was too remote to be recoverable.
<P>

	7.	The plaintiffs have no entitlement to maintain these proceedings as
representatives or trustees.
<P>

	8.	Currabubula Holdings has no entitlement to an estoppel or to equitable
compensation.
<P>

	9.	(i)	The material relied upon in relation to the defamatory cause of action
was not defamatory.
<P>

		(ii)	To the extent that the material was defamatory:
<P>

	(a)	It was not likely to cause the plaintiffs to suffer harm.
<P>

	(b)	It was published under qualified privilege.
<P>

	(c)	There was, in any event, publication to only five or six people and no
loss flowed from publication to them.
<P>

	(d)	Each statement was defamatory only of the company which owned the account
and, only Currabubula Holdings commenced proceedings
within the limitation
period and is therefore the only party which might be entitled to compensation
for defamation. . . .
<P>

	10.	The quantum claimed by the plaintiffs in respect of each item of loss
greatly exceeds any loss suffered.
<P>

678	The Bank addressed detailed submissions by way of a close examination of
the plaintiffs' cheque dishonour case.  It is convenient
to set these
submissions out.
<P>

	<b>Close Examination of the Plaintiff's Cheque Dishonour Case</b>
<P>

679	The Bank submitted that immediate attention requires to be paid to the
precise breaches of the facility agreement pleaded by
the plaintiffs.  As
already noted, there are two such categories of breach relating to cheque
dishonours, namely:
<P>

	(a)	On 16 February 1990, the dishonouring of cheques presented on 15
February.
<P>

	(b)	Following 17 February 1990, the dishonouring of further cheques listed on
the further amended summons.
<P>

	<b>The Bank's answers to the First Category of Schedule 1 Dishonoured Items,
namely those presented on 15 February1990</b>
<P>

680	As to the first category of breach dealing with dishonour of cheques
presented on 15 February 1990 and dishonoured on 16 February
1990, the Bank
pointed out that the plaintiffs in final submissions do not assert that on 15
February they had sufficient funds to
pay such cheques.  In short, the
plaintiffs accepted that the Bank was not obliged to honour those cheques as
the plaintiffs were
then overdrawn.   [See plaintiffs' submissions para 22
essentially accepting Mr Holgate's schedules].
<P>

681	The Bank submitted that the summons commencing the proceedings filed on 23
December 1995 had in the first part of Schedule 1,
identified approximately 79
cheques totalling $178,200 said to have been dishonoured but presented on 13
February 1990, 14 February
1990 or 15 February 1990.  The Bank submitted that
the amended summons upon which the plaintiffs ultimately moved at the
commencement
of the hearing had removed many of those items from the first part
of Schedule 1, so that the only cheques presented on 15 February
1990 and
dishonoured on 16 February 1990, which remained the subject of the plaintiffs'
claim, were some 28 cheques totalling $75,012.87.
 Hence the Bank submitted
that in respect of approximately 48 such cheques presented on or before 15
February 1990 and not honoured,
no complaint was pressed.  Whilst my count does
not agree with the Bank's count, the schedules do clearly make the point that a
number
of cheques which were presented on at least 13 and 14 February are
recognised by the plaintiffs as having been dishonoured and are
cheques in
respect of which no remaining claim is pressed.  As earlier pointed out, a
number of these cheques were held back.
<P>

682	Mr Macfarlan QC for the Bank made plain that the Bank accepted, for the
purposes of the proceedings, that from 22 February 1990
the facility was not
overdrawn.  That was not, however, on his submissions to say that thereafter
cheques could have been drawn on
the Number One accounts.  Mr Macfarlan's
submission was that cheques could not thereafter be drawn on the Number One
accounts because
those accounts had been rendered inoperative either by the
Bank's letter making plain that the Number One accounts had been frozen,
or as
a result of a consensual arrangement.
<P>

683	On Mr Macfarlan's submissions, it was thus permissible for the Bank to
decline to pay items drawn on the Number One account
on and after 22 February
1990.
<P>

684	In opening submissions it appeared that the question of fact presented,
would require consideration of a banker's duty to pay
customer's cheques in the
order of presentation, where a number of cheques are presented
simultaneously.
<P>

685	In Weerasooria, <i>Banking Law and the Financial System in Australia</i>,
at paragraphs 21.78-79, the matter is put as follows:
<P>

	<i>`In the absence of specific instructions to the contrary, a banker is under
a duty to pay a customer's cheques in the order in which
they are presented,
whether by post or otherwise.  If two cheques are presented simultaneously, for
example, by the same mail or
through the same clearing and there are only funds
sufficient to pay one, it is doubtful whether both may be returned.
Unnecessary
damage would be caused to the customer's credit if both are
returned.  Nevertheless, it is hard to say which is the preferable course
but
the smaller the amount of the cheque, the greater may be the damage to the
customer's credit:  Halsbury, 4th ed, vol 3, para
52.  The better opinion seems
to be that the banker should pay as far as possible:  Paget, p 301.</i>
<P>

<i>	Lord Chorley seems to agree with Paget when he states that no rule has been
established by the courts for dealing with the practical
problem of
simultaneous presentation of cheques, and it does not appear that any settled
practice is followed by the banks.  `Clearly,
any cheques for sums greater than
the balance can be disregarded, and in dealing with the others, probably the
simplest plan is to
pay them in the order they come to hand until there are not
sufficient funds to pay the smallest one left.  In the event of the customer
complaining, the banker could possibly contend that as his instructions were
ambiguous he was entitled to exercise a reasonable discretion':
 Chorley, p 72;
Westminster Bank Ltd v Hilton  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281926%29%2043%20TLR%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1926) 43 TLR 124.</a></i>
<P>

<i>	A bank is, however, not entitled to dishonour cheques already presented
because it knows of others to be presented shortly, unless
it was so acting on
the special instructions of the customer.  In Sednaoui Zariffa Nahas &amp; Co v
Anglo-Austrian Bank (1909) JIB
Vol XXX p 413, cheques presented for payment to
the defendant bank were marked `effects not cleared - please present again'.
The
bank contended that it was justified in refusing payment because it had
been advised of a number of cheques to be presented and it
did not have
sufficient funds to meet all of them and it was therefore entitled, without
paying any of them, to ask the holders to
re-present them.</i>
<P>

<i>	It appeared that on the day when the cheques were presented the bank had
sufficient funds to pay one or more of them but not all
of them.  It was held
that the bank was liable in damages since it had a duty to honour the first
cheque presented which was within
the amount of the funds in the bank:  see
also Caldwell v Merchants Bank of Canada  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%2026%20CP%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 26 CP 294.'</a></i>
<P>

686	Ultimately in the way the case was presented by the plaintiff, no
submissions which descended to this form of detail appear
to have been pressed,
the plaintiff being content to leave the matter resting with the defendant's
acceptance that from 22 February
1990, the facility was not overdrawn.
<P>

687	As earlier noted, the Bank admitted that on 16 February 1990, it
dishonoured cheques referred to in the amended summons Schedule
1 which were
presented to the Bank on 15 February 1997.  [Defence paragraph 14]
<P>

688	In contradistinction to the above described admission of dishonour, the
Bank admitted that between 16 February 1990 and 12 April
1990, it failed to pay
from the Number One accounts upon which they had been drawn, items identified
in Schedule 1 to the amended
summons.  That failure to pay cheques so presented
between those dates was put as not amounting to a dishonour.  [Defence
paragraph
18]
<P>

689	A number of schedules were relied upon by Mr Ryan and by Mr Macfarlan to
explain the position which obtained with respect to
presentation of the
relevant cheques, and the honouring or dishonouring of those cheques, generally
during the period between approximately
28 January 1990 and the end of March
1990.
<P>

690	Mr Holgate's statement included as schedules, certain flow charts which he
had prepared.  Annexure `B' to his statement recorded
the daily net balances in
terms of the actual position in the real world with items which had been
regarded as dishonoured.
<P>

691	It is apparent from Schedule `B to Mr Holgate's statement, that the
balances, taking into account a recognition of dishonoured
items, were as
follows:
<P>

	12 February 1990 - $8,518,348.43
<P>

<i>	</i>13 February 1990 - $8,576,773.16
<P>

<i>	</i>14 February 1990 - $8,535,577.18
<P>

<i>	</i>15 February 1990 - $8,522,619.95
<P>

<i>	</i>16 February 1990 - $8,432,724.48
<P>

<i>	</i>17 February 1990 - $8,432,724.48
<P>

<i>	</i>18 February 1990 - $8,432,724.48
<P>

<i>	</i>19 February 1990 - $8,381,813.55
<P>

<i>	</i>20 February 1990 - $8,334,485.50
<P>

<i>	</i>21 February 1990 - $8,311,705.25
<P>

<i>	</i>22 February 1990 - $8,271,271.27
<P>

<i>	</i>23 February 1990 - $8,079,501.74
<P>

<i>	</i>24 February 1990 - $7,982,230.78
<P>

<i>	</i>25 February 1990 - $7,982,230.78
<P>

<i>	</i>26 February 1990 - $7,780,046.69
<P>

<i>	</i>27 February 1990 - $7,893,807.37
<P>

<i>	</i>28 February 1990 - $7,858,608.15
<P>

<i>	</i>. . . 
<P>

<i>	</i>7 March 1990 - $6,539,533.78
<P>

<i>	</i>8 March 1990 - $1,124,975.24
<P>

<i>	</i>. . . 
<P>

<i>	</i>31 March 1990 - $1,107,690.05
<P>

692	The total of these balances shown on Annexure `B' to Mr Holgate's statement
reflects the fact that drawings by way of cheques
(and to some extent bank
authorities) were rejected to ensure that the limit remained below $8.5
million.
<P>

693	The above description of these balances shows that cheques were
dishonoured.  Hence the balances ran down.  Some reductions
occurred because
there were credits in the Number Two accounts.
<P>

694	The reduction as between 7 March 1990 and 8 March 1990, occurred by reason
of the $7million conversion of part of the facility
to a term loan.
<P>

695	Annexure `D' to Mr Holgate's statement shows detail of the Number One and
Number Two accounts.  Schedule `D' was a reworked
schedule, again dealing with
daily net balances but now doing so on the basis that the cheques and bank
authorities which had been
reversed by the Bank had been met by the Bank on
presentation.  In short, Schedule `D' includes reference to both the Number One
and Number Two accounts and assumes that the dishonoured items had in fact been
paid.  The balances in the total column for 12 February
through to 25 February
are as follows:
<P>

	12 February  - $8,525,810.52
<P>

<i>	</i>13 February - $8,584,518.25
<P>

<i>	</i>14 February - $8,616,425.07
<P>

<i>	</i>15 February - $8,632,319.57
<P>

<i>	</i>16 February - $8,629,228.63
<P>

<i>	</i>17 February -  $8,629,228.63
<P>

<i>	</i>18 February - $8,629,228.63
<P>

<i>	</i>19 February - $8,598,927.47
<P>

<i>	</i>20 February - $8,562,238.87
<P>

<i>	</i>21 February - $8,547,989.72
<P>

<i>	</i>22 February - $8,511,379.32
<P>

<i>	</i>23 February - $8,321,346.57
<P>

<i>	</i>24 February - $8,197,527.87
<P>

<i>	</i>25 February - $8,197,527.87
<P>

696	The same balances then show that dishonours did take place on 13 and 14
February.
<P>

697	Those balances show that had cheques been honoured, the balances on 23
February would have been $8,321,346.57.
<P>

698	On the basis of this schedule, the Bank asserts that if the cheques had all
been paid, there would have been an excess over
the facility limit up until 22
February and hence that the Bank was contractually entitled to dishonour
cheques to the extent of
the excess up to that date.
<P>

699	Annexure `D' to Mr Holgate's statement also records the occasion of the
$7million conversion to the term loan earlier referred
to and referred to.
<P>

700	Hence, one can use Annexure `D' to Mr Holgate's statement to see what the
position was in the Number One accounts and the Number
Two accounts in globo.
The total draw down reduces to below $8.5 million principally due to credits
accumulating in the Number Two
accounts.
<P>

701	The Bank further relied upon Exhibit D36 which records total balances for
the period 13 February 1990 to 6 March 1990 and is
a reworking of Mr Holgate's
Annexure `B'.  Exhibit D36 groups the Number One and the Number Two accounts
which contribute to the
total.  This exhibit is in the following terms:
<P>

<P>

<b><i>NOTE:</i></b><i>    There are no statements for account numbers 582 690
18100 and 560 100 92201 after 23 February 1990.  As at that date the accounts
were in debit for respectively ($49,013.03) and ($48,257.93).  In his total of
the daily net balances (annexure B) Mr Holgate has
assumed that without any
statements to work from, these debit balances were reduced to zero as and from
24 February 1990.  In fact
the evidence is that they remained at or about the
debit levels recorded as at 23 February 1990 until 7 March 1990 when the debit
balances were reduced to zero at the time of the term loan restructuring (see
annexure F to Mr Holgate's statement).'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

702	The first entry in the Number One account debit column of 13 February 1990
shows that the $8.5 million had been drawn.  The
Bank asserts that it permitted
the Paola Group, if it had any more money coming in, to draw it back by putting
it into the Number
Two accounts.  The Bank asserts that the facility had more
to it than the overdraft limits and refers to the request a few weeks
thereafter to exercise one of the options, that is term loan which was given
effect to.  What the Bank accepts is that there was
a freezing of operations on
accounts drawn on the Number One accounts to $8.5 million.
<P>

703	It will be seen from Exhibit D36, together with Exhibit PX 1230, and also
from page 4 of Annexure `A' to Mr Holgate's statement,
that on 15th and 16th
February, deposits of two separate amounts of $50,000 each to ABE Fax's account
occurred.  Taking into account
that the relevant figures in the `Debits Number
One Account' column of Exhibit D36 for 15 and 16 February also show debits, the
reason
for reduction of the balance in the Number One accounts debit column
from 15 February 1990 of $8,525,266.11 through to 16 February
1990 of
$8,482,757.70, being largely attributable to those two deposits.
<P>

704	The only other occasion when Exhibit D36 records a significant deposit into
the Number One accounts is as between 4 March 1990
when the balance is
$8,437,084.47 and 5 March 1990 when the balance becomes $8,263,521.04.  This is
attributable to the amount of
$178,634 being deposited into the Number One
accounts - see Exhibit PX 1210.  As earlier noted, at the Companies' requests
this figure
was transferred across to the Number Two accounts and that is why
the debits in the `Number One Account' column for MFI S3 returns
on 6 March
1992, to approximately the 4 March 1990 balance.
<P>

705	The Bank relies upon the balances in the Number Two accounts shown on
Exhibit D36 as increasing quite steadily through to 6
March 1990.  The Bank
asserts that all the money to the credit of the Number Two accounts were
available to be drawn on by Mr Paola
or his Group, for example, to pay NRS
suppliers COD, which the Bank asserts may have quickly restored any damage to
NRS's reputation.
<P>

706	The Bank asserts that when one looks at Exhibit D36 in the Number One
accounts, it is clear why there were fluctuations and
why they got to below
$8.5 million.  The maximum amount below the $8.5 million, apart from the 4 and
5 March deposits, show that
by and large the balance did not come down more
than about $60,000 or $70,000 below the $8.5 million figure.  That reduction of
some
$60,000 or $70,000 below the $8.5 million figure is attributable on the
Bank's case, to the two $50,000 deposits to ABE Fax.
<P>

707	On the Bank's case, the evidence proves that at the request of the company,
the Bank readily transferred to the Number Two accounts,
moneys deposited to
the Number One accounts, there being on the Bank's case, no suggestion in the
evidence of any request by the
customers to transfer the two $50,000 deposits
of ABE Fax into the Number Two accounts.  This was, Mr Macfarlan said, because
the
companies had substantial amounts in the Number Two accounts.
<P>

708	ABE Fax had never opened a Number Two account.  Its account had been frozen
for some time.  Mr Macfarlan also pointed out that
the ABE Fax receipts of
$50,000 were not treated by the Bank or customer as permanent reductions.  He
relied upon one of the letters
as showing the Bank still treated the full $8.5
million as available [PX 1217 dealing with the $7million and $1.5 million
segmentation,
of what was recognised by the Bank then as a continuing $8.5
million facility].
<P>

709	In support of the proposition that Mr Paola believed throughout 1990 that
the facility was still available, and of the further
proposition that Mr Paola
could have utilised balances standing in the Number Two accounts to pay
suppliers and for other business
purposes, Mr Macfarlan relied upon
cross-examination of Mr Paola at pages 156 to 158.   This was inter alia to the
following effect:
<P>

	<i>`. . . Q. . . .	the question I want to put to you is to suggest to you that
as at the beginning of March 1990, and in fact throughout
1990, you believed
that the facility described in the letter of 1 February 1990 from the Bank was
available to your group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I believe so yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Then 1210 please in the bundle.  Do you recall that there was a deposit
made to the account of Currabubula that had been in existence
for some time
which was the subject of a request for a transfer to the Number Two account,
the new account at Currabubula?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I recall that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that request was complied with?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes it was.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood that if there were any such deposits to the old
accounts then it was open to your group to contact the Bank
and arrange for
their transfer to the new ones?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yeah, with some difficulty.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well there wasn't any difficulty in having this transfer effected, was
there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There was some difficulty, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What was the difficulty?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh several arguments on the phone.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It was done immediately the request was made in writing wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was done once the request was put in writing yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And 1218 of the bundle, do you recall that a further request for
transfers were made as indicated in this letter?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And 1219 is an example of the same situation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Mr Paola, there came to be in the weeks and months following the middle
of February substantial credits in the new account, is
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And to some extent those credits were drawn against, correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The new accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The Number Two accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And to some extent substantial credit funds remained in the
accounts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Which could have been drawn against by your company - by your
group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, naturally.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And if you'd look at 1257 please.  Was there a point in time at which
you requested a bank balance for various accounts?  Do you
remember this
memorandum?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I remember this yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you were supplied with information such as is in the following
pages;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And in particular 1260 was information concerning the Northern Rural
Services account, correct?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yeah, this is - yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And do you remember the position in respect of the Northern Rural
Services accounts was that before the events of mid-February
there were four
accounts - one in respect of each of the four branches?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that after, or from mid-February, there came to be just a single No.
2 account?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you were informed in April when you made this request that there was
a $230,000-odd credit in the No. 2 account?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh, well, if it's here, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that could have been utilised for such business purposes of NRS as
you thought appropriate?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And if you wished to cause suppliers for NRS to be purchased on a C.O.D.
basis, funds were there to enable that to be done?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	When?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well let's take this date as an example;  as at about 17 April?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	May I suggest to you that one consideration that was playing on your
mind was a desire not to increase the overall debt owing
the bank any more than
was absolutely necessary because of the very high interest rates that were
applicable?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There had to be a surplus in those accounts to accommodate interest.  If
I recall correctly there was substantial interest payments
that had to be
made.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well what was the approximate amount of the overall monthly interest
payable?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Something around $120,000 or thereabouts . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	For the whole group?</i>
<P>

710	<i>A.	For the whole group yes . .</i> .'     [T 157-158]
<P>

	<b>The Bank's Answers to the Second Category of Schedule 1 Dishonoured Items
namely those presented between 16 February 1990 and 12 April
1990</b>
<P>

711	The Bank furnished six alternative responses in submission to the
plaintiffs' case in respect of the second category in Schedule
1 of the summons
of cheques presented [including Bank authorities] on presentation dates from 16
February 1990 to 12 April 1990.
 These submissions in point form were as
follows:
<P>

	<cite>Point 1</cite>
<P>

<i>	</i>If the subject items had been paid, at least up to 22 February 1990,
the facility would have been exceeded.  There was then a simple
justification
in the Bank for not paying those cheques or items.
<P>

	<cite>Point 2</cite>
<P>

<i>	</i>Those cheques were drawn on the Number One account.  The Bank asserts
that it was perfectly entitled to freeze those accounts and
did so by its
letter.  Alternatively, the Bank asserts that the Number One accounts were no
longer able to be used as a result of
a consensual arrangement of 15 February,
reached between the plaintiffs and the Bank.  The Bank also refers to the fact
that in so
far as the Moree, Gunnedah and Narrabri NRS accounts were concerned,
the company had said that the accounts were no longer required.
<P>

	<cite>Point 3</cite>
<P>

<i>	</i>In relation to this particular category of cheques, there was no
dishonour in relation to a number of them because they were paid
from the
Number Two accounts.  Here Mr Macfarlan accepted that the strength of the
submission varied considerably depending on how
soon after the reversal from
the Number One account, payment occurred from the Number Two account.  The
submission is strong where
the payment occurred on the same or the following
day.  In short, if there was, for example, a six week period which passed
between
the two events, the Court may infer dishonour on day one and that the
cheque went back to the supplier who complained and that the
plaintiffs then
provided a new cheque which was paid from the Number Two account.  Hence the
focus is on just how soon after the
reversal from the Number One account one
can find a payment taking place from the Number Two accounts.  It was accepted
by both parties
that an inherent part of a dishonour involves the Bank
communicating to someone that an item is not to be paid - [see Section 69
of
the <i>Cheques and Payments Orders Act</i> <i>1986 (Com)]</i> which
provides:
<P>

<i>	`A cheque is dishonoured if the cheque is duly presented for payment and
payment is refused by the drawee institution, being a refusal
that is
communicated by the drawee institution to the holder or the person who
presented the cheque on the holder's behalf.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The Schedule conveniently prepared by the plaintiffs appearing on the
4th, 3rd and 2nd last pages of the plaintiffs' written submissions,
lists the
plaintiffs' cheques and bank authorities reversed in Number One accounts on or
after 16 February 1990 but paid from NRS's
Tamworth Number Two account.  From
that schedule it is clear that bank authorities or cheques reversed in the
Number One account
but paid on the same day or on the following day from the
Number Two account, are to be located in the reversal entries for 1 March
1990,
19 February 1990, 20 February 1990, 21 February 1990, 8 March 1990, 15 March
1990, 13 March 1990 and 21 February 1990.
<P>

	<i>Point 4</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The Bank's next submission was that the Schedule Exhibit D35 records,
many of the items from 1 March through to 5 June involved bank
authorities.  It
cannot be assumed so the Bank submitted, that this involved any communication
to the customer because, of its nature,
there is nothing which the payee
presents to the Bank seeking payment to the customer where a bank authority is
involved.  The bank
authority is simply a standing arrangement in respect of
which the most that could be inferred, even where there was a lapse of time
between non-payment from the Number One account and payment from the Number Two
account, was that the payee just would not receive
the money in the meantime.
The Bank submitted that one cannot infer a communication from the Bank in that
instance by way of saying
something adverse to the financial standing of the
drawer of the cheque.
<P>

	<i>Point 5</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The Bank's fifth submission was that in the absence of any evidence as
to what answers were communicated where cheques were dishonoured,
to the extent
to which any such communications did take place, the Court could only assume
that an accurate answer would have been
given.  The accurate answer which the
Bank suggested would have been given would have been to the effect that the
account in question
was no longer operative.  In short, all items having been
drawn on the Number One accounts, such an answer would have been entirely
accurate and so the Bank submitted, would not have reflected on the Company's
financial standing.  Here again the Bank points out
that on 15 February for
example, the company said that the accounts from Moree, Narrabri and Gunnedah
were no longer operative.
<P>

	Mr Ryan had given certain references in the evidence to statements concerning
answers given.  Those references were Exhibit PX
Volume 4 pages 1282 and 1283.5
and Exhibit 4 page 1289.7.
<P>

	Mr Macfarlan pointed out that these references were to answers given when
cheques were much later drawn on the Number Two account
at a time when those
accounts were overdrawn.  Hence the answer there would have been in all
likelihood `present again' or something
similar.  Those answers, so Mr
Macfarlan submitted, did not then shed any light on what was said when cheques
in the second part
of Schedule 1 to the summons were not honoured. 
<P>

	I accept that the reference on Exhibit PX Volume 4 page 1283 to cheques having
been returned marked `present again' is in all likelihood
referable back to the
same volume at page 1281 where the Number Two accounts are referred to.  And in
the case of Exhibit PX Volume
4 page 1289, the reference to the return by the
Bank of a cheque `present again' clearly also refers to the Number Two
accounts.
<P>

	<cite>Point 6</cite>
<P>

<i>	</i>The sixth answer in the Bank's submission was that there is no evidence
as to who the payees of the cheques or bank authorities may
have been and in
that circumstance, those may have concerned inter-company payments or payments
to persons from out of town, the
amounts often being very small items and there
being very few of them compared to the vast numbers dishonoured on
approximately 15
February.  In short, the evidence of suppliers telephoning the
office was, Mr Macfarlan submitted, highly consistent with the dishonours
occurring on or about 15 February rather than the smaller and much later
amounts.
<P>

	<b>Dealing with the Case in Contract</b>
<P>

712	The plaintiffs' case in contract requires a close examination of both the
express and implied terms of the subject contract.
 In so far as each alleged
breach of contract is concerned, this requires a close investigation into the
precise circumstances which
obtained in or around 15 February 1990 and during
the ensuing days on the subject of loss.
<P>

713	It is convenient to proceed by initially turning to the subject
contract.
<P>

	<b>The Contract</b>
<P>

<b>	</b><u>The Parties</u>
<P>

714	The parties to the contract were the Bank, the eleven named borrower
companies referred to in the Bank's Facility Letter of
1 February 1990 and the
three named guarantors referred to in that letter.
<P>

	<u>Express Terms</u>
<P>

715	It is common ground that the express terms of the contract constituting the
Facility Agreement are to be found in the Facility
Letter of 1 February 1990
which incorporates the terms and conditions set out in the earlier Facility
Letters of 4 September 1987
and 18 November 1988, save to the extent that those
terms and conditions were inconsistent with the terms of the 1 February 1990
letter.  In the event of and to the extent of any such inconsistency, the terms
of the 1 February 1990 letter are to apply.
<P>

	<u>The Proper Construction of the Three Facility Letters</u>
<P>

716	The identification of the terms of the three facility letters has to be
made in the light of the objective facts and surrounding
circumstances known to
both of the contracting parties.  It is here important to bear in mind the
words of Lord Wilberforce in <i>Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen - Tangen
(trading as HE Hansen Tangen)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20WLR%20989" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 WLR 989.</a>  He said at 995:
<P>

	<i>`No contracts are made in a vacuum;  there is always a setting in which
they have to be placed.  The nature of what is legitimate
to have regard to is
usually described as the "surrounding circumstances" but this phrase is
imprecise;  it can be illustrated but
hardly defined.  In a commercial context
it is certainly right that the Court should know the commercial purpose of the
contract
and this in turn presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the
transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties
are
operating.'</i>
<P>

717	Later, Lord Wilberforce added at 996:
<P>

	<i>`. . . it is often said that, in order to be admissible in aid of
construction, these extrinsic facts must be within the knowledge
of both
parties to the contract, but this requirement should not be stated in too
narrow a sense.  When one speaks of the intention
of the parties to the
contract, one is speaking objectively - the parties cannot themselves give
direct evidence of what their intention
was - and what must be ascertained is
what is to be taken as the intention which reasonable people would have had if
placed in the
situation of the parties.  Similarly when one is speaking of aim,
or object or commercial purpose, one is speaking objectively of
what reasonable
person would have had if placed in the situation of the parties.  It is in this
sense and not in the sense of constructive
notice or of estopping fact that
judges are found using words like "new or must be taken to have known" . .
.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Cf excerpts from these passages cited by Mason J in <i>Codelfa
Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a> at
350-351.
<P>

718	The three facility letters, properly construed in the light of the
objective facts and surrounding circumstances known to both
of the contracting
parties contain the following terms:
<P>

	<u>The Content of the Financial Accommodation</u>
<P>

719	The Bank was to make available a Multi Option Facility with a limit of $8.5
million, effectively increasing the $6.8 million
limit of an existing Multi
Option Facility.  The facility obliged the Bank to provide financial
accommodation totalling not more
than $8.5 million to such of the eleven Paola
Group Companies identified as borrowers and in such amounts and in such forms
(whether
commercial bill acceptance/discount or overdraft limit or fixed and
floating term loans or documentary letters of credit) as was
requested of it by
the Paola Group Companies.
<P>

	<u>Reduction in the Facility Limit</u>
<P>

720	The facility was to reduce to $7.5 million by 31 May 1990
<P>

	<u>Review of the Facility</u>
<P>

721	The facility was subject to a review immediately financial accounts for the
Paola Group Companies for the half year ended 31
December 1989 became
available, such review to be completed by 31 March 1990.
<P>

722	An immediate review of the facility was to be conducted in the event of a
material adverse change in the financial condition
of any of the Paola Group
Companies.
<P>

	<u>Cancellation of Facilities and/or Declaration that Facility Immediately Due
and Payable</u>
<P>

723	The Bank was entitled by notice in writing to the Paola Group Companies to
declare that the facilities may be cancelled forthwith
and/or to declare the
facilities immediately due and payable together with all interest accrued
thereon and all other amounts payable
thereunder if any of the eight events of
default specified in the letter of 4 September 1987 occurred and were
continuing (the last
of which events was any circumstances arising which give
reasonable grounds in the opinion of the Bank that there has been a material
adverse change in the financial condition of the Paola Group Companies).
<P>

	<u>Fees</u>
<P>

724	The Paola Group of Companies promised to pay the fees specified in the
letter of 1 February 1990 and the Bank's legal fees.
<P>

	<u>Liability of Group Companies for Moneys Advanced to Other Group
Companies</u>
<P>

725	Each of the Paola Group Companies (other than ABE Fax and Automated
Business Equipment Pty Limited) agreed to be responsible
to the Bank for a
payment of all moneys advanced to any of the Paola Group Companies under the
Facility Agreement.
<P>

	<u>Securities</u>
<P>

726	The Paola Group Companies promised to provide securities already in place
which were specified in the annexure to the 1 February
1990 letter.
<P>

	<u>Duration of Facility</u>
<P>

727	Subject to the reduction of the facility to $7.5 million by 31 May 1990,
the facility was to continue:
<P>

	(a)	Until cancelled by notice in writing given by the Bank to the borrowers
upon the occurrence of one or more of the events of
default specified in the 4
September 1987 Facility Letter.
<P>

	(b)	Until terminated by agreement between the parties.
<P>

	(c)	Until terminated by operation of law.
<P>

728	Outside of cancellation by notice following the occurrence of an event of
default, the facilities were neither repayable on
demand nor repayable on
reasonable notice.
<P>

729	The position may be contrasted with the January 1984 facility which was
expressly stated as covering a 2-year term [PX 1/17],
and with the February
1984 `come and go' overdraft which expressly provided `the loan, being by way
of overdraft, is payable on demand
. . .' [PX 1.26].
<P>

730	The 4 September 1987 letter did contain a subheading `Term', but the only
words thereunder were `facilities to be reviewed 31
December 1987 to establish
suitable reduction conditions'.  To my mind, this is inconsistent with the
facilities being on demand.
 Indeed I accept the plaintiffs' submission that
the presence in the letter of events of default and detailed provisions
relating
to the Bank's power to terminate the facility on the occurrence of the
same is inconsistent with the facility being on demand.
<P>

731	The 22 March 1988 letter also referred to `term', but then simply continued
`review of 6-monthly cash flow projections by 30
June 1988 to determine future
requirements - annual review - next due 31 December 1988'.  [PX 1/137]
<P>

732	The 18 November 1988 letter was silent as to the term of the increased
facilities [PX 1/188].
<P>

733	The 6 February 1989 letter [PX 1/241] contained a section headed `Term' [PX
1/243].  It provided for annual review of the facilities,
a review of proposed
security arrangements and `immediate review in the event of a material adverse
change in the financial condition
of ABE Holdings Limited and subsidiaries,
Paola Holdings Pty Limited or Currabubula Holdings Pty Limited, or of
shareholders therein'.
 The letter importantly did provide for a fixed term for
one part of the facilities, namely a $113,000 guarantee facility provided
to
Paola.  [PX 1/241 and 1/243]  This makes it clear it seems to me that the
remaining facilities were not on demand.
<P>

734	The 22 September 1989 letter made no reference to `term' at all.  It did
include a section headed `Review' which read: `All
facilities to be subject to
annual review next due by 31 October 1990 or earlier on availability of audited
financial accounts of
the Group.  Immediately review in the event of a material
adverse change in the financial condition or change in ownership of the
Group.
<P>

735	The 1 February 1990 facility letter also made no reference to `term'.
However, the letter did require a reduction in the multi-option
facility limit,
to $7.5 million, by 31 May 1990.  This is inconsistent with the facility being
on demand, as was the customer's option
to choose a variety of funding
instruments, including term loans [PX 3.1047], bill facilities [PX 3/1047 and
3/1049], and the reference,
under `TENOR' to the fact that `fixed rate drawings
may be drawn for a maximum term of two years'.  [PX 3/1049]
<P>

736	Mr Macfarlan submitted that the words `immediate review is to be conducted
in the event of a material adverse change in the
financial condition or change
in ownership of any of the companies comprising the borrower', properly
construed gave the Bank an
entitlement to peremptorily and without notice
withdraw the facility upon the happening of such material adverse change.
<P>

737	I reject that submission as without substance.
<P>

738	On one view, it might be possible to read into the sentence a term which
would, upon the occurrence of a material change of
the character described,
entitle the Bank to conduct an immediate review, following which the Bank might
have the right:
<P>

	(a)	To seek to renegotiate aspects of the facility.
<P>

	(b)	If such renegotiation proved abortive:
<P>

	(i)	to then transform the facility into a facility with a defined term, or
<P>

	(ii)	to terminate the facility on reasonable notice.
<P>

739	To my mind, the sentence does not permit of any such radical surgery or
reconstruction.  The construction of the sentence has
to be carried out in a
context which takes into account all the parts of the document importantly
including:
<P>

	(a)	That the events of default include `any circumstances arising which give
reasonable grounds in the opinion of the Bank that
there has been a material
adverse change in the financial condition of the borrowers'.
<P>

	(b)	That upon the happening of such an event of default the Bank was entitled
by notice to declare the facilities as cancelled
forthwith or as immediately
due and payable.
<P>

740	The Bank's power to conduct an immediate review is likely to have been seen
by the parties as a simple precursor to the Banks,
having first satisfied
itself on such review of its entitlement to do so, then exercising its said
rights to declare the facilities
cancelled or immediately due and payable.
<P>

	<u>Event of Default - Default by Whom?</u>
<P>

741	A question arises as to whether an event of default under the agreement
would occur when any of the circumstances defined as
`events of default' in the
letter of 4 September 1987 applied:
<P>

(a)	To any one of the borrower companies;  or
<P>

	(b)	To all of the companies;  or
<P>

	(c)	To the Group as a whole.
<P>

742	Submissions were advanced by the plaintiffs in support of the proposition
that the relationship between the Bank and the Paola
Group Companies was a
group relationship by which, whilst facilities in set sums were listed for
companies in the group, the Bank
agreed to provide those facilities `for the
group'.  Emphasis was placed in support of this submission upon the Bank's
early attempts
to persuade Mr Paola that the companies might be better off with
separate facilities, which proposition he did not accept.  [1/1173;
T 423.17;
plaintiffs' submissions para 52]
<P>

743	The Bank submitted that the parties to the agreement were the Bank and the
several Paola companies identified in the 1 February
1990 letter as
`borrowers', each of those companies having individually executed the Notice of
Acceptance.
<P>

744	This is not the first case in which difficulties have been encountered on
the question of whether or not companies should appropriately
be regarded as a
single group.  In <i>Wimborne v Brien</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2023%20ACSR%20576" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 23 ACSR 576</a>, one of the
parties argued that the liquidator should treat various companies, because of
their interlocking and related ownership,
as essentially a single entity and
that it did not matter which assets or liabilities were in which company.  In
rejecting that approach
the New South Wales Court of Appeal said:
<P>

	<i>`However to treat the companies as a single group without regard to their
separate assets and liabilities would have breached a fundamental
concept of
company law - namely that except in respect of limited statutory exceptions . .
.there is no such thing as a "group" and
each company must be treated as a
separate entity . . . and it was the duty of the liquidator of (one group
company) to have regard
only to its interests being the interests of its
shareholders and its creditors as such'.</i>

was) at 6 said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`To speak of the companies as being members of a group is something of a
misnomer which may well have led his Honour into error. 
The word "group" is
generally applied to a number of companies which are associated by common or
interlocking shareholdings, allied
to unified control or capacity to control.
In such a case, the payment of money by company A to company B to enable
company B to
carry on its business may have derivative benefits for company A
as a shareholder in company B if that company is unable to trade
profitably or
realise its assets to advantage.  Even so, the transaction is one which must be
viewed from the standpoint of company
A and judged according to the criterion
of the interests of that company . . . The emphasis given by the primary judge
to the circumstance
that the group derived a benefit from the transaction
tended to obscure the fundamental principles that each of the companies was
a
separate and independent legal entity . . .  The creditor of a company whether
it be a member of a "group" of companies in the
accepted sense of that term or
not, must look to that company for payment.'</i>  [at 6 - 7 per Mason J]

Parliament considering whether the distinction between the law and
commercial
practice reflected in the above cases, should be maintained.
<P>

747	Of course, if applied inflexibly, the common law can have unsatisfactory
consequences in the context of groups:
<P>

	<i>`Company law possesses some curious features which may generate curious
results.  A parent company may sporn a number of subsidiary
companies, all
controlled directly or indirectly by the shareholders of the parent company.
If any of the subsidiary companies, to
change the metaphor, turns out to be the
runt of the litter and declines into insolvency to the dismay of its creditors
the parent
company and the other subsidiary companies may prosper to the joy of
the shareholders without any liability for the debts of the
insolvent
subsidiary.'</i>

<P>

748	None of this should serve to deflect from the clear necessity to have
regard to the surrounding circumstances setting in which
the subject contract
was made in the light of the objective facts and surrounding circumstances
known to both the contracting parties.
<P>

749	The acknowledgment by the parties in the 1 February 1990 letter that
pending an `amendment' to the facility agreement proposed
by which one
borrowing company was to represent the borrower, the facility agreement in
place was one entered into by the Bank `with
individual companies in the
Group', lends strong support to the conclusion to which I have come that upon
its proper construction
an event of default under the agreement occurred when
any of the circumstances defined as `events of default' in the letter of 4
September 1987 applied to any one of those companies.
<P>

750	It does not, however, follow that the individual companies in the Group
were not joint and several co-promisors in respect of
the indebtedness to the
Bank for all moneys advanced to any of the Group Companies.  In my view, the
individual Group Companies were
joint and several co-promisees in respect of
that indebtedness.
<P>

	<b>Standard Incidents of the Banker - Customer Contract</b>
<P>

751	It is axiomatic that in the case of a current account, `a bank is bound to
pay a customer's cheque drawn on such current account
in as much as the
relation of banker and customer as also that of debtor and creditor exists'.
[Cf <i>Dixon v Bank of New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281896%29%2017%20NSWLR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1896) 17 NSWLR 355</a> at 368.]  The
same position obtains where a facility agreement is in place which obliges the
Bank to pay a customer's cheque drawn
on a particular account up to the credit
limit the subject of the facility agreement
<P>

752	The Bank was obliged by an implied term of its contract with the Paola
Group to give reasonable notice in the event that it
determined to vary its
customary mode of providing general banking services, and in particular the
finance facility, to the Group.
 This obligation extended to any variations to
the accounts to be operated with the Bank.  The obligation embraced any
requirement
that overdraft facilities in place in relation to current accounts
would no longer be permitted to be drawn upon.  The obligation
embraced any
requirement that current accounts previously used for the operation of
overdraft facilities could only be operated in
reduction.  The obligation
embraced any requirement that the Group open new accounts.  In the case of a
determination by the Bank
to vary its customary mode of permitting operations
on the finance facility, the obligation to give reasonable notice implicitly
embraced a correlative obligation to be precise and accurate in communicating
what the variation involved and the effect, if any,
of the variation on the
continued operations of the facility.
<P>

753	Each of the five conditions necessary to ground the implication of a term
summarised by the majority in <i>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Hastings
Shire Council</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2052%20ALJR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 52 ALJR 20</a> at page 26 as repeated by Mason J in

337</a> at page 347 were satisfied.
<P>

754	In the case of a finance facility in place, it would be plain to a Bank
that it's customer's business relationships and other
dealings could well be
vitally affected by the Bank's tampering with the mechanics of the customer's
usual operations on the facility.
 Hence the special significance of precision
in the Bank's mode of communicating to the customer what a new regime would
entail and
whether it involved any suggestion of restricting or varying the
facility or of holding the position while the Bank determined whether
and if
so, in what way, to restrict or vary the facility itself.  Hence also the
special significance of directing such communications
to the customer [here a
corporate group of inter-related companies] at a level within the customer's
hierarchy commensurate with
the significance of what the Bank had determined
upon.
<P>

755	The obligation to give reasonable notice may be viewed as part of a general
contract which is basic to all transactions:
<P>

	<i>`The relationship of banker to customer is one of contract.  It consists of
a general contract, which is basic to all transactions,
together with special
contracts which arise only as they are brought into being in relation to
specific transactions or banking services.
 The essential distinction is
between obligations which come into existence upon the creation of the banker -
customer relationship
and obligations which are subsequently assumed by
specific agreement;  or, from the standpoint of the customer, between services
which a bank is obliged to provide, if asked, and services which bankers
habitually do, but are not bound to provide . . .'</i>  [Pagets Law of Banking
11th Edition, Butterworths 1996 edited by Mr Mark Hopgood at page 110]
<P>

	[Cf <i>Parras Holdings Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i>
[Unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 12 June 1998] where Davies J at page
34 makes the point that the grant of an overdraft facility
provides a
contractual relationship in the context of which moneys are lent by the banker
to the customer but that `there is more
to the relationship than the making of
a simple loan'.]
<P>

756	<i>Burnett v Westminster Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%201%20QB%20742" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 1 QB 742</a> provides an example
of a case where a bank was unsuccessful in its contention that a new practice
utilising the introduction of magnetic
ink characters seeking to restrict
cheques to the particular account for which they had been prepared, had been
consensually agreed
to by the customer.  The plaintiff had a cheque account at
the Borough Branch and drew a cheque on the cheque forms which had been
provided.  He crossed out the word `Borough' and put in `Bromley'.  He altered
the address and he initialled the cheque.  Later he
decided to stop payment on
the cheque, telephoning the Bromley Branch and informing them of this decision.
The cheque had passed
through the computer system which could not `read' the
alterations made by the plaintiff.  The cheque itself was forwarded to the
Borough Branch at which the employees were unaware of the stop-payment
instructions.  At the end of the suspense period, the amount
of the cheque was
debited to the plaintiff's account at the Borough Branch.
<P>

757	In an article by Robin Edwards entitled `The Rights of Banks to Contract
out of Common Law Liabilities Arising in the Banker/Customer
Relationship'
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2063%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 63 ALJ 237</a>, the author at 243 summarises what then occurred as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`The plaintiff sued the bank for acting without his authority and the
bank's defence was that the plaintiff had agreed to the restriction
appearing
on the cheque book.  The bank failed to prove that the customer had read the
restriction or signed anything accepting the
new conditions.  The court held
that cheque book covers had never been previously tested for the purpose of
spelling out contractual
terms and it was reasonable to assume that they
contained no contractual terms which varied the existing contractual
arrangements
between the customer and the banker.'</i>
<P>

758	The author expresses the view that if the account in that case had been a
new one, the bank's position may have been stronger,
but that it seems clear
that such conditions are only enforceable if it can be shown to have been
agreed upon at the time of opening
the account.
<P>

759	Obligations similar to that described above and also imported as part of
the banker - customer relationship would no doubt extend
to numerous matters
routinely the subject of banking business, such as the days and hours during
which business may be transacted,
the use of sundry standard authority and
other forms, the particular branches at which particular types of banking
transactions may
be conducted and the like.  In all these cases the contractual
relationship must be looked to in discerning the obligations of both
banker and
customer.
<P>

760	A convenient summary of the position is to be found in Weaver and
Craigie<i> `Banker and Customer'</i> 2nd ed., the Law Book Company, 1990 at
page 2514-2516 which is, inter alia, in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`The customer must also be taken to contract on the basis that both he and
his banker will observe and be bound by any relevant legislation
including in
particular the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/boea1909148/" class="autolink_findacts">Bills of Exchange Act 1909</a> (Cth) as amended from time to time,
and now, more relevantly, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/capoa1986268/" class="autolink_findacts">Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986</a> (Cth),
together with legislation or subordinate legislation dealing with such matters
as bank holidays and exchange control.</i>
<P>

<i>	In essence, therefore, it appears that the standard incidents of the
banker-customer contract are:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	The relationship is not one of trustee and cestui que trust:  Foley v

<i>	11.	The relationship between the parties presupposes that both will be

and a customer entered into in the ordinary course of the carrying on by the
banker
of the business of banking.'</i>
<P>

761	The Bank was plainly not obliged to honour cheques drawn beyond the limits
provided for by the facility.  That is not however,
to say that the Bank was
entitled to unilaterally vary the contract by refusing to permit the Group to
resume operations on its banking
accounts once it had deposited sufficient
funds to bring the credit facility back into place.
<P>

762	As I understood the submissions of Mr Macfarlan QC for the Bank, the Bank
asserts that a term is to be implied into the subject
contract that, providing
the Bank's requirements of a customer may be described as reasonable, standard
and `usual having regard
to normal banking procedures', the customer will be
obliged to comply with such requirements.  In support of this proposition the
Bank sought to draw upon statements in an article entitled `Insolvency' by J.
O'Donovan in 1987 <i>Companies and Securities Law Journal</i> page 50.  That
article deals generally with the subject of preferences and in particular the
entitlement of a preferred creditor,
following a liquidator's challenge to a
transaction as a preference, to invoke the so-called `protective provisions' in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 122(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</i> 1966</a> (Commonwealth).  That section
imposes upon the creditor the burden of proving the three conditions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
122(2)(a)</a>, namely that he took the benefit of the impugned transaction in good
faith, for valuable consideration, and in the ordinary course
of business.  The
article discusses closely the decision in <i>Kyra Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) v
National Australia Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20ACLC%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4 ACLC 400</a> the central question in
relation to which was whether the debtor company's state of mind was relevant
in determining whether a particular
transaction took place in the ordinary
course of business.
<P>

763	The article discusses, inter alia, whether or not the bank in the <i>Kyra
Nominees</i> case had discharged the burden of proving that it had received
payments in the ordinary course of business.
<P>

764	The author says inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`[Banks] may, . . . be able to protect themselves against the impact of the
Kyra Nominees case by changing the way in which they allow
an arguably
insolvent company to operate it's accounts.  As soon as a bank suspects that
one of its corporate customers might be
insolvent, it should require the
company to open a new current account.  All the companies receipts should then
be deposited in this
new account, which should always be maintained in credit.
The company could also be required to freeze its overdraft or loan account
. .
.'   </i>[At page 53]
<P>

765	No evidence was adduced proving that the practice and usage of bankers was
to approach a suspected insolvency of a customer
in the manner suggested by
O'Donovan.
<P>

766	The question of the steps which a bank is contractually entitled to take in
the event that it suspects that one of its corporate
customers might be
insolvent is by no means a simple one.  The matter may be dealt with by an
express term.  No such express term
was relied upon in the present proceedings.
Certainly the occurrence of a material event of default as defined in a
relevant contract
between the bank and its customer, will often give the bank,
as in the present case, the right by notice in writing to declare that
the
facilities are cancelled forthwith and/or to declare the facilities immediately
due and payable.  But absent the bank taking
such action and in the absence of
any express term dealing with such circumstances, the bank may only achieve a
variation of its
customary mode of providing general banking services or of
providing a particular finance facility to a customer or group, either
by
obtaining the customer's consensus to the proposed variation, or by giving
reasonable notice of the bank's determination to impose
the variation, as for
example by requiring the customer to open new current accounts.  The latter
entitlement is conferred by an
implied term of the contract.  To my mind, a
justifiable suspicion by a bank of a customer's insolvency is simply only one
of possibly
many circumstances which may in fact motivate a bank to exercise
its contractual entitlement, upon giving the customer reasonable
notice of the
requirement, to require the  opening of new accounts.  What period of time will
or will not prove sufficient to satisfy
the requirement to give reasonable
notice must depend on the circumstances of the individual case.  The point is
that in adjudicating
what period of time is reasonable, the Court must look
beyond the Bank's concern that preference payments may be made.  All the
circumstances
must be taken into account.  Importantly, the customer's
legitimate business and commercial interests must also be taken into account.
The Bank after all, may be proven to have misread the situation entirely,
mistaking as indicators of insolvency, circumstances which,
on proper
examination, do not and never did justify any such suspicion, and indeed never
could have justified any such suspicion.
 The point is that the Bank in failing
to elect to treat the customer as having committed an act of default and in
failing to exercise
its rights upon the occurrence of such act of default, to
call up or cancel a facility, is still to be taken as treating the facility
as
on foot.

767	In <i>Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd v Westminster Bank Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 QB 1</a> at first instance and in the Court of Appeal:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 785</a>
in the House of Lords sub nom<i> National Westminster Bank Limited v Halesowen
Presswork and Assemblies Limited</i>, aspects of the general law relating to
the combination of bank accounts were dealt with, as were detailed
interpretations of the
law of bankruptcy.  The following brief summary of the
facts taken from <i>Weaver and Craigie</i> at paragraph 7.960 is sufficient for
present purposes:
<P>

	<i>`. . . The company had two accounts with the bank.  The No. 1 account was
in debit &#163;11,339 and was "frozen" at that figure, i.e.
it was treated for
all purposes as a fixed loan account.  The No. 2 account was a current working
account kept in credit at all times.
 On 20 May 1968 the company gave the bank
and its other creditors notice of a meeting to be held on 12 June 1968 with a
view to winding
up.  On the latter date, but before the passing of the winding
up resolution, the company paid to the credit of the No. 2 account
a cheque for
&#163;8,611 received from one of its customers.  The dispute between the
company (represented by its liquidator) and
the bank was whether the liquidator
could claim the balance of the No. 2 account (consisting almost entirely of the
proceeds of the
cheque for &#163;8,611) thus forcing the bank to prove in the
winding up as an unsecured creditor for the &#163;11,339 debt in the
No. 1
account, or whether the bank could combine the two accounts and prove for the
balance.  In April 1968 the bank had entered
into an agreement with the company
that "in the absence of materially changed circumstances" the bank would
continue the existing
arrangements, i.e. permit the two accounts to be
conducted in the manner described above.'</i>
<P>

768	At first instance, Roskill J found in favour of the bank.  This was
reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal (Lord Denning
MR and Winn LJ,
Buckley LJ dissenting).  The House of Lords restored Roskill J's judgment in
favour of the Bank.  As Weaver and Craigie
point out, the ultimate decision
turned largely on interpretations of the laws of bankruptcy.  Roskill J had
however, clarified a
number of aspects of the general law relating to the
combination of accounts, not all of which were dealt with as fully in the two
appeals.
<P>

769	In the <i>Halesowen</i> case, the agreement between the bank and the
customer was that the arrangements should continue for four months `in the
absence of
materially changed circumstances'.  There was no real issue but that
the notice of the creditors' meeting was a material change in
circumstances
which would have entitled the bank to put an end to the arrangement, but the
bank had not done so.  Weaver and Craigie
at paragraph 7.990 question whether,
if the bank had put an end to the arrangement, it would have been obliged to
give the company
notice of the termination, and to pay cheques drawn before
receipt of the notice by the company.  The authors expressed the view
that the
answer would be in the affirmative because the notice of the creditors' meeting
was not of itself a circumstance which precluded
the bank from paying further
cheques.  That view is the view which was supported by Buckley LJ the
dissentient in the Court of Appeal
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 QB 1</a> at page 47.  The House of
Lords however left this question open because it did not require an answer in
the circumstances:   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 785</a> at 807, 810 and 820.
<P>

770	The passage from the judgment of Buckley LJ reads as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The notice of May 20 1968, in my opinion occasioned a material change in
the situation.  At any time after the receipt of it I think
that the bank could
have determined the agreement by notice, and </i><cite>I am inclined to think
that a notice taking immediate effect might have sufficed, subject to the bank
being obliged to honour any
drafts on the No. 2 account made by the company
before receipt of the notice</cite><i>;  but no such notice was given.  The
agreement, I think, remained in force until and after the passing of the
winding up resolution.
 Consequently, in my judgment, at the commencement of
the winding up the liability of the company on the No. 1 account and the
liability
of the bank on the No. 2 account were distinct.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[1971] 1 QB at 47  [Emphasis added]
<P>

771	Here it is crucial to keep in mind the fact that the bank did not elect to
regard any of the Paola companies or the Group as
having committed any event of
default.  The bank did not purport to cancel the facility.  The Bank did not
declare the facility immediately
due and payable.  In my judgment the bank,
without giving reasonable notice, determined to and in fact froze all current
accounts
and determined to prevent any further drawings on any of those
accounts.  It then communicated that decision to the Group.  It did
not obtain
the Group's consensus to its actions.  Faced with the Bank's pre-emptive
actions, the Group had no alternative other than
to open the new accounts in
order to continue trading.   The bank clearly determined to alter its customary
mode of providing the
finance facility through existing accounts which, subject
to the customer bringing the balance in the accounts under the $8.5million
limit, would absent the Bank's directive, have entitled the customer to
continue to draw on the account.
<P>

772	That conduct of the Bank was in breach of the above described implied term.
The critical questions in the case are, as it seems
to me, whether that conduct
of the Bank in the particular circumstances of this case resulted in any, and
if so what loss to the
Paola Group or to particular Group companies;  whether
even if causally connected, losses claimed were too remote from the breach
of
contract;  which plaintiffs have locus standi to recover in respect of losses,
and which plaintiffs are barred by limitations
legislation from recovering in
respect of losses sustained by them.  My decision as to limitations and
standing questions has already
been set out.
<P>

	<b>Causation - The Events of Mid-February 1990 Seen in Perspective</b>
<P>

773	The events which took place on 15 February 1990 and on the immediately
succeeding days require close examination.  As already
made plain, these events
were the subject of extensive submissions by the parties.
<P>

774	On the plaintiffs' case, the Bank's conduct during those days and in
particular the combination of the sending of the freezing
letter, the dishonour
by the Bank of cheques presented on those days and the submission of the `in
liq' bank statements, constituted
a `death blow' to the business of NRS and
created a general stigma in respect of the whole Group.  The cause of action in
respect
of which the plaintiffs rely in relation to the dishonour of cheques
and the sending of the freezing letters is the cause of action
in contract.
The `in liq' statements have a bearing upon the contract case as factual
matters in that such statements in part communicated
the Bank's freezing
decision.  The independent cause of action on which the plaintiffs rely in
respect of the `in liq' statements
is the cause of action in defamation.
<P>

775	Shortly stated, the plaintiffs say that on the evidence, the Court should
infer, particularly in the country setting in which
the plaintiffs' businesses
were placed, that news of the Bank's general withdrawal of support to the Group
and/or of the fact that
the Bank had frozen the Group's entitlement to draw on
certain accounts and/or was referring to the Group as `in liquidation', would
spread like wildfire through the community and did so with such rapidity as to
prevent the Group from thereafter being able to restore
confidence in the
viability of the Group.
<P>

776	The plaintiffs' case is that the business of NRS had not yet matured and
was still suffering from initial starting costs but
had proven to be very
promising.  The case is that NRS had several branches and by and large
excellent prospects for the future.
 
<P>

777	The plaintiffs rely upon the evidence given by Mr Taylor that:
<P>

	<i>`</i><cite>During 1989, the business of NRS was travelling well and was
growing.  It was beginning to have a strong reputation and was certainly
a
viable business.</cite><i>  The success of the business was based upon its
personnel making business and exhibiting understanding and trust to its
customers.
 Customers during that time generally preferred to deal with
independents rather than conglomerate merchandisers such as Elders and
Dalgety.'</i>    [Statement paragraph 11]
<P>

	<i>`The business operated on a high cash flow, payment with delivery basis.
There were very little, if any, bad debts.'</i>  [Statement paragraph 12]
<P>

<i>	`Suppliers provided reasonable credit terms . . .  The support of suppliers
and the usual credit terms of supply were critical to
the operation of NRS as
without their support, supplies could not be purchased for sale.'
</i>[Paragraph 13]
<P>

<i>	`In late 1989 NRS employed approximately nineteen people in the four
branches at Tamworth, Narrabri, Gunnedah and Moree. . . . `</i>  [Paragraph
14]
<P>

<i>	Coming into 1990, the economy became somewhat tougher.  </i><cite>The
business of NRS was still progressing</cite><i> though the business environment
was difficult with high interest rates as I recall, of approximately 24%.  In
spite of those rates,
the business of NRS was sound enough that it could still
meet its commitments.  There were very little problems with clients, very
few
if any bad debts and business was growing with increased turnover and the
number of clients increasing.  </i><cite>Activity was continuing to
grow</cite><i>.  Suppliers were also at that time very positive and supported
NRS.'  </i>[Paragraph 16]
<P>

<i>	`It was an important part of NRS success that suppliers provided credit and
their support to the Company.'</i>  [Paragraph 19]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

778	The plaintiffs' case is that Mr Paola's instructions to Mr Taylor of
mid-February 1990 should not receive undue emphasis.  The
case is that such
instructions seeking to have payment to creditors extended by 30 days, to have
suppliers repaid by return of slow
moving saleable stock, and to reduce
ordering to replace only stock items which were fast moving, whilst perhaps
causing some difficulties
with certain suppliers, could not be suggested as
necessarily signifying to the commercial community that NRS was no longer
viable
and would obviously not prosper.  The plaintiffs further submit that the
direction is unlikely to have been communicated otherwise
than to suppliers who
were due for repayment at the end of January, and that those are not
necessarily on the evidence, all or even
the vast bulk of major suppliers.
<P>

779	To my mind, the fact that Mr Taylor had not adverted in his statement to
the mid-January 1990 circumstances which had led to
his resignation as a
director of NRS and as general manager of NRS, whilst a matter of significance,
should not be taken too far
and should not result in his evidence being given
no weight.  The instruction which he had objected to had in part been adverted
to in Mr Paola's discussions with the Bank [see paragraph 306].  The matter was
explained by Mr Paola in cross-examination.  Mr Taylor
had stated in his
statement that coming into 1990, the economy had become somewhat tougher than
in 1989.  I see no reason not to
give weight to the above excerpts from Mr
Taylor's statement.  The picture painted is consistent with the contemporaneous
documents
and with Ms Hamblin's recollections.  The tightening up of credit
procedures in terms of the not uncommon practice of small businesses
with cash
flow difficulties could have dramatic and drastic results in some cases, and in
others may well have a less potent immediate
effect and simply amount to a
hiccup for a few weeks or months in the trading terms of the business.  NRS on
Mr Hardy's evidence,
was `in its prime' at the time when it was cut off.  His
evidence accords with Mr Taylor's evidence as to the state of the rural
economy
being tough in the early 1990's.  He saw the outlook for rural merchandising
being quite good for 1991.  This is also consistent
with Mr Taylor's views of
activity within NRS `continuing to grow'.  Importantly Mr Taylor's evidence was
that the business was beginning
to have a strong reputation and was `certainly
a viable business'.
<P>

780	In my judgment, Mr Taylor's unavailability to be cross-examined does not
require the Court in all of the circumstances not to
give weight to Mr Taylor's
evidence given by statement, as long as the matters accepted as having occurred
in mid-January and thereafter
as proven and accepted by Mr Paola, are included
in the overall assessment of all the evidence.
<P>

781	The plaintiffs' case is that the evidence of Mr Hardy should be read as
suggesting that the effect which conduct of this general
type would have, must
depend upon how the matter is managed.  His evidence was, it will be recalled,
that a great deal would depend
upon precisely how such information was
communicated to the commercial community.  What would normally happen he said,
where a company
was taking such action, was that if its suppliers were not
being paid in 30 days, they would simply not be paid on the 30-day figure
and
when they would telephone possibly a few weeks later asking for their cheque,
they may receive a reply `its coming'.  In short,
the effect of a decision by a
particular company not to pay creditors for some 30 further days would depend
upon how that message
was delivered to suppliers.  It could be managed.
However, if creditors learned <u>in terms</u> of a direction being given simply
not to pay creditors, that would certainly be news likely to spread very
quickly through the community.
<P>

782	On the plaintiffs' case, the Bank has failed to prove detail of the cheques
dishonoured and presented on 13 or 14 February 1990,
which had been the subject
of Schedule `1' to the original summons, but no longer formed part of the
plaintiffs' claim.  In that
circumstance, the plaintiffs assert that there is
no evidence of the circumstances or effect of the dishonour of any of such
cheques,
or as to whether the cheques were paid from other sources, or as to
who the payees of such cheques were.  I have, however, already
pointed out that
there is some limited evidence in respect of these cheques.
<P>

783	On the plaintiffs' case as I understood it, the mere fact that certain
suppliers' cheques may have been dishonoured, being cheques
presented on 13 and
14 February would, in the ordinary course of events, have led to questions from
suppliers, but such questions
could have been deflected by the Group in seeking
to keep its good offices with such suppliers, as for example by stating that
there
may have been some mistake and that a new cheque would be forwarded to
the supplier shortly.
<P>

784	The plaintiffs' case is that, but for the Bank's above described conduct in
sending the freezing letter, dishonouring cheques
which ought to have been
honoured and sending the `in liq' bank statements, NRS would have weathered
such difficulties as it would
have encountered by reason of its own actions in
overdrawing its accounts for a few days, and in delaying payment to certain of
its
suppliers and creditors for a short time.
<P>

785	In short, the plaintiffs suggest that the events properly viewed in
perspective point up that it was the Bank's actions which
formed the crucial
integer and which should on the evidence, be inferred, one way or another, to
have had the net result that, from
one day to the next, creditors with whom the
Group dealt, and the commercial community generally, came to view the Paola
Group as
`in trouble', and the NRS business in particular as, to use the
colloquial, having `gone broke'.
<P>

786	The Bank on the other hand submits that its conduct was unexceptional in
the circumstances and that it did no more than exercise
rights which it was
perfectly entitled, within contract, to exercise.  The Bank points out that it
was contractually entitled to
dishonour cheques to the extent of the excess up
to 22 February.  In respect of the period after 22 February, the Bank asserts
that
the only live questions on the dishonour aspect go to those cheques which
were drawn on the Number One accounts and were not very
shortly thereafter paid
from the Number Two accounts.  Only in respect of that category of cheques
could it be said on the Bank's
submissions, that the payee was likely to have
been informed that the cheques were not being honoured through the Number One
account.
 Even here, the Bank submits that the correct inference as to what
communications would have been given to payees would have been
that the account
in question was no longer operative.  Here the Bank submits that such an answer
would have been entirely correct.
 The Bank submits that such an answer would
not have reflected adversely on the Company's financial standing.  
<P>

787	The Bank submits that the Group in its 15 February 1990 letter appeared not
to take exception to the suggestion that new Number
Two accounts should be
opened, and indeed gave appropriate instruction in that regard, noting at the
same time that NRS accounts
in Moree, Narrabri and Gunnedah were no longer
required.  That was confirmed by Mr Booth on 16 February 1990.  [PX 1162]
<P>

788	The Bank submits that there is no evidence that any person within the Group
communicated the fact of the `in liq' bank statements,
or the fact that any
persons within the Paola Group had formed the view on reading the `in liq'
references, that the Bank had placed
companies in the Paola Group into
liquidation, to any person in the commercial community.  Nor, on the Bank's
submissions, can the
Court infer these matters.  The Bank submits that there is
no evidence that the Group reacted to the Bank's freezing letter, or to
the
Bank's dishonour of cheques, otherwise than by determining to keep this
information `in house' and to carry out such steps as
were possible to
`quarantine' that information.
<P>

789	Importantly the Bank submits that on Ms Hamblin's evidence, on and about 15
February 1990, the phones were ringing hot with
complaints which were coming in
about dishonoured cheques within the Paola Group's offices.  It is submitted
that on the evidence
such complaints were being received from creditors who
included suppliers, or whom the Court should infer must have included
suppliers..
<P>

790	The Bank submits that there is hardly room for the Group to complain in
circumstances where the Group, having agreed in its
letter of 15 February 1990
to open the new Number Two accounts, the Bank thereafter failed to honour
cheques drawn on the old Number
One accounts, insisting on all cheques to be
honoured being drawn on the new Number Two accounts.
<P>

791	The Bank submits that the business of NRS was clearly in cash flow
difficulties for some considerable time prior to February
1990 and that steps
had already been taken by the Group to suggest to the Bank that NRS was likely
to be sold.
<P>

792	The Bank submits that on the evidence the Court could not find that NRS was
a healthy company with excellent prospects as at
15 February 1990, but on the
contrary should hold that the NRS business was in severe financial difficulty
and was suffering from
a severe cash flow problem.  Little or no weight should,
so the Bank submits, be placed on Mr Taylor's evidence as all, or at least
to
the extent that it is found to be inconsistent with other evidence before the
Court.
<P>

793	Further the Bank submits that Mr Paola's conduct following the 15th
February, clearly indicates that what he was about was building
up credit in
the Number Two accounts, not for the purpose of paying NRS suppliers, but for
the dual purposes of being able to meet
interest commitments to the Bank and
looking towards building up sufficient credit to enable the Group to discharge
its obligation
to repay $1 million of the facility by 31 May 1990.  Hence the
Bank submits that, even had the Bank's freezing letter not been sent,
and even
had the Bank on and after 22 February 1990 continued to honour cheques when the
Group had brought itself within the overdraft
limit, in the ordinary course of
events, the fortunes of NRS would not have been any different.  This is because
Mr Paola would have
been likely to have acted in exactly the same way as he in
fact acted, namely by permitting a rupture of relationships with NRS'
suppliers
in order that interest commitments to the Bank could be met out of the scarce
moneys coming into the Group, and in order
to enable a build up of funds with a
view to using those funds to discharge the $1 million reduction due at end
May.
<P>

794	The case raises an important question in terms of causation.  Clearly the
question of whether an act or omission is a cause
to which legal responsibility
attaches is to be determined by common sense principles:  <i>Alexander v
Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20NSWLR%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 9 NSWLR 310</a> at 357 per McHugh JA.

<P>

795	The question is one of fact.  It stems from `The common law tradition . . .
that what was the cause of a particular occurrence
is a question of fact which
"must be determined applying common sense to the facts of each particular case
. . .".   [<i>March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506</a> at
515 per Mason CJ]
<P>

796	J.W. Carter, the editor of the Contract Section of <i>Halsbury's Laws of
Australia</i>, Butterworths, 1992, puts the matter as follows:
<P>

	<i>`<b>Causal connection required</b>    The onus is on the plaintiff to prove
a sufficient connection between the breach and the loss suffered.  Causation
does not depend
on remoteness or immediacy in time, nor is it concerned with
philosophic speculation;  it is only concerned with ordinary everyday
life and
thoughts and expressions.  Causation is a question of fact and it is sufficient
for the plaintiff to prove that, but for
the defendant's breach, the loss or
damage in question would not have been suffered.  However, this is not the
exclusive test, and
in most cases the relevant question is whether the
defendant's breach was so connected with the plaintiff's loss or damage that,
as a matter of ordinary common sense and experience it should be regarded as a
cause of it.'</i>  [Volume 6 paragraphs 110-11150]
<P>

	Authorities cited for the last proposition include <i>March v E &amp; M H
Stramare Pty Ltd</i> 
<P>

797	Applying common sense to the facts here proved, requires one to stand back
from the events in question and to gain a proper
perspective of those
events.
<P>

798	The focus is as to the effect of a number of contributing causes on the
goodwill and reputation of NRS.  The focus is also as
to the effect of a number
of contributing causes on the goodwill and reputation of the Group as a
whole.
<P>

799	Multiple causes of a loss are treated with in Halsburys Laws of
Australia:
<P>

	<i>`<b>Multiple causes</b>    The mere fact that there is more than one cause
of the plaintiff's loss is not a sufficient reason to deny the plaintiff
recovery.
 If there are concurrent causes of the plaintiff's loss, it suffices
that one of these is the defendant's breach.  In cases where
one factor has
more relevance than others it is sufficient for the defendant's breach to be
the `material', `substantial', `decisive'
or `dominant' cause.  However, the
object of such descriptions is to exclude cases where the contribution of the
breach is minimal
and they do not require the breach to be the dominant cause
of the loss or damage.  Thus, most modern formulations of the principle
state
that the requirement of causation is satisfied if the breach was
</i><cite>a</cite><i> cause of the loss or damage.  It may also be relevant to
consider the knowledge of the parties.'   </i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Volume 6 paragraphs 110-11160 of the Contracts section of Halsbury's
Laws of Australia]
<P>

800	There is a subtle but important distinction to be kept in mind between on
the one hand, what the Bank in fact did, and on the
other hand, the content of
the Bank's notification to the Group of what it had done and/or was proposing
to do.  In gaining a proper
perspective by applying common sense to the facts
here proven, and in assessing whether the Bank's breach of contract was a cause
of particular loss or damage, it is thus necessary to look closely at the
precise communications to relevant persons from the Bank,
whether oral or in
writing, of what the Bank had determined to do and was doing.
<P>

801	Ultimately, it does appear that notwithstanding the communications of 15
and 16 February 1990, the Bank elected not to withdraw
the credit facility.  As
has already been noted, the Bank later permitted set-off arrangements between
the old and the new current
accounts and in early March permitted part of the
facilities to be converted into a term loan of $7 million, and the balance of
$1.5
million to be distributed among the current accounts.  However, what the
Bank would ultimately determine to do, was not communicated
to the Group on 15
or 16 February 1990.  In contradistinction to what the Bank ultimately
determined to do, there was no statement
on 15 or 16 February which confirmed
that the facility would be continued.  To the contrary, the oral and written
communications
of those days made quite plain that all current accounts had
been frozen and that no further drawings would be permitted to occur
on any of
those accounts.  The Bank's subsequent decision to permit the set-off
arrangements, and to permit the facility to continue,
took place during
following weeks.
<P>

802	The facsimile forwarded by Mr Booth to the managers of the several branches
at 3pm on 15 February, did not refer to whether
the Bank was prepared to fund
the Paola Group in the immediate future, or thereafter, and if so on what
basis.  It simply confirmed
advice in earlier telephone calls, that all current
accounts for Group Companies were `to be frozen forthwith' that all further
drawings
on existing current accounts would be `returned', and that all new
Number Two accounts were to be operated `on a credit basis only'.
 None of the
persons receiving that facsimile and drawing their relevant information from
the content of the facsimile would have
assumed or should be inferred to have
assumed, that the facility would in later days and weeks, be simply continued
by the Bank.
<P>

803	The letter sent at 5:30pm on 15 February and addressed to the Managing
Director of the Group included a sentence, stating that
questions as to how the
Bank would `fund the Paola Group in the immediate future' would be dealt with
following a further meeting
presently planned to take place on the following
day.  That letter includes no positive statement that the Bank would fund the
Paola
Group in the immediate future, and could reasonably have been read by Mr
Paola and by any other person who read the letter, as simply
signifying that
the Bank's decision as to whether, and if so how, to fund the Paola Group in
the immediate future, was still to be
determined and would be addressed
thereafter.  It was not possible for a reader to read into the letter precisely
what the Bank might
or might not propose to do in relation to a continuance of
the facility.  The letter simply left any reader of the letter with the
impression that the Bank's arrangements with the Group had been generally
frozen until further notice and that the only mode in which
the Group could
thereafter operate would be by opening new accounts which would have to be
operated on a credit basis only.
<P>

804	In substance, the Bank's notifications to the Group at least involved the
following parameters:
<P>

	(i)	That the Bank had determined to prevent the Group from further drawings on
its current accounts, which determination was in
place.
<P>

	(ii)	That the Bank had determined to require that if the Group wished
thereafter to operate cheque accounts, new Number Two accounts
would have to be
opened and operated on a credit basis only, and that this requirement was also
in place.
<P>

	(iii)	That all further drawings on current accounts were to be returned.
<P>

805	The Bank's conduct fell far short of compliance with its contractual
obligations.  No notice at all was given, let alone reasonable
notice.  Such
information as was given was neither precise nor accurate.  The Bank's
communications did not affirm that the facility
was to be continued.  The
communications in fact suggested the contrary.  And as for the possibility that
the Bank's tampering with
the mechanics of the customer's usual operations on
the facility could vitally affect the Group's business relationships and other
dealings, this appears to have been ignored - the Bank on the evidence,
apparently having in mind only the question of protecting
itself against the
possibility that it might be adversely affected by further drawings on existing
accounts, being later held to
amount to preferential payment.  And as for the
special significance of the Bank directing its relevant communications to the
Group
at an appropriate level, the flurry of activity particularly on 15th and
also on 16th February which included the sending of the
`in liq' bank
statements, paid no regard to this parameter - and indeed became an immediate
cause of the panic within the Group's
and NRS's offices and a cause of the
events and resignations which followed, which events are generally referred to
in more detail
below.  It is not difficult to discern that a `confidential'
letter addressed to Mr Paola explaining the Bank's position in clear
terms and
giving him time to explain to Group employees what the position was, would have
averted the panic and prevented the subsequent
events.
<P>

806	In my judgment, there is no doubt that by reason of the Bank's
communications of mid February 1990, the impression gained by
employees within
the Group and by those dealing in business with the Group and by the local
community was that the Bank had withdrawn
support for NRS which was seen as no
longer viable and as likely to fail.  In my judgment, the impression gained by
reason of the
same communications, by employees within the Group and by those
dealing in business with the Group and by the local community, went
beyond NRS,
and was that the Bank had withdrawn support for the entire Group which was
likely to be no longer viable and may well
fail.  It should not be forgotten
that on 15 February Mr Booth had followed up his earlier telephone calls with
the facsimiles to
which I have referred, sent to the Managers of the Tamworth,
Moree, Narrabri, Gunnedah and Macquarie Centre Group branches.  There
was
plainly a flurry of activity on the 15th February.  It continued on the
following day.  Mr Paola was `stunned'.  Ms Hamblin was
`confused'.  Mr Plante
appeared to her to be just as confused.  The Bank fails in its attempt some
nine years later to minimise the
effect of what occurred by suggesting that
calm prevailed because it soon became clear that the Group was not in
liquidation and
that Number Two accounts were opened.  The evidence clearly
establishes that an atmosphere of the highest anxiety and panic erupted.
Immediate concerns arose as to the need for staff to look for new jobs.  The
whole state of affairs could not have been and on my
findings was not
quarantined from the outside community.
<P>

807	Focussing first on the 15th and 16th of  February 1990 and upon the Bank's
submissions relying upon:
<P>

	(a)	the fact that altogether outside of the freezing letter and outside of the
sending of the `in liq' bank statements, the Group
had already placed into
circulation a number of cheques which were dishonoured as going outside the
Group's facility balances, so
that, as it were, news of the Group's financial
difficulties had already to an extent, been gleaned by payees of such cheques
and
<P>

	(b)	the decision by NRS, in part implemented, to defer payment to
creditors,
<P>

it is to my mind, simply incorrect to view the effect of the Bank's freezing
letter and the effect of the sending of the `in liq'
statements as not adding,
and not adding very significantly, an entirely new dimension to a situation
which NRS is likely to have
been able to weather or, using Mr Hardy's term, to
`handle'.  In the events which happened, the Group was in fact able, albeit by
being obliged to include the Number Two bank accounts in its banking
operations, to bring itself under the facility limit within
but a few days.  Mr
Paola, who appears to have been previously regarded by the Bank as an astute
businessman and whose strategy to
the Bank's knowledge, included endeavouring
to procure an early sale of NRS, is unlikely in the extreme to have permitted
the business
to lose the reputation it had established over its first years
during the lead-up to such sale, if that matter was within his control.
 I do
not regard the cash flow difficulties of NRS as evidencing that the matter was
no longer within Mr Paola's control.  He was
endeavouring as he in fact told
the Bank, to tighten up the Group's approach to credit and he obviously had as
a key objective, an
endeavour to build up a fund so as to be able to repay the
Bank $1million by the end of May.  His advice to the Bank of new controls
was
summarised in Mr Booth's November 1989 Credit Precis remarks:  `. . . in the
meantime Mr Paola has introduced . . . centralised
account management and
purchasing and limitations on authority of branches to make payment for goods
and services . . .'.  [PX 726]
<P>

808	I cannot accept that such evidence as there is of the cash flow
difficulties of NRS and of the deferral of payment to creditors,
is to be read
as equating to the NRS business `gasping for breath', or more importantly, as
so gasping to the knowledge of the business
community with which it dealt.  Mr
Hardy in fact gave evidence that it is not uncommon for small businesses to use
the strategy of
holding back on payments to creditors [T 354].  He referred at
transcript 355 to news which would `have to be to people not being
paid for a
lengthy period of time before people start talking about it'.  From time to
time, a business may often have surges of
growth and at other times suffer from
cash flow difficulties.  In a time of a mini drought, the ability of NRS to
service debts owed
to its suppliers would be dependent on payments being
received by it from its own customers.  Delay in receipt of payments from the
latter would be expected to lead to delay in being able to immediately
discharge its obligations to make payments to the former.
 And the dishonour by
15 and 16 February of a number of cheques drawn by NRS, was not necessarily a
telegraphing to those with whom
NRS dealt, to the effect that the business was
in its death throws.  The message which suppliers would take, as Mr Hardy
indicated,
would depend at least to a degree upon precisely how they were
`dealt with' by NRS when enquiries would come in.  I infer that plainly
enough,
suppliers would take from the dishonours, a message that the NRS account would
require careful scrutiny.  I infer that the
message which such suppliers would
take would be that the matter should be investigated quickly.  Some of them may
well have been
persuaded in the short term to think that some form of mistake
may have been made as the reason for the dishonours.  Some, possibly
all, may
well come to immediately believe that the business was suffering from a
short-term cash flow.  Some may go further and read
the dishonours as giving an
early insight into NRS as experiencing major financial difficulties.  As I have
said, precisely what
message those suppliers who had received dishonoured
cheques would take from the fact of the dishonours, must depend at least to
some degree, upon how the matter was dealt with generally by NRS.  Of
particular importance is the fact that only limited evidence
was adduced as to
the identity of suppliers with whom NRS dealt.  The few suppliers mentioned
during cross-examination should not
be inferred as comprising anything like the
majority of suppliers.
<P>

809	To my mind what the Bank achieved by sending the freezing letter, and by
the `in liq' statements, was to take out of the hands
of the Group, the ability
to regain the good offices of such suppliers or creditors as had received
cheques with `present again'
or `dishonour' endorsements, and was to take out
of the hands of the Group the ability to deal in any manner with such of the
suppliers
and creditors who's confidence required to be regained. Quite simply,
the Group was rendered powerless to respond, having lost all
ability to be
proactive. It could not redress the blow to the Group's reputation and in
particular to NRS's reputation.  Mr Paola's
entrepreneurial skills and
abilities had in the past been assessed by Mr Booth and by the Bank as `sound'.
He had been regarded as
`a person who constantly changed his business
activities in response to the market'.  He had been regarded as a person who
quickly
capitalised on opportunities presented.  Mr Paola's Group had plainly
had it's ups and downs over the period mid 1989 to early February
1990.
Whatever may have been his skills as a businessman, Mr Paola could not, in the
face of the Bank's actions, restore the genie
to the bottle.  It is not
necessary to go so far as accepting Mr Ryan's colourful submission that the
effect of the leaking in a
small country community of the news that a bank had
so acted, ought be read as not dissimilar to raising a `typhus' flag on a ship
awaiting passenger interest.  All that the Court need find is that the effect
of the Bank's conduct was highly material to the reputation
of the Group and in
particular of NRS.  That finding is made.
<P>

810	Extending the focus to the days and weeks after the 15th and 16th February,
it becomes necessary to take in the following facts:
<P>

	(i)	The fact that number of cheques drawn on the Number One accounts were
dishonoured from those accounts and after a period of
a few days or longer,
paid from the Number Two accounts, in circumstances in which payees would have
received a communication that
the cheques were, to use a neutral phrase, `not
to be paid'.  In my judgment, the likelihood is that the `present again'
marking
would have been used by the Bank on such cheques.  [Cf 4 May 1990 - PX
1289]
<P>

	These are the situations where payments from the Number Two accounts did not
take place on precisely the same day nor within two
or three days of the Number
One account reversal.  The schedule attached to the plaintiffs' submissions
clearly makes the point that
the periods of time during which dishonours took
place and ultimately cheques were honoured from Number Two accounts, runs
through
dates from 19 February to the end of February and continues into March
as well.
<P>

	(ii)	The fact that the Bank's actions in freezing the Number One accounts, and
the `in liq' bank statements was in one way or another,
communicated to the
commercial and local community.
<P>

811	I reject the Bank's submission that there is no evidence that, or from
which the Court can infer that, any person within the
Group communicated the
fact of the `in liq' bank statements to any person in the commercial community
and I reject the submission
that on the evidence the Court must find that the
information relating to the freezing letter and the `in liq' statements was
quarantined
within the Group.  Ms Hamblin, for example, recalled that within
one or two weeks after receipt of the bank statements, she spoke
to three or
four companies including one which was in direct competition with NRS.  The
substance of what was said has been set out
in paragraph 525 above, generally
put in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`They were interested to see that Northern Rural Services were going to,
they would say go bust and it was just a general conversation
about it going
bust and Tony's or the Company's lack of ability to pay its bill'.</i>
<P>

812	Ms Hamblin also recalled having other conversations about Mr Paola's
business with other persons including at least one whom
she was able to name as
a neighbouring farmer, Mr Ranclaud.  He said to her words along the lines that
Mr Paola had `gone bust'.
 She could also recall the names of other persons she
spoke to about Mr Paola and his business in that period, and although she said
that there were others, she could not recall their names.  The difficulties of
proof in this area have of course long been recognized.
 Back in 1935 Lord
Atkin adverted to the problem:  `It is impossible to track the scandal, to know
what quarters the poison may reach
. . .'.  <i>Ley v Hamilton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1935%5d%20153%20LT%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1935] 153 LT
384</a> page 386.
<P>

813	Ms Hamblin recalled that the mood or operation of the business changed and
went from being very positive because there was a
new business in town and
employment for a lot of people, to one of almost dismay because as she
recalled, automatically people started
wondering or worrying about their jobs
and the loss of their jobs.  They were also she recalled, worried about their
name within
the industry.  They were worried she recalled about what impact it
would have on their name in the town and their chance of future
employment.
<P>

814	Mr Thornhill, the Administration Manager at Tamworth, resigned on the 15th
February.  Mr Plante resigned 12 days later.  Mr
Taylor left his position as
general manager at the end of February or early March.
<P>

815	Mr Taylor's evidence was:
<P>

	<i>`The effect of the dishonouring of the cheques was that staff morale was
greatly affected.'</i>  [Paragraph 27]
<P>

	<i>`Staff morale and the confidence in the business of NRS was further damaged
when in the day or so after I was notified that cheques
had been dishonoured
that bank statements were sent to NRS from the State Bank with the words `in
liq' printed on their face.  The
statements had been sent by facsimile to
NRS.'</i>  [Paragraph 28]
<P>

<i>	`When I received these bank statements, I recall that I had a conversation
with Duncan Plante to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	Duncan:  NRS shouldn't be in liquidation.</i>
<P>

<i>	Taylor:  Well it is;  it says so here on the statement'.</i>  [Paragraph
29]
<P>

<i>	`Following receipt of the bank statements and recognising that cheques had
been dishonoured, I recall that I said to all of the staff
words to the
effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	"It looks like it's all over, I suggest you all get another job if you can.
The company is in liquidation."  </i>[Paragraph 31]
<P>

<i>	`NRS could not obtain product without cash and therefore could not sell
anything and therefore NRS could not trade.  Once that occurred
the business
ceased.  It became a business trading at a reduced level, operating on a day to
day for survival without any significant
profit.'</i>  [Paragraph 34]
<P>

<i>	`As a result of the bank statements and the dishonouring of the cheques, I
also formed the opinion that NRS was in liquidation and
that the business had
ceased.'</i>  [Paragraph 38]
<P>

816	Mr Taylor's reaction to the bank statements, namely that the company was in
liquidation, does not constitute an act of intervention
by the plaintiffs or by
a third party which can be said to have broken the chain of causation between
the Bank's breach of contract
and the plaintiffs' loss.  The reaction was
closely related to the Bank's breach of contract.  A parameter of that breach
was the
manner in which the Bank communicated it's decisions to the Group and
it's employees.  The sending of the bank statements so read
by Mr Taylor simply
constitutes conduct of the Bank in execution of it's breach of contract.
<P>

817	On my findings, Mr Paola's evidence in relation to his conversations with
Mr Giblet, Mr Plante, Mr Taylor and Mr Thornton should
be accepted as correct.
Clearly, Mr Giblet had also come to believe from the bank statements that
relevant companies were in liquidation
and preferred to regard the Bank, rather
than Mr Paola, as requiring to be believed.
<P>

818	Mr Paola's concession that particular suppliers took up to three or four
weeks rather than days to advise that they had closed
the account of NRS, is
not to be read as proving that the Bank's conduct of 15 and 16 February was not
highly material to NRS losing
the confidence of suppliers.  Nor is it to be
read as proving that NRS suffered no loss by reason of the Bank's conduct which
it
would not have suffered anyway absent such conduct.
<P>

819	A question arises as to whether it is or is not appropriate in examining
the causation question here and in applying common
sense to the facts here
proved, to separately examine the events of 15 and 16 February 1992, and to
then examine the events thereafter,
or whether on the other hand, the correct
approach is simply to look at the erosion of NRS's reputation and goodwill
which took place
in the first few months of 1990 and then to assess the effect
of the Bank's conduct.  There is also the question of the significance
to be
attached to the date 22 February 1990 emphasised by the Bank.  
<P>

820	To my mind, there is much to be said for the proposition that the matter is
not to be measured in `coffee spoons', so that the
whole of the facts and
circumstances running say from the end of 1989 through until the sale of NRS,
should be taken into account.
 Regardless however, of whether or not it be
appropriate to focus independently on the 15th and 16th of February 1990, and
then in
a separate exercise, to focus on the later days and weeks, the result
to my mind is the same.  Applying common sense on the facts
here proven, to
each of those periods of time treated with separately, or to the period of time
running from late 1989 through until
the business of NRS was sold, it is clear
that notwithstanding that the business of NRS did have a cash flow problem,<u>
the Bank's relevant</u> <u>conduct</u>, played a very real and tangible part in
an immediate impression being communicated both within the Group and without
the Group to
the effect that the Bank had withdrawn support for NRS and that
NRS was no longer viable, or was likely to fail, and indeed that
the Bank had
withdrawn support from the Group, which itself was no longer viable or was
likely to fail.  By no means could the effect
of the Bank's conduct be
described as minimal, insignificant or minor.  The support of its banker to a
going business concern may
as a general matter be regarded as one of the first
matters of interest to those dealing with such a concern.  Withdrawal of that
support, and even a suggestion of the real possibility of such withdrawal, may
in the hypothetical case, be expected to have a marked
impact on the reputation
and goodwill of such a business, and in this case in fact had such a marked
impact on the reputation and
goodwill of NRS.
<P>

821	I use the term `the Bank's relevant conduct' to emphasise a factual
distinction.  In assessing the effect of the Bank's conduct
following 22
February 1990, the integers involve first, the sending of the freezing letters
without notice, second the submission
of the `in liq' bank statements and
third, the dishonour of cheques drawn on the Number One accounts.  In assessing
the Bank's contractual
entitlement up to 22 February, the Bank was however
clearly entitled to dishonour the cheques drawn up to 22 February, and its
dishonour
of those cheques cannot per se amount to a breach of contract.  It's
dishonour of cheques thereafter does constitute a breach of
contract.  But the
number of cheques involved is not large.  And the relevant dishonours are, I
accept, only to be regarded as having
occurred where payment did not take place
on the same day or on the day following the reversal from the No. 1 Account
[see paragraph
711- point 3].
<P>

822	It should not, however, be overlooked that the Bank's freezing letters
communicated a decision, regardless of whether or not
the Group brought itself
back within the facility limit, to refuse to honour cheques drawn on the
current accounts.  Hence the sentence
`all the further drawings on the current
accounts are to be returned' in the 3pm, 15 February facsimile.  In <i>Rouse v
Bradford Banking Company Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1894%5d%20AC%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1894] AC 586</a> Lord Herschell LC said in
relation to an overdraft:
<P>

	<i>`This I think at least it does;  if they have agreed to give an overdraft
they cannot refuse to honour cheques or drafts within the
limit of that
overdraft, which have been drawn and put into circulation before any notice to
the person to whom they have agreed
to give the overdraft that the limit is to
be withdrawn'.  </i>[at p 596]
<P>

823	Hence one has the situation where up to 22 February, the Bank was
contractually entitled to refuse to honour cheques drawn outside
the facility
limit.  But what those reading the Bank's communications were entitled to
infer, was that the Bank was advising that
even if the customers brought
themselves back within the limit, the Bank would not pay the customers' cheques
from the current accounts
on which they had been drawn.
<P>

824	Examining the significance to be attached to the date 22 February 1990, it
is again important, it seems to me, to stand back
from the respective sets of
submissions, to stand back from the several sets of schedules detailing the
fate of particular cheques
and bank authorities, to stand back from the
somewhat beguiling picture which the Paola Group sought to paint in terms of
the cash
flow position in early 1990 of the Group and particularly of NRS, and
to stand back also from the somewhat beguiling picture which
the Bank in turn
sought to paint in terms of the pre and post 15/16 February 1990 and pre and
post 22 February 1990 dates.
<P>

825	It is clear that the Bank determined on 15/16 February not to pay any
cheques drawn thereafter on the bank accounts which had
been, up to that point
in time, operated by the Group.  It is also clear that absent the Bank
cancelling the facilities and/or declaring
the facilities to be immediately due
and payable, there was no justification in contractual terms for such conduct
of the Bank. 
It is further clear that the Bank's conduct went well beyond its
legitimate entitlement to dishonour cheques drawn on the Group's
accounts which
took the limit beyond $8.5million.
<P>

826	In order to put in place a variation of the Bank's customary mode of
permitting operations on the facility [here by permitting
the current bank
accounts to be used for that purpose], the Bank would have had to give the
Group reasonable notice of its requirements
so as to enable the Group to make
its own appropriate internal and external arrangements by way of meeting the
Bank's requirements.
 Clients and customers would need to be informed.  Bank
authorities would need to be changed.  Managers and employees would need
to be
informed.  And the Group would have been able in a quiet and measured way, to
move into the new arrangements with a minimum
of disruption to ongoing
business.
<P>

827	If one posits a hypothetical fact situation, as one in which the Bank had
not sent out its `freezing letter', had not placed
all existing accounts into
reduction and had not sent out the `in liq' bank statements, but simply, as it
were, continued as before,
then the Paola Group would have been entitled to
assume that to overcome its cash flow difficulties at the time, its options
included:
<P>

	(a)	Making deposits into its accounts so as to bring itself back within the
$8.5million and thence to ensure that its cheques would
be honoured.
<P>

	(b)	Seeking to persuade the Bank to increase the facility yet again.
<P>

	(c)	Putting assets, for example NRS's business, on the market for sale.
<P>

	(d)	Approaching certain of the creditors of the Group with a view to
ameliorating any concerns such creditors might have or seeking,
for example, to
arrange altered credit arrangements.
<P>

828	Plainly enough, if the Group determined to make deposits into its accounts,
the source of funds to permit such deposits was
a matter for the Group and was
not a matter for the Bank.
<P>

829	Granted that the Group had suffered and was suffering cash flow
difficulties, granted that in a number of instances cheques
had already been
dishonoured and granted further that the decision had been taken and I infer,
implemented, to defer payment to creditors
for thirty days, yet still the Group
in the hypothetical fact scenario so posited, would not have had to grapple
with:
<P>

	(a)	the Bank's decision to refuse further drawings on the Group's accounts;
and
<P>

	(b)	the Bank's continued, albeit `dwindled' dishonouring of cheques drawn
after 22 February when the accounts were within limit;
<P>

	(c)	the difficulties in fact faced by the Group following the sending of the
`in liq' statements.
<P>

	(d)	the reactions of Group employees to the communications made by the Bank on
15 and 16 February 1990.
<P>

830	Nor in the hypothetical fact situation so posited would the Group have had
to weather the swift circulation in small country
town environments of the
`news', and even rumours, that something dramatic and of significance had taken
place in the Bank's dealings
with the Group.  News which I infer from the
evidence `got out' by virtue of employees passing the information to family and
friends,
of employees resigning and having to seek new employment, of the need
to explain why the new accounts had had to urgently be opened,
of the nature of
the business, of the existence of competitors and of the fact that the events
concerned small country communities.
 At least one identified neighbouring
farmer specifically told Mrs Hamblin in the period of one to two weeks after
the receipt of
the bank statements,  [T 290, 292] that Mr Paola had `gone
bust'.  There were others.  There is further support for the same finding
in
the 15th August 1991 report of the liquidator dealing with NRS's failure:
<P>

	<i>`In February 1990 . . . the State Bank froze the accounts of NRS.  It has
been stated to us that </i><cite>this action</cite><i> resulted in the
withdrawal of support by a number of creditors of NRS along with a substantial
reduction in staff morale.  This made
continuance of successful trading
extremely difficult . . .'  </i>  [PX 2071-2083]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

831	I have returned several times to the schedules in evidence dealing with the
cheques which were dishonoured in order to gain
an impression of whether, as
the Bank would have it, the schedules show a clear and sustained period of
dishonours prior to 15/16
February and, on the other hand, relatively minimal
dishonours after 22 February.
<P>

832	Close attention also has to be paid to the reversals shown in the
schedules.  When did each reversal take place and on occasions
when the
reversals did take place, was it the case that the reversals occurred after 22
February, and if so when were particular
cheques and bank authorities paid from
the Number Two accounts, and how many days had passed between that occurrence
and the dates
when those items had been reversed in the Number One account?
<P>

833	The immediate impression which I have from an examination of the several
schedules is of the large number of reversals which
took place on and after 15
February, generally up to approximately 22 February.  Reversals continued
thereafter, but as Mr Macfarlan
submitted, the reversals after 22 February
ultimately dwindled so that the case in respect of dishonoured cheques after
that date
does not involve a large number of cheques or a large number of
amounts and in some cases includes failure to pay on bank authorities.
 The
Bank authority problems ought not to have occurred and could also have been
avoided had the Bank complied with its obligation
to give reasonable notice, in
which event the haste into which the Group was hurried and which accompanied
the Bank's precipitous
decision, would not have taken place.
<P>

834	The focus on 22 February is put by Mr Macfarlan as centrally relevant for
the reason that, taking into account the debit balances
in the Number One
accounts and the credit balances in the Number Two accounts and assuming that
all cheques drawn had been honoured,
there would have been an excess over the
facility limit up until 22 February but not thereafter.
<P>

835	I do not see 22 February in the same light.  To my mind, the 22nd of
February can and should be viewed as being a date some
seven days after a far
more important critical date - namely the 15th of February.  It was on the 15th
of February that the Bank
communicated its determination, in blanket fashion,
no further questions to be asked, never again to honour a cheque drawn on the
Group's current accounts.  It is that determination and the communication of
that determination, including the sending of the `in
liq' statements, that
caused a rupture in the Group's and in NRS's regular dealings on its bank
accounts.  It is that determination
and the communication of that
determination, and that rupture revealed to Group employees, which was a
clearly material cause of
the damage to staff morale and confidence within the
Group possibly best evidenced by the resignations, and further, was clearly
a
material cause of the Group's and in particular NRS's, loss of reputation..
There is a clear difference between on the one hand
the Bank simply
dishonouring cheques drawn outside the facility limit, and on the other hand,
the Bank in substance advising that
notwithstanding that the Group might place
itself within it's limit, the Bank had determined no longer to allow drawings
on the Group's
accounts.
<P>

836	The probable significance to the Group of the Bank's actions was recognized
in the Bank's letter of 15th February where the
words `in order to enable the
Paola Group to trade' are used in connection with the recommendation that new
accounts be opened.
<P>

837	The rupture in the Group's and in NRS's dealings with its bank accounts to
which I have referred, was clearly recognised, it
seems to me, in the letter of
29 March 1990 from the Bank to the Group, at PX 1239, whether sent or not sent.
That document, signed
as I have said by both Mr Booth and Mr Swinburne, reads
inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`. . . whilst it was agreed the company (and the Group as a whole) was
experiencing liquidity difficulties it was our understanding
that asset sales
planned for the ensuing months would comfortably repay the Bank and all known
creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>	Unfortunately being formally notified that ABE Holdings was "insolvent" did
necessitate the Bank having to take action in the form
of placing all overdrawn
current accounts operated by Group companies in reduction.  This had to be done
without warning or delay.
 We nevertheless regret having to take this action.
</i><cite>We are of course well aware of the inconvenience this must have
caused</cite><i>.'  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>	</i>Mr Swinburne, when first confronted by Mr Paola with the problem, had
recognised what a `grave step' the Bank had taken [paragraph
487].
<P>

838	In that expression of regret, it is plain that Mr Booth and Mr Swinburne
were aware of the inconvenience which the Bank's actions
`must have caused'.
To my mind, the word `inconvenience' represents a gross understatement of the
dramatic effect on NRS which the
Bank's actions in fact caused.  [See also the
terms of Mr Paola's letter of 23 August 1990 to Mr O'Neill, the Chief Executive
of
the Bank, referred to at Judgment paragraph 583, as emphasised].
<P>

839	In the result, the Bank's breach of contract was a direct cause of the loss
to the reputation and goodwill of NRS.
<P>

840	It is appropriate to immediately examine the claim pursued in relation to
NRS and to then examine Currabubula's rights, if any,
to recover damages in
respect of any loss sustained by it in relation to NRS.
<P>

	<b>NRS </b>
<P>

841	I turn then to examine the claim in relation to NRS.
<P>

842	The plaintiffs claim damages in respect of the sale of the NRS business on
the basis that the business was sold immediately,
on a fire sale basis and with
the business damaged because it is said to have had to operate on a cash only
basis.  The claim is
in respect of an alleged loss of some $900,000, the
business having been sold in May 1990 for $691,000.  The $900,000 claim is
based
upon Mr Hardy's reports which value the business in June 1990 in the sum
of $1.6 million.
<P>

843	The respective reports of Mr Hardy on the one hand and of Mr Bryant/Mr
Halligan on the other hand were the subject of close
cross-examination and
detailed submissions, both sets of valuers accepting that it was appropriate to
use the capitalisation of maintainable
earnings methodology for the
valuation.
<P>

844	The issues critical to the respective experts opinions on value turned on
the assessment of maintainable earnings and the capitalisation
rates.  Mr Hardy
adopted a maintainable earnings figure of $314,000 and a capitalisation rate of
20%.  Messrs Bryant/Halligan expressed
the view that the appropriate
maintainable earnings figure was $68,000 and that the appropriate
capitalisation rate figure was within
a range of 25-30%.
<P>

845	There were many parameters in respect of which the experts differed and in
respect of which Mr Hardy and then Mr Bryant were
cross-examined.
<P>

846	Mr Hardy had of course been involved in an auditing capacity with the Group
at the material time and in his 31 January 1990
letter (PX 3/1034) had included
what was referred to as an `allowance for possible goodwill value of Northern
Rural Services operations
not recognised in the Paola Group accounts -
$300,000'.
<P>

847	Tasked under cross-examination with his treatment of the goodwill of NRS in
that letter, his evidence was that when he prepared
the letter he was by no
means performing a valuation of NRS and had selected the value for goodwill
arbitrarily.  [T 344.50.]  This
statement is borne out by his subsequent letter
of 16 March 1990 [PX 1220], wherein he explained:
<P>

	<i>`In our letter of 31st January 1990 we included an arbitrary and possibly
optimistic figure of $300,000 for goodwill for Northern
Rural Services
operations.'</i>
<P>

848	The 31 January 1990 letter had estimated a Group loss for the year of
$1,044,000 including an estimate of $146,000 as the trading
profit for NRS.  Mr
Hardy's report had however estimated an NRS profit of $314,000 for the year.
<P>

849	His evidence at transcript 343.1, was that `[the figures] are determined
under different circumstances.  The $314,000 is a derived
figure.  What we were
trying to determine there was the future maintainable profits for the company,
and it happened that we adjusted
the 1990 year to arrive at such a figure.
<u>In the course of the audit, I would not have given anywhere near the
consideration to profit projections as I would have done for
this
evaluation'</u>.    [Emphasis added]
<P>

850	After a close cross-examination by Mr Macfarlan on working papers
indicating the way in which the figures in the letter of 31
January had been
derived, Mr Hardy was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	How do you account for the large differences between the figures in
your report and the figure that you described in March 1990
as an arbitrary and
possibly optimistic figure?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	For the very reasons that the figures that were used in my audit letter
were arbitrary, and I didn't in any way do a proper valuation
of what the
company in - in fact, that letter goes on to ask the company for details of
operating plans, budgets and valuations.
 It indicates that in no way did I do
anything other than arbitrary assessment for audit purposes and I was not
performing a valuation.'
  </i>[T 346]
<P>

851	Under cross-examination, Mr Bryant accepted that essentially the difference
between his report and that of Mr Hardy lay in the
maintainable earnings figure
struck by the two reports and the choice of capitalisation rate.  [T 565]
<P>

852	Mr Bryant also accepted that in forming a view as to maintainable earnings
and the appropriate capitalisation rates, the valuer's
task is permeated with
judgment, being a judgment based upon first factual knowledge of the company in
question and secondly knowledge
of the appropriate valuation theories to be
applied to the company.  [T 565]
<P>

853	Mr Bryant accepted that in relation to maintainable earnings, as a general
observation it is the case that an auditor of a company
would be expected to be
familiar with its operations and trading results;  that if he was performing
his duty he would be tasked
each year to talk to management of the company, to
discuss the accounts of the company, to discuss actual problems that the
company
might be having and in some circumstances to discuss potential problems
that the company might be having.  [T 565]
<P>

854	Mr Bryant accepted that an auditor's task is to opine at the end of the
financial year whether the accounts are true and fair,
and that the auditing
standards require the auditor to get to know the business of the audited
company.  He also accepted that in
terms of knowledge relevant to the formation
of valuation opinions being the maintainable earnings figure and the
capitalisation
rate, that an auditor performing that valuation task, if
otherwise qualified, is in a very good position to inject both the factual
knowledge and then to apply the valuation theory to that company.  [T 566]  Mr
Bryant accepted that this would extend to a valuation
of the business of that
company.
<P>

855	Mr Bryant gave evidence that, as he thought was indicated in several places
in his report, this valuation `is particularly difficult,
partly for the reason
. . . that it was a relatively new business . . . [and] . . . secondly, because
there is very little information
about the business and certainly not enough to
do a valuation which, for example, a valuer would want to advise somebody to
buy or
sell the business'.  [T 567]  Mr Bryant accepted at transcript 567 that
very little information had been made available to him, or
appeared, so he
said, to have been used by Mr Hardy, at least as expressed in Mr Hardy's
report.
<P>

856	Mr Bryant accepted at transcript 568 that it is very important when one is
determining the maintainable earnings for a business,
to understand in what
phase of its life the business is in.
<P>

857	Mr Bryant accepted that he had not valued a rural business similar to NRS
before, and had not worked in the country.  [T 569]
 He had never audited `such
rural enterprises'.  [T 570]
<P>

858	The defendant was granted leave to read section of a supplementary
statement of Mr Halligan in which he states that between
1985 and 1992 he was
employed by Pannell Kerr Forster in Adelaide and during this time was involved
in rural matters by way of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part X</a> Administrations for Farmers and formal
insolvency administration of a rural franchise selling cars, trucks and
tractors.  He also
states that between 1988 and 1990 he worked in the Official
Management of a rural merchandising business in Strathalbyn in South
Australia.
The business consisted largely of supply to the wheat and cropping farmers in
the surrounding area.  For about six months
during that period, he had worked
closely with the owners of the business and had daily contact with them.
<P>

859	The supplementary statement also includes evidence that during 1998, Mr
Halligan carried out valuations of a milk processing
business and an insurer of
agricultural businesses.
<P>

860	Notwithstanding Mr Halligan's said experience, there was no evidence that
he had valued a rural business similar to NRS before.
 To my mind, it is plain
that neither he or Mr Bryant had anything like Mr Hardy's knowledge in relation
to the affairs of the Group
and the rural economy at the material times.  They
had nothing like Mr Hardy's `on the ground' advantage in familiarity with the
operation and trading results of the Group.  They included no list of
comparable sales of businesses and their capitalisation in
their report.  They
did not know how the customers and suppliers regarded the NRS business at the
time and they were unaware of the
position of the business in relation to its
reputation in early 1990 in the market place.
<P>

861	At transcript 572 Mr Bryant was asked whether in his report he gives any
detail of the position of the business `in relation
to its reputation in May
1990 in the market place'.  His answer was:  `No.  That is <u>one of the many
items which we have indicated a valuer would like to know and was not
information that was available to us'</u>.  [Emphasis added]
<P>

862	The cross-examination at transcript 572 includes the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Would you agree with me that your report is silent on any detail of
whether or not anything done by the bank to NRS or the Paola
Group had any
effect upon the reputation or standing of that Group in May 1990?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Thats correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But, of course, it would be important, wouldn't it, in valuing the
business to know how its customers and supplier regarded it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes . . ..</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If a business is regarded as untrustworthy and unreliable, people won't
use it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.'  </i>[T 572]
<P>

863	Mr Bryant accepted at transcript 580 that his report did not include a list
of comparable sales of businesses and their capitalisation.
 
<P>

864	At transcript 580 he was cross-examined on paragraph 78 of his report which
had read:
<P>

	<i>`There are a number of factors that affect the choice of a capitalisation
rate.  In our opinion, in the case of the business, the
most important issues
are the basis of the maintainable earnings (i.e. whether before or after
interest and tax), the riskiness of
the maintainable earnings, and the
prospects for growth in earnings. . . .'</i>
<P>

865	In the following paragraphs of the report, he had commented briefly on each
of these matters.  He was asked:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Don't you think that in respect to NRS the prospects for growth and its
actual growth deserved a bit more than a brief comment?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Possibly, yes.  </i><cite>Had there been more information,
yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	His Honour:	I was going to ask, if I may Mr Ryan.  Mr Bryant, how would you
be able to say anything at all in relation to this business
about its prospects
for growth in earnings in the light of the information which you received and I
understand there are limitations
in that regard?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  </i><cite>Well, it is very hard your Honour</cite><i>.  Obviously
one can look at the growth that had already occurred </i><cite>which was quite
strong</cite><i>, but it obviously wouldn't make sense simply to draw a line
and plot that growth going upwards.  The real difficulty is a large proportion
of new businesses fail in their first five years and so you could certainly say
any new business has the potential for growth but
a valuer also knows that it
has the potential to fail and it is very difficult.  It is very difficult to
balance those factors, but
one of the significant factors is that buying a
business that is just starting is risky.'  </i>[T 580]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

866	Generally and from the further evidence given by Mr Bryant at transcript
583.25-45, I gained the impression that the valuation
exercise here in point
was very much a matter of judgment and gaining impressions and that there were
particular difficulties inherent
in the exercise of the subject valuation by
reason of the lack of records, by reason of the fact that the NRS business was
still
essentially `starting out', and by reason in the case of Mr Bryant and Mr
Halligan, that they had not had any `on the ground' involvement
with the
business or Group at relevant material times.  This is of course not a
criticism of Mr Bryant or of Mr Halligan and is a
parameter which is only to be
expected where an independent expert is years after a relevant business has
been sold, asked to give
an opinion as to the valuation of that business at an
earlier point in time.
<P>

867	Mr Hardy referred in his report to the fact that NRS had commenced
operations in the North-Western New South Wales towns of
Tamworth and Narrabri
in July 1987 and that the business had opened further branches in Gunnedah and
Moree in July 1988.  He referred
to the fact that this coincided with a growth
period in the rural merchant industry in New South Wales as evidenced by the
sales
growth experienced by the company in its first two years of operation,
namely $6.36million in 1988 and $9.7million in 1989 and $5.5million
for the
first half of 1990.
<P>

868	He commented that individual store operations were being conducted
profitably with the exception of Moree Merchandising which
incurred losses in
both 1989 and 1990.  He commented that the company was a healthy take-over
prospect for competitors in the industry
because of its expanding market share.
In his view, a market characteristic which continues even until the present
time, is several
large players dominating the market place, acquiring smaller
operations to increase their market share and profitability per unit
of sales.
He commented that NRS held excellent prospects for increased profitability on
the back of its expanding sales and its steady
gross profit margin.
<P>

869	Mr Hardy had referred to an industry `rule of thumb' for the valuation of
rural merchants being a maintainable profit stream
providing a return on
investment of 20-25%, the investment consisting of three components valued as
follows:
<P>

	(i)	Inventory - valued at cost.
<P>

	(ii)	Plant and equipment - valued at the agreed market value;  and
<P>

	(iii)	Goodwill - valued at 1-3.5 times maintainable earnings, having regard to
the size of the operation (for example single or
multi-branch operation) and
the amount of goodwill attributable to the owner of the business in the local
market place.
<P>

870	The Bryant/Halligan report also criticised Mr Hardy's use of the `rule of
thumb', and expressed the opinion that `rules of thumb'
for valuations ought be
treated with scepticism because they failed to take into account the particular
characteristics of the business
being valued.
<P>

871	Mr Hardy expressed the view that freehold land and buildings was a separate
issue.  This may or may not be incorporated into
the purchase price, having
regard to factors such as the purchasing company's management policies (for
example to lease premises
only), or whether it had a branch already open in the
same location in competition just a suitable for trading.
<P>

872	He expressed the view that this valuation approach was utilised by larger
merchandising groups in determining prices for acquired
businesses in the early
1990's.
<P>

873	One of the documents which had been made available to Mr Hardy in
furnishing his report and which was tendered as part of Exhibit
PX was a report
to creditors as at 15 August 1991 of Ferrier Hodgson &amp; Co., the liquidators
of the company.  That report had,
in paragraph 6 on PX 2075, included the
following:
<P>

	<cite>`6.00 reasons for the NRS's failure</cite><i>:</i>
<P>

<i>	In our opinion, NRS' liquidation was a result of a number of reasons which
included:</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The significant increases as stated above in the various expenses for
1990 financial year.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	The poor seed and grain harvest in late 1989.  This resulted in lower
than expected sales for the financial year 30 June 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	.	In February 1990 the secured creditor, State Bank of New South Wales,
froze the accounts of NRS.  It has been stated to us that
this action resulted
in the withdrawal of support by a number of creditors of NRS along with a
substantial reduction in staff morale.
 This made continuance of successful
trading extremely difficult. . . .'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i> [PX 2071-2083]
<P>

874	In calculating the maintainable profit stream, Mr Hardy expressed the view
that the company's actual gross profit margins compared
favourably with the
industry benchmark, whilst the overhead structure needed review.  He expressed
the view that it was unclear on
the information available, how much `related
group company overhead' was borne by this business because of its cash
flows.
<P>

875	Maintainable earnings had been determined by Mr Hardy after adjustments to
a number of financing, non-recurring or excessive
expenditures.  Detail was
given in a schedule to Appendix `B' to his valuation.
<P>

876	Mr Hardy took into account the following factors in determining
maintainable profits of the business:
<P>

	<i>`(i)	1988 and 1989 were start-up years.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The figures included unprofitable Moree merchandising
operations.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The company, having suffered as a result of other Group companies
problems - its bank account having been frozen and cheques
returned to
suppliers </i><cite>without notice </cite><i>in February 1990</i>.
<P>

<i>	(iv)	As a result of these actions, credit was withheld by the company's
suppliers from February 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The business only traded for eleven months of the financial year
following the forced sale of retail operations on 31 May 1990</i>.'  
<P>

<i>	</i>[I note that the matters referred to in (i) - (v) were only admitted
into evidence as assumptions relied upon by Mr Hardy for the
purpose of his
report.]
<P>

877	Pages 14 to 17 to Appendix `B' to Mr Hardy's first report and his business
valuation schedule are appended to the Judgment as
Appendix 9.
<P>

878	In Mr Hardy's second report of 12 June 1997, he expressed the view that
`the company was denied the opportunity to either pursue
the development of the
multi-branch strategy or sell the Group in an orderly fashion (say) to IAMA who
was developing such a strategy'.
 The industry, he said, `was rationalising
itself at the time with fewer larger players with some interest in gaining
market share'.
<P>

879	In paragraph 2.14 of his second report, Mr Hardy said:
<P>

	<i>`The judgments made in my valuation concerning maintainable sales, industry
profit margins and capitalisation rates reflected that
industry activity, the
forced nature of the sale, and the fact that the opportunity to rectify early
growth problems were denied
by the Bank's actions.  My valuation ($1.6million
which was $0.9million above value actually received) also indicated that the
result
achieved by the sale was probably the worst case scenario for
NRS.'</i>
<P>

880	In commenting on Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan's report, paragraph 23 which had
expressed the view:
<P>

	<i>`. . . on the basis of the information available, the maintainable earnings
are not as high as assessed by Mr Hardy and the capitalisation
rate he uses is
too low.  In our opinion, the likely value of the business would not have
exceeded the actual sales proceeds ($700,000)
and there is not a loss',
</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Mr Hardy in his second report said:
<P>

	<i>`It is noted that the Defendant's accounting expert concluded at paragraph
23 that the precipitous action taken by the Bank and the
resulting forced sale
of the business resulted in no loss being suffered at all.  Such a view is not
commercially realistic.'</i>
<P>

881	Under cross-examination and in explaining his approach, Mr Hardy indicated
that he was prepared to apply a valuation methodology
to NRS, as at May 1990
because of his knowledge of the Group as auditor and because he was aware of
the sale, in 1993 or 1994 of
the very same businesses to IAMA.  [T 337.25]  
<P>

882	Both parties accepted before me, as I understood it, that one of the
elements in a valuation is to consider the growth potential
of the business,
and the risk of the business succeeding or not.
<P>

883	After close cross-examination on a number of topics such as why he had not
made any allowances for bad debts, Mr Hardy had answered
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`There are a number - there is, I guess, one compelling reason to me why
the treatment of some key determinants in preparing my valuation
statements are
more lenient than Arthur Anderson's appear to be, but my views have been in the
back of my mind in a range of these
issues.  Am I allowed to tell you what that
is?'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The following questions and answers are as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Is this the reason why you didn't include any amount in respect of bad
debt?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It helped shape  my opinion on that and other issues that queried me on,
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I think you'd better indicate what it is?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The difficulty that I had in valuing this business is, or I should say,
one of the key factors that I used in valuing this business
is my knowledge of
the market place for these types of businesses, the buying and selling of these
types of businesses, my specific
knowledge of that and the opportunities that
were available to Mr Paola had he continued to operate these companies.</i>
<P>

<i>	In other words, there were specific opportunities that were available to
him that I considered deeply before I decided to adopt his
format of
valuation.</i>
<P>

<i>	Specifically, to give you an instance, specifically, there was an
opportunity in `93/'94, I think it was, where a large number of
similar
companies came together.  Eight companies, 50 were retail outlets, came
together in an SBS armour float.  The circumstances
surrounding that, and in
fact the two companies that bought Mr Paola's Northern Rural Services form part
of that float.  The values
that they received for these businesses was
substantially more and was in the order of $2-3million at least.  These same
businesses
Mr Paola sold them at $659,000.</i>
<P>

<i>	What was difficult for me in assessing the loss suffered by Mr Paola is to
what extent should I rely upon that specific market opportunity,
and others
that would have been available to him if he had been allowed to continue to
trade and to what extent I should have regard
to that when I did my valuation?
What I did was to adopt what I felt was more conservative.  To fall back to the
standard form of
valuation I had regard to those specific market opportunities,
but my way of implementing those opportunities was to be more favourable
to the
company in the key components of valuation than I might otherwise have
been.</i>
<P>

<i>	So I was more prepared to accept management projections.  I was more
prepared to accept a higher gross profit rate.  I was more prepared
to be
lenient on the adjustments that I made to gross profit to arrive at a net
profit, and I was more lenient in the selection of
the capitalisation rate
because I was aware of the specific opportunities that Mr Paola would have had
if the businesses continued.</i>
<P>

<i>	So therefore, in all of these things that you are querying me on, I have
been more favourable to the company but for what I believe
to be a specific
market knowledge that I have that I think was reasonable that Mr Paola  may
have availed himself of if the businesses
continued . . .'</i>

884	In forming the views that he did, Mr Hardy obviously considered appropriate
matters, such as the actual and projected results
of the company and the proper
capitalisation rates.  I do not accept that Mr Hardy's report should be
categorised as having adopted
a valuation based on what happened in 1993 to
1994.  His evidence was that having considered this matter he decided to revert
to
a more conservative and standard form of valuation.  Quite legitimately, he
had regard to market opportunities but only in the sense
that this translated
into a more favourable view of key elements in the valuation process than he
might otherwise have applied. 
[T 337.46]  Nor could it be said that events
which happen after the date as at which property is to be valued cannot throw
light
on the real value of the property at the time.  <i>Gould v Vaggelas</i>

<P>

885	Mr Hardy was able to give a personal insight into the relevant operations
of the rural economy at the time.  It was put to him
in cross-examination that
as at June of 1990, the outlook the vendor and purchaser would have seen would
have been bleak so far as
the rural economy was concerned.  His answer was:
<P>

	<i>`No, I think that there was - I mean, what I said in my reports is that
there was a clear opportunity for a rationalisation of the
rural merchandising
industries and I think that was known by the larger groups including Mr Paola.
There was, despite the fact that
it might not have been the most buoyant of
times although it wasn't too bad, there was clearly I believe a mood among some
people
to build and to expand their market share in this area.'  </i>[T 339]
<P>

886	To my mind, Mr Hardy's evidence suggests that rural conditions were not in
early 1990, so depressed that NRS was either doomed
or worthless.
<P>

887	At transcript 379.55-380, Mr Hardy gave evidence of the basis of his
treatment of growth of NRS and its potential for further
growth.  This shows
and is supported by the accounting records of NRS, a very significant growth
from 0 - $6million-odd in the first
year of operation, in the second year
growth to $9.7million and in its third year, in the first half of that year,
sales of approximately
$5million having been achieved.
<P>

888	Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan's report emphasises the lack of sufficient data for
the conducting of a valuation with any degree of certainty
with a resultant
decision to raise the suggested capitalisation rate and to take a more
pessimistic view of matters such as reliance
on forecasts, which in turn
ultimately produces a lower figure for maintainable earnings.  Paragraph 51 of
the Bryant/Halligan report
reads:
<P>

	<i>`In our opinion, in light of the fact that all of the profit and loss
accounts relied upon by Mr Hardy are unaudited and in the light
of the
liquidator's comments concerning the lack of reliability of the 1990 accounts,
we are of the opinion that the capitalisation
rate should be increased to take
into account the uncertainty attaching to this information.  We take this into
account below in
our commentary on the choice of a capitalisation rate.'</i>
<P>

889	Under cross-examination, Mr Bryant accepted that the business was a
relatively new business (T 567];  agreed that it was important
in determining
maintainable earnings for a business to understand in what phase of its life it
was [T 568], as start-up businesses
could have characteristically high costs [T
568.40];  effectively accepted that the criticism of NRS' record keeping had to
be viewed
in the context that the businesses were sold in May 1990 and the
liquidator was speaking of August 1991 [T 573].  
<P>

890	In dealing with Table 3 on page 11 of the Report and the criticism of use
of management forecasts, Mr Bryant had some difficulty
in explaining why net
profit would be out by 110% but revenue figures only by 19% [T 575].
<P>

891	Table 3 on page 11 of the Bryant/Halligan report was in the following
terms:
<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

892	The cross-examination of Mr Bryant included the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You have got a comparison of budgeted and actuals?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you come down to net profit and loss being out according to your
calculations by a factor of 110%?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	That is a figure that his Honour has heard before, but would you also
have a look at the revenue figures and the gross profit
figures?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you see the revenue figure is only out by 19%?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the gross profit figure was out by 25 percent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Can you help his Honour with why the net profit and loss forecast was
out then by 110 percent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I suppose the explanation your Honour is that because the net profit is
obviously comprised of revenues less expenses.  If I could
give an example - if
you take a company which is budgeting a profit - sorry - is budgeting revenue
of 100 and costs of 90 and a net
profit of 10, if its revenue reduces by 10,
which is a decrease of only 10 percent, but its expenses remain the same, its
net profit
has moved by 100 percent.  It has moved from ten to zero.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And it would be the case therefore that revenues were out by19 percent,
but do you know whether it was, for example higher than
predicted start up
costs which actually produced the disparity for net profits?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.  I don't know.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 575]
<P>

893	Much of the Arthur Anderson report focuses upon the missing facts and
documents relating to NRS' business and the difficulties
in consequence
involved in expressing an opinion as to valuation.
<P>

894	Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan in commenting on the historical financial statements
relied upon by Mr Hardy, focus on the fact that although
the accounts for the
year ended 30 June 1988 were audited, the auditor stated that he did not
express an audit opinion on the detailed
profit and loss account included in
the financial statements.  Likewise although the accounts for the year ended 30
June 1989 were
audited by Mr Hardy, he had stated that he did not express an
audit opinion on the detailed profit and loss account included in the
financial
statements.  Hence Mr Hardy's statements that the profit and loss accounts for
the years ended June 1988 and June 1989
were audited, are said to be
incorrect.
<P>

895	Again the financial statements for the 6-month period ended 31 December
1989 and the financial statements for the period ended
30 June 1990 are
referred to by Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan as not containing any notes and as not
being audited.
<P>

896	In relation to the 1990 financial statements, the report notes that the
liquidator of NRS in his report to creditors dated 15
August 1991, referred to
their investigations as having indicated that maintenance of the company's
records was poor.
<P>

897	Hence, the Bryant/Halligan first report in paragraph 51 states:
<P>

	<i>`In our opinion, in light of the fact that all of the profit and loss
accounts relied upon by Mr Hardy are unaudited and in light
of the liquidator's
comments concerning the lack of reliability of the 1990 accounts, we are of the
opinion that the capitalisation
rate should be increased to take into account
the uncertainty attaching to this information . . .'</i>
<P>

898	On being tasked with these issues, Mr Hardy in cross-examination, gave the
following evidence:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Hardy, as a general matter, valuers of businesses regard unaudited
accounts as less reliable than audited ones;  would you
not agree?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would agree.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Sorry, you would?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would agree, but can I - you refer to the word accounts, these
accounts being the balance sheet, profit and loss, the statutory
profit and
loss statement and notes are audited.  What is never audited, what accountants
do is put a standard disclaimer on the
detailed P and L at the back of those
accounts because whilst we have confirmed the profit or loss as being part of
our audit, we
have not confirmed the allocation of expenses, classification of
sales, so we make this standard statement.  It doesn't</i> - <u>that company
had good accounting systems at that time.  There was no reason to suggest the
figures were unreliable</u>.  And my position as auditor, <u>I was aware of the
accounting systems, the calibre of the accountant preparing them</u> and whilst
we still put this standard disclaimer on the detailed P and L because we have
not gone through that, verified the individual
expenses, items or the gross
profit rates or the allocation of other income, but the final figure, profit or
loss is audited as part
of the balance sheet and statutory profit and loss
account.'   [Transcript 321]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

899	Under cross-examination, it was put to Mr Bryant that the purchasers of the
business would be likely to have taken the documentation
relating to the
business with them, so that a liquidator's report of August 1991 in respect of
a period when only the Moree grain
business was operative and dealing with lack
of documentation, could not necessarily be extrapolated from to support the
proposition
that maintenance of company records had <u>always</u> been poor.
<P>

900	Messrs Bryant/Halligan criticise Mr Hardy's report on the basis that his
reliance upon figures forecasted by management should
only have been permitted
where there was adequate evidence that management had a successful record of
making reasonably reliable
forecasts and where the basis for each of the
forecasted figures was adequately explained.
<P>

901	A number of details are put by Messrs Bryant/Halligan in criticising Mr
Hardy's estimate of maintainable earnings and his estimate
of a capitalisation
rate.  These matters, together with Arthur Anderson's opinion as to the alleged
loss are generally set out in
paragraphs 60 through to 92 of Arthur Anderson's
first report. 
<P>

902	In dealing with Mr Hardy's estimate of maintainable earnings, the
Bryant/Halligan report at paragraph 61, expresses the view
that `no reliance
should be placed on management forecasts' and that `the figures in the
`adjusted potential 1990' column [used by
Mr Hardy] should not be used'.
<P>

903	The Bryant/Halligan report comments in detail on the adjustments which Mr
Hardy made to the `adjusted potential 1990' net loss
to derive his estimate of
0.314million for the maintainable earnings.  In a number of instances the
Bryant/Halligan report accepts,
or accepts with some minor amendments,
adjustments made by Mr Hardy in their entirety or in part, as reasonable in
concept but continues
with the words `but we do not have the information to
judge whether it is supported by the facts.  [See the references to Messrs
Bryant/Halligan not having information to judge or assess whether adjustments
are or are not reasonable to be found in paragraphs
64, 66, 67, 68, 70 and 71
of the first report.]
<P>

904	In paragraph 71 of the first report Messrs Bryant/Halligan in dealing with
a number of specific items of income say `Our understanding
of these items of
income is limited, of course, because little explanation of them is given in
the accounts . . .'
<P>

905	Ultimately, the opinion given by Messrs Bryant/Halligan in paragraph 83
that `a capitalisation rate in the range of 25% to 30%
is more reasonable for
the business than the capitalisation rate of 20% used by Mr Hardy' has to be
accepted as a judgment, and as
a judgment in respect of which the difficulties
usually faced by a valuer, and the particular difficulties which Messrs Bryant
and
Halligan accept they faced in the present situation, have to be taken into
account.
<P>

906	In paragraph 84 of their report, Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan summarise the values
for the business that result for using the method
of capitalisation of
maintainable earnings based on different assumptions concerning the
capitalisation rate and the maintainable
earnings.  That table is as
follows:
<P>

	
 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

907	At the commencement of paragraph 85 of their report, Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan
reiterate `That the quality of information available
may have a significant
effect on the resulting values.  This is because the value is highly sensitive
to changes in the estimates
of the capitalisation rate and the maintainable
earnings . . .'
<P>

908	Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan state in paragraph 86:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Hardy's estimate of the adjusted net profit for the year ended 30 June
1990 is 0.173million.  By adjusting sales revenue in accordance
with
management forecasts, he further adjusts the adjusted net profit of
0.173million upwards by 0.141million to 0.314million, which
he then takes as
the maintainable earnings.  Hence Mr Hardy's value of 1.571million for the
business includes an amount of 0.706million
(i.e. 0.141million divided by his
capitalisation rate of 20%) that is dependent on the accuracy of management's
forecasts of future
sales.  In other words, about 45% (i.e. 0.706million
divided by 1.571million) of the assessed value is based on management
forecasts.
 Mr Hardy clearly places a high degree of reliance on those
forecasts.  However, as we have earlier explained, it is our opinion
that the
evidence, such as it is, shows that management were not reasonably accurate
forecasters and that it is, accordingly unreasonable
to rely on the
forecasts.'</i>
<P>

909	Here again the divide between the respective experts emphasises the
question of the forecasts and their reliability.
<P>

910	In paragraph 87 of their report, Messrs Bryant/Halligan say:
<P>

	<i>`In our opinion, on the basis of the information available, the value of
the business appears to have been in the range of 0.272million
to 0.226million
using the method of capitalisation of maintainable earnings.  This should be
viewed in the context of the fact that
the business only made a net profit
before tax in 1988, and that for 1989 it made a net loss of 0.214million and
for 1990 it recorded
a net loss of 0.888million.  The business was, in fact,
unprofitable.  After making many adjustments, we estimate that the net loss
converts to a small maintainable earnings of about 0.068million.  When valued
at capitalisation rates of 25% and 30%, the value falls
in the range of
0.72million to 0.226million.  We note, however, that the business was sold for
a total 0.691million in what we understand
were arms-length transactions
(although we note that we have not seen any documentary evidence of the
transactions).  The total consideration
of 0.691million probably represents,
partly or wholly, the value of the stock, plant and equipment sold.
Accordingly, in our opinion,
the value of the business in May 1990 was probably
about 0.691million and there is no evidence we have seen to suggest that the
value
exceeded that amount.'</i>
<P>

911	Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan point out in paragraph 89 that Mr Hardy's opinion
implicitly assumes that all of the loss he has calculated
is caused by alleged
damage to the reputation of the business and its alleged forced sale.  They
state that Mr Hardy does not consider
the possibility that the loss, if any,
was partly caused by other factors.  In this regard they note that the
liquidator of NRS attributed
the failure of the company to a number of causes
including `for example, a poor grain and seed harvest in late 1989 resulting in
lower than expected sales'.  Notwithstanding this, Messrs Bryant/Halligan state
that in their opinion the reasonable value of the
business, based on the
information available, did not exceed the sale proceeds of 0.691million and
that there is no loss to NRS.
 They also express the view that Mr Hardy should
have taken into account the taxation consequences to NRS of realising a capital
gain on the sale of its business.
<P>

912	In paragraph 91 of their report Mr Hardy/Mr Halligan note that the
liquidator had reached agreement, subject to obtaining approval
from the Bank,
for the sale of the plant, equipment and stock of the Moree branch to
Currabubula Holdings for about 0.075million
- in which regard they refer to the
liquidator's report to creditors of 15 August 1991.  They then say `Mr Hardy
has not taken into
account the proceeds from this sale in his calculation of
the loss.  If the sale did occur then the loss, if any, in respect of NRS
should be reduced by 0.075million'.
<P>

913	In terms of the very close attack on Mr Hardy's report, based upon his
letter of 31 January 1990 and Exhibit `D5', to my mind
Mr Hardy's evidence
should be accepted, namely that he was not performing a valuation at the time,
and that in asking the company
for details of operating plans, budgets and
valuations, he was seeking information which he plainly did not have.  An
arbitrary assessment
for audit purposes is not a valuation.
<P>

914	It seems to me important to note that Mr Bryant fairly conceded that one of
the many items which a valuer would have liked to
know, but which was
information not available to himself or Mr Halligan, was detail of the position
of the business in relation to
its reputation in May 1990 in the market place.
Likewise, as he accepted, it would be important to know in valuing a business,
how
its customers and suppliers regarded it.  [See transcript 572]
<P>

915	As I have said, the Bryant/Halligan report from time to time expresses
quite frankly that the authors understanding of particular
items is limited.
This is often because little explanation of these items is given in the
accounts.  One such item referred to in
paragraph 71 is for example the opinion
of Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan that an adjustment should be made to Mr Hardy's
schedules in relation
to `wool press rental'.  Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan expressed
the opinion that an adjustment in respect of wool press rental requires
to be
made; "wool press rental should . . . be removed as being non-recurring or
abnormal and not connected to the core business".
 However, they express the
view that the value of the wool press itself should be added to the valuation
obtained by capitalising
earning, which they say they are unable to do `as we
do not have any details of the wool press and do not know its value (we assume
that the value of the wool press would be small relative to the value of the
business).'
<P>

916	Under cross-examination on this paragraph, Mr Bryant accepted that he had
never valued wool presses.  He was asked why it was:
<P>

	<i>`. . . that you assumed the value would be relatively small?  You don't
know whether it is a very expensive machine or a very cheap
machine?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I think I am right in saying that the income that it appears to have
generated is not great, but I will [not] [the word not is
obviously a mistake
which should not be in the transcript] say that I am not an expert in valuing
wool presses.'</i>
<P>

917	On the issue of Mr Hardy's reliance upon management forecasts, he was
closely cross-examined.  The cross-examination included
the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Hardy, would you agree that as a general principle a prudent valuer
should only take some account of management forecasts where
management has a
successful record of forecasting?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	If that's desirable, but that opportunity is not always
available.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, in your reports have you set out any examination of past forecasts
of management here and examined management success rate?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No, but in preparing my figures I had regard to -</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	The question is whether you've got anything in your reports about that
Mr Hardy?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	About?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Whether in your reports you have set out any analysis of the extent to
which management forecasts have been proven correct or
incorrect?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.  I didn't put anything in my reports to that effect.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, that is an essential part of the reasoning of a prudent valuer,
isn't it, to show that there has been a testing of the reliability
of
management forecasts?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	You've got to understand my reasoning for formulating the conclusions I
did here.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, do you agree with my proposition or not?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	[The above question commencing "Well, that is an essential part" was
then put again]?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It is part of the consideration.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It is a critical part of a prudent valuer's reasoning isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It depends on the circumstances.  it is part of what I do.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Do you say that you weren't able to do it in this case?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There is a limited track record of testing managements' budgets against
the actual results</i><cite> because the business was cut off in its
prime</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	But you have read Arthur Anderson's report in this matter have you
not?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I have.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And Arthur Anderson sets out such a comparison of managements' forecasts
and the actual results don't they?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  They do.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you have put on some four reports since that Arthur Anderson report
and you haven't seen fit to in any way join issue with
what Arthur Anderson
said about that, have you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I differ with the degree of emphasis that Arthur Anderson put on
historical results versus my considerations in this matter. 
I think they put
too heavy a reliance on historical results and</i><cite> given the limited time
that this business has operated I think there are other considerations that
need to have weight as well.</cite>    [T 322-323]
<P>

918	Mr Hardy was then asked questions in relation to Arthur Anderson reports
suggesting an error of 110 percent as between budgeted
and actual results to 31
December 1989.  In being asked about the margin of error, he was asked:  
<P>

	<i>`That margin of error is a matter that was highly relevant to take into
account when deciding whether or not to have regard to the
budgeted sales
figures;  wouldn't you agree?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's one of the elements that are taken into account but, as I said to
you before, Arthur Anderson generally place greater emphasis
on historical
results and the limited management projections that were done for this company
than I have done.'  </i>[T 324]
<P>

919	Mr Hardy `s further evidence was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	You weren't surprised in those circumstances that Arthur Anderson did
suggest that a higher degree of emphasis be placed on the
historical figures
rather than the projections . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I was a little surprised that Arthur Anderson placed so much
emphasis on historical results and didn't look to what that
business might have
done in the market place.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, you hadn't done any other analysis of comparing budgeted and
actual results such as is contained at the top of page 11 of
Arthur Anderson's
report have you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well, if that is the only information the valuer has as to the
reliability of budgeted figures a prudent valuer would be driven
to the
historical rather than the projected figures wouldn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.  Driven - you would have regard for it.  I am not sure driven is the
right word.  I go back to - perhaps because of my understanding
of what
happened for this business and these businesses in the market place
specifically I was more prepared to rely upon management
projections than what
Arthur Anderson were.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Let me just give you the opportunity to explain Mr Hardy.  How can you
rely upon company projections when an analysis of the budgeted
and actual
results to the last completed period showed an error of 110 percent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	What I actually did in my sales projections . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The way - what I used was - sorry - the sale projections that I used in
my figures were calculated by - I took - I looked for
the first six months of
the year where there was actual of 1990 year where there was actual trading
took place.  I think in the case
of the sales revenues the actual sales were 85
percent of the budgeted sales.  When I looked at how we would determine what
should
have been the sales results for the 1990 year.  I took management
projections and discounted them by a similar sum.  So I had regard
to what took
place actually and I discounted the management projections by a similar sum and
the reason I did that is because the
management projections indicated quite
correctly from my knowledge that the second half of the year should have been a
higher sales
period than the first half.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And why do you say that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Because of the pattern of trading if you like on a rural company,
generally the sales are concentrated in the second half of the
year a little
more than the first half.'    </i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 325]
<P>

920	At transcript 325 to 326 Mr Hardy gave evidence that he had not assumed,
prior to February 1990, that the company was `sailing
along quite splendidly'
but assumed `that the business was in its infancy.  We had a situation where
there were four retail outlets.
 Two had only been operating for about two
years and two for only eighteen months.  I took the view that there were
certain specific
results on the board, that the company was very much in a what
I would call, an embryonic stage as far as it's development was concerned
and
its - yes.'
<P>

921	To my mind, Mr Hardy took a justifiable position in terms of going back to
his own understanding of what had happened for the
business and similar
businesses in the market place in his assessment of the reliability of
management projections.  His answer at
transcript 325 line 20 and following
included the fact that he had taken management projections and discounted them
and the reasons
for this.
<P>

922	It is clear from his evidence that he took into account the number of
retail outlets and how long they had been operating and
the specific results
which had been obtained and the embryonic stage that the company was in at its
infancy.
<P>

923	At transcript 326, Mr Hardy also referred to the state of the rural economy
as being tough in the early 1990's and the outlook
for rural merchandising
being quite good for 1991 as being matters he took into consideration.
<P>

924	Mr Hardy's knowledge in relation to the affairs of the company and the
rural economy and the failure of the defendant to make
good, to my mind, any
particular fundamental misconception in the approach taken by Mr Hardy.  My
view of Mr Hardy in the witness
box, a close examination of the respective
reports and a close consideration to the respective contentions as to the
respective merits
and demerits of the respective reports has led me to the view
that Mr Hardy's assessment should be preferred.  At the end of the
day the
question of valuation principle and application is, as all parties seem to
accept, ultimately a judgmental issue.  To my
mind and having observed him in
the witness box, Mr Hardy should not be assessed as having done otherwise than
his best to give an
objective opinion as to the valuation of the subject
businesses.  At the end of the day it was he who had the `on the ground'
advantage
in familiarity with the operation and trading results of the Group to
be in the best position to value the business.  I reject the
submission that
his evidence ought be rejected as unreliable by reason of his past association
with the Paola Group.  I was impressed
by his frankness and candour in giving
evidence.  He is accepted as a creditworthy witness whose evidence is reliable
and whose views
were given honestly.
<P>

925	In the result in my view, the value of the NRS business in June 1990 on a
going concern basis, was $1.6million.  The actual
value realised, having been
$691,000, this was $909,000 under fair value.  This is the measure of the loss
caused by the Bank's breach
of contract.  The loss suffered by NRS by reason of
the breach of contract was clearly not too remote.  The test renders a
defendant
liable for those losses which are of a type that the defendant should
(or a reasonable person in the defendant's position would)
have realised were
sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract, in the light of the
information available to the defendant
when the contract was made, so as to
make it proper for the court to hold that the losses flowed naturally from the
breach or that
losses of that kind ought to have been within the contemplation
of the defendant at the time the contract was made.  [<i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>

926	Here, the full extent of the loss suffered by NRS flowed according to the
`usual course of things' from the breach. The loss
was of a type that the Bank

<P>

	<i>`A cannot, as a general rule, bring an action against B to recover damages
or secure other relief on behalf of C for an injury done
by B to C.  C is the
proper plaintiff because C is the party injured, and therefore, the person in
whom the cause of action is vested.'</i>
<P>

928	Gould involved a husband and wife (`the Goulds') being induced by
misrepresentations to purchase, on behalf of a company to
be formed and
controlled by them (ultimately being Gould Holdings Pty Ltd), a tourist resort
on terms which included the transfer
to the vendors of valuable property and a
mortgage back to the vendors to secure the balance of the purchase price.  The
three components
of the purchase price of $2,315,000 were:
<P>

	Deposit	$5,000
<P>

	Cash on completion	$957,000
<P>

	Mortgage back to the vendors	$1,352,500
<P>

929	The parties agreed that the obligation to pay cash on completion be met by
the transfer, by Mrs Gould, of a Gold Coast shopping
centre for $300,000 and
the sale by Mr and Mrs Gould to the vendor companies of the issued capital in
Talle Downs Pty Ltd for a net
consideration of $657,500.  Talle Downs owned a
shopping centre at Palm Beach.
<P>

930	After two years of unprofitable trading, the company defaulted.  The
vendors exercised their power of sale as mortgagees to
recover a deficiency and
sued Mr and Mrs Gould as guarantors.  The Goulds counterclaimed for damages for
deceit.  The liquidation
had no funds with which to take proceedings against
the vendors.
<P>

931	The issue of damages was complicated by a number of considerations
including the fact that Gould Holdings was not a party.
<P>

932	The trial judge sought to determine a figure which would in practical
terms, restore the Goulds to the position they would have
occupied if there had
been no fraudulent misrepresentations and no acquisition of the resort.  Gibbs
J summarised the trial judgment
on this issue as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The learned trial judge rejected a claim by the Goulds for damages for
losses sustained by Gould Holdings in the course of trading
and for the decline
in the value of their shares in that company.  He was clearly right in doing
so.  There were four elements in
his award of $1,427,500.  First, he assessed
at $733,212.12 the true value, as at the date of sale, of the property sold by
the Goulds
under contracts made on 29 October 1975 and treated by the contract
for the sale of the South Molle Island Resort made on that date
as cash paid on
completion of that contract of sale.  Secondly, he assessed at $266,273 the
value of property mortgaged by the Goulds
to banks and sold either by the
mortgagee or by the Goulds themselves under pressure from the mortgagee.  Until
July 1977, when one
of the vendor companies, South Molle Pty. Ltd.  ("South
Molle"), entered into possession under its mortgage, Gould Holdings continued
to trade, and to enable it to do so it was necessary to raise capital for
repairs, improvements and working capital.  In order to
raise the money the
Goulds gave personal guarantees - the dates on which they were all given do not
appear very clearly from the
evidence, but some were given in February 1976,
and it has not been established that Connolly J. was wrong in thinking that all
the
guarantees to the banks were given in or about that month.  These
guarantees were supported by the mortgages of the properties which
the Goulds
lost when the banks took action under the mortgages.  Thirdly, the learned
trial judge allowed $27,983 which represented
the amount which remained owing
by the Goulds under the guarantees which they had given to raise money for
Gould Holdings.  Fourthly,
having rounded off the total of the three preceding
amounts to $1,227,500, he added $200,000 by way of interest.'    </i>[157 CLR
at pages 224-225]
<P>

933	His Honour then dealt with the first item of damage, giving reasons for the
holding that the loss which the Goulds had in fact
suffered of $733,212.12, was
a direct consequence of the fraud and holding that the Goulds were entitled to
recover that amount by
way of damages.
<P>

934	Gibbs CJ then continued:
<P>

	<i>`Once it is held that the carrying on of the business was a direct
consequence of the inducement, and was not the result of a supervening
cause
such as the Goulds' unreasonable decision to continue trading, it must follow
that the respondents are entitled to recover
also the second and third items of
damage which Connolly J. assessed.  </i><cite>The direct consequence of buying
the resort was that Gould Holdings had to procure the necessary funds to enable
the business to carry
on and for that purpose to obtain the necessary
guarantees from the Goulds.</cite><i>  It was foreseeable that this would
occur.  For the reasons I have given, it cannot be held that it was
unreasonable to give the
guarantees.  Further, as I have said, the right of
action against Gould Holdings which the Goulds obtained in return for giving
the
guarantees can be regarded as valueless.'     </i>[157 CLR at page 228]
[Emphasis added]
<P>

935	Brennan J (as his Honour then was) said at page 253:
<P>

	<i>`The question raised by the appeal is the measure of the Goulds' damages.
They did not purchase the resort.  Can they recover damages
except through the
company which suffered loss as the purchaser?  The Goulds cannot sue in their
own names for the company's loss
(Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd. v Newman
Industries Ltd. [No. 2]);  they can recover </i><cite>only the loss suffered by
them</cite><i> in acting upon the fraudulent misrepresentations which Mr.
Vaggelas made.  </i><cite>They did not act upon those representations by
becoming the purchasers of the resort</cite><i> but by forming the company, by
providing it with funds to complete the contract to purchase the resort and
</i><cite>by guaranteeing the company's borrowings needed to improve the resort
and provide working</cite><i> capital.  No doubt it was a matter of
indifference to the Vaggelas interests whether the Goulds chose to buy the
resort personally
or by forming a company to be the purchaser, but the terms of
the contract show that the formation of the company to complete the
purchase
and conduct the resort was contemplated by the parties.  The representations
were calculated to induce the Goulds either
themselves to buy or to form a
company to do so and, in the latter case, to provide to or procure for the
company the funds it would
need to complete the purchase of the resort and to
conduct the resort.  It is the loss, if any, suffered by the Goulds in acting
in this way which is recoverable in this action.  The Goulds' loss is the loss
suffered by a creditor of the company which, apart
from its cause of action in
deceit, is worthless.'    </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

936	It is clear that in the present case Currabubula Holdings cannot recover
damages merely because of its interest as one of three
shareholders in Paola
Holdings, which was in turn the intermediate holding company of ABE Holdings,
which held the issued shares
in NRS.  This is not necessarily to accept that a
company can never recover damages in respect of the diminution of the value of
it's shares in a wholly owned subsidiary.  [Cf <i>George Fischer</i>, <i>(Great
Britain) Ltd v Multi Construction Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20BCLC%20260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 BCLC 260</a>;  <i>Fosters
Brewing Group Ltd v Elliott</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, 10
August 1995, Beach J)]
<P>

937	In <i>George Fischer</i>, the plaintiff was the holding company of a number
of wholly owned operating subsidiaries.  Multi Construction Limited which was
the defendant, entered into a contract with the plaintiff to install equipment
at the subsidiary which sold the products of the other
operating subsidiaries
of the plaintiff.  The equipment installed by the defendant was defective and
the plaintiff claimed damages
for, inter alia, the loss of sales and increased
operating costs of its subsidiaries caused by the defendant's negligence.  The
plaintiff
claimed that those losses, although suffered directly by its
subsidiaries, were suffered indirectly by it and that it's losses were
measured
by the loss of a profit to its subsidiaries.  The defendant argued that such
losses were not recoverable since a shareholder
suffered no recoverable loss by
diminution in the value of his shareholding or reduction in distributions to
him as a member of the
company.  The trial judge held in favour of the
plaintiff.  An appeal was dismissed.  The Court of Appeal (Glidewell, McCowan
LJJ
and Sir Michael Kerr) held that the plaintiff had an unquestioned right of
action against the defendant for breach of contract and
was entitled to claim
damages for the loss caused to its operating subsidiaries.
<P>

938	Importantly, evidence had been adduced at the trial to the effect that a
&#163;1 loss to the subsidiary company as a result
of a breach of contract
would result in a &#163;1 loss to the balance sheet or profits of the holding
company, unless some other
extraneous factor produced a different result.  The
judge accepted this evidence as admissible and as proving the plaintiff's loss.
[See Glidewell LJ at 269]
<P>

939	The critical evidence given by the expert was as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Every &#163;1 loss in a subsidiary company represents &#163;1 loss in GF
(Great Britain), since each of these companies is 100 percent
owned by GF
(Great Britain).  GF (Great Britain) is therefore entitled to the whole of the
profit earned by a subsidiary.  Thus,
if the profits of a subsidiary are
reduced by &#163;1, the value of  GF (Great Britain's) investment in the
subsidiary is also reduced
by &#163;1.  This remains true whether the profits
of the subsidiaries are distributed to GF (Great Britain) by way of dividend or
whether they are retained within the individual subsidiaries own working
capital.  It is by virtue of this relationship within the
Group companies that
I have included the subsidiaries' losses in my quantification of the claim for
damages.'    </i>[1995 1 BCLC at 268]
<P>

940	Currabubula's case is very different to that dealt with in <i>George
Fischer.</i>  Currabubula called no evidence to the effect of a particular
quantifiable loss to NRS as a result of breach of contract resulting
in a
particular quantified loss to the balance sheet or profits of Currabubula as
one of the ultimate shareholders.
<P>

941	I do not see Currabubula as having, by reason of its indirect shareholding
in NRS any locus standi which would permit it to
recover in respect of the loss
suffered by NRS following the so-called fire sale of its businesses.
<P>

942	To my mind, Currabubula has an entirely discrete locus standi permitting it
to recover in respect of the losses sustained by
NRS.  Currabubula was a party
to the agreement with the Bank, constituted by the facility agreement.  NRS was
also a party to that
agreement.  The Bank owed joint and several contractual
obligations under the facility agreement to Currabubula and to the other
borrower companies.  Currabubula was a co-promisee, as was each of the Group
borrower companies, in respect of the Bank's joint and
several obligations to
observe and not to breach any of the express or implied terms of the facility
agreement.  The Court's holding
that the Bank breached the obligation imposed
upon it by an implied term of its contract with the Paola Group to give
reasonable
notice in the event that it determined to vary its customary mode of
providing general banking services, and in particular the finance
facility to
the Group and failed to comply with all the requirements which such obligation
embraced [see paragraph 752], carries
with it an entitlement in Currabubula, to
recover in respect of loss or damage suffered by Currabubula by reason of the
Bank's breach
of contract.  This is of course providing that it is able to
establish that the loss or damage was caused by the Bank's breach and
that the
loss or damage was not too remote.
<P>

943	The loss suffered by Currabubula by reason of the Bank's breach of contract
was not too remote.  This is a question of fact.
 It was always plain to the
Bank that the security it was taking from Currabubula extended to borrowings by
any of the companies
in the Group.  It must always have been clear to the Bank
that in the event that any breach of contract by the Bank would lessen
the
value of any assets held by any of the Paola Group of Companies which also
secured the loan to the Bank, each other of the Paola
Group of Companies, and
in particular bearing in mind its substantial asset base, Currabubula Holdings,
if and when called upon in
terms of the interlocking network of guarantees and
securities, would suffer a loss equivalent to the amount of such lessening in
value of other Group Companies' assets.  This is what occurred here.  Given the
particular unusual circumstances and virtual certainty
that Currabubula, as the
`asset rich' branch of the Paola Group, would be called upon to meet Group
indebtedness, Currabubula's loss
may well be described as having flowed
according to the `usual course of things' from the breach of contract.  This is
a matter which
is not altogether clear.  However, bearing in mind the terms of
the Group's communications to the Bank of its financial position,
difficulties
and proposals, clearly evidenced by the Bank's contemporaneous notes, it was,
it seems to me, clearly loss which may
reasonably be supposed to have been in
the contemplation of both parties at the time the February 1990 facility
agreement was entered
into, as the probable result of the breach.  Hence the
second limb of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> was certainly satisfied.  Currabubula
in my judgment, suffered a loss in the sum of $909,000, and this because the
business of NRS
was sold at undervalue.  Had the business been sold at market
value, NRS would have been obliged to and would have paid that full
purchase
price to the Bank to procure a discharge of the securities encumbering NRS.  In
consequence, Currabubula would have had
to pay $909,000 less than in fact it
was obliged to pay in reducing the Group indebtedness owed to the Bank.  A
Group indebtedness
heavily secured over Currabubula assets.
<P>

944	I turn next to deal with the claims pursued qua Durhambone East, Durhambone
West, Gabo and U-Bix.
<P>

	<b>Durhambone East</b>
<P>

945	Mr Paola conceded in cross-examination that he decided for business
considerations related to the financial position of his
Group, to sell
Durhambone.  [T 180.17]
<P>

946	At transcript 208, he gave the following evidence under
cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	. . . was it your view in the middle of 1990 that Durhambone needed to
be sold in order to produce money for the company to enable
it to continue
trading - when I say `company', I mean your Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Because I suggest to you, quite apart from commitments to the bank,
there were other expenses and commitments that the group had
that it was your
view the group could not fund out of prospective cash flow?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And from your point of view therefore, in mid 1990 the sale of
Durhambone was imperative?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It certainly became that way, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well it became that way by mid 1990, didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, it did.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And not only imperative, but urgent?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It became urgent.'</i>
<P>

947	In or prior to September 1989, Mr Paola had arranged for a video to be
taken of Durhambone referable to the prospective sale
of it.  Dalgety's were
appointed as agents for sale in September 1989.  Elders, the primary agent, was
appointed to handle the sale
in the second half of 1989 and commenced
advertising the property for an auction to be held in February 1990.
<P>

948	In mid January 1990 Mr Paola told Mr Booth that his strategy was to reduce
bank debt to less than $5 million `as soon as possible'
and that assets would
be realised until that was achieved.  [PX 850]
<P>

949	Tested as to what time frame he had in mind, his evidence was:
<P>

	<i>`. . . our budget was to achieve that during the calendar year.  Our
objective was to achieve it as soon as possible.  I felt that
it could be done
by some time shortly after the mid-year.'    </i>[T 95]
<P>

950	A further auction date for 4 April 1990 was fixed for the auction.  Due to
heavy rains that auction date was postponed to 27
May 1990.  As at 1 May 1990
Mr Paola advised the Bank that whilst some interest had been shown, no
worthwhile offers had as yet been
made.  Mr Terrey wrote to the Bank on 7 May
1990 also stating that it was not expected that the property would sell and
adding: 
`However, it is our commitment that this property be sold as soon as
possible, ensuring that a realistic price is attained, avoiding
at all costs a
`fire sale'.  To this end, confidence in the Group's overall financial position
will need to be restored in the market
place, particularly the country areas'.
[PX 1308]
<P>

951	In the result there were no bids at the auction of 25 May 1990.  Mr Paola
however negotiated with interested purchasers after
the auction.  [T 78.35]
<P>

952	At transcript 176-177 Mr Paola gave the following evidence under
cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	And the fact is, Mr Paola, that unless Durhambone could be sold
quickly, looking at the position in April 1990, you saw the group
getting
itself into a wholly unacceptable financial position later in the year.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	This was our projection.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Just try to concentrate on the question, if you could.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I am.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	All right.  Well, I'll put it again.  In April of 1990 your state of
mind was that, unless Durhambone could be sold promptly,
the group would get
itself into a wholly unacceptable financial position later in the year?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It would - the state of mind was that -</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	I'd prefer you to say whether or not the proposition put to you is an
accurate one.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Not entirely accurate.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It's partly accurate, is it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Partly accurate.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What part is accurate?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It's accurate that we had these payments coming due, but the pressure
was not so great because the vendors concerned I was confident
those payments
could be delayed.  And we had a desire to meet those commitments on
time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	For the group to get to a position where it required some amount of
approximately $10.8 million in bank debt in November 1990
would have been a
wholly unacceptable position in your view, wouldn't it</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, the bank debt would never have got to that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	If it had gone to that, you would have regarded that as wholly
unacceptable, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would have regarded it as unacceptable, yes, but it would never have
gone to that;  it couldn't go to that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You say that because you don't think the bank would have advanced any
more money;  is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, I couldn't refinance because of the problems and the State Bank
certainly wasn't going to go beyond the 7.5.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that means, doesn't it, Mr Paola, that for the group to be in a
position where it needed $10.8 million in bank debt would
have been wholly
unacceptable because it just simply wasn't going to be available, as you
believed it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	At what point in time?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In April of 1990 your state of mind was that there just wasn't going to
be available something over $10 million in bank facility
later in the
year?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Without the sale of Durhambone, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And the sale of Durhambone, in your mind, was therefore imperative, I
suggest?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	By that time, the sale of Durhambone was starting to become more
important, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It was imperative in your view, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	</i><cite>It was getting that way, yes</cite><i>.  I'm sorry, it was
imperative because of the pressure we had from the bank to sell it.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It was imperative because, unless it was sold, you'd need more bank debt
than was available from the bank;  that right, isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Well, yes, to a certain extent that's right.'</i>    [Emphasis added]
<P>

953	Although Mr Paola in the following question and answer appears to have
sought to qualify the answer emphasised in the above
passage, Mr Paola's
evidence as a whole satisfies me that he had seen the sale of Durhambone as
urgent from 1989 and that by mid
1990 he saw it as fast becoming imperative to
achieve a sale.  Without such a sale he realised that, bearing in mind the
indebtedness
to the Bank and the interest commitments, the Group's financial
position would be intolerable.  The view Mr Paola had was that the
property had
to be sold to permit the Group to continue trading.  It was Mr Paola's
considered view that absent such sale, the Group
could not fund out of it's
prospective cash flow, it's commitments to the Bank and it's other expenses and
commitments.
<P>

954	I accept the Bank's submission that the sale of Durhambone was a business
decision made by Mr Paola as a result of the financial
circumstances of the
Group.
<P>

955	The plaintiffs' case is that the Bank placed relentless pressure on the
Group to sell Durhambone.  The Bank, as I understood
it's case, does not deny
that it pressured the Group to sell Durhambone.  Mr Booth conceded this in
terms at transcript 512.47. 
The Bank asserts however that on all the evidence
the Bank did no more than press Mr Paola to do that which he had been promising
to do since 1989.  The Bank's case is further that on no view could it be said
that any breach of contract committed by it in February
1990 (assuming for the
argument that such breach took place), caused the Durhambone sale.
<P>

956	To my mind, the Bank's submissions should be accepted as having substance.
The whole of the evidence requires to be viewed when
determining the delicate
balance in issue - was the Group pushed into the sale by reason of the Bank's
freezing decision, or did
it sell for it's own commercial reasons?  Commercial
reasons which importantly included the pressing contractual obligation to repay
$1.5million of the facility by 31 May 1990.  In my judgment, the evidence
establishes that albeit in an environment of sustained
pressure from the Bank
to sell Durhambone, Mr Paola did not sell by reason of the Bank's breaches of
contract earlier referred to,
nor by reason of a call-up by the Bank of the
facility.  In fact what happened was that Mr Paola recognised that there was a
pressing
need to reduce the Group's indebtedness to the Bank both to honour the
term of the facility which required the end of May reduction,
and to alleviate
the Group's overstretched financial situation.  An overstretched financial
situation which in Mr Paola's personal
view was simply intolerable and had to
be redressed.  Hence the pressure from the Bank cannot be read as flowing from
or caused by
the Bank's breaches of contract, nor as a `withdrawal of the
facility', nor as equivalent to a calling up of the facility.
<P>

957	An important integer involves the time span.  In my judgment, Mr Paola
believed that the sale of Durhambone was urgent as far
back as 1989 but did not
sell the property until mid 1990 because he wished to ensure that he took the
time necessary to ensure that
he achieved the best price in the prevailing
market.
<P>

958	An integer in the equation is the absence of any action by the Bank to call
up the debt.  Such pressure as was exerted was not
causally connected to the
Bank's February 1990 breach of contract which I have held took place.
<P>

959	The fact that, in my judgment, NRS received $909,000 less than it would
otherwise have received upon the sale of NRS, does not
convert the sale of
Durhambone into a sale caused by the Bank's breach of the implied contractual
term.  Even had the plaintiffs
received the additional $909,000 upon the sale
of NRS, that would have been far from achieving the reduction in Bank debt
below $5
million that in Mr Paola's view was necessary.
<P>

960	It is true that Mr Paola's evidence at transcript 92, in relation to his
strategy to reduce bank debt to less than $5 million
during the first half of
1990, outlined to the Bank in early 1990, was that from February to June `the
plan of reduction . . . swung
out of [his] control.  The management of the
Group was lost.  The strategies were to react to events'.
<P>

961	In my judgment, the evidence does not support the submission that it was
the Bank's breach of contract which caused the sale.
 The market had been
carefully and exhaustively tested over a long period of time.  The sale did
however take place in an environment
of continued pressure by the Bank that the
sale occur and that the Group meet the market.  And it did take place in an
environment
in which the Group was known to be in severe financially straitened
circumstances.  But the suggestion of Mr Paola having lost the
management of
the Group `due to the Bank's breach of contract' is rejected.  Not only did Mr
Paola fail to give evidence that if
the proceeds of sale of NRS had been
$900,000 higher, he would not have sold Durhambone East, but he in fact gave
evidence that in
June 1990 he was asking Dalgettys to submit an offer from him
in excess of $1.1 million relating to two pastoral properties, in a
context of
putting properties together for possible sale.  This does not bear out the
suggestion of `reacting to events', or a loss
of all control.
<P>

962	The case in relation to Durhambone East has not been made out.
<P>

963	Were I to be wrong in my decision that the case in relation to Durhambone
has not been made out, it would be necessary to reach
a finding as to the
proportion of the total purchase price of `Durhambone East'  attributable to
the land content of the sale.  This
is a matter upon which the parties were
divided.  Upon a close examination of the subject sales, Mr Spackman gave
evidence that the
proportion of the total purchase price of Durhambone East
attributable to the land content, was in the range of $4.26 and $4.36 million.
[See his analysis on page 6 of his second report.]  The parties addressed on
the basis that this evidence should be regarded as attributing
$4.3 million to
the land content.
<P>

964	In Mr Spackman's first report, he had defined a forced sale as `the
estimated amount that a property should exchange for at
the date of valuation
between an anxious vendor and an unmotivated buyer after limited exposure to
the market'.  Those forced sales
he said, are generally associated with a
mortgagee seeking to recover outstanding loan amounts after taking possession
of a property,
or may well be a sale to wind up a partnership or family
situation.
<P>

965	In the case of Durhambone, he applied variable discount factors with
approximately 10% in times of better marketing conditions
or after the market
had dropped and settled with a 15% drop in uneasy or poorer marketing
conditions.  His calculations were set
out on pages 36 and following of his
first report.  In relation to Durhambone East, his calculations recorded as at
27 July 1990,
a market value of $4,760,000 and a forced sale value of
$4,050,000.
<P>

966	The complications in relation to working through what was the land content
of the Durhambone East sale are because the sale
involved, in addition to the
sale of land content, sale of plant, equipment and the payment of a `crop
preparation' fee to Currabubula.
 Detail of the agreement between the
purchasers and Currabubula and between Currabubula and Limthono Pty Limited are
recorded in
the Deed dated 21 July 1990 between relevant parties.  [PX
4/1444]
<P>

967	In the absence of the plaintiffs having adduced any evidence to contradict
Mr Spackman's adjusted figures for the land component
of Durhambone, it seems
to me necessary for the Court to accept Mr Spackman's adjustments in relation
to the land content of that
sale.  Hence, in my judgment, any loss which may
have occurred in relation to the sale of Durhambone East, would have to take
into
account the component of the total purchase price which is properly to be
allocated to the purchase of the land and the improvements
at the figure $4.3
million.  Accepting Mr Spackman's market value at $4,760,000, the loss on a
`forced sale' basis becomes $460,000.00.
<P>

968	Mr Spackman did in his second report, give evidence that valuation is, by
its very nature, imprecise and that therefore there
is a degree of margin and
to the effect that the net result of the sale of Durhambone East falls within
an acceptable margin of his
valuation figures - this being, on his evidence,
generally within 10 percent, possibly more in a poor declining market.  He
notes
that the sale took place at a time of market uncertainty as prospects for
wheat and wool, two of the major influences on the Merrywinebone/Rowena
property markets, were deteriorating and eventually dropped dramatically after
the sale and did not improve again for at least six
years.
<P>

969	In those circumstances, Mr Spackman's evidence would suggest that no loss
was sustained on the basis here of any `forced sale'.
 As this was the only
valuation evidence called, it seems to me that it must be accepted.
<P>

970	I note that although the plaintiffs did not call evidence from a valuer in
contradiction of Mr Spackman's report, the plaintiffs
sought to rely on a bank
valuation [Exhibit PX 2/710], being a valuation of Durhambone by Mr Miller at
$10 million, excluding plant
and equipment, which valuation was dated 16
November 1989.
<P>

971	The plaintiffs' reliance upon that valuation runs into grave evidentiary
difficulties.  The $10 million figure in 1989 related
to the whole of
Durhambone and without valuation evidence in this regard, it cannot be
translated into a 1990 figure qua Durhambone
East.
<P>

972	Further, there was no attempt made by the plaintiffs' counsel in
cross-examination to contradict Mr Spackman in terms of putting
this 1989
valuation to him and suggesting that it was inconsistent with his valuation or
indicated that the value in July 1990 should
be different to that which Mr
Spackman had stated it was in his report.
<P>

	<b>Different Considerations Raised as Between the NRS and the Durhambone East
Sales</b>
<P>

973	The sale of NRS and the sale of Durhambone East on the evidence, raise
quite different considerations.  The circumstances in
which the sale of NRS
took place and the loss of confidence in NRS as a business have a real and
obvious and direct connection with
the Bank's breach of contract.  On the other
hand, the sale of Durhambone, has no such real, obvious or clear connection
with the
Bank's breach of contract.  I regard the sale of Durhambone on the
evidence, as a necessary event bearing in mind the Paola Group's
financial
position recognised from late 1989 and becoming steadily more urgent and
critical into mid-1990. 
<P>

	<b>Durhambone West</b>
<P>

974	The plaintiffs' claim here is that, had the Bank not exerted the pressure
it did on Currabubula, Durhambone West would have
been sold in one lot with
Durhambone East.  The basis for the claim is that Durhambone West was actually
sold on 16 June 1994 for
a purchase price of $1.304 million to the Harris
Family.  The plaintiffs submit that Mr Spackman's comment as to that value was
that
it appeared to reflect `a distressed market as well as reflecting the very
poor climatic conditions at the time of sale'.  The plaintiffs
point out that
Mr Spackman's valuation did not provide a valuation for Durhambone West as at
July 1990.  The plaintiffs submit that
Mr Spackman's valuation of Durhambone
West in May 1989, was $2.5 million market value or $2.250 million on a forced
sale basis.
<P>

975	In consequence, the plaintiffs submit that the pressure to sell Durhambone
East which is said to have led to a splitting of
the Durhambone aggregation,
prima facie caused the Group not to recover the proper value of Durhambone West
as it was in May 1989,
even giving some discount for the change in the rural
economy between that time and July 1990.
<P>

976	I reject the submission that the sale of Durhambone West was caused by the
Bank's breach of contract.  It had been proposed
to sell the whole of
Durhambone from late 1989/early 1990.  It was not the Bank's breach of contract
which caused the splitting of
the Durhambone aggregation.  The factors earlier
referred to which led to the sale of Durhambone East were the same factors as
led
to the splitting of the Durhambone aggregation.
<P>

977	I accept the defendant's further submission that there is no evidence to
support the claim to a `forced sale' loss.  The Court
is unable, in the absence
of evidence, to fix some figure to give `some discount for the change in the
rural economy between May
1989 and July 1990'.  The Court cannot, in the
absence of evidence, extrapolate from a May 1989 valuation of $2.5 million to
some
other valuation at July 1990.
<P>

978	In any event, I reject the plaintiffs' claim that the breach of contract
caused any loss on the sale of Durhambone West.  The
chain of causation breaks
down at threshold because I do not accept the proposition that the pressure to
sell Durhambone was the
cause of the splitting of the Durhambone aggregation.
Mr Paola had to sell Durhambone for reasons earlier set out, as a business
decision as a result of the financial circumstances of the Group and in a
context in which it was necessary for Durhambone to be
sold promptly or the
Group would get itself into a wholly unacceptable financial position later in
the year.  That was the reason
why the splitting occurred.
<P>

	<b>Gabo</b>
<P>

979	The plaintiffs' loss claimed on the sale of Gabo, derives from the fact
that it was sold on 30 August 1991 for $3.5 million,
including the then growing
crops.  The submission is that even on Mr Spackman's figures, this was below
the fair market value which
he found to be $3.9 million as at 30 August 1991.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs submit that since the sale of Gabo was required by
the Group in order to meet the demands of the Bank to repay the facilities, due
to the shortfall in the sale of Durhambone East and
the inability to sell
Durhambone East and West as an aggregation, the plaintiffs pursue an
entitlement to $400,000 for the sale of
Gabo.  The plaintiffs note again that
in valuing Gabo, Mr Spackman excluded plant, equipment and growing crops.
<P>

980	This property had been on the market since at least February 1991.  The
Bank's actions of which the plaintiffs' complain occurred
in February 1990.  In
my judgment, it cannot be said that the Gabo sale was caused by the Bank's
breach of contract in February 1990
or by the events of February 1990.
<P>

	<b>U-Bix</b>
<P>

981	The plaintiffs' claim here is that refusing to allow Currabubula to take
$390,000 from the proceeds of sale of Durhambone East,
breached the Bank's
promise that it would provide the financial accommodation promised in February
1990 up to $8.5 million for as
long as was desired by the Group, subject to the
limitations set out in the agreement.
<P>

982	The case is that the sale of Durhambone East was the result of a breach of
contract by the Bank.  That this was a continuing
breach still operative in
August and September 1990, which breach was comprised of the Bank failing to
advance further funds and
to honour the facility agreement.
<P>

983	The plaintiffs submit that the Court should categorise the refusal to
provide the $390,000 sum from the proceeds of sale as
a breach of the facility
agreement.
<P>

984	To my mind, the U-Bix claim fails at threshold.  Durhambone was part of the
security furnished by the Group to the Bank to cover
indebtedness of any of the
Group companies.  Where the secured creditor is approached to release any part
of the security to the
mortgagor, absent the secured creditor being paid out in
its entirety upon the sale of the subject property, the secured creditor
has a
contractual entitlement to retain the whole of the proceeds of realisation of
the portion of the security released.  In substance,
the mortgagor must be seen
as simply requesting a variation to the contract.  The mortgagee has no
obligation to agree to such a
request.  The defendant was within its
contractual entitlement in agreeing to release Durhambone East from its bank of
security properties
if, and only if, the whole of the proceeds of Durhambone
East were paid to the Bank in partial discharge of the antecedent indebtedness.
That the Bank here agreed to some small segments of the net proceeds of the
sale of Durhambone East being made available to the Group,
is simply a
reflection of the Bank's entitlement to make that concession.
<P>

985	Hence, I accept the defendant's submission that the agreement between the
parties contained an express condition that the facilities
would be secured by
registered mortgages over Durhambone;  that Durhambone was by far the most
valuable asset securing the facilities;
 that the plaintiffs could only obtain
a variation to the agreement if the Bank consented to the variation;  and that
where the variation
sought by the plaintiffs was the discharge of those
mortgages, the Bank was entitled to impose a condition on its agreement to the
variation, which required all the proceeds of sale of Durhambone to be paid to
it.
<P>

986	Thus the refusal by the Bank to release the sum of $390,000 was not a
breach of contract.
<P>

987	Even if the refusal to release the moneys had been a breach of contract,
the plaintiffs face insuperable obstacles to success
on the U-Bix claim.
<P>

988	I accept the Bank's submission that the losses claimed by the plaintiffs
here do not come within either branch of the rule in
<i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281854%29%209%20Exch%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1854) 9 Exch 341.</a>
<P>

989	Mr M.J. Lorimer, a Director of Grant Samuels &amp; Associates, who is an
investment banker and corporate adviser, gave evidence
that from June 1991 to
June 1993 the price of the U-Bix shares had risen rapidly.  On 28 June 1991,
the share price was $2.00 per
share.  On 28 June 1993, trading closed at a
price of $9.35 per share, this representing an increase of 467.5% over the two
year
period or approximately 216% per annum.
<P>

990	On his evidence, by comparison the New Zealand Share Market did not grow as
quickly.  The NZSE40 Capital Index represented approximately
97% by market
capitalisation of all the companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.
The movement on that index, on Mr Samuel's
evidence, is widely quoted and
generally accepted as approximate for the movement in the New Zealand
Sharemarket.  On Mr Lorimer's
evidence, on 28 June 1991 the NZSE40 Capital
Index closed at 1,434.98 and on 28 June 1993 closed at 1667.54.  This
represents an
increase of 15.9% over the same two year period or less than 8%
per annum.
<P>

991	On Mr Lorimer's evidence, he having practiced as a merchant banker for at
least 15 years including practice in the field of
investment advice, the
movement in the share price of U-Bix was exceptional and demonstrably well
outside any expectation that the
shares would rise in value through general
market conditions.  Mr Lorimer's evidence was:
<P>

	<i>`Based upon my knowledge and experience, it is my opinion that a buyer of
shares in U-Bix in 1990 would have had no reason to expect
that the share price
would increase at an annual rate 27 times that of the market as measured by the
NZSE capital index.'</i>
<P>

992	In my view, the lost profits could not be said to `arise naturally' from
the failure to release the subject funds.
<P>

993	Damages for lost profit on share transactions, in particular of the
magnitude of $20 to $30 million, I accept could not have
been within the
contemplation of any party at the time the facility agreement was entered into.
There is no evidence or allegation
of any communication between the parties
which would then attract the second limb of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>.
<P>

994	The claim in respect of U-Bix shares is a claim for deprivation of a
commercial opportunity.  Damages must therefore be quantified
by reference to
the Court's assessment of the prospects of success of that opportunity.
[<i>Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 332]</a>  The alleged
commercial opportunity was the opportunity to buy and sell U-Bix shares and to
realise a profit.
<P>

995	The factors which have to be taken into consideration in determining
whether or not the shares would have been purchased, include
the following:
<P>

	(i)	There was clearly no concluded agreement, or even an agreement in
principle, as at the time of the Durhambone East settlement
in early September.
The letter of 12 September 1990 [PX 1614] shows that there were still
unresolved matters.  Mr Paola could not,
at transcript 197.40, shed any light
on what they were.  Moreover, the vendors were still enquiring about Mr Paola's
companies' credit.
 The upshot was, I accept, that a straight out sale was
ruled out.  [PX 1726]
<P>

	(ii)	The vendor first offered the shares for sale at New Zealand $1.90 when
they were selling on market for New Zealand $1.45.
<P>

	(iii)	The vendor then in November 1990, offered an option to purchase the
shares at New Zealand $2.00 when they were selling on
market for New Zealand
$1.30.
<P>

	(iv)	The offers made by the plaintiff in 1991 to purchase the shares were
consistently less than their market value.
<P>

	(v)	The owner of the shares stated that it would only sell for a price that
was equivalent to the market value.  [PX 1945]
<P>

	(vi)	The owner of the shares did not sell until an offer was made by the Maori
Development Corporation, equivalent to the market
value.  As the Development
Corporation had been Mr Paola's partner in the purchase negotiations, I accept
that it should be assumed,
in the absence of evidence being called from the
Development Corporation, that Mr Paola had the opportunity to join in the final
and successful bid at New Zealand $2.00 but declined to do so because the price
was too high.
<P>

996	I further accept the Bank's submission that the factors which would have to
be taken into account concerning a sale of the shares,
assuming they had been
purchased by the plaintiffs, would include the following:
<P>

	(i)	There was no evidence at all that Mr Paola had the intention to or would
have sold the U-Bix shares whilst the market price
was high, or at all.  The
fact that evidence was not led from Mr Paola on this topic gives rise to the
inference that he could not
have given evidence that would have assisted his
case.  In those circumstances, I accept that it cannot be concluded that he has
established that there was any, or at least any significant, prospect of
earning the type of profit he claims on the sale of the
U-Bix shares.  Such
material as there is, suggests I accept, that he was going to be a long term
investor.  The contention that he
would have sold while the market price was
high has been entirely left in the realm of speculation.
<P>

	(ii)	The evidence does not establish that the holding costs of the shares
would have been met from dividends alone.  The existence
of any firm
arrangement for the payment of consultancy fees was not proved.
<P>

	(iii)	I do not accept that the plaintiffs have proved that there would have
been dividends/consultancy fees sufficient to take
up rights, issues and the
like.
<P>

	(iv)	The reason assumed by Mr Hardy but not supported by evidence from Mr
Paola, for the sale of shares - was that Mr Creighton
was to resign and that a
new capital raising was to be put into effect.  The Paola Group relied upon Mr
Paola's contention that he
had a close relationship with Mr Creighton who was
the Chief Executive of U-Bix and who sought Mr Paola's advice on company
matters.
 Mr Paola's case was that he was aware in early 1993 that Mr Creighton
was planning to leave the company as this was announced in
the June 1993 Annual
Report.  This was a reason why, according to Mr Hardy's report, Mr Paola would
have sold the shares in the relevant
period.  To my mind, the evidence does not
sustain the proposition that Mr Paola would have sold the shares for reasons
relating
to Mr Creighton.  Had Mr Paola purchased the subject shareholding, no
inference can be drawn that Mr Creighton would have resigned
anyway, Mr Paola
on this hypothesis being on the Board, and their relations being good.
<P>

	(v)	The turnover of shares was approximately $2.5million each six months and
if an additional $3.5million shares had been sold
within any six month period,
it would have led to share prices being considerably lower.
<P>

997	There is further difficulty in relation to the U-Bix claim.  The losses
would in any event, only be available to Currabubula
and Paola Holdings, the
latter having become a party to the proceedings by the 29 September 1997 order,
after the expiration of the
limitation period.
<P>

998	The negotiations were being carried on by Mr Paola on behalf of a company
to be formed.  That company, Leman Pty Limited, was
acquired as a shelf company
on 14 September 1990 when 99 of the issued shares were transferred to Paola
Holdings and the remaining
share was transferred to Currabubula Holdings on
trust for Paola Holdings.
<P>

999	I accept the Bank's submission that any cause of action in relation to a
loss of opportunity to make a profit on the U-Bix shares
arose on 4 September
1990 when the Bank, in its letter, unequivocally refused to release the
$390,000 sum from the proceeds of sale
of Durhambone.  That request had been
made by Currabubula (as the owner of Durhambone), and if the failure to release
those funds
was a breach of the agreement with the Bank, then Currabubula was
the party entitled to damages.  As it acquired 1% of Leman Pty
Limited, any
damages to which it would be entitled would only be 1% of what would otherwise
have been payable by way of compensation.
<P>

1000	I accept the Bank's submission that the refusal to release the funds
having taken place on 4 September 1990, any cause of action
which Paola
Holdings may have had, would have expired on 4 September 1996 which was before
Paola Holdings was added as a plaintiff
and would therefore be statute
barred.
<P>

1001	The Bank also submitted that the Paola Group had not made good on the
evidence the proposition that the refusal by the Bank
at the beginning of
September 1990 to release $390,000 to the Group was the reason why the subject
shares could not be purchased.
 In this regard, the Bank relied upon the
evidence that immediately after the sale of Durhambone had been completed, Mr
Paola's solicitors
had continued to negotiate for and work on the documentation
for the sale of the U-Bix shares and that, as Mr Paola conceded, he
would not
have continued to incur legal costs if he had not thought he could obtain the
necessary funds.  [T205.5]  The Bank also
relies upon the evidence that Mr
Paola continued to negotiate for the purchase of the shares throughout the
remainder of 1990 and
up to the middle of 1991.  To my mind, there is substance
in the Bank's submission that this conduct by Mr Paola is inconsistent
with his
assertion that the refusal by the Bank to release the $390,000 to him at the
beginning of September 1990 was the reason
why he could not purchase the
shares.  It is unnecessary however for the reasons earlier given that I reach a
decision on whether
as a matter of fact Mr Paola had the funds available for
the deposit.  He had of course recently purchased a property `Cassels' for
$200,000 which was not secured to the Bank.  [T 199.1]  That property may have
been available to sell or mortgage in order to raise
funds.  Also, Mr Paola did
concede that as late as September 1990, there was scope for additional security
to be taken over Gabo.
<P>

1002	For all these reasons, the claim in respect of the U-Bix shares fails.
<P>

	<b>Loss of Opportunity to Refinance</b>
<P>

1003	The plaintiffs assert that loss of opportunity to refinance may be claimed
where the Bank had no right to freeze the facility,
or if it be found that it
did have such a right, that there was either a binding contractual provision or
alternatively, an estoppel
to the effect that the plaintiffs would be granted
time to refinance.
<P>

1004	To my mind, the plaintiffs' claim to loss of opportunity to refinance
fails, there being no evidence to the effect that the
freezing of the accounts
prevented any opportunity to refinance or prevented any refinancing.  Hence,
the claim to damages for `loss
of opportunity' simply fails at a threshold
level.  Had Mr Paola been in a position to give evidence that the freezing of
the accounts
had prevented refinancing, no doubt such evidence would have been
given.
<P>

1005	It is convenient to turn next to the Defamation case.
<P>

	<b>Dealing with the Case in Defamation</b>
<P>

1006	In paragraphs 40 and 41 of the amended summons, Currabubula Holdings seeks
damages for defamation.  No claim is made on this
cause of action by any other
company.
<P>

1007	Until the final day of the hearing, the amended summons had relied upon
only one bank statement, issued to Currabubula Holdings,
bearing the notation
`in liq' upon it.  That statement was said to relate to account number 00183734
and to have been published on
14 February 1990.  At the conclusion of the
hearing on 22 February 1999, leave was granted to Currabubula Holdings to amend
the second
schedule to the amended summons by deleting the reference to the 14
February 1990 statement and by substituting references to seven
bank statements
issued to Currabubula Holdings on account number 29-0674-00 said to have been
published on 21, 23 and 28 February
1990 and on 7, 14, 21 and 28 March 1990.
<P>

1008	Currabubula Holdings also presses its claim in relation to the publication
of other bank statements issued to NRS, ABE Holdings
and Pyojit.
<P>

1009	The statements in question are:
<P>

	NRS (Gunnedah)	- Account 670983.00 - statement for 16 February 1990
<P>

	NRS (Narrabri)	- Account 690181-00 - statements for 16 and 23 February and 2,
6 March 1990
<P>

	NRS (Tamworth)	- Account 290420-00 - statements for 16 February and for 7, 14
and 21 March 1990.
<P>

	ABE (Holdings)	- Account 29-0674-00 - statement for 21 February 1990
<P>

	Pyojit 			- Account 64113900 - statements for 15 and 22 February 1990
<P>

1010	The Bank does not dispute the sending of the statements.  They were
received at the general office in Tamworth of NRS.  This
was the general office
of NRS.  It was also the general office at which Mr Plante worked and from
which, as Group Secretary, he carried
out his responsibilities on behalf of
Group companies.  The Bank routinely communicated with Group companies by
sending correspondence
and facsimiles to this office.  The 1 February 1990
facility letter was, for example, sent to this office.  The primary method of
communication adopted by the Bank and the Group was by using facsimile.
[T482-483]  It will be recalled that Mr Giblet had picked
up a handful of
statements, all of which had the `in liq' notation.  Ms Hamblin gave evidence
which I accept that Mr Taylor, Mr Thornhill
and Ms Sykes as well as herself
looked at the statements.  There was only the one facsimile machine in the fax
room which `was in
the centre of the office'.  Her evidence was that this was
an area where, all the paperwork went to because a lot of faxes namely
orders,
were received and sent.  Her evidence was that the statements `were always to
be left there'.
<P>

1011	The Bank then submits that the only persons who saw the bank statements
were Paola Group employees, each of whom knew or could
be expected to know or
be told, that the company was not in liquidation.  The Bank submits that Mr
Paola could have sought written
confirmation from the Bank that it was the
loan, rather than the company which was in liquidation, if he considered the
statement
created a difficulty.  In those circumstances, the Bank submits that
it was unlikely in the extreme that Currabubula would suffer
any harm as a
result of the publication and that the Bank is entitled to the defence under
section 13 of the <i>Defamation Act</i>.
<P>

1012	The Bank then relies upon the fact that ABE Fax had in 1989, been placed
in receivership which the Bank suggests is similar
to liquidation and had its
corporate title noted accordingly.  The Bank submits that Mr Paola's proposal
of 12 February 1990 would
have resulted in similar steps in relation to ABE
Holdings.  These, the Bank submits, did not appear to cause Mr Paola or his
Group
any concern and yet the Bank submits they were clear indications to all
who became aware of them, both inside and outside the Group,
of insolvency
within the Group.  The Bank's submission is that in the light of Mr Paola's
lack of sensitivity to these, the Bank
could not reasonably have been expected
to contemplate that marking bank statements which were purely for the Group's
use with an
indication that the loans were in liquidation, would cause
Currabubula to suffer any harm.
<P>

1013	It is common ground that the statements complained of had the notation `in
liq' at the foot of the balance column of each statement.
 Examples of
statements complained of are included as Appendix 10 to this Judgment.
<P>

1014	In a number of instances, the statements were addressed to the secretary
of the company in whose name the account was operated.
 In some instances, the
statements were addressed to `the proprietors' of the company in whose name the
account was operated.  In
certain instances the statements were addressed `the
directors' of the company in question.  In a number of cases, the words `Please
hold statements' or `Hold statements' appeared in the box showing the
addresses, as in:
<P>

	`The Secretary
<P>

	Northern Rural Services Pty Ltd
<P>

	Please Hold Statements
<P>

	Gunnedah Branch  NSW  2030'
<P>

1015	The imputations said to arise from the sending of the bank statements
are:
<P>

	(1)	 that Currabubula was insolvent and 
<P>

	(2)	that a liquidator had been appointed to Currabubula - paragraph 40 of the
second further amended summons.
<P>

1016	Currabubula alleges that it suffered loss of business reputation and loss
of cash flow and dividend income and a reduction
in the value of its
shareholding in Paola Holdings.
<P>

1017	The plaintiffs' submission is that the sending of the statements had a
significant effect on the fortunes of the Paola Group.
 Mr Paola's evidence at
transcript 144 to 146 has already been set out in the judgment.  He had never
seen `in liq' on a bank statement
before and was stunned by reading those words
on the bank statements.  He said to those whom he spoke about the statements
that the
company was not in fact in liquidation.  Mr Giblet, as has already
been mentioned, said to Mr Paola: `Anyone can see you are in liquidation
and
that the Bank does not lie'.  [T 55]
<P>

1018	Ms Hamblin's evidence in relation to being shown the bank statements has
also been set out.  As soon as she saw the bank statements,
she believed that
the company was in liquidation.  The statements seemed very confusing to her
and to her observation Mr Plante appeared
as confused as she was.  She counted
`the trouble starting' when the bank statements came out with the words `in
liq' on them and
people started looking elsewhere for employment.  She gave
evidence that she had not observed any difficulties with the NRS business
insofar as she was involved in answering telephones or otherwise, prior to the
bank statements arriving with the `in liq' notations.
 Mr Taylor recalled staff
morale and confidence in the business of NRS being `further damaged' when, in
the day or so after he was
notified of cheques being dishonoured, the bank
statements were sent to NRS with the `in liq' notations on their face.
Employees
such as Mr Plante said to him:  "NRS shouldn't be in liquidation" and
Mr Taylor, following receipt of the bank statements and recognising
that
cheques had been dishonoured, said to all of the staff:  "It looks like it's
all over, I suggest you all get another job if
you can.  <u>The company is in
liquidation</u>".  Mr Taylor, as a result of the bank statements and the
dishonouring of cheques, formed the view that NRS was in fact in liquidation
and that the business had ceased.
<P>

1019	These reactions to the notations and the evidence of what then occurred
are relevant to questions of causation and loss.  The
Court itself decides,
however, whether the words used convey the imputations alleged.
<P>

1020	The essential elements of the tort of defamation are that defamatory
words, of and concerning the plaintiff, have been published
to third parties.
I accept the plaintiffs' submission that there is little doubt that, if the
words otherwise can bear the meaning
that NRS, for example, was bankrupt or in
liquidation, then this was defamatory, as it imputes a lack of business acumen
to the entity.
<P>

<P>

1021	It is of course the case that with regard to a company `it is impossible
to lay down an exhaustive rule as to what would be
a libel on [it].  Cf Lord
Esher M R in <i>South Hetton Coal Co Ltd v North-Eastern News Association
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1894%5d%201%20QB%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1894] 1 QB 133</a> at page 139.
<P>

1022	At page 142, Lord Esher makes the point that it is clear that a
corporation at common law may maintain an action for a libel
by which its
property is injured.
<P>

1023	Lord Esher goes on to make the point that statements may be made with
regard to the mode of carrying on business of a firm
or company, such as to
lead people of ordinary sense to the opinion that the firm or company conducts
their business badly and inefficiently.
 If so, his Lordship says:  `the law
will be the same in their case as in that of an individual, and the statement
will be libellous'.
<P>

1024	At page 141, Lord Esher makes the point that the words complained of must
attack the corporation or company in the method of
conducting its affairs, must
accuse it of fraud or mismanagement, or must attack its financial position.
<P>

1025	Kay LJ in <i>South Hetten </i>at page 145, makes the point that the
property or business of a trading corporation may be injured by defamatory
statements, whether
written or oral.  Also that a trading corporation has a
trading character, the defamation of which may ruin it:
<P>

	<i>`If, for example, an individual, a private partnership, or a corporation
were carrying on a trading business, and someone wrote and
published an untrue
statement that they were insolvent, or any other statement which might destroy
their credit or paralyse their
business, it is obvious that such a statement,
if untrue, would be a libel.'</i>
<P>

1026	It is not necessary for the statement to be defamatory that there be any
further imputation or implication that the directors
are trading improperly
whilst the company is insolvent or have contributed in some way to the
company's insolvency.  As Schiemann
LJ observed in <i>Aspro</i>:
<P>

	<i>` . . . it can be defamatory to say of a man that he is insolvent or cannot
or will not pay his debts or has delayed paying his debts
. . . This is so
notwithstanding that it requires no ingenuity  to contemplate circumstances in
which a man's insolvency is not attributable
to any fault on his part . . .
such an allegation would tend to injure a man's credit which the law protects
as part of his reputation.'
   </i>[1995 4 All ER at 733]
<P>

1027	The Bank submits that the placing of the words `in liq' underneath the
balance of the account, as opposed to alongside the
name of the company, makes
plain that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words as here used, was that
the loan, and not the
company, was in liquidation.  In short, the Bank submits
that the material does not convey the imputations alleged and is not
defamatory.
<P>

1028	On my finding, the words used convey each of the imputations complained
of.  The question is one for the Court's determination.
 An ordinary reasonable
reader would come to the conclusion that both imputations were conveyed by the
publications.  Had this been
a case with a jury, my finding would have been
that it was clearly open to a jury to hold that reasonable persons would
understand
the words complained of in a defamatory sense.
<P>

1029	The bank statements were formal documents issued to the companies in
question.  In finding that the words used convey the imputations
complained of,
I rely upon the ordinary natural meaning of the words `in liquidation' as used
in relation to a company.  As to the
placement of the notation on the
statements, I note that there is no natural tethering of the notation to the
figures shown in the
`balance' column, nor necessarily to that column itself.
The bank statements appear to have been prepared by a Bank employee instructed
to include the words `in liq' upon the bank statements, the instruction having
been carried out by a prominent capitalised notation
placed at the logical end
of the five columns dealing with `Date', `Particulars', `Debit', `Credit' and
`Balance'.
<P>

1030	In relation to the question of the publishing of the statements, the
Bank's submission is that there was no evidence of publication
beyond the
persons in the relevant Group offices.  Currabubula on the other hand, submits
that the statements were relevantly published
to the staff of the companies who
received the faxes as there was no attempt, it is said, to mark the letters as
being confidential
or private to, for example, the Board.  In this regard,
Currabubula Holdings cites <i>Pullman v Walter Hill &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%201%20QB%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 1 QB
524</a> at 527 where Lord Esher MR said :
<P>

	<i>`The first question is, whether, assuming the letter to contain defamatory
matter, there has been a publication of it.  What is the
meaning of
"publication"?  The making known the defamatory matter after it has been
written to some person other than the person
of whom it is written.  If the
statement is sent straight to the person of whom it is written, there is no
publication of it;  for
you cannot publish a libel of a man to himself.  If
there was no publication, the question whether the occasion was privileged does
not arise.  If a letter is not communicated to anyone but the person to whom it
is written, there is no publication of it.  And,
if the writer of a letter
locks it up in his own desk, and a thief comes and breaks open the desk and
takes away the letter and makes
it's contents known, I should say that would
not be a publication.  If the writer of a letter shows it to his own clerk in
order
that the clerk may copy it for him, is that a publication of the letter?
Certainly it is showing it to a third person;  the writer
cannot say to the
person to whom the letter is addressed, "I have shown it to you and to no one
else".  </i><cite>I cannot, therefore, feel any doubt that, if the writer of a
letter shows it to any person other than the person to whom it is written,
he
publishes it</cite><i>.  If he wishes not to publish it, he must, so far as he
possibly can, keep it to himself, or he must send it himself straight to
the
person to whom it is written.  There was, therefore, in this case a publication
to the type-writer.'    </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

1031	<i>Pullman</i> involved a libel contained in a letter respecting the
plaintiffs, two of the members of a partnership, written on behalf of the
defendants,
a limited company, and sent by post in an envelope addressed to the
firm.  The writer did not know that there were other partners
in the firm.  The
letter was dictated by the managing director of the defendants to a clerk, who
took down the words in shorthand
and then wrote them out in full by means of a
`type-writing machine'.  The letter thus written, was copied by an office boy
in a
copying-press.  When it reached its destination, it was in the ordinary
course of business opened by a clerk of the firm, and was
read by two other
clerks.  The Court of Appeal, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, held
that the letter must be taken to
have been published both to the plaintiffs'
clerks and the defendants' clerks and that neither occasion was privileged.
<P>

1032	In dealing further with the question of publication, Lord Esher said:
<P>

	<i>`The letter was not directed to the plaintiffs in their individual
capacity;  it was directed to a firm of which they were members.
 The senders
of the letter no doubt believed that it would go to the plaintiffs;  but it was
directed to a firm.  When the letter
arrived it was opened by a clerk in the
employment of the plaintiffs' firm, and </i><cite>was seen by three of the
clerks in their office</cite><i>.  If the letter had been directed to the
plaintiffs in their private capacity, in all probability it would not have been
opened by
a clerk.  </i><cite>But mercantile firms and large tradesmen
generally depute some clerk to open business letters addressed to
them</cite><i>.  The sender of the letter had put it out of his own control,
and he had directed it in such a manner that it might possibly be opened
by a
clerk of the firm to which it was addressed.  I agree that under such
circumstances there was a publication of the letter by
the sender of it, and in
this case also the occasion was not privileged for the same reasons as in the
former case . . .'   </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

1033	Lopes LJ said, inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`The first question is whether there has been any publication of the
alleged libel.  What is meant by publication?  The communication
of the
defamatory matter to a third person.  Here a communication was made by the
defendants' managing director to the type-writer.
 Moreover, the letter was
directed to the plaintiffs' firm and was opened by one of their clerks.  The
sender might have written
"Private" outside it, in order to prevent its being
opened by a clerk.  </i><cite>The defendants placed the letter out of their own
control, and took no means to prevent its being opened by the plaintiffs'
clerks</cite><i>.  In my opinion therefore, there was a publication of the
letter, not only to the typewriter, but also to the clerks of the plaintiffs'
firm . . .'</i>   [Emphasis added]
<P>

	[1891 1 QB at 529]
<P>

1034	<i>Theaker v Richardson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20WLR%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 WLR 151</a>, was a case where the
plaintiff and the defendant were both members of their local district council
and candidates in an imminent
council election.  As a result of ill-feeling
between them, the defendant wrote an abusive letter to the plaintiff in highly
defamatory
language.  The letter was typed by the defendant, placed in a
manilla business envelope and sealed by gumming down the flap, which
was
further secured with Sellotape.  The envelope was addressed to the plaintiff in
her married name with the addition of the appellation
`Coun.' before the word
`Mrs'.  The defendant himself put the letter through the letter-box of the
house where the plaintiff lived
with her husband and married daughter.  Shortly
afterwards the plaintiff's husband entered the house, saw the letter on the mat
and
opened it, thinking it was an election address.
<P>

1035	Harman LJ said:
<P>

	<i>`A number of cases on publication was cited to us but each obviously
depends on its own facts and no one is very pertinent to the
instant case.  In
the leading case, Delacroix v Thevenot</i>,<i> the plaintiff's success
depended</i> <i>on the facts that the libel was addressed to his place of
business and that the defendant knew that a clerk employed there read his
master's letters.  To a similar effect are Pullman v Hill &amp; Co and
Gomersall v Davies, . . . In Huth v Huth the publication was
said to be to the
butler who opened the letter out of mere inquisitiveness, and the claim failed
because this was a breach of the
butler's duty not to be anticipated by the
defendant.  In Sharp v Skues the jury answered in the negative a question as to
the knowledge
on the defendant's part of the likelihood of the letter being
opened by a clerk or partner of the plaintiff's.  Lord Cozens - Hardy
M.R. said
this:</i>
<P>

<i>	"It would be a publication if the defendant intended the letter to be
opened by a clerk or some third person not the plaintiff, or
if to the
defendant's knowledge it would be opened by a clerk;  but the jury had
negatived this in the clearest terms, and under
these circumstances it was
impossible to hold that some act done by a partner or a clerk of the plaintiff
by his direction and for
his own convenience when absent from the office could
be a publication by the defendant under circumstances which the jury have
found,
in answer to question 2, the defendant knew could not possibly
happen".</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[1962 1 WLR at page 157]
<P>

1036	Harman LJ continued at page 157:
<P>

	<i>`It thus appears that the answer to the question of publication of a liable
contained in a letter </i><cite>will depend on the state of the defendant's
knowledge, either proved or inferred</cite><i>, of the conditions likely to
prevail in the place to which the liable is destined.'  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

1037	In the present case it was customary for the Bank to communicate with the
subject Group by facsimile.  I infer that the Bank
would assume that the
facsimile machine in the main office to which the bank statements were sent,
would be manned by employees and
not necessarily by the secretary or directors
of the relevant company.
<P>

1038	On the Bank's submissions, the evidence shows that the bank statements
were seen only by Mr Paola, who knew that the company
was not in liquidation;
by Mr Taylor who was told by Mr Paola and by Mr Plante that the company was not
in liquidation;  by Mr Giblet
who was told by Mr Paola that the company was not
in liquidation, by Mr Terrey, by Mr Plante who was familiar with liquidations
and
`all things meant by liquidations' and who, on the Bank's submissions,
presumably knew that the company was not in liquidation and
by Ms Hamblin who
the Bank submits `knew that the company was not in liquidation which was
confirmed to her by Mr Plante'.
<P>

1039	Hence, the Bank submits that except for Mr Terrey, the evidence shows that
the persons who saw the statement either knew that
the company was not in
liquidation or were told by its senior executives that it was not in
liquidation.
<P>

1040	The Bank then submits that there is no evidence that there was any
publication of the defamatory material beyond those persons
and importantly
that there is no evidence of publication or republication to creditors,
suppliers or the community.
<P>

1041	I reject this submission.  I have generally dealt with the factual issue
above.  The quotation set out in paragraph 812 above,
is taken from <i>Ley v
Hamilton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%20153%20LT%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 153 LT 384</a> at page 386, a defamation case where Lord Atkin
stated that `It is precisely because the "real" damage cannot be ascertained
and
established that the damages are at large.  It is impossible to track the
scandal . . .'.
<P>

1042	The Bank submits that publication was extremely restricted and that there
is no evidence of damage, either special damage or
otherwise and that no
damages should therefore be awarded for defamation.  I note in particular in
relation to the submission that
publication was limited, Mr Hardy's evidence in
relation to the rapidity with which such news travels in country areas and to
the
evidence given by Ms Hamblin.  Damages are dealt with below.
<P>

1043	I turn to examine the defences relied upon.
<P>

1044	Section 13 of the <i>Defamation Act (1974) NSW</i> provides:
<P>

	<i>`It is a defence that the circumstances of the publication of the matter
complained of were such that the person defamed was not likely
to suffer
harm'.</i>
<P>

1045	The section was generally examined by Moffit P in <i>Chappell v Mirror
Newspapers Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2080%2d691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) AustTortsR 80-691</a> and later by the Court of Appeal in
<i>King &amp; Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 305.</a>
<P>

1046	In <i>Chappell</i>, Moffit P said:
<P>

	<i>`The quality of the circumstances of the publication must be the factor
which renders it unlikely that the person defamed will suffer
harm.  Whereas a
defamatory imputation is actionable per se, without damage (s 8-9), so that a
defendant cannot defeat an action
even if he were able to prove that there was
no actual damage, the defence under s 13 is directed entirely to the
circumstances of
the publication.  It does not change the general law so the
defendant can raise an issue on the probabilities whether there is in
fact harm
caused to the person defamed.  </i><cite>The issue is directed to the quality
of the publication in respect of its proneness to cause harm.</cite><i>  The
words of s 13 are "was not likely to suffer harm" and "did not suffer harm"
(meaning "probably did not suffer harm").  </i><cite>The quality of the
circumstances of the publication determines at the moment of publication
whether it is or is not actionable</cite><i>.  Actionability does not depend
upon an inquiry as to what thereafter happens and in particular whether or not
harm in fact probably
resulted from the publication.  </i><cite>The defence
depends entirely on the causative potency of the circumstances "of the
publication" to produce immunity from harm.</cite><i>  Hence it is not
sufficient to establish a s 13 defence that a defendant merely proves "in all
the circumstances" that it is unlikely
the plaintiff will suffer harm and even
less that the plaintiff has not in fact suffered harm.  To regard s 13 as
providing a defence
in either of these cases would in a practical sense destroy
the fundamental concept of the law of defamation earlier referred to.
 There
would be substituted in any action for defamation no more than a rebuttable
presumption of fact that damage flows from a defamatory
imputation.'    </i>[At
page 68947]
<P>

	Moffit P went on to discuss the purpose and operation of the section:
<P>

	<i>The apparent purpose of s 13 and its predecessors, despite some difference
in their terms and application, was to give a defence to
and hence discourage
actions for trivial defamation.  </i>
<P>

<i>	This will arise in particular where there is a limited publication.  This
will more often be the case where the defamation is oral
but will sometimes
extend to a written defamation.  Examples of written defamatory imputations of
trivial impact published by letter
or circular to a limited or particular class
of persons can be readily thought of.</i>
<P>

<i>	. . . there should not be substituted for the circumstances "of the
publication" the circumstances "concerning the defamatory imputation"
or
"concerning the person defamed".  Further, the circumstances are "of" the
publication and not "concerning" the publication.  The
word "of" more directly
ties the circumstances to the acts of publication.  "The circumstances of the
publication" must admit some
context, but that context must be such as will
serve to define the circumstances of the publication and their relevant
operation
in relation to the likelihood of harm.  There cannot be admitted
under their umbrella circumstances which are not related to the
publication.
The second matter is that the circumstances as defined by the section must be
the factors which operate to establish
that the person defamed is not likely to
suffer harm.  The words "such as" require this causal relationship to exist in
order that
the defence be made out.  This causal relationship is not
established if it is other circumstances, not part of the context of the
circumstances of the publication earlier referred to, which have to be relied
on to produce likely immunity from harm, if such likely
immunity would not have
existed without these extraneous circumstances.'</i>   [At page 68, 947-8]
<P>

1047	In<i> King &amp; Mergen</i> the defendant had relied on s 13 on the ground
that the defamatory material was published to persons previously aware of its
contents.
 The defendant submitted that, as a result, those persons to whom the
material was published would not have taken a different view
of the plaintiff
after publication and so he was not likely to suffer harm as a result of the
publication.  The Court of Appeal considered
that the defence should have gone
to the jury on this basis.  Mahoney JA (with whom Clarke JA and Meagher JA
agreed on this point)
stated:
<P>

	<i>. . . the question considered and decided in Chappell's case was the
meaning of "the circumstances of the publication . . ." and what
was decided
was that those circumstances did not include the fact that, prior to the
publiction, the plaintiff already had a bad
reputation.  In the present case,
the defendants did not suggest - at least there was no agreement at the trial -
that the plaintiff,
before publication of the notice, had a bad reputation.
The nub of the defendants' case was that, prior to the publication, the persons
to whom the defamatory matter was published already knew the material that was
contained in the notice.  The contention was that,
because of this, they would
not have thought differently of the plaintiff after the publication and so he
was not likely to suffer
harm.</i>
<P>

<i>	On this approach, the defendants' case under s 13 went to (to adapt the
language of Moffitt P) "some quality concerning" the persons
to whom the
defamatory matter was published and not "some quality concerning" the plaintiff
of whom it was published.  Section 13
was therefore available in this case
</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Mahoney JA then went on to consider whether this distinction as made in
Chappell was a valid one:
<P>

	<i>As, I think, the learned trial judge indicated by his judgment, a
distinction of this kind is a fine distinction.  His Honour adverted
to the
fact that a plaintiff's "bad" reputation will consist of or at least involve
what other persons think of him:  see, eg, Plato
Films Ltd v Speidel  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20AC%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] AC
1090</a> at 1131-2, per Lord Radcliffe.  Therefore, harm to his reputation is
likely to be suffered insofar as something is published to persons
which may
lead them to think less of the plaintiff.  That, at least in part, is true.
And, the argument suggests, there would be
incongruity in providing a defence
under s 13 where there will be no harm because the publishee knows beforehand
what is published
but in not providing a defence where, as it is inferred, the
publisher already has a bad view of the plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	But, if there be such incongruity, it arises not from the terms of s 13 but
from presuppositions as to what ought to be the defence
available to a
defendant.  Section 13 might have provided that there was a defence if "in all
the circumstances" the person defamed
was not likely to suffer harm from the
publication.  In such a case, his prior bad reputation would be proved to show
that he was
not likely to suffer harm from the instant imputation.  But, as
Moffitt P pointed out in his judgment, the section did not so provide.
</i><cite> It provided a defence only where, by reason of more restricted
matters, viz, the circumstances of the publication, the plaintiff
was not
likely to suffer harm.</cite><i>  If the restricted nature of the defence be
recognised, then there is, in my opinion, no such incongruity.  And,
accordingly, the
principle established by Chappell's case does not apply where
that which the defendant suggests as the basis of the s 13 defence,
viz, what
the publishers already knew, falls within what, as Moffitt P explained, is the
meaning of "the circumstances of the publication"
. . . As I have indicated,
Chappell's case decided that the s 13 defence exists only where the fact that
the plaintiff "was not likely
to suffer harm" arose because of "the
circumstances of the publication . . .".  And, in addition, it held that the
pre-existing bad
reputation of the plaintiff was not one of "the circumstances
of the publication . . .".</i>
<P>

<i>	In my opinion, Chappell's case was correctly decided in respect of each of
these matters.  As a matter of statutory construction,
it is I think clear that
it is to be by reason of the circumstances of the publication that the
plaintiff was not likely to suffer
harm, for the purposes of the defence.
There is no reason requiring departure from the ordinary meaning of the
section.'</i>
<P>

1048	The Section 13 defence fails.  The circumstances of the publication into
the facsimile machine situate in the main office manned
by sundry employees
likely to read the bank statements were clearly not `such that the [companies]
defamed were not likely to suffer
harm'.  If there be any pre-existing
indications of cash flow difficulties and/or of the holding back or even
dishonour of some cheques,
these matters were not `circumstances of the
publication'.  The defence runs when `by reason of the circumstances of the
publication
the plaintiff was not likely to suffer harm'.
<P>

1049	Section 22 of the Act provides:
<P>

	<i>`(1)	Where, in respect of matter published to any person:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the recipient has an interest or apparent interest in having
information on some subject,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to him
information on that subject,  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the conduct of the publisher in publishing that matter is reasonable in
the circumstances,</i>
<P>

<i>	there is a defence of qualified privilege for that publication.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), a person has an apparent interest
in having information on some subject if, but only if,
at the time of the
publication in question, the publisher believes on reasonable grounds that that
person has that interest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)	Where matter is published for reward in circumstances in which there
would be a qualified privilege under subsection (1) for
the publication if it
were not for reward, there is a defence of qualified privilege for that
publication notwithstanding that it
is for reward.'</i>
<P>

1050	The Bank submits that at the time it sent the bank statements to
Currabubula Holdings (restricting its submission in this way
as it asserts that
it is Currabubula alone which pursues this cause of action), it believed that
Currabubula had an interest in knowing
both the existing balance in its account
and that the account was in liquidation. The Bank asserts that this belief and
its conduct
in providing the information on the premise of this belief, was
reasonable. The bank therefore claims the defence of qualified privilege
in s22
above. [Defendant's overview submissions, paragraph 52]
<P>

1051	In <i>Theophanous v Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%2d94%29%20182%20CLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993-94) 182 CLR
104</a> at 138, the majority of the High Court (Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ)
made clear that reasonableness is a question of fact in
the circumstances.
<P>

1052	In <i>Morgan v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd (No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR
374</a>, the Court of Appeal considered at length the statutory defence of
qualified privilege, and in particular, the requirement set out
in subsection
(1) (c), that the publisher's conduct be reasonable in the circumstances.
<P>

1053	Hunt A-JA, with whom Samuels JA and Mahoney JA agreed, set out the
following propositions to be proved by the defendant in
relation to the
`reasonableness requirement':
<P>

	<i>`(1)	The conduct must have been reasonable in the circumstances to publish
each imputation found to have been in fact conveyed by
the matter complained
of.  The more serious the imputation conveyed, the greater the obligation upon
the defendant to ensure that
his conduct in relation to it was reasonable.  Of
course, if any other defence (such as truth or comment) has already been
established
in relation to any particular imputation found to have been so
conveyed, it is unnecessary to consider the reasonableness of the
defendant's
conduct in relation to the publication of that particular imputation.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	If the defendant intended to convey any imputation in fact conveyed, he
must (subject to the exceptional case discussed in Barbaro's
case, and perhaps
also that discussed in Collins v Ryan) have believed in the truth of that
imputation.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)	If the defendant did not intend to convey any particular imputation in
fact conveyed, he must establish:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	that (subject to the same exceptions) he believed in the truth of each
imputation which he did intend to convey;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that his conduct was nevertheless reasonable in the circumstances in
relation to each imputation which he did not intend to convey
but which was in
fact conveyed.</i>
<P>

<i>	If, for example, it were reasonably foreseeable that the matter complained
of might convey the imputation which the jury finds was
in fact conveyed, it
will be relevant to the decision concerning s 22(1)(c) as to whether the
defendant gave any consideration to
the possibility that the matter complained
of would be understood as conveying such an imputation, as will be his belief
in the truth
of that particular imputation and what steps he took to prevent
the matter complained of being so understood:  Evatt v John Fairfax
&amp; Sons
Ltd at 13-14;  Makim v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%205%20BR%20196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 5 BR 196</a> at 209;  see
also Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission at 712 (whether the defendant
"knew whether he was likely to convey
a misleading impression");  Austin v
Mirror Newspapers Ltd (at 362) (Privy Council).</i>
<P>

<i>	(4)	The defendant must also establish:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	that, before publishing the matter complained of, he exercised
reasonable care to ensure that he got his conclusions right, (where
appropriate) by making proper inquiries and checking on the accuracy of his
sources;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that his conclusions (whether statements of fact or expressions of
opinion) followed logically, fairly and reasonably from the
information which
he had obtained;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	that the matter and extent of the publication did not exceed what was
reasonably required in the circumstances;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	that each imputation intended to be conveyed was relevant to the
subject about which he is giving information to his readers.'</i>
<P>

1054	Hunt JA then says at page 388:
<P>

	<i>`It is necessary to keep in mind that each of the matters referred to in
par (4) are relevant to the reasonableness of the defendant's
conduct;  they do
not raise questions independently of that issue.'</i>
<P>

1055	In this way, s22(1)(c) is directed not at the extent of the interest of
the recipient in knowing the truth, but to the reasonableness
of the
defendant's conduct in publishing the particular matter (Hunt A-JA at 389 in
reference to the decision in <i>Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NSWLR%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NSWLR 697).</a>
<P>

1056	The basis of the plaintiff's argument is that given Currabubula already
knew that the account had been placed in liquidation,
on the prior advice of
the Bank, it was unnecessary, and I infer unreasonable, for the Bank to then
fax the bank statements to the
general office area. [Plaintiff's overview
submissions, para 217]
<P>

1057	In my view, proposition (3) as put forward by Hunt A-JA, which is relevant
to these facts, has not been made out by the Bank.
Whether or not the Bank
intended to convey the imputations which I have found were in fact conveyed,
the conduct of the Bank in publishing
the matter was unreasonable in the
circumstances.
<P>

1058	Further, to my mind, it is not open to the Bank to assert that as the
statements were confidential, the Bank could not foresee
that their contents
would be made available to any persons other than senior officers of
Currabubula Holdings. [Defendant's overview
submissions, para 52]
<P>

1059	As I have previously set out, the statements were not marked
`confidential' and the Bank took no steps to ensure that the statements
were
not published to any persons other than those Senior Officers.
<P>

1060	In my view, the conduct of the Bank in publishing the matter was clearly
unreasonable in the circumstances.  The words used
having conveyed the
imputations pleaded, the Bank's conduct in all the circumstances was
unreasonable.  Use of the words `in reduction'
would have been a different
matter.
<P>

1061	It is then necessary to focus upon the precise dates of the bank
statements issued to Currabubula.
<P>

1062	It is to be recalled that the first statement issued to Currabubula with
the notation upon it was published not on 15 or 16
February 1990, but on 21
February 1990.  The statements published on 15 and 16 February were in respect
of Pyojit (statement for
15 February);  NRS Tamworth, Narrabri and Gunnedah
(statements for 16 February).
<P>

1063	To my mind, it cannot be said that the publishing prior to 21 February
1990, of bank statements with the offensive notation
addressed to companies
other than Currabubula, conveyed qua Currabubula, the imputations alleged,
namely that Currabubula itself
was insolvent and/or that a liquidator had been
appointed to Currabubula.
<P>

1064	The publishing of those earlier bank statements which conveyed the
imputations alleged in respect of those companies, namely
that they were
insolvent and/or that a liquidator had been appointed to them, would have been
actionable at the suit of those companies.
 However, only the publishing of the
21, 23 and 28 February and 7, 14, 21 and 28 March 1990 bank statements conveyed
the imputations
alleged in relation to Currabubula.
<P>

1065	It is perhaps a close question whether or not the publishing of the bank
statements bearing the offensive notation here addressed
to companies other
than Currabubula, conveyed qua Currabubula, the imputations alleged, namely
that it was insolvent and/or that
a liquidator had been appointed to it.  There
was no imputation pleaded to the effect that the publication of the bank
statements,
bearing the offensive notation addressed to companies other than
Currabubula, conveyed an imputation `that Currabubula conducted
its business
badly or inefficiently'.  The confined mode of pleading the imputations here
seems to me to lead to the conclusion which
I have referred to above, namely
that Currabubula was defamed only upon the publishing of the bank statements in
respect of itself.
<P>

1066	Hence, only in respect of the publications of the 21, 23 and 28 February
and of the 7, 14, 21 and 28 March statements can Currabubula
claim to have
suffered damage.
<P>

1067	There was, however, no specific evidence devoted to examining what loss
flowed from the publishing of the Currabubula statements,
as opposed to the
detailed evidence of what followed the publishing of the earlier bank
statements.
<P>

1068	Here again the matter is not, in my view, to be looked at in isolation.
The first statement was sent to Currabubula on the
Wednesday following the
15th/16th [Thursday/Friday], close of the previous week. Currabubula was a
shareholder of Paola Holdings.
 The shares in Currabubula were held by Mr and
Mrs Paola who, together with Currabubula, held shares in Paola Holdings.  The
Group
was plainly a closely held Group, usually referred to as the Paola
Group.
<P>

1069	In my judgment, the Group as a whole suffered damage by reason of the
publishing over a period of weeks, of the bank statements
bearing the offensive
notations.
<P>

1070	Currabubula suffered loss because the defamatory utterances occurred in
respect to it, at a time when the news in respect of
the Group and/or Mr Paola
`going bust', was rapidly circulating and now embracing Currabubula proper.
<P>

1071	Had the bank statements relating to Currabubula's account been published
on 15/16 February 1990 and had all the Group Companies
in respect of whom
similar bank statements had been received on 15/16 February sued in defamation,
the defamation case would have
been a very different one.  The difficulty here
lies in determining what damages Currabubula alone is entitled to recover in
respect
of the bank statements published on the later date.  As I have said, no
specific evidence was adduced to examining what loss flowed
to Currabubula by
reason of the publishing of the later statements concerning it.  This may well
have been because throughout the
hearing, the plaintiffs appear to have
believed that a bank statement concerning Currabubula was sent on 14 February
1990.  This
was corrected on the last hearing day when the mistake was
realised.
<P>

1072	The facts thus require scrupulous examination in terms of assessing
Currabubula's claimed entitlement to damages.  Some questions
of the principles
going to assessment of damages which were not addressed in submissions, require
to be addressed.  Again, this is
probably because it was only at the last
moment that the amendment to the pleading was made.  In my view, it is
appropriate to give
the parties an opportunity to address submissions on the
question of the precise relief to be granted in respect of the defamation
cause
of action in light of the Judgment.
<P>

1073	Before leaving the defamation cause of action, one further matter should
be emphasised.
<P>

1074	I have set out above the reasons for my finding that Currabubula has locus
standi to recover in respect of losses incurred
<u>by it</u> caused by the
sending of the `in liq' statements.  If that finding be incorrect, then the
plaintiffs' case must be considered in
contract only and as devoid of the cause
of action in defamation.  The plaintiffs do not become disentitled in their
contract case
from relying upon the fact of the sending of the `in liq'
statements as part of the matrix of fact which took place.  It does not
follow
from the fact that the plaintiffs do not plead the sending of the `in liq' bank
statements as an independent breach of contract,
that the sending of the
statements is not to be regarded as an integer in the chain of events which
followed by reason of the Bank's
breach of contract.  All that follows if the
defamation cause of action is not made out is that no relief may be granted for
any
commission of that tort.  The reactions, as a factual matter, of a group of
employees and managers and of others, upon learning of
the sending of the `in
liq' statements, remains part of the plaintiffs' breach of contract case.  The
statements become simply one
of the modes adopted by the Bank to communicate
it's decisions to it's customer group.  That the `in liq' notation was
interpreted
by many who saw or heard of the bank statements as signifying that
the Group and/or NRS had gone into liquidation, is simply an event
which is
sufficiently proximate to the breach of contract to enable the plaintiffs to
rely upon the matter as a step in proving their
loss caused by the contractual
breach.
<P>

	<b>The plaintiffs claim that the Multi-Option Facility was not provided to the
plaintiffs so that there was a denial of the facility</b>
<P>

1075	In so far as the plaintiffs' claim was put as a failure by the Bank to
provide the Multi-Option Facilities to the plaintiffs
and a consequential
denial of the facility, the Bank submitted that there was no denial of the
facility in any fashion and that alternatively
if there was a denial of the
facility, there was a justification for that denial.
<P>

1076	Mr Ryan had submitted that credits had come into the Number One accounts
and that the plaintiffs were not permitted by the
Bank to draw against those
credits.  Mr Macfarlan's response was to point to the vast bulk of credits as
having come into the Number
Two accounts then being available to be drawn
against.  The only exception to that, Mr Macfarlan pointed out, was the two
amounts
of $50,000 which had come in from the receiver and had been deposited
into the Number One accounts.
<P>

1077	Mr Macfarlan pointed out that to `flesh out' the plaintiffs' submission,
it would be necessary to say that the plaintiffs were
denied the ability to
draw on those particular two deposits.  His submission was that this could not
be so because the Bank made
it clear that it would transfer any deposits to the
Number Two accounts and that that was done upon request.  In this regard, Mr
Macfarlan relied upon Mr Paola's evidence in cross-examination at transcript
page 150 to the following effect:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Paola, I directed you to the heading document on page 1204, and the
question I want to put to you is to suggest to you that
as at the beginning of
March 1990 and in fact throughout 1990, you believed that the facility
described in the letter of 1 February
1990 from the Bank was available to your
Group?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I believe so yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Then 1210 please in the bundle.  Do you recall that there was a deposit
made to the account of Currabubula that had been in existence
for some time
which was the subject of a request for a transfer to the Number Two account,
the new account at Currabubula?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes I recall that.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And that request was complied with?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes it was.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And you understood that if there were any such deposits to the old
accounts then it was open to your Group to contact the Bank
and arrange for
their transfer to the new ones?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yeah, with some difficulty.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Well there wasn't any difficulty in having this transfer effected, was
there?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	There was some difficulty yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	What was the difficulty?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Oh several arguments on the phone.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	It was done immediately the request was made in writing wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	It was done once the request was put in writing yes.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[T 156]
<P>

1078	The Bank submitted that there was an absence of any evidence of any
request made for a drawing which was denied.
<P>

1079	Hence, in relation to the plaintiffs' submission that credit was denied,
Mr Macfarlan's response was that the Bank's obligation
was to provide $8.5
million worth of credit and to do so at the customer's option in different
forms.  As Mr Macfarlan pointed out,
Exhibit D36 does demonstrate that credit
was provided as to the $8.5 million subject only to the qualification as to
part of the
deposits from the receivers.  As to those deposits from the
receivers, the Bank's submission is that it was well understood that
it was
possible to have the Bank transfer the deposits to the Number Two accounts and
to draw on them.
<P>

1080	In short, the $8.5 million was fully drawn from the Number One accounts
and that, as Mr Macfarlan submitted, was the full extent
of the credit to which
the plaintiffs were entitled.  His further submission was that the plaintiffs
were entitled to come and go
with other funds which they had and that this in
fact occurred.
<P>

1081	The ABE Fax account, it should be recalled, was not a newly frozen account
but had been frozen for some time when the company
had gone into receivership
in the previous year - PX 1166.
<P>

1082	Hence, Mr Macfarlan submitted that there was no denial of the $8.5 million
credit - this was always provided to the plaintiffs.
 And as to the
Multi-Option Facility - Mr Macfarlan's submission was that it was available
also and was indeed exercised by a conversion
of the $7 million in March 1990
to a term loan.
<P>

1083	To my mind the issue tendered may be answered in terms of the facts.  The
Bank did not in fact call up the facility.  Outside
of requiring the $1million
reduction provided for by the Facility Letter, the Bank did not demand that it
be repaid by a specified
date.  The Bank clearly placed considerable pressure
upon the Group to reduce its indebtedness and to do so post haste, but it did
not call up the facility.  The Bank did, however, refuse to allow the proceeds
of securities sold to be treated otherwise than in
permanent reduction of Bank
debt.  [See for example Letter of 4 May 1990 PX 1305, 1306]  The breaches of
contract found do not include
a calling up of the facility.
<P>

	<b>Dealing with the Events of Default</b>
<P>

1084	Mr Macfarlan made plain that the Bank only relied on the allegation that
an Event of Default under the facility agreement had
occurred if the Court was
to hold contrary to the Bank's submissions, that the Bank had terminated or
withdrawn the facility by its
mid-February 1990 conduct.  In that circumstance,
the Bank's submission was that any such termination or withdrawal of the
facility
was justified.  The Bank does not assert that it relied in later
months on the occurrence of any events of default to terminate the
facility and
further does not assert that it withdrew the facility after mid-February 1990.
The Bank did however seek to put forward
in part, an explanation of its
mid-year attitude concerning the sale of Durhambone, that the Bank had the view
that an event of default
had or may have been committed, and that it was for
that reason, concerned and expressing views, about the financial position of
the Group.
<P>

1085	It is clear from the judgment that the Court has made no finding that the
Bank terminated or withdrew the facility in mid-February
1990 or thereafter.
<P>

1086	In those circumstances, it may be unnecessary to determine whether an
event of default took place prior to the February 1990
communications from the
Bank to the Group.  In deference, however, to the submissions made, I set out
hereunder my findings in that
regard.
<P>

1087	In my view, an Event of Default occurred when ABE Holdings, by the letter
of 13 February 1990, notified the Bank that `the
directors of the company have
determined that the company is insolvent'.  [PX 1110]  I do not see the
statements made by Mr Paola
at the 12 February 1990 meeting that `if [the Bank]
don't like the idea of putting ABE Holdings into receivership we won't do it.
Currabubula will give it the support it needs', as affecting the position.  The
letter was sent in unequivocal terms.  No binding
letter of comfort had been
executed by Currabubula.  Whether or not Mr Paola may have intended to cause
Currabubula to execute a
binding letter of confirmation, depending on the
Bank's attitude to the Group's proposal, has no material relevance to that
issue.
 In fact Mr Paola, at transcript page 133, accepted that all he intended
to suggest at the meeting was that the support previously
provided by
Currabubula at it's discretion, would be continued.
<P>

1088	In my view, a further Event of Default occurred when, under cover of the
letter of 13 February 1990 [PX 1100], the letter from
Ferrier Hodgson of the
same day [PX 1101] was sent to the Bank.  The Ferrier Hodgson letter states:
`This statement was prepared
in discussions with company officers and from the
financial statements as at [31 December 1989]'.  ABE Holdings and Paola
Holdings
had in common the company officers who conducted the negotiations on
behalf of the Group with the Bank.
<P>

1089	Accordingly, the statement that the $4.454million debt owed by Paola
Holdings to ABE Holdings was not recoverable, was an admission
by Paola
Holdings and ABE Holdings that Paola Holdings could not pay its debts.
<P>

1090	I note that Mr Diamond under cross-examination at transcript page 231,
conceded that a reader of the Statement of Position
which had accompanied the
Ferrier Hodgson letter, could reasonably come to the conclusion that the view
was being expressed by the
document that Paola Holdings was worthless.
Likewise, Mr Hardy at transcript 370, conceded under cross-examination that a
reader
of the letter and it's attachments would be entitled to conclude that
the author of the Statement of Position had taken a view that
Paola could not
repay it's loan and was worthless.
<P>

1091	I further accept the Bank's submission that circumstances had arisen which
would have given reasonable grounds for an opinion
to have been reached by the
Bank:
<P>

	(i)	That there had been a material adverse change in the `financial condition'
of ABE Holdings;
<P>

	(ii)	That there had been a material adverse change in the `financial
condition' of Paola Holdings;  and
<P>

	(iii)	That there had been a material adverse change in the `financial
condition' of the Paola Group of Companies.
<P>

1092	Whether such an opinion was in fact reached by a Bank Officer is a
different question.
<P>

1093	The two letters from ABE Holdings and Ferrier Hodgson of 13 February 1990
expressly acknowledge, it seems to me, that ABE Holdings
was insolvent.
<P>

1094	I note that on page 2 of the Corporate Finance Group's submission, [PX
721] relating to the application for the additional
facilities, it was stated
that the purpose of those facilities was for `funding increased working capital
requirements as a result
of the ongoing liquidation of ABE Fax Pty Limited'.
Page 5 of the same submission [PX 724] indicates that the fact which
precipitated
the application for the increase in facilities was the obligation
that Mr Paola had undertaken personally to guarantee the repayment
of a debt of
$1.65million which was owed by ABE Fax to Okura, and Mr Paola's desire to have
this obligation discharged by ABE Holdings.
 On page 6 of the same submissions
[PX 725] it is anticipated that the total amount of additional debts which the
companies in the
Paola Group would incur as a result of the winding up of ABE
Fax would be $2 million.
<P>

1095	The application was for a general increase in the multi-option facility
although it appears that most of the additional funds
were to be made available
to ABE Holdings.  The Bank points out and I accept, that by February 1990 ABE
Holdings was the largest
borrower from the Bank and had received the majority
of the $3.2 million which had been advanced by the Bank at the end of 1989 and
the beginning of 1990.  It was against this background, that the Bank was
informed on 12 February 1990, that notwithstanding the
apparent receipt of a
large proportion of the additional funds of $1.7 million, ABE Holdings was
insolvent and could not pay its
own debts, still less the debts of ABE Fax
which it had guaranteed.  At the same time, the correspondence received from
Ferrier Hodgson
[PX 1101] indicated that Paola Holdings was solvent.
<P>

1096	In those circumstances, I accept the Bank's submission that there had been
an obvious `material adverse change' in the `financial
condition' of ABE
Holdings, Paola Holdings and the Paola Group of Companies generally.  I do not,
however, accept that the Bank had
any or any reasonable grounds for believing
that its overall securities would not amply cover the Group's indebtedness.
<P>

1097	I accept the Bank's submission that, even if the above events are not
sufficient to constitute a `material adverse change'
in the financial condition
of the borrowers, they do amount to `reasonable grounds' that such a change may
have occurred.
<P>

1098	I do not accept that the Bank has proven that it in fact formed the
opinion in February 1990 that an event of default had occurred.
 Mr Booth at
transcript 396 when asked whether he had turned his mind to the question of
whether the Group had admitted an Event
of Default in relation to the facility,
gave an answer reading:  `Can I say I would have done?'  At transcript 396 he
accepted that
he had no actual recollection and at transcript 396 called it
`more instinct than practice - it would have been my first reaction'.
<P>

1099	When pressed, Mr Booth said at transcript 397 as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Can you recall whether you formed any view at the time about whether
there had been an event of default?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I can form a view.  We would have been, in your (sic) minds, aware
of an event of default.  We were considering an option
. . .'</i>
<P>

1100	Finally at transcript page 398, Mr Booth was asked what was the event of
default which he had formed the view had occurred,
and his answer was:  `The
events were two, material adverse change being one, the second being the
admission of insolvency of ABE
Holdings'.
<P>

1101	It was on his evidence, the insolvency of ABE Holdings which he thought
had repercussions for the entire Group that gave rise,
in his view, to a
material adverse change.  [T 398]
<P>

1102	On my findings, Mr Booth did not recall either reading the Events of
Default list in the 4 September 1987 letter, or considering
the same at all and
had no actual recollection of concluding that an Event of Default had occurred.
This is entirely consistent,
it seems to me, with the documents produced by Mr
Booth and the Bank at the relevant time and subsequently.  No document in
evidence
records the formation of any such view, notwithstanding it's
significance in the circumstances.  Mr Booth, I accept, was a prolific
note-taker and diarist and yet failed to record this, one would think seminal
event, in the Bank's relationship with the Group.
<P>

1103	I reject Mr Booth's evidence that he formed a view that Events of Default
had occurred at the relevant time.  His several attempts
to reconstruct a basis
from which he might be able to infer that he `would have' formed such a view,
were weak in the extreme and
fell far short of satisfying the Court that such a
view was reached at the time.
<P>

1104	It is necessary also to refer to Mr Swinburne's evidence.  In his
statement of 7 May 1998, He furnished a reason for the `freezing'
of the
accounts that made no reference to the formation of a view that an Event of
Default had occurred.  [Paragraph 15]  In none
of his three statements did he
say that he formed such an opinion at any relevant time.  However, in oral
evidence at transcript
531.15 he was asked whether he had turned his mind to
the issue and his answer was that he did, forming the view that `notification
of insolvency was a serious event.  And I then sought advice within the Bank as
to what course of action I should follow'.
<P>

1105	Mr Swinburne's evidence was that he `felt' it was an Event of Default.
<P>

1106	Plainly, the advice that Mr Swinburne sought was from Mr Stenhouse.  His
supplementary statement dealt only with the `freezing'
of accounts where a
customer stated it was insolvent.  His statements do not record any
consideration of the question of the existence
of an Event of Default.  There
is no evidence from him about any consideration of the material adverse change
issue.
<P>

1107	I do not accept that Mr Swinburne in fact formed an opinion that an Event
of Default had occurred.  Rather, he sought advice
about the statement made at
12 February 1990 that ABE Holdings was insolvent.
<P>

1108	These events took place some ten years ago.  Whilst Mr Booth and Mr
Swinburne may be accepted as giving evidence of what they
now believe to have
then occurred, their evidence is rejected in the light of all of the evidence
before the Court and particularly
bearing in mind the material which had
appeared in their statements, their cross-examination and my view as to the
probabilities
in the circumstances.
<P>

1109	It will also be recalled that under the sub-heading `Other', the facility
letter of 1 February 1990 provided:
<P>

	<i>`All other terms and conditions as described in the Bank's letters of offer
dated 18 November 1988 and 4 September 1987 are to continue
to apply unless the
provisions herein are inconsistent.  In such case the provisions herein shall
prevail.'</i>
<P>

1110	The 4 September 1987 letter had included under the sub-heading
`Representations and Warranties' the words:
<P>

	<i>`The borrowerss [sic] represent and warrant to the Bank as of the date of
this letter of offer: . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	- That there has been no material adverse change in the business, assets or
condition of the borrowers since the original application
for finance
facilities by the borrowers;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	- the borrowers further represents [sic] and warrants that all statements
made and documents provided in, or in connection with,
the application to the
Bank for the facilities specified in this Letter of Offer and all
representations which the Borrowers have
made or may (during the continuance of
the Facilities as outlined in this letter of Offer) make to the Bank as to its
financial position
are true and fair.</i>
<P>

1111	The same letter includes under the heading `Covenants' the following:
<P>

	<i>`The borrowers have not, at the date as of which they most recently
prepared annual accounts, have [sic] any liabilities (contingent
or otherwise)
which were not disclosed thereby (or by the notes thereto) nor were there at
that date any unrealised or anticipated
losses arising from commitments entered
into by the borrowers which were not disclosed or reserved against'.</i>
<P>

1112	To my mind, these representation and warranties were repeated in the
letter of 1 February 1990.  In my judgment, the admission
of ABE Holdings'
insolvency and the implicit admission of Paola Holdings' insolvency were
material adverse changes in the `business
assets or condition of the borrowers'
and thus, the representation to the effect that there had been no material
adverse change,
was either incorrect when made, or became incorrect during the
term of the facility.
<P>

1113	I accept the Bank's submission that another material adverse change was
the fact that it appeared that Currabubula was no longer
prepared to support
the Paola Group of Companies.  Until the end of 1989, the accounts for all
companies (except ABE Fax) had been
prepared on the basis that the Group was a
going concern, thus implying that Currabubula Holdings would support each
company.  Mere
discretionary support to be exercised at the option of
Currabubula, I accept, would not have been enough.  As the accounts were
prepared
on a `going concern' basis, they were consistent only with the
existence of a <u>commitment</u> of support from Currabubula.  Currabubula had
indicated to the auditor however, that it would not provide support for those
companies
(PX 1024) and this had the effect of throwing those companies into
insolvency (T 362.5).
<P>

1114	I further accept the Bank's submission that the accounts which had been
provided to the Bank, and on which the Bank's consideration
of the application
of the facilities had been made [PX 720-732], failed to disclose liabilities
and losses.  The Bank's letter of
offer of 1 February 1990 was not accepted
until some days after 1 February, by which time the Group had the letter from
the company's
auditor of 31 January 1990 [PX 1034].  That letter makes clear
that it was then expected that the companies would lose $1.044 million
in the
1990 year rather than `break even' as had been indicated by the material
presented to the Bank [PX 724].
<P>

1115	In those circumstances, the Bank's case that Events of Default had
occurred by mid-February 1990, is made out.  As I have indicated
earlier, this
finding is not strictly necessary, bearing in mind the reasons for judgment
earlier given.
<P>

1116	There remain a number of discrete matters which may be dealt with fairly
shortly.
<P>

	<b>Crop Preparation Payments</b>
<P>

1117	The sale of Durhambone East involved, in addition to the sale of the land,
the sale of plant, equipment and the payment of
a `crop preparation' fee to
Currabubula.  The complaint made by the plaintiffs is that amounts paid in
respect of crop preparation,
stock and plant totalling some $1.6 million, were
not secured by any of the security instruments held by the Bank in respect of
the
land - see the equitable mortgage and floating charge given by Currabubula
to the Bank.
<P>

1118	The short answer to the plaintiffs' claim is the same answer as has been
given in paragraphs 984 and 985 above.  When the plaintiffs
sought a variation
to the agreement with the Bank which had included an express condition that the
facilities would be secured by
registered mortgages over Durhambone, the Bank
was entitled to require, as in fact on analysis it did, that such conditions as
it
sought to impose in consideration for agreeing to that variation be complied
with.  One such condition was that the amounts paid
for crop preparation, stock
and plant be paid to the Bank in discharge of the overall indebtedness.
<P>

	<b>The Estoppel Claim </b>
<P>

1119	It is again not strictly necessary to deal with this claim as the
plaintiffs have succeeded in establishing the relevant breaches
of contract.
The Bank had no legal right without notice, to freeze the Group's accounts.
The plaintiffs have succeeded on their implied
term case in contract in this
regard.
<P>

1120	Had the estoppel case been required to be determined, to my mind the case
was not made out.  The representations were too imprecise
to ground an
estoppel.  A statement in late 1988 or early 1989 that there was `not much
likelihood' that the Bank would withdraw
its facilities without giving Mr Paola
notice, gives no context and plainly does not address anything like all of the
circumstances
which would have to be addressed, to give the representations
sufficient precise content upon which the plaintiffs could seek to
ground an
estoppel.  Nor am I persuaded that the plaintiffs relied upon these statements
as pleaded.
<P>

	<b>The 6 September 1990 Deed of Release</b>
<P>

1121	The plaintiff have not established that this Deed of Release was executed
by reason of duress and illegitimate pressure from
the Bank.  For the reasons
earlier given in the judgment, I do not consider that illegitimate pressure was
used by the Bank which
induced Currabubula to enter into the Deed of Release.
Currabubula, by Mr Paola, was well aware of the commercial necessity that
Durhambone be sold and the requirements of the Bank that the Deed of Release be
executed, did not go outside of the bounds of matters
which the Bank was
entitled to require as a condition of discharging a security - here
Durhambone.
<P>

	<b>The Bank's `Final Arrangement' Claim</b>
<P>

1122	The Bank's claim, summarised in the Judgment at paragraph 12, is rejected.
No submissions were ultimately addressed by the
Bank on the issue.  The
facility was plainly in place for relevant purposes as at the date of the
Bank's breaches of contract held
to have taken place.
<P>

	<b>The Plaintiffs' Claim Relating to the June 1992 Mortgage</b>
<P>

1123	In the light of the above reasons, this claim [see Judgment paragraph 40
(vii)] is not made out.
<P>

	<b>Short Minutes of Order and Further Submissions</b>
<P>

1124	The proceedings will be relisted for further submissions in relation to
any specific claims which either party contends have
not yet been dealt with,
such as interest, including claims for interest charges unnecessarily incurred,
for submissions in relation
to costs and for the making of final orders.
