<u>REGINA   v    Ronald Arthur WHITE</u><p>
60678/95<p>
Monday 7 April 1997<p>
IN THE COURT OF  CRIMINAL APPEAL<p>
SIMPSON J, HIDDEN  J<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><u></u><p>
<u></u><b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<p>
<b>HIDDEN J:</b>  Ronald Arthur White pleaded guilty in the District Court to
an indictment containing two charges of armed robbery and one charge
of
stealing a motor vehicle, and asked that there be taken into account on a Form
2, two charges of stealing from retail stores.
 <p>
	<p>
	In due course the proceedings were heard before Nield DCJ and, on 21 August
1995, his Honour sentenced the applicant in respect
of one of the armed
robberies to penal servitude for eight years, consisting of a minimum term of
five years to date from 6 April
1995, the date on which the applicant was taken
into custody, and an additional term of three years.<p>
	<p>
	On the other charges the applicant was sentenced to fixed terms concurrent
with the minimum term to which I have referred and, in
fixing the sentences to
which I have referred, his Honour took into account the matters on the Form 2.
The applicant seeks leave
to appeal against those sentences. <p>
	<p>
	The facts of the matter need not be considered in detail, but the sequence of
events is of some importance.  The applicant had been
released on parole in
November 1994 and was subject to that parole order at the time these offences
were committed.  On 28 February
1995 he stole some fishing tackle from K-Mart
at Bankstown.  This was one of the matters on the Form 2. He was arrested,
charged
and released on bail.  <p>
	<p>
	Whilst subject to that bail undertaking, he committed the other offence on the
Form 2 of stealing a shirt from David Jones at Bankstown
on 3 April 1995.
Again he was arrested and, yet again, he was released on bail.  The three
offences on the indictment accordingly
were committed whilst he was still
subject to the parole order and whilst subject to the two bail undertakings. <p>
	<p>
	Those offences were committed on the same day, 5 April 1995.  He stole a motor
vehicle and he used that vehicle for the purpose
of the two armed robberies to
which he pleaded guilty.   In the evening of that day he threatened the
attendant at a bottle shop
at Liverpool and robbed him of about $400 in cash.
He then drove to the BP Service Station at Yagoona where he threatened the
attendant
with a rifle and robbed him of about $300 in cash. <p>
	<p>
	He was arrested in the small hours of the following day, 6 April 1995.  He
made no admissions to the police but, as I have observed,
he did ultimately
plead guilty upon his arraignment in the District Court.<p>
<p>
	His Honour accepted that the applicant had significant emotional problems at
the time, to which I shall refer in a moment.   The
applicant put forward an
explanation for his actions in a handwritten statement and in oral evidence,
but about that explanation
his Honour was justifiably sceptical.<p>
	<p>
	The applicant has a long record, mainly for matters of dishonesty, including
two prior robberies, and he has in the past been sentenced
to prison on quite a
number of occasions.  He is now forty years old.  <p>
	<p>
	He has had a very difficult background which does elicit some sympathy for
him.  A significant aspect of that background is a serious
asthmatic condition
from which he has suffered from an early age.  This involved his frequent
hospitalisation and caused serious
disruption to his social and educational
development.  He has a history of drug abuse, but it seems that he has made
some commendable
efforts in recent years to deal with this.  In recent times
also he has made good progress in literacy skills courses.<p>
	<p>
	It seems that he was the victim of a serious sexual assault a few years ago
which has affected him deeply, and which was the source
of the emotional stress
he was undergoing at the time of the offences with which we are dealing.  At
the time of sentence he had
been on strict protection whilst in custody, the
necessity for that protection arising from the sexual assault to which I have
referred.
 I do not believe I need say any more about the circumstances of
it.<p>
	<p>
	This material was before his Honour from the evidence of the applicant
himself, from a pre-sentence report, from two psychiatric
reports, and a report
of the Canterbury Community Health Service.   His Honour had regard to all of
that and said of the applicant,
perhaps with some force:<p>
"Perhaps he is a man who, after having served so may prison sentences, is
unable to live away from a controlled prison life."<p>
<p>
	His Honour assessed the sentences with an eye to totality of criminality, and
he found special circumstances in the applicant's
need for appropriate
psychiatric and psychological treatment on his release.<p>
	<p>
	Before us, the effective sentence passed by his Honour has not really been
challenged in the light of the material which was then
before the Court.  The
application for leave to appeal is based entirely upon the applicant's state of
physical health.  Before his
Honour the evidence of that was, to say the least,
spare. <p>
	<p>
	The applicant himself gave evidence that he had contracted emphysema and had
been told by doctors that he probably had about six
years of quality life left.
Apart from a passing reference in one of the psychiatric reports, there was no
medical evidence of this
emphysemic condition.  There was, of course, abundant
reference to his long history of asthma.  Before his Honour there was no
evidence
of the effect, if any, on the applicant's prison conditions as a
result of his emphysema.  His Honour made no reference to that condition,
or
indeed, to the applicant's physical health at all in his remarks on sentence.
<p>
	<p>
	For the purpose of this application Mr Scouler of counsel, who represents the
applicant, has tendered fresh evidence.   That evidence
was objected to by the
Crown prosecutor, but the hearing of the application proceeded on the basis
that we would determine its admissibility
in due course, having considered the
material.  That evidence is in the form of an affidavit of the applicant of 3
April 1997, to
which are annexed two medical reports relating to his
respiratory problems.   The effect of those reports is that, apart from the
asthma from which the applicant has long suffered, he does now suffer from
emphysema and, as a result, has what is described in one
of the reports as
"quite a severe air flow obstruction".  The condition is exacerbated, hardly
surprisingly, by the fact that the
applicant still smokes, although the
evidence discloses is that he has in more recent times significantly reduced
his daily smoking.<p>
	<p>
	What the affidavit does disclose is that his respiratory problem has a
significance effect on his day-to-day prison life, and reduces
considerably his
capacity to comply with the regime of the prison at Junee where he is currently
contained.   It seems that everyday
activities such as getting up, washing
himself, cleaning his cell, are increasingly more difficult.  The fact that his
movement is
significantly slowed by his condition makes it difficult for him to
comply with the day-to-day prison regulations in a number of
respects.  He has
difficulty attending musters on time and has been told that that is a
requirement which he must meet, and about
which there will be no relaxation of
the rules.  Perhaps more importantly, it seems that his condition affects his
capacity to undertake
work within the prison and education courses.  As a
result of that, his progress through the classification system is limited, as
it seems that he would not achieve a C classification unless he were fit to
work.   <p>
<p>
	The Crown prosecutor objects to this fresh material on the basis that it is
evidence which could, and should, have been led in the
sentence proceedings
themselves, and on the basis that it is evidence of events after sentence which
might attract the intervention
of the executive government, but are not
properly the subject of consideration by a sentencing court and, in particular,
by this
Court as an appellate court.<p>
	<p>
	In my view the evidence is admissible in this appeal, although I have arrived
at that view not without some misgiving.  It is not
immediately apparent that
this material, or material of this nature, could not have been presented before
the learned sentencing
judge.  Nevertheless, and not without some hesitation, I
have formed the view that it is admissible as evidence for the purpose of
explaining the full extent and implication of the applicant's condition of
health which existed at the time of sentence, and I lift
those words from the
frequently quoted passage of King CJ in <b><i>Regina v Smith</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2027%20A%20Crim%20R%20315" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 27
ACR 315</a> at 316. <p>
<p>
	Having determined that the evidence is admissible, it is clearly relevant to
the assessment of the appropriate sentence to be passed
upon the applicant.
This Court had occasion in recent times to consider the authorities relating to
the illness of an offender when
it comes to passing sentence in <b><i>Regina v
L</i></b> (unreported, 17 June 1996) at pages 6 to 8 of the joint judgment, and
it is unnecessary to repeat what appears there.<p>
	<p>
	The applicant's criminality is grave indeed, especially when considered
against the background of his criminal record, and the fact
that he was subject
to conditional liberty of more than one form at the time these offences were
committed.  As I have said, counsel
does not argue with his Honour's assessment
of sentence on the material which was before him, nor could any such argument
have been
respectably mounted.<p>
	<p>
	However, in the light of the fresh material, I am satisfied that the applicant
is entitled to a greater degree of leniency.  In
the light of that material and
the material that was before his Honour, I am satisfied that there are special
circumstances warranting
a departure from the usual proportion between minimum
and additional terms.<p>
	<p>
	Accordingly, leave should be granted and the appeal allowed.<p>
<p>
	In the view I have formed, the appropriate effective sentence is one of penal
servitude for seven years, comprising a minimum term
of four years to date from
6 April 1995, and an additional term of three years.  It appears to me that the
practical way to achieve
that is as follows.<p>
	<p>
	In respect of the first count of armed robbery, I would quash the fixed term
of five years fixed by his Honour and substitute for
it a fixed term of four
years to date from 6 April 1995.  In respect of the second count, the other
armed robbery, I would quash
the sentence imposed by his Honour and substitute
for it a sentence of seven years penal servitude, comprising a minimum term of
four years to date from 6 April 1995 and to expire on 5 April 1999, and an
additional term of three years to commence on 6 April
1999 and to expire on 5
April 2002. <p>
	<p>
	I would confirm the fixed term in respect of the third count, the offence of
stealing a motor vehicle.<p>
	<p>
	I should add that, in sentencing him for the second count, the armed robbery
carrying the term of penal servitude for seven years,
I would take into account
the matters on the Form 2.  I would propose orders accordingly.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SIMPSON J:</b>  I agree.  The orders of the Court will be as proposed by
Hidden J.<p>
