<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>(re directions sought by defendants in relation to the opening
address)</b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In the absence of the jury a number of directions have
been sought on behalf of the defendants; firstly, that in his opening address
to the jury counsel for the plaintiff should be limited to addressing in
relation to those issues which are matters for the jury
pursuant to s 7A of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i></b> as amended by the 1994 Act; secondly, the
number of times a tape of the radio broadcast, the subject of the proceedings,
can be played
to the jury; thirdly, that the jury should not be informed of the
imputations alleged until after the tape of the broadcast has been
played; and
fourthly, whether the jury can have with them in the jury room during their
deliberations the tape of the broadcast and/or
a transcript thereof.
<P>

2	The first matter, namely whether the opening should be limited to the issues
which are for the jury's determination under s 7A
creates no problems because
senior counsel for the plaintiff concedes that his address should be so
limited.
<P>

3	The other issues all arise because of s 7A in the context that whereas all
issues in the trial were previously matters for the
jury, and in the course of
the trial it would be necessary to refer to the matters complained of and the
context in which the words
were used on a number of occasions, it is said that
such requirement no longer exists since the jury's function has become so
limited,
and reliance is sought to be placed on the dicta of the Court of
Appeal in a number of cases dealing with radio and television broadcasts,
pointing to the transient nature of the publication of the allegedly defamatory
matter and the need for the jury to consider what
would be the first impression
on hearing or seeing that matter of the ordinary, reasonable listener or viewer
of average intelligence.
 Reference was made in particular in this context
to<b> <i>Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Parker</i> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR
448</a>;<b> <i>TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Mahony </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 397</a>
and<i> <b>Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden</b></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43
NSWLR 158.</a>
<P>

4	Mr Rares, senior counsel for the defendants, frankly concedes that he cannot
point to any case where such directions as he now
seeks have been given but
similar directions were sought in<b> <i>Marsden v Amalgamated Television
Services Pty Limited</i></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/87.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 87</a> and were refused by Levine J.  In
that case, the directions sought included the following: 
<P>

	"2.  That in each action the videotape comprising the matter complained of be
played once only to the jury;
<P>

	4.  That in each action the jury not be informed of the imputations until the
jury has seen and heard the matter complained of...;
<P>

	5. That no part of the video containing the matter complained of is to be
played during addresses and
<P>

	6.  The jury will not be supplied with transcripts of the matters complained
of".
<P>

The directions sought in this case are virtually the same, allowing for the
difference between a radio and a television broadcast
and as I say, the
directions were refused in that case.
<P>

5	I have considered his Honour's reasons in that case and I consider they
should be followed, not only in the interests of judicial
comity but because,
with respect to his Honour, I consider he was correct.
<P>

6	As his Honour pointed out at [22], the course suggested for the defendant is,
in effect, "unheard of" and "deconstructs the orthodoxy
attendant upon the
usual procedure in defamation actions on the issue of whether or not the matter
complained of conveys the imputations".
 It is important to bear in mind that
his Honour said, at [34]:
<P>

	"The jury does not decide whether it, that is, its four members, are of the
view that the matter complained of carries the defamatory
imputations.  The
jury decides whether the hypothetical ordinary, reasonable viewer would
understand the matter to carry those defamatory
imputations."
<P>

His Honour also pointed out, at [39], that one of the sanctions available to
redress the affect of excessive playing of the allegedly
defamatory matter
would: 
<P>

	"be to the effect that the more the plaintiff has to play the videotape, the
less likely, it would be argued forensically, that
the ordinary reasonable
viewer would understanding (sic) it as carrying the defamatory imputations."
<P>

7	Reference was made in the judgment to<b> <i>Butera v Director of Public
Prosecutions for the State of Victoria</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 180</a> and the fact
that the tape becomes admissible only because with proper equipment, it is
capable of being used to prove what is recorded
on it by being played over, and
it is that evidence, aurally received, which is admissible to prove the
relevant fact.
<P>

8	This aspect is now the subject of s 48(1)(C) of the  <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act
1995</a></i></b> which renders the tape and a transcript of it admissible.
However, I can see some difficulty in a transcript in that the provision
of a
written transcript of what was said may tend to mislead the jury into
considering the material as if it were print media, eg
a book or newspaper,
rather than an oral broadcast and I therefore exercise my discretion, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
135</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i></b>, to exclude the evidence by way of a
transcript of the material, although it would otherwise be admissible pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(1)(C).</a>
<P>

9	Finally, it was submitted that if during its deliberations the jury wished to
replay the tape, they should send a request, the
Court be reassembled and it
should be replayed in Court.  It was said that in that way the Court would know
how many times they played
it and it may, here or elsewhere, determine whether
they have proceeded correctly, in considering what the words would convey on
a
first impression.
<P>

10	This approach, in my view, would constitute an unwarranted and illegal
intrusion into the secrecy of the jury's deliberations.
 Those deliberations
are secret and must remain so, and just as the conversations of jurors in the
jury room are immune from review,
their replaying of the tape and the number of
times they do so would, in my view, amount to no more than a review of their
deliberations
and cannot be permitted.
<P>

11	For these reasons, I refuse the directions sought on behalf of the
defendants.
