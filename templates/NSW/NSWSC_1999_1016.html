<P>

<b>2040/98 - FOSTER v FOSTER</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>ACTING MASTER</b>:  The plaintiff, by summons filed on
16 April 1998, seeks an order that provision be made out of the estate of  his
father, the late
Donald Eli Foster pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a>.
<P>

2   	The deceased died on 9 January 1998 aged 80.  The plaintiff
is the sole surviving child of the deceased, his older brother
Graham having
died on 31 August 1994.  The plaintiff, therefore, is an eligible person
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)(b).</a>
<P>

3   	The defendant is the executrix of the deceased's estate.
She is a daughter of the plaintiff and therefore a grandchild of the
deceased.
<P>

<b>HISTORY</b>
<P>

4   	The plaintiff was born on 12 April 1944.  He continued to
reside with his parents at the family home until 1970 when he married.
 There
appears to be nothing remarkable about his relationship with his parents as a
child.
<P>

5   	Between 1970 and 1989 there were weekly family visits by
the parents which usually included a barbecue.  Those visits took
place usually
on a Friday night.  Every Saturday, the plaintiff attended his parents' home
and helped around the house.  In 1971
he painted the kitchen.  In 1979 he
assisted the deceased to build a fern house and assisted him with roofing work
and painting.
 In 1988 he and his brother painted the outside of the house and
he replaced the front fence.
<P>

6   	During this period he and his wife had three children.  The
defendant is the second eldest child.  There is evidence that 
the defendant
was the favourite grandchild of the deceased.
<P>

7   	In 1980, the deceased transferred to the plaintiff
debenture stocks worth $40,000.  The purpose of the transfer appears to
have
been to enable the deceased to reduce his tax burden.  The plaintiff's evidence
is that at the time the debenture stocks were
registered in the plaintiff's
name the deceased said to him, "When you receive the interest from the stocks
use part of the money
to pay the income tax on the income and give the balance
to me."
<P>

8   	This arrangement continued until 1989.  In 1981, the
plaintiff received a loan from the deceased in the sum of $10,000.  The
purpose
of the loan was to allow the plaintiff and his wife to discharge the mortgage
they had on their home.  There was an agreement
with the deceased that the
plaintiff would pay interest on the loan at 8%.  According to the plaintiff's
evidence, the deceased requested
the plaintiff to pay out his mortgage with the
then mortgagee and take a loan from the deceased.  That way the deceased could
obtain
interest without declaring it to the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation.
The deceased also proposed that the interest that the son
paid on the loan be
the same commercial rate that the bank had applied to the mortgage.  At the
same time he lent a further sum of
$9,000 to the plaintiff.  The purpose of
this loan was to enable the son to build a swimming pool.  Once again agreement
was reached
on the interest rate which was 11%, and once again, it appears to
have been a commercial rate.
<P>

9   	Further to the agreement the plaintiff was to pay off the
loan at the rate of $50 per week.  This was done each Friday or Saturday
when
he visited his parents.  Of that $50, $30 represented the principal and
interest payments on the $10,000 loan, and $20 represented
interest only on the
$9,000 loan.
<P>

10   	In August 1982 the deceased retired.  It would appear that
he became eligible for an age pension.  This meant that by having
these
undeclared loans, he was able to maintain the maximum benefit of his pension
entitlements as well as reduce the amount of taxation
that he was liable to
pay.
<P>

11   	In 1989 the plaintiff's mother was diagnosed with liver
cancer.  She died in December of that year.  After the death of the
mother, the
plaintiff and his wife were helping the deceased clean up around the house.
During this process, it came to his knowledge
that the deceased had $20,000 in
cash in the safe in his house.  There was some discussion about the $20,000 and
it was agreed that
the money would be placed in the bank.  The deceased
requested the $20,000 be banked at the Commonwealth Bank at Jannali in the
plaintiff's
wife's name.  That was done. 
<P>

12   	After the plaintiff's mother died, the relationship with
the deceased deteriorated.  There was some suggestion that there
may have
always been friction, but a rein was kept on that friction by the presence of
the mother.  Once she had died, there were
no restraining influences.  However,
there really is no evidence which supports that suggestion.
<P>

13   	After the death of the mother there were two incidents
which appeared to have doomed the relationship betweeen the plaintiff
and the
deceased.
<P>

<b>THE "GOLDEN" BROOCH</b>
<P>

14   	Although no value has been attributed to the brooch, it
became a significant factor in the continuing relationship of the
plaintiff and
the deceased.  The evidence is unclear precisely how the plaintiff's wife came
into possession of the brooch.  The
plaintiff's evidence, although none was
given by his wife, was that shortly after the death of his mother, the
deceased, in the presence
of the plaintiff, his wife and the plaintiff thought,
his brother, and an old friend of his mother's from the north coast of New
South Wales, gave the brooch to the plaintiff's wife.  
<P>

15   	There is, annexed to the affidavit of the defendant sworn
on 27 August 1998, a letter written by the deceased dated 6 August
1982,
although it is conceded that the date is wrong and the year should be "1992",
referring to the brooch and some money.  The
note, in part, says as follows:

<P>

"The reason I am only leaving my son Donald Warren the sum of $1,000 is after
the death of my wife on the 3rd December 1989 a gold
brooch was missing.  On
Christmas Day that year his wife was wearing it.
<P>

Late in January I went to there (sic) home and asked for the brooch.....".
<P>

16   	Affidavit evidence by the deceased's sister Nataline Mavis
Kennedy sworn on 17 September 1999 refers to a conversation she
had with her
brother shortly after Christmas in 1989.  The deceased said to his sister, "I
saw Warren and Lorraine on Christmas Day.
 Lorraine was wearing Verlie's brooch
and I asked for it back.  I also asked for repayment of  the money I lent him.
Warren said
to me `I'm not going to give the brooch back.  It was given to me
and I'm not going to repay the loan.  Don't come back here again.'"
<P>

17   	The plaintiff's evidence differs in a number of respects
to the note and the evidence of his aunty.  Firstly, he said that
the brooch
was given by the deceased to his wife, not to him.  Secondly, he said that the
deceased asked for it to be returned on
Christmas Day, not in late January.
Thirdly, he denies that he told the deceased not to come back again.
<P>

18   	In his evidence, the plaintiff said that he informed the
deceased that he could not return the brooch as the brooch was not
a gift to
him but to his wife and it was a matter between the deceased and the
plaintiff's wife as to what was to happen to the brooch.
 The plaintiff took
the matter no further.
<P>

19   	This, of course, was a time shortly after the death of the
deceased's wife.  The deceased was probably still in an emotional
state after
her death.  However, to be fair to the plaintiff, there is no evidence of that.
Nevertheless, the plaintiff does not
appear to have done anything to placate
the deceased either by discussing the matter with his wife or trying to arrange
for the two
of them to talk through the problem with the brooch.  He did
nothing.  It seems to me that he could have been a little more conciliatory
and
tried to assist the deceased at a difficult time in his life.  He treated the
whole incident as if it was an arm's length agreement,
but in reality it
wasn't.  The brooch wasn't given to a third party unrelated to either of them;
the brooch was given to the plaintiff's
wife, a member of the family and a
matter that could have been sorted out by the family by the intercession of the
plaintiff.
<P>

20   	To my mind, taking a passive stance really didn't help the
situation.  
<P>

<b>THE RETURN OF THE DEBENTURE STOCK AND MONEYS</b>
<P>

21   	In 1989, the plaintiff repaid the $9,000 loan to the
deceased.  At about this time the plaintiff was made redundant and out
of the
moneys he received because of the redundancy he was able to pay out that loan
to the deceased.  His evidence is that from
the payment out of the loan the
deceased was not happy because he was going to miss out on 12 months'
interest.
<P>

22   	In 1990 there was a discussion between the plaintiff and
the deceased about their financial arrangements.  It seems that the
plaintiff
and his wife no longer wanted to have the responsibility of the debenture stock
and the $20,000.  The plaintiff's evidence
is that he approached the deceased
and advised him that his wife was about to start work.  Therefore, because the
money was in an
account in her name, any interest on the $20,000 would be
subject to tax.  The tax liability would fall to the wife.  Prior to her
working any interest from the $20,000 would have been under the tax threshold
and therefore not liable to tax.
<P>

23   	He also advised the deceased that the tax payable on the
debenture stock was attracting a rate at the higher scale, whereas
the
plaintiff's wage and salary income attracted a lower rate.  This was having an
impact on the plaintiff's liability for taxation.
 It would appear that the
deceased either couldn't understand what was being said to him, or refused to
understand.  The plaintiff's
evidence is that the deceased's response to this
was, "You and Lorraine are stealing from me.  You are not giving me my just
rewards."
<P>

24   	As a result of that conversation and the steps taken by
the plaintiff and his wife, the relationship deteriorated further.
 Some months
after that conversation and it is not known when that conversation took place
other than in 1990, the plaintiff approached
the deceased again and told him
that either they would be paying back or transferring the assets that they held
on his behalf because
everything was becoming too difficult.
<P>

25   	Shortly after the conversation, the plaintiff transferred
to the deceased the $40,000 debenture stocks, paid him the balance
of $1,300
owing on the $10,000 loan and returned the $20,000 that the wife was holding in
her name.
<P>

<b>HISTORY POST 1989</b>
<P>

26   	After the two incidents above, the relationship between
the plaintiff and the deceased had deteriorated quite markedly.  Although
the
plaintiff continued to visit the deceased, and initially those visits were on a
weekly basis, he found that by the deceased's
non-responsive attitude to him,
the deceased no longer showed any interest in him or wished to see him.
<P>

27   	At Christmas 1991, the plaintiff invited the deceased to
spend Christmas with the family.  However, the deceased declined
the
invitation.
<P>

28   	In 1992, there was an incident between the plaintiff, his
wife and the defendant.  Evidence was given about the alleged assault
by each
of them.  The parents' evidence was totally different to that of the defendant.
I found the plaintiff's wife to be honest
and forthright in the answers that
she gave in cross-examination and in relation to this particular incident I
favour the evidence
given by the parents over that given by the daughter.
<P>

29   	An outcome of this incident was that the daughter left
home.  It appears she became closer to her grandfather and there was
a
deterioration of her relationship with her parents.
<P>

30   	The plaintiff's evidence was that the last five or six
years of the deceased's life, that is, from a period sometime in 1992/1993
whilst he no longer attended his home because of the reception he had received
in 1991, he regularly telephoned him.  His evidence
was that on the occasions
when he telephoned the deceased the call was terminated by the deceased hanging
up. 
<P>

31   	In cross-examination, it revealed that the plaintiff was
less than frank in this aspect of his evidence.  It  turned out that
"regularly" meant "I regularly rang my father on his birthday".  In other
words, for the last five or six years of the deceased's
life, he phoned him
approximately once a year.
<P>

32   	At the time of the deceased's eightieth birthday, the
plaintiff phoned him to wish him happy birthday.  However, that call
appears to
have been a disaster.  The evidence was that the telephone call took no more
than 30 seconds.  The plaintiff's evidence
was that the deceased, on
recognising the son's voice, said to him, "I'm going blind but you don't care
at all for me."  The plaintiff
responded "I wish you well for your birthday"
then the deceased hung up.
<P>

33   	It was suggested on behalf of the defendant that this was
an opportunity for the plaintiff to make amends for the past, to
try to achieve
some reconciliation with the deceased.  However, it is difficult to attribute
any blame to the son for not pursuing
a reconciliation with the deceased at
this point in time. 
<P>

34   	There is evidence of the defendant that on numerous
occasions the deceased told her that he wanted nothing to do with the
plaintiff.  The deceased appeared to have become fixed in his ideas about the
plaintiff and as far as he was concerned, the plaintiff
no longer existed.  In
hindsight, one may be able to say that the son should have and could have done
a lot more than he did;  once
again he just appears to have had a passive role
over the last five or six years of the deceased's life.  If the deceased was
happy
to renew a worthwhile relationship, good and well - if he wasn't the son
wasn't going to do much about it.
<P>

35   	What is unclear is what were the family dynamics during
this period of time.  The plaintiff may have had good reasons why
he was unable
to reconcile with the deceased.  It seems to me that on the evidence, that one
could not blame the son for the deterioration
of the relationship and the
failure of reconciliation.  The deceased seems to have been just as much, if
not more so, responsible
for the state of affairs.
<P>

36   	During this period of time, the plaintiff's evidence is
that he asked his daughter, the defendant, how the deceased was. 
The
daughter's response appears to have been "Why don't you ring him yourself?" 
<P>

37   	So a situation had arisen where there had been a complete
breakdown of the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased
and the
plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

<b>THE PARTIES</b>
<P>

38   	In <b>Fraser v Venables </b>(30 September 1998,
unreported), Master MacLaughlin said, "It cannot be emphasised too strongly
that an applicant seeking an order
for provision under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
has an obligation to place before the court information as full and as frank as
possible concerning the applicant's financial and
material circumstances (which
include the financial and material circumstances of the applicant's spouse or
de facto partner)."
<P>

39   	Generally I found the plaintiff to be a credible witness.
However, there were certain aspects of his evidence which lacked
frankness and
he appeared to be evasive.  He failed to disclose evidence relating to his
superannuation entitlements. Details of
those entitlements only came to the
attention of the Court as a result of subpoenas issued on behalf of the
defendant.  It may be
said in his favour that he was unaware of the requirement
to provide such financial information as his entitlement to the superannuation
policies is not available to him at the present time.  
<P>

40   	His evidence concerning the value of his household
contents cannot be accepted.  For the purpose of these proceedings, the
total
value given for household contents was $30,000.  However, the defendant
produced evidence which shows for the purpose of insurance
the plaintiff has
insured household contents for $175,000.  The explanation given by the
plaintiff was that the reason for the increase
was due in part to the fact that
he is holding at his premises furniture belonging to another daughter who is
currently residing
overseas.  However, no evidence was given as to how much of
the value is to be attributed to his goods and how much is attributed
to the
daughter.  There was no evidence given concerning the furniture that belongs to
the daughter.  
<P>

41   	The defendant, in cross-examination, appeared to have
difficulty in understanding some of the questions that were put to her.
 In
that regard I give her the benefit of the doubt, but she generally had
difficulty with the concepts that were associated with
the questions.  However,
in relation to questions put to her concerning the income and assets of the
husband and their interest in
a company called Foster &amp; Anthony, I found
her to be evasive and unconvincing. 
<P>

42   	In relation to the incident involving her parents, her
evidence was in conflict with that of the parents and I accept their
evidence,
mainly based on the forthright way in which the mother responded to questions
under cross-examination.
<P>

<b>ASSETS</b>

43   	As at the date of hearing, the estate comprised of the

52   	Evidence was given that during the deceased's lifetime the
defendant received approximately $60,000 from him.
<P>

53   	In <b>Singer v Berghouse </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> at p 209,
when on determining an application under the Act, the Court must take a two
stage approach.  The first stage involves consideration
of whether or not
inadequate provision has been made for the plaintiff.  This requires an
assessment of whether provision was inadequate
or what in all the circumstances
was a proper level of maintenance appropriate for the plaintiff having regard
to his financial position
and the size of the estate.  The totality of the
relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased and the relationship of the
deceased and other persons having legitimate claims upon his bounty.  The
second stage involves similar considerations, that is an
assessment of what the
proper level of maintenance and what would be adequate provision.  
<P>

54   	There is no dispute that the plaintiff is an eligible
person.  He qualifies by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(b).</a>  There is no dispute that no
provision was made for the plaintiff under the deceased's will.  The question
becomes whether or not
provision should be made for him, having regard to the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> sub-section (3).
<P>

55   	The assets and liabilities of the plaintiff and his wife
have been set out earlier in the judgment.  It is clear from those
assets that
the plaintiff and his wife are reasonably well off.  The one dark cloud on the
horizon is the fact that his current employment
will end some time in the next
six months.  He has received a letter indicating that he will be made redundant
within that period
of time.  He is currently 56 years of age.  Once redundancy
takes place he will be entitled to draw on his superannuation benefits
and it
is suggested that his wife is also in a precarious position in relation to
employment.  However, there was no evidence in
relation to that and she is no
more secure or less secure than any other person in the workforce today.
<P>

56   	The plaintiff has put on evidence which indicates that he
suffers from back problems and has bilateral frozen shoulders. 
These
complaints will limit the type of employment that he will be able to undertake
in the future.  It is also likely to limit the
amount of work that he will be
able to do around the home.
<P>

57   	Evidence was given that there was a possibility of
employment at Pagewood.  The company which he works for, Rothmans, is merging
with British American Tobacco Australasia.  It is not guaranteed that he will
obtain a position at Pagewood, and according to his
evidence, there will not be
a position available at that plant which is comparable to the present position
he holds.  Therefore,
with the restriction on the type of physical activity he
can do, a lack of experience and skills in other areas of employment, together
with his age, will limit his competitiveness for those positions that are
available. 
<P>

58   	By marshalling his assets, he would be in a position to be
liability free.  However, to do that would mean either selling
the Blackheath
property and discharging the mortgage or alternatively, cashing in his
superannuation once redundancy takes effect
and paying out the mortgage and the
credit card debts and then using the balance towards the renovations that are
required for the
Oyster Bay home or to invest that balance and put the income
earned from the investment towards their day to day living expenses.
 
<P>

59   	It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that there
would be sufficient money available from such a fund together with the
income
his wife earns and the income generated by Blackheath to enable them to
continue to live at a reasonable level.  However,
if the Blackheath property is
sold, that one income stream dries up.  If his wife is made redundant or ceases
to work because of
medical reasons (there was some evidence about her medical
condition), their income would be severely diminished.
<P>

60   	Whilst the plaintiff appears to have had three overseas
trips in the last five years, there was no evidence given about the
destination
of  his travels.  It is therefore not clear whether those trips involve short
distances such as New Zealand or Singapore
or whether they were to North
America or Europe.  In any event, it doesn't necessarily follow that he is
living a luxurious lifestyle
and is not in need of some support.
<P>

61   	The defendant and her husband have a reasonable level of
income.  They also, however, have a large mortgage on their Camperdown
property.  According to her evidence, she has expectations of having children
at some stage.    If that event happens, there will,
at least for some time, be
a loss of income.  The defendant has already received approximately $60,000
from her grandfather, the
deceased.  She is the sole beneficiary under his
will.  Of course, the deceased was entitled to dispose of his assets in
whatever
way he saw fit and his election was to give all of his estate to his
granddaughter, the defendant.
<P>

62   	There is evidence from the defendant, and it is not
controversial, that during the last six years of the deceased's life,
she was
of great comfort to him.  The evidence of the deceased's sister was that the
defendant was a tremendous help to him.  The
defendant organised and hosted his
eightieth birthday at her home.  Similar evidence is contained in the affidavit
of Edwin Arthur
Hyland of 16 September 1999.
<P>

63   	The defendant's evidence was that she had a close and
loving relationship with both her paternal grandparents, and of course
that
continued after the death of the grandmother in December 1989.  Her evidence,
and it was not strongly contested, was that she
became his main carer in 1994
when the plaintiff's brother died she looked after him for two weeks after a
heart attack, and after
he lost his sight she took over the responsibility of
paying his bills, taking him shopping, taking him to doctors and generally
looking after his well-being.
<P>

64   	On the evidence, she was available at any time during the
day and night to assist the grandfather.  Without this close and
caring
relationship, it is difficult to see how the deceased would have survived as an
independent person until his death.
<P>

65   	It is submitted that the application should be dismissed
on two bases.  Firstly, that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a
need.
Secondly, that the plaintiff's conduct over the last six years of the
deceased's life disentitles him to any provision out
of the estate.  Whilst the
plaintiff appears to be in sound financial position, he is close to the end of
his working life and in
any event he will be unemployed within the next six
months without guarantee of further employment.
<P>

66   	The second submission that has been made in relation to
his conduct, I think needs to be looked at in the context of the whole
of his
relationship with his father.  There is no controversy concerning his evidence
of the relationship up until 1989.  In fact,
his conduct seems impeachable.  He
was not only available to help his parents, but he attended weekly to do things
around the house
for them.  He was involved in maintaining the property and
throughout that period, he could only be regarded as a loving and dutiful
son.
<P>

67   	During this period he received no benefits from the
deceased.  The moneys that were lent to him by the deceased and the debenture
stocks transferred into his name were done, not with a view of assisting him
and his family, but with a view of maximising the deceased's
ability to earn an
income without a reduction in his pension and to avoid payment of tax on those
investments.  In fact the evidence
was that there was some detriment to the son
and his wife because of the income tax imposition on the two of them.
<P>

68   	The deceased, when offering the two loans to his son, was
in no different a position than a stranger.  The loans had an interest
component and that interest component was based on the rates that the bank was
then charging according to the plaintiff.  That evidence
hasn't been
challenged.  The only one to benefit from such an arrangement, therefore, was
the deceased, not the plaintiff.  He already
had a loan with the bank
concerning the $10,000 and the loan from the deceased in relation to the $9,000
was at a current bank rate.
 Therefore, no benefit flowed to either himself or
his family.  The benefit went the other way.  Nevertheless, as a dutiful son,
he accepted that arrangement  that the deceased requested of him.
<P>

69   	After the death of the plaintiff's mother the relationship
deteriorated and I have already set that out earlier in the judgment.
 It is,
however, difficult to apportion all the blame to the son for the state of
affairs that arose.  There is evidence, not only
from the plaintiff, but also
from the defendant, that the deceased wanted to have nothing to do with his
son.  The evidence of his
son is that until late 1991, he endeavoured to have
or to maintain a relationship that existed prior to the death of his mother.
This was spurned by the deceased.  By 1992, the plaintiff had taken the view
that it was pointless maintaining contact with the deceased.
 Thereafter, with
the exception of his brother's funeral, he had no contact with the deceased
other than to ring him for his birthday.
<P>

70   	I accept the evidence of the plaintiff on this matter that
every time he attempted to speak with the deceased he cut him off
by hanging
up.  It could be said that the son could have done more than he did to try and
restore the relationship.  His daughter
had said to him on a number of
occasions that if he wanted to find out how the deceased was, he should ring
him.  I'm not too sure
that those statements by her were really made in a
conciliatory fashion which would give the plaintiff some encouragement that
there
might be a change in attitude by the deceased.
<P>

71   	In <b>Kleinig v Neal [</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%20532" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1981] 2 NSWLR 532</a> at 540, Mr
Justice Holland made the following comments:
<P>

"If it is a case of parent and child, another circumstance is that the parent
was responsible for bringing the child into the world
and having done so
assumed a duty to be concerned with the child's welfare.  A wise parent will
recognise that perfect harmony between
parent and child is in the nature of
things not be looked for and that, coming to adulthood, a child will want to
make his own life
just as the parent had done before him.  Differences of
outlook between different generations is not exceptional, it is the general
rule, so some friction between parent and child or disappointment in a parent's
hopes and expectations concerning his child will
be accepted by the wise parent
as almost inevitable.  If it occurs, the parent who is just as well as wise
will not allow such disharmony
or disappointment to blind him to the needs of
his child for maintenance, education or advancement in life.  The duty of a
parent
towards his child to provide for those needs on his death, if he can,
continues in spite of such disharmony or disappointment and
the statute obliges
the court to consider whether it has been performed.  The court must take in
the whole scene and make the judgment
that it considers that a wise and just
parent would have made in the circumstances.  Of course, as the statute
provides, if the court
considers that the character or conduct of the child has
been such as to disentitle the child to any or any further benefit from
the
parent, it may refuse the child's claim." 
<P>

72   	In the context of the present proceedings, the parts of
those comments made by his Honour that are apposite have reference
to
differences of outlook between generations is not exceptional but there will be
some friction between parent and child and that
a wise and just parent will not
allow disharmony or disappointment to blind him to the needs of his child.  His
Honour also referred
to the duty of a parent towards a child to provide for the
child's needs on his death notwithstanding the disharmony and disappointment.

<P>

73   	The Act obliges the Court to consider the question of the
character and the conduct of the child has been such as to disentitle
the child
from any or any further benefit.  Looking at those matters that are set out in
s 9 sub-section (3), and looking at the
relationship between the deceased and
the plaintiff over a period in excess of 50 years, on the whole the son's
conduct is not such
which would disentitle him to receive any benefit from his
father's estate.  True it is that over the last six years the relationship
was
virtually non-existent and that the plaintiff did little to restore the
relationship to its former position.  Nevertheless that
was for a short period
of the total relationship.  It was a critical period, there can be no denying
that, but nevertheless, during
this period, neither the plaintiff nor the
deceased made any attempt to restore the relationship.  See also <b>Arratoon v
Arratoon </b>(Bryson J, 31 July 1995, unreported).
<P>

74   	The deceased has more than adequately provided for the
defendant.  It is clear from the evidence that she had a loving, caring
relationship with her grandfather all of her life and in his last five years
she was always there and fulfilled the role that one
would normally expect of a
spouse, a professional carer, or perhaps a child.
<P>

75   	In making an assessment of what provision should be made
for the plaintiff, the defendant's relationship with her grandfather
must be
taken into account.  In my view, there should not be a substantial interference
with the testamentary intention of the deceased.
 Nevertheless, I do not think
the deceased was wise and just when he made no provision for his son.
<P>

76   	There is no duty on a parent to make provision for a child
out of his estate of a sum which would give the child an unencumbered
property:
<b>Fiorentini v O'Neill </b>(Court of Appeal, 4 December 1998, unreported).  I
do not think it is appropriate in this case for provision to be made out of the
estate of the deceased which would discharge the mortgage over the Oyster Bay
property.  Taking the whole of the relationship, and
taking into account the
plaintiff's employment prospects in the future and the possibility of physical
deterioration, in my view
proper provision for the son would go to matters that
are set out in paragraph 11 of his affidavit of 20 June 1999.
<P>

77   	In that paragraph he refers to renovations on the Oyster
Bay house, fencing, repairs to the pool and external and internal
painting.  If
provision is made out of the estate for those matters to be attended to, the
plaintiff's superannuation entitlements
are preserved to be used either by way
of weekly payments or they can be cashed in and the moneys used in whichever
way the plaintiff
and his wife sees fit.
<P>

78   	The order that I make then is that provision be made out
of the estate of the late Donald Eli Foster by way of a legacy to
the plaintiff
in the sum of $68,000.  The plaintiff's costs to be paid out of the estate;
the defendant's costs on an indemnity basis,
be paid out of the estate.
