<u>REGINA v. William John TOMAN</u><p>
<u></u>60055/97<p>
Wednesday 14 May 1997<p>
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL<p>
SMART J, BRUCE J<b>	</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<p>
<b>SMART J:</b>  William John Toman seeks leave to appeal against the severity
of a sentence comprising a minimum term of nine months penal servitude
and an
additional term of two years and three months for breaking, entering and
stealing from a dwelling house taking into account
twenty-five other offences
committed while on bail on the charge on which he was sentenced.  These include
another eight break, enter
and steal offences.  Further, in June 1996 the
applicant stole two diamond rings having a value of $30,000 by snatching them
from
commercial premises.  One ring was recovered but the other was not.<p>
<p>
The remainder of these other offences covered matters of dishonesty, possession
of a prohibited drug and possession of a replica
Smith &amp; Wesson pistol and
a flick knife.  The explanation given about the pistol and the knife reduced
the seriousness of these
offences.  <p>
<p>
The applicant who was born on 6 November 1975 first came before the courts in
about August 1993, being dealt with on two counts of
armed robbery by the
Children's Court.  Thereafter there were offences of break, enter and steal and
possess a prohibited drug prior
to the subject offences in April 1995.  He was
subsequently dealt with for other matters and he spent some short periods in
gaol.<p>
The applicant's parents separated when he was six.  He lacked a father's
influence, his father being affected by his war service
in Vietnam.  The
applicant proceeded to Year 11 at a good school.  However, he was set a bad
example by an elder step-brother as
he grew up and he made friends with those
who were interested in drugs and he took drugs.<p>
<p>
Since the applicant has landed in his present trouble his father has sought to
help him settle down and find employment.  On the
material that was before the
sentencing judge some rehabilitation had begun but there was a long way to go.
The applicant had to
take medication to sedate himself so he could cope with
being in custody.  The sentencing judge took into account factors which led
to
the applicant having to go into protection.<p>
<p>
The sole ground of appeal as the matter has been conducted today is based on
the marked deterioration in the medical condition of
the applicant's mother.
It has emerged that the applicant has requested the gaol authorities'
permission to visit his mother. He
was told that because he is in the last
month of his sentence he cannot be released for a visit.<p>
<p>
For the offence itself, taking into account the other offences, the penalty
imposed was a light one as the sentencing judge expressly
recognised.  In the
normal course I would not have intervened as his decision on the materials
before him was correct. The material
now before the court, particularly in the
report of 14 May 1997 of <p>
Dr Boyer, Head of the Department of Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,
indicates that the mother's condition has reached what
is close to a terminal
stage.  Her life expectancy is to be measured in weeks, perhaps months.<p>
<p>
The applicant is due to be released on parole on 26 May 1997.  Having regard to
the matters in Dr Boyer's report and the deterioration
which has taken place
since sentencing, this is a wholly exceptional case.  The minimum term should
be varied by being reduced by
about ten days.  I propose that there be a
minimum term of 8 months and 20 days penal servitude commencing on 27 August
1996 and
expiring on 16 May 1997 with an additional term of 2 years 3 months
and 10 days commencing on 17 May 1997 and expiring on 26 August
1999.<p>
<p>
We have not to altered the sentence overall but in the exceptional
circumstances made a minor adjustment to the minimum term and
the additional
term.<p>
<p>
An extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal should be granted,
leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal to
the extent mentioned should
be allowed, and the sentence which I have indicated should be imposed in lieu
of that originally imposed.<p>
<p>
I propose also that it be ordered that the applicant be released on parole at
the end of the minimum term which will be on Friday
16 May 1997.<p>
<p>
<b>BRUCE J:</b>  I agree.  I wish to say but not by way of judgment - Mr Toman,
you have been given an opportunity and you should take that opportunity
and do
not ever come back to the courts.<p>
<p>
<b>APPLICANT:  </b>Yes sir.<p>
<p>
<b>SMART J:</b>  The orders are as proposed.<p>
