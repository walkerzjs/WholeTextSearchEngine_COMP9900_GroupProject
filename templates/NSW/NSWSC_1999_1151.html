<P>

<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	Two notices of motion filed on behalf of the plaintiff
company are before the court.  In order to make clear what is sought
to be
achieved, it is necessary to recount some of the rather long and complex
history of this matter.
<P>

2   	The statement of claim that initiated the proceedings was
filed on 2 March 1990.  The plaintiff company sought damages for
negligence and
breach of contract alleged against the defendants, who are the partners of a
firm of solicitors.  The negligence and
breach of contract alleged was failure
to act on behalf of the plaintiff company to exercise an option to purchase
certain real estate.
 The statement of claim was filed in the last days of the
period allowed under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act </i>1969</a>.  It was not served until
December 1991, 
<P>

3   	Judging by the size of the court file and matters referred
to in an affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff company, the
proceedings
appear to have been before the court on many occasions since the statement of
claim was served.  Details of the various
interlocutory appeals were not in
evidence, and, except for those matters to which I am about to refer, do not
appear to be relevant.
<P>

4   	Sometime in 1996 the defendant solicitors sought to protect
their position by applying for an order for security for costs.
<P>

5   	On 19 August 1996 the Prothonotary made the following
orders:
<P>

"1. The Plaintiff provide security for costs in favour of the Defendants in the
sum of $100,000. 
<P>

2. Security for costs be given by deed, in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p53" class="autolink_findacts">Part 53</a>, Rule 3(2)
of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

3. These proceedings be stayed until such security has been provided.
<P>

4. Costs be in the cause.
<P>

5. There be liberty to apply on seven days'."
<P>

6   	On 14 July 1998 the plaintiff company provided to the court
a deed executed by S J Hooper, who is by other evidence disclosed
to be the
governing director of the plaintiff company.  Pursuant to the deed, Mr Hooper
promised, in default by the plaintiff company
of payment of any costs order, to
make such payment himself.
<P>

7   	On 20 April 1998 the plaintiff company filed two notices of
motion, in one of which it sought an order that Mr Hooper be joined
as a
plaintiff in the proceedings.  In the other, he sought transfer of the matter
to the District Court.
<P>

8   	On 17 July 1998 the Deputy Registrar of the court informed
Mr Hooper that the deed referred to in paragraph 6 had been accepted
as
complying with SCR Pt 53 r3(2).  On the same date he forwarded a copy of the
deed to the solicitors acting for the defendants,
and advised that the stay
granted by order 3 of the Prothonotary's orders of 19 August 1996 had been
lifted.
<P>

9   	On 8 October 1998 the solicitors acting for the defendants
filed a notice of motion seeking the following:
<P>

"1. A direction that the deed executed by Stephen James Hooper on 14 July 1998
was not a provision of security within the terms
of the orders made by the
Prothonotary Whalan on 19 August 1996.
<P>

2. Further and/or alternatively in the event that Court should determine that
the deed...satisfies the terms of orders... in regard
to the giving of security
then the said orders be varied to require that the said security be given by
payment into court of the
sum of $100,000 or by the giving of a deed as
provided for in Part 53 Rule 3(2) but by a person with proven nett assets
sufficient
to fully satisfy any order for costs up to the amount of the
security ordered."
<P>

10   	All these notices of motion were heard together by Master
Harrison commencing on 15 October 1998.  On 19 November 1998 the
Master
permitted the plaintiff company to re-open its case for the purpose of adducing
evidence relating to Mr Hooper's financial
circumstances, and gave the
plaintiff company leave to file in court a further notice of motion seeking an
order that it be discharged
from the obligation to give security on condition
that it provide a deed of guarantee executed by Mr Hooper and his wife Barbara
Elizabeth Frances Hooper, which bound them personally to pay any costs ordered
against the plaintiff company.
<P>

11   	After hearing evidence and argument the Master dismissed
Mr Hooper's notice of motion of 19 November.  She vacated the order
of the
Prothonotary so far as it permitted the security for costs to be given by deed,
but did not vacate the order requiring the
plaintiff company to provide
security for costs or the order that the proceedings be stayed pending
provision of security.  The effect
of the Master's orders is that the
proceedings will be stayed unless and until the plaintiff provides a cash
security of $100,000.
 Master Harrison further ordered that Mr Hooper 
<P>

"be granted leave to be joined as a plaintiff in these proceedings once the
stay of proceedings is lifted."
<P>

12   	The plaintiff company appealed.  The appeal was heard and
determined by Abadee J on 5 July 1999.  In short, his Honour held
that no error
had been demonstrated in the Master's discretionary judgment.  He dismissed the
appeal.  One of the bases for the appeal,
in which Mr Hooper represented the
company, was that Mr and Mrs Hooper had, since the proceedings before the
Master, in fact signed
a deed of guarantee along the lines proposed in the 19
November notice of motion.  Although the document was admitted on the hearing
of the appeal without objection,  Abadee J held that it did not advance the
matter before him. 
<P>

13   	On the hearing of the present notices of motion I was
informed that an appeal against the decision of Abadee J had been filed
in the
Court of Appeal but that this was in the nature of a holding appeal to protect
the plaintiff's interests in the event that
it is unsuccessful in the present
proceedings. 
<P>

14   	The nature of these applications can now be explained.
The first notice of motion was filed on 14 July 1999 and is in essentially
identical terms to that filed in court before Master Harrison on 19 November
1998.  That is, the plaintiff company seeks discharge
from the obligation to
give security for costs on condition that it provide a deed of guarantee by
which Mr and Mrs Hooper bind themselves
personally to meet any costs ordered
against the company.
<P>

15   	In the second notice of motion, filed in court on the day
of hearing (2 August 1999) the plaintiff company seeks a stay of
execution of
the Prothonotary's order, and 
<P>

"Any other orders the court deems fit."
<P>

16   	One preliminary matter raised by the defendants can be
disposed of shortly.  They argued that, having regard to the appeal
before
Abadee J, and the appeal from his decision filed in the Court of Appeal, the
procedure now adopted is no more than a duplication
of what has already been
done, and amounts to an abuse of process, and that the plaintiff should not be
permitted further to occupy
the time of the court and impose additional burdens
on the resources of the defendants.  While this is an argument that demands a
certain degree of sympathy, the fact of the appeals to Abadee J and to the
Court of Appeal cannot resolve the present application.
 The issue raised
before Abadee J was limited to whether the Master had been shown to have been
in error in the exercise of her discretion
on the evidence before her.  Even
taking into account the additional evidence admitted without objection, that
remained the issue,
given that Abadee J did not consider that evidence
materially altered the position.
<P>

17   	That brings me back to the plaintiff's applications.  They
are brought under SCR Pt 42 r12, which is in the following terms:
<P>

"Matters occurring after judgment
<P>

 
<P>

12. 	(1)  A person bound by a judgment may move the Court for a stay of
execution of the judgment, or for some other order, on the
ground of matters
occurring after the date on which the judgment takes effect and the Court may,
on terms, make such order as the
nature of the case requires. 
<P>

 	(2)  Subrule (1) does not affect the powers of the Court under Part 44 rule 5
(which relates to stay of execution)." 
<P>

18   	For the purpose of this Part, "judgment" includes an
order.  The plaintiff relies upon what it asserts is a material change
in
circumstances sufficient to warrant variation of the orders made by Master
Harrison.  Mr Hooper again appeared for the purpose
of representing the
company.  He asserted that the circumstances relevant to the decision had
changed in two material respects.
<P>

19   	The first of these concerns the availability of the deed,
now executed by himself and his wife, in which they undertake to
make
themselves personally liable for any costs ordered against the company.  This
deed is different from that earlier provided only
in that it is signed by Mrs
Hooper as well as Mr Hooper.  
<P>

20   	The second asserted material change is that, as a
consequence of the orders of Master Harrison, Mr Hooper is now a party to
the
proceedings, meaning that the defendants have available to them an individual
against whom they have recourse in the event of
a costs order being made in
their favour.
<P>

21   	In order to consider whether there has been any material
change in circumstances, it is necessary to consider the issue that
arose
before the Master, and her reasons for the decision she made.  It seems
reasonably plain that, although the plaintiff was not
in possession of a deed
executed by Mrs Hooper at the time of hearing, it did quite clearly propose
provision of such a document
as an alternative to the payment of cash security
as required by the Prothonotary.  That was the basis of the application of 19
November,
which was rejected by the Master.  Master Harrison was sceptical
about Mrs Hooper's willingness to provide such a guarantee.  The
Master
referred to the absence of direct evidence from Mrs Hooper that she was willing
to do so; to her age, 63, and her relatively
modest financial circumstances.
Mrs Hooper's income is derived from social security benefits.  She has limited
assets. She had then
been separated from Mr Hooper for nearly 4 years.  Mr
Hooper had at some stage said that his wife wanted to retain such assets as
she
possessed.  For these reasons Master Harrison doubted that Mrs Hooper would be
willing to sign the guarantee.  That was clearly
a factor in the Master's
decision.
<P>

22   	There is now evidence that Mrs Hooper is not only willing
to take that course, but has in fact done so.  There is, to that
extent, a
change in circumstances.  However, that does not of itself establish a
sufficiently significant change in circumstances
to warrant a variation of the
Master's order.  
<P>

23   	The Master's scepticism about Mrs Hooper's willingness to
sign was only one of the matters that led her to make the orders
she did.
Another was the value of the guarantee, given the assets position of both Mr
and Mrs Hooper as disclosed by the evidence,
relative to the amount of security
ordered by the Prothonotary.  The amount of security ordered was $100,000.  The
combined assets
of Mr and Mrs Hooper would yield at most, a little over
$42,000.  Of this, Mrs Hooper's assets were quantified at a little over $3000.
In the light of this evidence the Master concluded that the deed proffered to
the Deputy Registrar did not provide adequate security
for the defendants.  It
is true that the deed accepted by the Registrar was signed by, and therefore
bound, only Mr Hooper, and the
deed now relied upon extends to Mrs Hooper.
Having regard to the limited extent of her assets, it is quite clear that the
Master's
decision would not have been any different even if the deed signed by
Mrs Hooper had been available at the time of the master's decision.
 That
however, is not the question.  This is not an appeal from the Master. The
question is whether the deed now proffered does amount
to a materially
different circumstance sufficient to warrant variation of the order made.  I am
satisfied it does not. The purpose
of the Prothonotary's original orders, and
the Masters variation, was to provide protection to the defendants in the event
if a costs
order against the plaintiff.  The deed in the circumstances does not
provide that protection.
<P>

24   	The second matter on which the plaintiff relied was the
asserted fact that Mr Hooper is now, as a result of Master Harrison's
orders, a
party to the proceedings, and his assets would be accessible to the defendant
to satisfy an otherwise unpaid costs order.
 Mr Hooper is not yet a party - he
was granted leave to be joined as a party once the stay of proceedings is
lifted.  The stay of
proceedings will be lifted, on the Master's orders, only
when proper security is provided.  It is true that that order 2 could be
varied
to enable him to become a party before the  provision of security, or
simultaneously with that, but the evidence of his financial
position
demonstrates that that event would not materially alter the position as it was
when Master Harrison made her orders.
<P>

25   	The plaintiff has failed to establish any relevant change
in circumstances such as to justify variation of the orders.
<P>

26   	The plaintiff's notice of motion is dismissed. I order the
plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of and incidental to the
notice of
motion.
