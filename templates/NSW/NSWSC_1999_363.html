<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>KIRBY J</b>
<P>

<b>Friday 16 April 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>30048/98  -  Taylor Farms (Australia) Pty Ltd  v  A Calkos Pty Ltd &amp;
Ors [No 1]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (re costs)</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 12 March 1999 I gave judgment in this matter.  The
order I made was in these terms:
<P>

	1.	I allow the appeal.
<P>

	2.	I vary order 1 made by the Commercial Tribunal so as to exclude para 4 and
vacate orders 2 and 3.
<P>

	3.	I remit the matter to the Commercial Tribunal to redetermine the issues
arising under para 4.  Taylor Farms should have the
opportunity of re-pleading
para 4 so that the Tribunal can then determine whether it has jurisdiction to
deal with the issue.
<P>

	4.	I reserve the question of costs.  Taylor Farms has ultimately succeeded
upon one aspect of the claim (although not an aspect
which it identified, in
terms, in the statement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 51A</a> r 5). I am inclined to think, subject to
further argument, that Taylor Farms should have one third of its costs.
However, I give
leave to either party to relist the matter within fourteen days
to argue the question of costs.  If, within that period, neither
party does so,
my order will be as above.
<P>

2	The parties have not been able to reach agreement on the question of costs.
The issue, therefore, has come back before me.  Both
parties have made written
submissions.  Both claim success.  Each, therefore, claims costs.  Each in the
alternative says that it
should be awarded some proportion of the costs which
they have incurred.
<P>

3	I have been provided with a copy of the decision of the Court of Appeal in
<b><i>Waters v P C Henderson (Australia) Pty Limited</i></b> (unreported, 6
July 1994) which deals with the issue of costs. 
<P>

4	The principles are not in doubt.  They can be stated as follows:
<P>

&#183;	First, the costs are in the discretion of the court - s 76(1)(a) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.
<P>

&#183;	Second, the court has the power to determine by whom and to what extent
costs should be paid - s 76(1)(b).
<P>

&#183;	Third, the costs should normally follow the event unless it appears to
the court that some other order should be made (Pt
52A r 11).
<P>

&#183;	Four, it is not unusual in litigation for a party to make a number of
claims, and to succeed on only some of those claims.
 Nonetheless, that success
ordinarily entitles a party to its costs.  The court does not seek to determine
costs issue by issue.
<P>

&#183;	Five, where there is an issue which is dominant and separable, and the
party who succeeded in the litigation fails on that
issue, the court may
recognise that failure in the order which it makes concerning costs.
<P>

&#183;	Six, that recognition may take a number of forms.  In an appropriate
case the court may award costs on that issue to the
party who succeeded in
respect of it.  Alternatively, and perhaps more usually, the court may moderate
the costs order to which the
successful party is entitled.
<P>

5	Here the plaintiff Taylor Farms points to its ultimate success.  The appeal
was allowed.  The matter should not be looked at issue
by issue.  The usual
rule should apply.
<P>

6	The defendant Calkos says this:  first, the judgment runs for thirty-four
pages, it contains eighty-six paragraphs, apart from
the order which is para
87.  Of those thirty-four pages, all but the last record reasons for rejecting
the various claims of the
plaintiff.  Only paras 85 and 86 deal with the issues
in respect of which Taylor Farms succeeded.
<P>

7	Secondly, that in determining the significance which should be attached to
paras 85 and 86, for the purposes of costs, a number
of matters are relevant.
The issue upon which the plaintiff ultimately succeeded was not identified in
the grounds of appeal under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 51A</a> r 5.  As a consequence Calkos was not really
in a position to meet that argument.  Had it been given notice, Calkos would
have pointed
to, as it now does, the opportunity which the Tribunal afforded
Taylor Farms to re-plead their defence after it had been struck out.
 Further,
the problems of Taylor Farms, in respect of para 4, were very much of its own
making.  The pleading was deficient, as the
Tribunal remarked, and as I
remarked in the course of my judgment.
<P>

8	The parties have appeared before me today, and elaborated upon these
submissions.  Dealing first with the plaintiff's submission,
the ordinary rule
that costs follows the event really does depend upon one being able to discern
an "event" in respect of which the
plaintiff succeeded.  Whilst success need
not be complete in order to attract an order for costs, here the plaintiff did
fail in
a significant number of respects.
<P>

9	The document which was under attack in the Commercial Tribunal was headed
Statement of Defence and Cross-Claim.  It included claims
which were as
follows:  first, a claim under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (paras 1 and 2).
Secondly, a claim under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a> (para 3).  Thirdly, a claim
treated by the Tribunal as based upon promissory estoppel (para 4).  Finally,
para 5 which made a claim
which has not been pressed before me.
<P>

10	The plaintiff failed in respect of paras 1, 2 and 3.  It abandoned para 5.
It succeeded, therefore, in respect of part only of
para 4.  I agreed with the
Tribunal's view concerning promissory estoppel, but took the view that the
claim as pleaded was somewhat
broader than simply promissory estoppel.
<P>

11	Turning to the defendant's arguments, it is not accurate to identify only
the last page of the judgment as recording success
on the part of the
plaintiff, in my view.  The judgment sets out material which was relevant to
the issue upon which the plaintiff
ultimately succeeded.  Paragraph 4 could be
dealt with briefly because the earlier paragraphs deal with the limits to the
jurisdiction
of the Tribunal.  I, therefore, do not find an analysis based upon
paragraphs numbers, or pages, helpful in determining the issue
of fairness in
respect of costs.  Nor do I accept that the defendant was not in a position to
meet the plaintiff's arguments in respect
of para 4, as it relates to aspects
other than promissory estoppel.  Though the defendant complained at the
original hearing that
the issue was a late arrival, and did not appear in the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 51A</a> r 5 statement, it did not seek an adjournment.  It dealt with the issue
which was, after all, within a fairly narrow compass.
<P>

12	An affidavit of the solicitor for the defendant, Mr Stephen Valtas, sworn on
25 March 1999, has been tendered on the issue of
costs.  The affidavit draws
attention to a hearing on 1 May 1998 before the Registrar of the Commercial
Tribunal in which the plaintiff
in these proceedings, Taylor Farms, was given
leave to file an amended defence.  I rather gather that they did not take up
that leave.
 However, that matter does not change my view concerning the issues
which relate to para 4.
<P>

13	On my understanding there were limitation issues, which the defendant had
foreshadowed, relating to the various claims which
the plaintiff sought to
press before the Commercial Tribunal.  However, amending a pleading which was
filed some considerable time
ago may be very different from filing a new
pleading, its predecessor having been struck out.  I came to the view that the
Tribunal
ought, in fairness, have sought clarification of para 4, in the
absence of a concession that all that was intended was promissory
estoppel.
However, the defendant is right that the plaintiff Taylor Farms, through a
pleading which was less than adequate, created
many of the difficulties which
were before the Commercial Tribunal, and before this court on the present
appeal.
<P>

14	These being the arguments what should be done?  I believe it not entirely
fair to the plaintiff to simply look paragraph by paragraph
of the statement,
the cross-claim and defence and record the outcome.  The hearing was, as I have
said, an exploration of the jurisdiction
of the Commercial Tribunal.  Toohey J,
when sitting in the Federal Court in <b><i>Hughes v West Australian Cricket
Association Inc</i></b> (1986) ATPR 40-748, made a number of observations in
the context of cost rules which are similar to those in the Supreme Court.
<P>

15	His Honour said this:
<P>

	"In the present case it is true that if one took a head count of the cause of
action pleaded in the statement of claim, the applicant
failed on more than he
succeeded, and by some margin.  Nevertheless the applicant succeeded in his
primary aim viz to challenge the
operation of r 2 rr 38.1 of the rules of the
Cricket Council insofar as the rule operated to preclude him from playing
district cricket
by reason of his participation in the South African tours."
<P>

16	Ultimately his Honour awarded the applicant 75 per cent of his costs.
<P>

17	Here the plaintiff succeeded in having the order of the Tribunal, so far as
it related to para 4, set aside, and the appeal allowed.
 The adverse findings
to the plaintiff were rather more substantial than was the case before Toohey
J.  At the time I made the tentative
suggestion in my order of 12 March 1999 I
wondered to myself whether I was being too harsh on the plaintiff in suggesting
they receive
only one-third of their costs.
<P>

18	Before I resolve the issue as to what is fair in all the circumstances I
should mention one other aspect.  This morning in argument
it was put, on
behalf of Calkos, that the order I made, order 2, vacating the order of the
Tribunal, required revision.  The Tribunal
having struck out the pleading,
ordered Taylor Farms to pay the costs of the motion.  It was suggested that the
appropriate order
by this court should be that the Tribunal's costs order, so
far as it related to para 4 only, should be vacated.  It should otherwise
be
left undisturbed.
<P>

19	I gave thought to this matter before I framed order 2.  I believe the order
I made was appropriate.  Had the Tribunal not struck
out para 4, it may have
made an entirely different costs order.  It may have ordered each party to pay
its own costs.  It is really
not possible, at this time, and on the information
I have, to say whether it is practicable to make an order in the form which has
now been suggested.
<P>

20	It therefore seems to me better that the appeal, having been allowed, the
costs order below should be vacated.  The success of
Calkos before me on
certain issues, repeating the success below, should be reflected in the costs
awarded in these proceedings to
Taylor Farms.
<P>

21	When choosing the figure of one-third as the appropriate proportion, I was
endeavouring to balance these various matters.  Having
heard argument, and
reflected upon the written submissions, and the issues generally, I still
believe that the order I set out in
my original judgment is the appropriate
order.  Given that the plaintiff succeeded on the appeal, an award of only
one-third of the
costs is unusual.  However, I believe that proportion, in the
context of order 2 which I made (vacating the costs order below), is
fair.  I,
therefore, order that the defendant should pay one-third of the costs of Taylor
Farms.
<P>

22	Dr Desiatnik, in the course of argument, drew attention to the order I made,
order 3.  He indicated that the problems that had
arisen in the Commercial
Tribunal can be traced to the fact that the plaintiff, Taylor Farms, had
inappropriately failed to differentiate
between, on the one hand, the matters
which were put by way of cross-claim, and the matters which were put by way of
defence.  He
asserted that the matters which are dealt with in para 4 were
purely matters of defence, and that ought to be made plain by me in
the orders
which I frame.
<P>

23	There was some debate between us as to whether one might characterise the
residual matters in para 4, if I can so term them,
that is the matters other
than promissory estoppel, as plainly matters of defence.
<P>

24	I was inclined to agree with him that they may be so regarded.  However,
ultimately I believe that it is a matter for the Tribunal,
and a matter which
may depend upon the way in which the claim is eventually framed once the facts
are set out.  I, therefore, believe
the Tribunal is in a much better position
to deal with that issue than I am, and I therefore make no comment other than
to reaffirm
the terms of my original order.
<P>

25	<b>ORDERS:</b>
<P>

1.	I allow the appeal.
<P>

2.	I vary order 1 made by the Commercial Tribunal, so as to exclude para 4, and
vacate orders 2 and 3.
<P>

3.	I remit the matter to the Commercial Tribunal to redetermine the issues
arising under para 4.  Taylor Farms should have the opportunity
of re-pleading
para 4 so that the Tribunal can then determine whether it has jurisdiction to
deal with the issue.
<P>

4.	The plaintiff should be entitled to one-third only of its costs on this
appeal.
