<b><u>30079/99 - David DRABSCH  v  Steve BUCKLEY &amp; Kenneth
BOSTON</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>    By a summons filed on 25 October 1999 Mr.
David Drabsch, ["the plaintiff"], claims relief as follows:
<P>

<i>"1.	A declaration that the disciplinary proceedings commenced on 17 November
1998 by the Department of Education and Training against
the plaintiff under
s.83(f) of the <b>Teaching Services Act 1980</b> are unfair, oppressive and an
abuse of process.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	An order that the disciplinary proceedings referred to in paragrah 1
above be permanently stayed.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	An order for costs."</i>
<P>

2  	The foregoing claim for relief is pursued against two defendants.
The first defendant is Mr. Steve Buckley. The second defendant
is Mr. Kenneth
Boston. Mr. Boston is the Director-General of the Department of Education and
Training. Mr. Buckley is, put simply,
the person who will be conducting the
disciplinary proceedings if the same are not stayed.
<P>

3  	The basic principles by reference to which such an application as
that of the present plaintiff is to be decided are now well
established by, in
particular, the majority judgment in the High Court of Australia in <b>Walton v
Gardiner  &amp; ors. </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 378.</a> I take the following propositions
to be clear:
<P>

1)	This Court has a supervisory jurisdiction of such a kind as empowers it to
grant, in a proper case, relief of the kind now sought
by the plaintiff.
<P>

2)	The burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff. That is to say, it is for the
plaintiff to demonstrate on the probabilities that
the proper application of
the relevant principles of law to the particular facts, correctly understood,
of his case justifies the
granting by this Court, whether in whole or in part,
of relief of the kind which the plaintiff claims.
<P>

3)	The power of the Court to stay permanently, and whether in whole or in part,
disciplinary proceedings of the kind here in question
will be exercised
sparingly and with caution, and only in a clear case.
<P>

4)	The basic guidelines for this Court, when it is considering whether or not
it will exercise in a particular case its supervisory
jurisdiction to grant a
permanent stay of, relevantly, disciplinary proceedings of the kind here in
question, are set out clearly
and comprehensively in the following extract from
the majority judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in <b>Walton</b>:
<P>

<i>".......................(T)he question whether criminal proceedings should
be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls
to be determined by a
weighing process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and
considerations. Among those factors
and considerations are the requirements of
fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of
charges
of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and
the need to maintain public confidence in the administration
of justice. The
question of whether disciplinary proceedings in the tribunal should be stayed
by the Supreme Court on abuse of process
grounds should be determined by
reference to a weighing process similar to the kind appropriate in the case of
criminal proceedings
but adapted to take account of the differences between the
two kinds of proceedings. In particular, in deciding whether a permanent
stay
of disciplinary proceedings in the tribunal should be ordered, consideration
will necessarily be given to the protective character
of such proceedings and
to the importance of protecting the public from incompetence and professional
misconduct on the part of medical
practitioners"</i> [177 CLR, 395,396]
<P>

(5)	It is of the greatest importance to keep carefully in mind that it is not
any part of the present function of this Court to
decide whether the breach of
discipline now alleged against the plaintiff is true, either in whole or in
part. That is the function
of a properly constituted and a properly conducted
departmental inquiry. The Court will do whatever is proper to be done to the
end
of ensuring that any such inquiry is conducted justly according to law; but
the Court will not usurp the proper rle of such a departmental
inquiry.
<P>

<b><u>The Legislative and Procedural Framework of the Current Disciplinary
Proceedings against the Plaintiff</u></b>
<P>

4  	The plaintiff is currently employed as a teacher by the
Department of Education and Training of this State. He is so employed
to teach
science and photography at Peel Technology High School. Since 30 November 1998
he has been removed from face to face teaching
and has been rostered to perform
administrative duties of various kinds.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff, being such a teacher, is amenable to the
provisions of the <b>Teaching Services Act 1980 (NSW)</b>, ["the Act"]. He is
amenable, in particular, to the provisions of Division 6 of the Act, being
provisions having to do with matters
of discipline and conduct. The scheme of
Division 6, so far as is at present relevant, is as follows:
<P>

1)	A teacher who engages in any disgraceful or improper conduct is guilty of a
breach of discipline: s.83(f).
<P>

2)	Any allegation of such a breach of discipline must be dealt with either by
the Director-General of the Department or by a prescribed
officer: s.84(1).
<P>

3)	Authority is conferred for the making of Regulations as to all necessary
procedural and other ancillary requirements in connection
with the carrying
out, either by the Director-General or by a prescribed officer, of the duty
imposed by s.84(1): s.84(2).
<P>

4)	A finding that a teacher has in fact committed a breach of discipline can
lead to a range of possible punishments of the teacher.
At one end of the range
is a caution. At the other end of the range is dismissal. Each of the
authorised forms of punishment is,
from the particular teacher's point of view,
a very serious matter both in purely personal, and in career, terms.
<P>

	If an alleged breach of discipline is found upon investigation to have been
established, and if a penalty is thereupon imposed,
an appeal will lie pursuant
to s.23 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/gareata1980458/" class="autolink_findacts">Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal Act 1980</a>
(NSW)</b>. Any punishment taking the form of termination of employment is
subject, as well, to review upon an application to the Industrial
Relations
Commission, and pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act 1996</a> (NSW)</b>, for
reinstatement on the grounds of wrongful dismissal.
<P>

5)	Regulations have in fact been made pursuant to the authority conferred in
that behalf by s.84(2) of the Act. The Regulations
are described as the
<b>Teaching Services (Education Teaching Service) Regulation 1994</b>, ["the
Regulations"]. Part 3 of the Regulations deals with breaches of discipline. The
scheme for which provision is thus made operates,
so far as is relevant for
present purposes, as follows:
<P>

	(a)	Any person who holds an appointment as Deputy Director General, as
Assistant Director-General, or as a Director, in the Department
of Education
and Training is a prescribed officer for the purpose of Part 3 of the
Regulations.
<P>

	(b)	If it is proposed, either by the Director-General of the Department or by
a prescribed officer in the sense described in (a)
above, that a teacher may
have committed a breach of discipline, the teacher may be charged accordingly:
cl. 14(1)
<P>

	(c)	Such a charge may be laid orally or in writing. If it is laid orally, the
teacher in question must be furnished with a written
copy of the charge, and
within a reasonable time: cl. 14(2).
<P>

	(d)	That initial step in the charging of the particular teacher must call upon
the teacher to furnish a written reply within a
specified time which may not be
less than 14 days: cl. 14(3).
<P>

	(e)	Any such reply must either admit or deny the truth of the charge notified;
and may give, in addition, any explanation that
the particular teacher may wish
to make in regard to the charge: cl. 14(4).
<P>

	(f)	If a reply is not received from the particular teacher within the time
specified in the relevant portion of the written notification
of charge, then
the teacher is taken to have denied the truth of the charge as notified: cl.
14(5).
<P>

	(g)	In the event that the particular teacher denies the notified charge, it
becomes necessary for the Director General, or a designated
prescribed officer,
to deal with the charge. That may be done in either of two ways. The first way
is by directing the particular
teacher to furnish an explanation in writing.
Such an explanation must be furnished within the time prescribed by the
direction calling
for the furnishing of the explanation; but that time must not
be less than 14 days. The second permitted approach  is the conducting
of an
inquiry into the charge: cl. 15(1) and (2).
<P>

	(h)	If it is decided to deal with the charge by directing the particular
teacher to furnish an explanation in writing, then the
person dealing with the
charge is authorised to do either of two things. The first thing authorised is
the making of a finding <i>"............. after considering any reports
relating to the breach of discipline and any replies or explanations of the
member of
staff"</i>. Alternatively, the person dealing with the charge is
authorised to decide to deal thereafter with the charge by conducting an
inquiry:
cl. 15(3)
<P>

	(i)	If it is decided, at any stage of dealing with a charge, that there should
be an inquiry, then it is required that such an
inquiry be conducted in
accordance with procedures which are established in that behalf by clause 16 of
the Regulations.
<P>

	(j)	Clause 16 is critical in the present case. It is, therefore, useful to set
it out in full, and as follows:
<P>

<b><i>"Conduct of inquiries</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>  16. (1)   </i></b><i>If it is decided to conduct an inquiry, the
disciplinary authority must give written notice to the member of staff charged
of the
time, date and place at which the inquiry is to be conducted.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(2)   </b>If the member of staff does not, without reasonable cause,
appear at the time, date and place notified, the charge may be inquired
into
and dealt with in the member's absence.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(3)</b>   For the purposes of an inquiry, a disciplinary authority may
call on any person to appear and to give such evidence, and produce
such
documents, as appear to the authority to be relevant to the inquiry.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(4)</b>   A member of staff must not, without reasonable cause:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a) fail to appear, give evidence or produce documents at an inquiry when
called on to do so; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b) knowingly give false or misleading evidence at an inquiry.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(5)   </b>A member of staff may be represented at an inquiry by a
barrister, solicitor or agent employed at the member's expense.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(6)   </b>A disciplinary authority may conduct an inquiry without
regard to legal formality, and is not bound by any law or practice as to
evidence,
but may inform himself or herself of any matter in such manner as he
or she thinks fit.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(7)   </b>However, a disciplinary authority must not inform himself or
herself of, or take into consideration, any matter that has not been
disclosed
in evidence at a sitting of the inquiry if the matter is one that ought, in the
interests of justice, to be available for
challenge or testing by the persons
entitled to be present at the inquiry.</i>
<P>

<i>  <b>(8)   </b>Nothing in subclause (7) prevents a disciplinary
authority:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	from informing himself or herself of, or taking into consideration, any
matter of which a court would be entitled to take judicial
notice; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	when deciding whether or how to punish a member of staff found to have
committed a breach of discipline, from taking into consideration
any previous
breach of discipline that has been found by a disciplinary authority to have
been committed by the person charged."</i>
<P>

6  	Given the circumstances of the present particular case, it is
desirable, I think, to make the following observations about 
the procedures
that are laid down by clause 16 of the Regulations.
<P>

7  	<i>First</i>, it is clear, in my opinion, that sub-clauses (6)
and (7) are intended to be read together in order to make clear that the
breadth
of the language used in sub-clause (6) is not to be understood as
constituting an inquiry conducted pursuant to clause 16 as some
kind of
peremptory, inquisitorial procedure akin to the procedure of, for example, the
old Court of Star Chamber. 
<P>

8  	<i>Secondly</i>, there is, as I read sub-clause (7), some
ambiguity about how, exactly, it is contemplated that the sub-clause might
operate in a
particular case. If the sub-clause had terminated after the words
<i>"........at a sitting of the inquiry"</i>, there would have been, I think,
no such ambiguity. The ambiguity which I perceive arises by reason of the
addition of the words
<i>".............. if the matter is one that ought, in
the interests of justice, to be available for challenge or testing by the
persons
entitled to be present at the inquiry"</i>.
<P>

9  	During the course of the oral submissions of counsel, I raised
this apparent ambiguity in the wording of sub-clause (7). I pointed
out that it
seemed to me that the concluding words of the sub-clause could be read in such
away as to authorise a person who was
conducting a clause 16 inquiry to take
into account anything coming to the notice of that person outside <i>"a sitting
of the inquiry"</i>; subject only to the wholly subjective view of that person
upon the question, which might have very great significance in a particular
case, whether <i>"the interests of justice"</i> entailed an opportunity
<i>"................for challenge or testing by the persons entitled to be
present at the inquiry"</i>.
<P>

10  	In response, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the defendants
assured the Court that it is the invariable practice, in the
conduct of a
clause 16 inquiry, that the person conducting the inquiry absolutely disregards
anything falling outside what has been
<i>"..........disclosed in evidence at a
sitting of the inquiry"</i>. Learned Senior Counsel gave that assurance not
only in general terms, but also in terms particular to the case of the present
plaintiff.

<P>

11  	I accept, as of course, what was thus put to the Court by
learned Senior Counsel for the defendants. I think, nevertheless,
that the
ambiguity of which I have been speaking should be brought to the urgent
attention of the relevant authorities, to the end
of having that ambiguity
removed. In the present particular case, I am fortunate to have had that
assurance from learned Senior Counsel
 for the defendants; and to have had the
assurance accepted, - or, at least, not actively disputed, - by learned counsel
for the
plaintiff. Absent those circumstances, I would have thought that the
ambiguity of which I have been speaking would have a very real
relevance to the
carrying out of that weighing exercise of which the High Court speaks in
<b>Walton</b>.
<P>

<b><u>The Course to Date of the Current Disciplinary Proceedings against the
Plaintiff</u></b>
<P>

12  	In 1986 the plaintiff was a school teacher at a particular high
school where he taught science and agriculture. One of his
students was a young
girl who has been referred to in connection with the present proceedings by the
pseudonym `<i>S'.</i> Miss S alleged, put shortly, that the plaintiff had on
two separate occasions in 1996, had consensual sexual intercourse with her.

<P>

13  	The allegations were referred to the police. The police
investigations did not result in any charging of the plaintiff, principally,
as
I infer from the available evidence, because Miss S, although willing to be
interviewed by the police, and although interviewed
in fact by them, was not
willing to give evidence in Court in support of any charge preferred formally
by the police against the
plaintiff.
<P>

14  	I am satisfied that departmental policy at the time was that in
such a case, if the police were not prepared to charge the
particular school
teacher, and if the reason for that was a reluctance on the part of the
particular pupil to give the necessary
evidence in Court, then the Department
itself would take, in effect, no further action of substance. That is what
happened in the
plaintiff's particular case. As I have said, there were various
departmental investigations. They included a meeting at which Miss
S's natural
mother, a lady who was then acting as Miss S's guardian, and the plaintiff
himself were interviewed by departmental officials.
Then, and at all other
material times, the plaintiff denied absolutely, and has continued to deny
absolutely, that he in any way
misconducted himself with Miss S, either as she
alleges, or at all. 
<P>

15  	In 1986, the police having decided to take no further action
against the plaintiff, the departmental file on the allegations
was, in effect,
closed.
<P>

16  	By then, the plaintiff had been moved at his own request to
another school. Further allegations of professional misconduct
were made
against him. They involved inappropriate behaviour of various kinds, but it is
not necessary to repeat here the fine detail
of what was alleged. It is plain
from the available evidence that the 1986 matters were present to the minds of
the departmental
officials who investigated the 1989 allegations. The 1989
allegations were monitored according to then current departmental procedures.
The plaintiff was  given a fairly strong rebuke about the behaviour which had
given rise to the particular complaints. That apart,
no further disciplinary
action of any kind appears to have been thought necessary.
<P>

17  	Thereafter, 9 years elapsed; and elapsed, as it would seem from
the evidence to hand, without any further untoward events in
the plaintiff's
teaching career.
<P>

18  	In 1997 the 1986 incidents were, however, re-activated. It is
that re-activation which has given rise to the disciplinary proceedings
in
connection with which the plaintiff makes his present application.
<P>

19  	I am satisfied that the re-activation of the 1986 matters
resulted, putting the point in simple terms, from the activities
of the Royal
Commission presided over by Wood CJ at CL, as his Honour now is, into the NSW
Police Service. The course of the hearing
conducted by the Royal Commissioner
gave rise to a supplementary reference to the Commissioner of certain
allegations of paedophilia,
being allegations thought to be connected with the
allegations of corruption and malpractice which were, otherwise, the principal
concerns of the original Terms of Reference of the Royal Commission. The
inquiries of the Royal Commissioner into these allegations
of paedophilia led
in their terms to the appointment of the Honourable John Slattery QC, lately a
Judge of this Court and Chief Judge
at Common Law, to review a large number of
files concerning past allegations of sexual misconduct by school teachers
towards their
pupils. My impression from what I have read is that the
plaintiff's 1986 file was not referred, in a particular way, to Mr. Slattery
QC; and that it was not mentioned by him, in terms, as a file which ought to be
re-opened. Be that as it may, I am satisfied that
it was the review conducted
by Mr. Slattery QC that gave rise to the re-opening in fact of the  1986
allegations that had been made
against the plaintiff by Miss S.
<P>

20  	By a letter dated 27 August 1997, a Mr. John Fox, who appears to
have been the Case Manager then in charge of the re-opened
investigation, sent
a letter to the plaintiff informing him that the Department would be
investigating an allegation of conduct <i>"that could amount to improper
conduct of a sexual nature with a student"</i>. The letter appears to be in a
standardised format. It gives the plaintiff certain peremptory directions; but
furnishes absolutely
no particulars of the conduct to which it refers. The
plaintiff has given evidence, which I accept, that thereafter, and until
October
1997, he received no further word from the Department. 
<P>

21  	In due course, and by a letter dated 13 October 1997, the
plaintiff was contacted by a Miss (or Mrs.) Blackadder, Chief Investigator
of
the Case Management Unit within the Department. Save for one additional
paragraph which is of no present particular importance,
the letter of 13
October was in exactly the same form as the letter of 27 August 1997 that had
been written by Mr. Fox.
<P>

22  	The plaintiff gave evidence, which I accept, that he had
thereafter, and until May 1998, no further contact from Miss (or Mrs.)
Blackadder. He received, however, in May 1998 a letter dated 6 May. This letter
called upon the plaintiff to respond in writing to
allegations which were
particularised as follows:
<P>

<i>"1	That on 5 or 12 June 1986 at the conclusion of a Thursday evening
photography class, whilst in the preparation room adjacent to
the science
laboratory in a demountable building at Manilla Central School you:</i>
<P>

<i>	a)	kissed a Year 10 female student, namely (......Miss S......), on the
mouth;</i>
<P>

<i>	b)	fondled the breasts of a Year 10 female student, namely (....Miss S....)
through her clothing;</i>
<P>

<i>	c)	pushed up the sports bra top and fondled the naked breasts of a Year 10
female student, namely .....(Miss S)....;</i>
<P>

<i>	d)	removed and dropped on the floor the knickers of a Year 10 female
student, namely..... (Miss S) ......;</i>
<P>

<i>	e)	removed your trousers and underpants in the presence of a Year 10 female
student, namely ....(Miss S)....;</i>
<P>

<i>	f)	took a condom from the drawer of the desk in the preparation room,
removed the condom from its wrapper and placed the condom on
your erect penis
in the presence of a Year 10 female student, namely .....(Miss
S).......;</i>
<P>

<i>	g)	lay on top of and inserted your penis into the vagina of a Year 10
female student, namely ....(Miss S)...., who was lying on the
couch;</i>
<P>

<i>	h)	performed cunnilingus on a Year 10 female student, namely .....(Miss
S)....;</i>
<P>

<i>	i)	lay on top of and again inserted your penis into the vagina of a Year 10
female student, namely ....(Miss S)....., and some time
later you
ejaculated.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	During July 1986, on a Thursday evening at a photography class in the
science laboratory in a demountable building at Manilla Central
School
you</i>
<P>

<i>	a)	came up behind and, with your hands, fondled the breasts of a Year 10
female student, namely ...(Miss S)....;</i>
<P>

<i>	b)	at the conclusion of the photography class, on the couch in the
preparation room adjacent to the science laboratory in a demountable
building
at Manilla Central School you had sexual intercourse with a Year 10 female
student, namely ....(Miss S)....."</i>
<P>

23  	The plaintiff responded in writing and by a letter dated 8 May
1998. Put simply, the plaintiff denied outright each and every
allegation of
misconduct that he had been called upon to answer.
<P>

24  	Once again, several months passed. And then, and by a notice in
writing dated 17 November 1998, the plaintiff was formally
notified that he was
charged with a breach of discipline in that he had engaged in improper conduct.
The particulars of the breach
thus charged against the plaintiff were the same
particulars as those that had been provided in the letter of 6 May 1998. By a
letter
dated 19 November 1998, the plaintiff denied outright each and every
allegation of misconduct charged against him.
<P>

25  	On 11 January 1999 the first defendant, Mr. Buckley, wrote to
the solicitor for the plaintiff advising that he had been appointed
to deal, as
prescribed officer, with the charges that had been preferred against the
plaintiff. Mr. Buckley advised that he had decided
to deal with the charges
under clause 15(2)(a) of the Regulations. Mr. Buckley advised, further, that he
had asked for a report on
the matter from the relevant departmental officials,
and that he would provide a copy of the report as soon as he had received it.
This he did subsequently, and by letter dated 8 February 1999. In that letter
Mr. Buckley called upon the plaintiff to furnish an
explanation in writing by
19 February 1999.
<P>

26  	The case thus served upon the plaintiff is Exhibit A in the
present proceedings. It is what a lawyer would describe conventionally
as a
written submission outlining, both as to fact and as to law, the case which it
is sought to make against the plaintiff. Attached
to that submission is a
collection of documents concerning the 1986 allegations. They include file
notes and the like documents apparently
taken from the relevant departmental
files. They include, also, a very detailed statement taken from Miss S on 10
December 1998.

<P>

27  	On 10 February 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to the first
defendant asking for an extension of time in which to reply
to the submission,
Exhibit A. Between 10 February 1999 and 7 June 1999 there was a steady flow of
correspondence from the plaintiff's
solicitor. Much of it is addressed to the
first defendant and seeks successive extensions of time for the filing of the
plaintiff's
submissions in reply to the departmental submission earlier
mentioned. Some of the correspondence is directed to a Mr. Whelan, the
General
Manager of Executive and Legal Services in the Department. It is not necessary,
I think, to rehearse for present purposes
the fine detail of this
correspondence. It is sufficient to understand that there has grown out of it a
firm conviction on the part
of those representing the plaintiff that they are
not being given access to departmental files and the like materials to which
they
ought to be entitled in aid of the proper preparation of the plaintiff's
case in answer to the charges pending against him. To such
an extent did this
conviction take root, that a formal dispute notification was lodged with the
Industrial Relations Commission.
This notification gave rise to proceedings in
the Industrial Relations Commission, which proceedings were eventually settled
upon
a basis that did make available to the plaintiff's advisers some material
additional to that which they had previously been given
by the Department and
its representatives. 
<P>

28  	One letter in particular, which forms part of the sequence of
correspondence written between  10 February 1999 and 7 June 1999,
calls for a
more particular noting. It is a letter dated 7 May 1999 and written by Miss (or
Mrs.) Blackadder, previously herein mentioned,
to the plaintiff's solicitor.
The letter says, among other things, this:
<P>

<i>"The Department's position is that the material to be relied upon to support
the charge against Mr. Drabsch has already been provided
to the Prescribed
Officer."</i>
<P>

29  	I take this to be a reference to the departmental submission
which is Exhibit A in the present proceedings.
<P>

30  	Eventually, and on 7 June 1999, the plaintiff's solicitor
forwarded to the first defendant, as Prescribed Officer, a detailed
written
submission in reply to the departmental submission, Exhibit A in the present
proceedings. This written submission put in
for the plaintiff was admitted as
Exhibit B in the present proceedings. Before looking at any of the detail of
Exhibit B, two preliminary
observations about it are relevant. <i>First</i>,
the first defendant allowed, by my reckoning, at least four distinct extensions
of time for the lodging by the plaintiff of a submission
in reply to the
departmental submission, Exhibit A in the present proceedings. <i>Secondly</i>,
it does not appear to have occurred to any of the plaintiff's legal
representatives and advisers, as of June 1999, that the plaintiff
was by then
in so unfairly prejudiced a position as would justify the making to this Court
of an application for a permanent stay
of the disciplinary proceedings. This
is, as I think, a relevant consideration both as to the assertion now made by
the plaintiff
that he is, in fact, so prejudiced; and as to the discretionary
element in relief of the kind now claimed by the plaintiff.
<P>

31  	As I have said, on 7 June 1998 a detailed written submission in
reply was put in by the plaintiff. The submission runs to 25
pages. Attached to
it is a schedule of 14 documents, many of them substantial witness statements.
The submission itself is closely
reasoned and clearly expressed. It contradicts
with logic and precision various of the arguments advanced in the departmental
submission.

<P>

32  	The submission deals, among other things, with a number of
preliminary issues. At the forefront of them is the issue of the
way in which
the Prescribed Officer should proceed: that is to say, whether he should
proceed under clause 15(2)(a), or by way of
a hearing under clause 15(2)(b). A
submission is put in the following precise terms:
<P>

<i>We submit that you could only form a concluded view on the charge after
hearing from witnesses in this matter. This is particularly
the case in
relation to the two key witnesses: David Drabsch and ..(Miss S)......"</i>
<P>

33  	Following receipt of the plaintiff's written submission, and on
19 July 1999, the first defendant wrote to the plaintiff's
solicitor a letter,
the relevant parts of which are as follows:
<P>

<i>"Having considered the material before me it is quite clear that there is
directly conflicting evidence in regard to a number of significant
issues which
go to the heart of the particulars of the charge.</i>
<P>

<i>In these circumstances I have decided to continue dealing with this matter
in accordance with Clause 15(3)(b) by holding an inquiry
in accordance with
Clause 16. The inquiry will supplement evidence already provided in written
submission.</i>
<P>

<i>I anticipate that the inquiry will be brief and specific in its focus, as I
have already considered a substantial volume of written
material.</i>
<P>

<i>I will also extend an opportunity to Mr. Drabsch to give evidence in person
about any other matter of relevance.</i>
<P>

<i>For the benefit of all involved in this case and to ensure that this matter
is resolved speedily, I would like to meet with you and
Mr. Paul X Whelan,
General Manager of Executive and Legal Services, Department of Education and
Training, to discuss preliminary
procedures relating to the conduct of the
inquiry. I do not intend to discuss evidence of any kind at this stage."</i>
<P>

34  	On 27 July what might be described as a round table conference
was held in order to consider various practical aspects of the
proposed oral
hearing. That conference gave rise to a further letter to the plaintiff's
solicitor from the first defendant. The relevant
contents of that letter are as
follows:
<P>

<i>"As previously advised in my letter of 19 July 1999, due to directly
conflicting evidence, I am proceeding to deal with the matter
by inquiry. The
inquiry will be narrow in focus.</i>
<P>

<i>I have before me already a report from the Department of Education and
Training in relation to the charges made against Mr. Drabsch
on 17 November
1998. Included in that report is Mr. Drabsch's statement of 1 August 1986. The
report also includes an undated record
of interview with .......(Miss S)
.........and .......(Miss S's)..... statement of the 3 September 1997 and 10
December 1998. I also
have before me your submission of 7 June 1999 on behalf
of Mr. Drabsch.</i>
<P>

<i>I am working on the assumption that I have before me all that you wish me to
have in relation to this matter. If there is any additional
evidence you wish
to be considered at the inquiry please provide it by Thursday 4 August
1999.</i>
<P>

<i>The purpose of the inquiry is to test the evidence of ......(Miss S) ......
and Mr. Brabsch.</i>
<P>

<i>I will allow 5 days from the conclusion of the hearing (date to be fixed)
for the Department of Education and Training to provide
me with any further
written submission the Department may wish to make. A copy of this will be made
available to you with a further
period of 5 days allowed for any resulting
submission you may wish to make.</i>
<P>

<i>Following our discussions of 27 July 1999 if you have any concerns about the
procedural fairness of the process I have outlined for
conducting the inquiry I
invite you to bring those concerns to my attention by 4 August 1999.</i>
<P>

<i>It would also be helpful if you could advise me promptly if for any reason
you become aware that a person whose evidence I seek to
test in this matter is
unable to appear at the hearing."</i>
<P>

35  	Thereafter, and by letter dated 5 August 1999, the plaintiff's
solicitor wrote to the first defendant concerning, put shortly,
ongoing
endeavours to obtain additional material which it was thought either was, or
ought to be, available from departmental and
other sources. The following
proposition was put to the first defendant: 
<P>

<i>"In the circumstances, it is our submission that where there is a conflict
of material significance between the evidence of Mr. Drabsch
and his assertions
in the written submissions and that of the Departmental witness then, in the
interest of procedural fairness,
that witness should be required for
cross-examination. Should they not be made available then, at an appropriate
time, we will make
submissions as to the relevance of their evidence."</i>
<P>

36  	There was some further correspondence as to procedural matters,
and as to the provision of additional documentation to the
plaintiff and his
representatives, but it is not necessary to repeat the detail of that
correspondence.
<P>

37  	In due course the first defendant fixed two days for the
proposed oral hearing. Thereafter, and on 15 October last, the solicitor
for
the plaintiff wrote to the first defendant a letter, the relevant portions of
which are as follows:
<P>

<i>"We advise that we have instructed Ms Marty of counsel to appear at the
proposed oral inquiry. We have today received advice from
Ms Marty in the
matter.</i>
<P>

<i>We refer to paragraph 11 of our Submissions on Behalf of David Drabsch and
in particular its reference to a decision to be made by
you prior to
determining whether an oral inquiry should be held. That decision is whether it
is fair for these disciplinary proceedings
to continue at all.</i>
<P>

<i>We submit that you should decide that it is unfair for this matter to go any
further and that in all the circumstances to continue
with disciplinary
proceedings would constitute an abuse of process. We refer you to the decision
of the High Court of Australia in
</i>Walton v Gardiner (1992) 177 CLR 178.<i>
We rely on paragraphs 31-34 as to porejudice occasioned to Mr. Drabsch and
paragraph 26 of our submissions as to the material no
longer available, which
was in existence at the first Departmental inquiry into this matter. We refer
to the letter of Mr. Paul Whelan
dated 22 September 1999 advising that police
records in this inquiry are no longer in existence. This includes a statement
of ..(Miss
S).. and records of interviews of Mr. Drabsch.</i>
<P>

<i>At the time of preparing written submissions in this matter, we attempted to
locate the students said to be in the photography classes
at the time. We
believe that these students would have been able to confirm that insufficient
time had elapsed since the commencement
of the photography course for there to
have been an opportunity for the two incidents to have taken place six weeks
apart as alleged.</i>
<P>

<i>We were successful in locating Dione McKnight, who stated that it was too
long ago to remember the details of the photography classes
she attended. We
were unable to trace Michael Todd.</i>
<P>

<i>Any documents, including Departmental records, which may have been of
assistance in establishing this point are no longer in existence.</i>
<P>

<i>An inability to prove these matters is prejudicial and unfair to Mr. Drabsch
and further compounds the oppressive nature of the reinstitution
of these
proceedings after a delay of twelve years.</i>
<P>

<i>Should you be unwilling to terminate the proceedings at this stage on the
basis that the determination of the proceedings would be
an abuse of process,
we request that this matter be adjourned pending final determination of the
matters of </i>Smith v Boston <i>(currently reserved), and the matter of
</i>Singleton v Boston <i>(hearing of which is listed for 4 November 1999) both
of which are applications to the Supreme Court for permanent stays on grounds
similar to those raised in our submissions. We submit that the continuation of
these proceedings on 25 and 26 October 1999, with
similar matters pending
before the Supreme Court, would constitute a further abuse of process."</i>
<P>

38  	The reference in that letter to paragraph 11 of the submission
earlier put in on behalf of the plaintiff is a reference to
the following
paragraph of that submission:
<P>

<i>"If you are not minded to dismiss the charge as particularised at this
stage, we strongly submit that before you make any determination
as to the
charge that you conduct an inquiry as outlined in the Regulations."</i>
<P>

39  	By letter dated 19 October last the first defendant replied in
terms indicating that, having considered carefully what had
been put to him, he
had <i>"........ formed the view that I should proceed to deal with this matter
by way of the planned inquiry and that it is in Mr. Drabsch's
interest that the
matter be concluded as expeditiously as practicable"</i>.
<P>

40  	It is this decision of the first defendant which has triggered
the present application for relief by way of a permanent stay
of the current
disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff.
<P>

<b><u>The Merits of the Plaintiff's Present Claim for Relief</u></b>
<P>

41  	The first matter to consider is whether, if the proposed oral
hearing is allowed to proceed, it can be expected reasonably
that the plaintiff
will have a fair chance of defending himself against the charges that have been
preferred against him.
<P>

42  	In that connection, I think that it is worthwhile to make at the
outset a point which is obvious, but which is apt to be overlooked
in the
rather over-heated atmosphere which seems to me to have grown up around the
current disciplinary proceedings. The point is,
simply, that it is not at all
inevitable, as matters stand, that the charges must, or even that they probably
will, be found proved.
This Court, and for that matter the first defendant, can
have at the present time no idea of how Miss S will present as a witness
at the
proposed hearing. She might be impressive; but then again she might not be. Her
evidence seems to be uncorroborated, a circumstance
which is, as a matter of
common sense to put the point no higher, always a matter of anxious concern in
connection with the making
of any finding as to whether or not an alleged
sexual impropriety has occurred.
<P>

43  	The plaintiff will have a full opportunity, by counsel, to
cross-examine Miss S. It is submitted for the plaintiff that such
opportunity
is more apparent than real in the sense that it is possible to identify police
and other departmental documents which
once existed but which no longer appear
to exist, and of which it might be supposed that, if available, they would
provide the basis
for cross-examination of Miss S as to prior inconsistent
statements made by her. There are, in my opinion, several answers available,
at
this stage of proceedings, to that submission. <i>First</i>, in so far as it is
possible to identify the previous, but not current, existence of any such
documents, it is entirely a matter
of speculation as to what they might have
proved, upon examination, to contain that is relevant to such a
cross-examination of Miss
S. <i>Secondly</i>, the material already in the
possession of the plaintiff, (some, but as I acknowledge, not all of which I
have previously herein
summarised), contains material which seems to me to have
some real value from the point of view of a potential cross-examination
of Miss
S. <i>Thirdly</i>, and if I may fall back upon an old saying, the proof of the
pudding is in the eating. If in the events which happen at the proposed
inquiry, it is demonstrable that the plaintiff, through no fault of his own,
was deprived of a fair chance of cross-examining Miss
S, upon whose evidence
alone the charges against him really depend, then he will have every proper
opportunity of seeking appropriate
relief, including appropriate relief from
this Court. Such an application can be dealt with upon its own merits and in
the light
of demonstrated facts; whereas the present application invites
speculation as to what such facts might prove to be in the future.
<P>

44  	The plaintiff submits, also, that in a more general sense he is
irremediably prejudiced in his proper defence of the charges
pending against
him, by reason of his having been deprived of documentary material to which he
is entitled. I am not satisfied, on
the probabilities, that the evidence before
me justifies a finding to that effect. Learned Senior Counsel for the
defendants put
in, in connection with his submissions at the recent hearing, a
schedule of documents which have been provided to the plaintiff's
representatives in connection with the 1986 investigations into the relevant
allegations of sexual impropriety. I will have that
document marked for
identification. `1' and kept with the Court file for any necessary future
reference. The contents of the document
are completely clear and I need not now
repeat them. It suffices to say that the contents of that schedule, and what I
have seen
among the other material put into evidence in connection with the
present application, satisfies me, on the probabilities, that the
plaintiff is
not improperly prejudiced by reason of the demonstrated existence of other
documents to which he is entitled and which
have not been made available to him
upon proper request. Once again, it is worthwhile making the point that if, at
the proposed hearing,
it emerges in a real and concrete way that  there is some
documentary hiatus or other which gives rise to incurable prejudice to
the
plaintiff in his proper defence of the pending charges, then this Court is
able, and in a proper case will not hesitate, to give
some appropriate relief.

<P>

45  	Running through the submissions of the plaintiff upon this vexed
question of documentary material is, as I followed the submissions,
a
suggestion that the Department has not made, upon proper request, such full and
frank disclosure of relevant documents as might
have been expected of a party
to litigation, and in particular of a party which is a major Department of
State. From what I have
seen of the departmental materials, I would say that
the departmental files appear to have been, and still to be in some degree,
somewhat in disarray. It is the case that various bits and pieces of
documentary material have been provided, as it were in dribs
and drabs, to the
plaintiff and his representatives; and it can be accepted readily and
reasonably that the result has been to engender
a suspicion that there might be
lurking somewhere or other even further documents which, were they only brought
to light, would prove
to have present utility for the plaintiff. But that is
not the same thing as saying that it has been demonstrated on the probabilities
that in fact such is the case; and, as earlier indicated, I am not in fact so
satisfied.
<P>

46  	I think that it should be said, in fairness to the first
defendant, that his position in the present controversy can only be
judged from
his correspondence as annexed to the various affidavits read by the parties in
support of their respective cases. I think
it is only fair to say that a
reasonable reading in context of that correspondence does not suggest that
there is anything at all
untoward in the procedure which the first defendant
has indicated he proposes to adopt. As earlier indicated, the first defendant
was asked for a succession of extensions of time in which to reply to the
charges; and he granted every such extension upon request.
The submissions put
for the plaintiff to the first defendant asked in terms for an oral hearing
rather than for an inquiry based
only upon documentary material; and the first
defendant, once again, acceded to that request. It is true that the first
defendant
has placed, at least for the time being, procedural limitations upon
the proposed oral hearing; but that is not, of itself, indicative
of prejudice
or of any other form of procedural unfairness. As I have now said more than
once, what is important in terms of procedural
fairness is not so much what
might happen, but what does in fact happen.
<P>

47  	As I understand the current state of affairs concerning the
proposed oral hearing, the first defendant will have before him
documentary
material in the form of the competing submissions, Exhibits A and B, in the
present application. He will have before
him no other documentary material
unless it has first been produced by the party intending to rely upon it to the
opposing party.
He will hear from Miss S; and he will hear separately from the
plaintiff. Whoever appears for the Department will have the opportunity
of
questioning the plaintiff; and the plaintiff will have the opportunity, by
counsel, of cross-examining Miss S. The working out,
on the ground as it were,
of those procedures might, or might not, indicate that it would be required as
a matter of procedural fairness
or natural justice otherwise, that some
additional witness or witnesses, being available to be called, should be called
in fact.
I do not see any warrant for an anticipatory conclusion that the first
defendant, if such a state of affairs arises in fact, either
cannot or will not
deal with it justly and according to the relevant law.
<P>

48  	I have not overlooked the very considerable impact which the
evidence demonstrates, as I am satisfied it does, to have been
caused to the
plaintiff by the re-activation of the 1986 matters. The psychological, and
indeed the psychiatric consequences, to
the plaintiff have been real. I admit
to a subjective feeling that there is, on the face of the events which have
happened, a harshness
about the notion that the plaintiff, having had the 1986
matters investigated without any adverse findings having been made against
him,
should discover that, through no fault of his own, he has to re-defend himself
some 13 years after the events in question. In
objective, rather than
subjective, terms, that delay is itself a matter of real weight in the
plaintiff's side of the balance which
has now to be struck by this Court; and I
have given it weight accordingly.
<P>

49  	It is, however, important that sight not be lost of the
countervailing public interest. The Royal Commission to which I earlier
referred brought to public notice, and very much to public concern, in a way
which I think had not previously obtained, the prevalence
of abuse, including
sexual abuse, of school pupils by school teachers. What was uncovered by, and
in the wake of, the Royal Commission
demonstrated, - or, at the very least, has
been widely seen as having demonstrated, - administrative slackness in the
proper investigation
and correction of allegations of such abuse. These are
matters of very great public interest; and they, too, must be given a proper,
and a properly substantial, weight in the relevant scheme of things.
<P>

50  	I advert, finally, to the question of delay on the part of the
plaintiff in seeking the relief that he now claims. I would
not think it fair
to take the view that the plaintiff should have moved for a permanent stay as
soon as he had received, in November
1998, formal notice of the charges made
against him. I do think, however, that by May/June of this year he both could
and should
have moved for a permanent stay if that is what he wanted to
achieve. He chose, instead, - albeit, as I do not doubt, upon professional
legal advice, - <i>first,</i> to seek relief in the Industrial Relations
Commission; and <i>secondly</i>, to make the written submissions put in for him
by his legal representatives on 7 June last. These considerations of delay on
the
part of the plaintiff must be kept, of course, in a sensible perspective
and in a fair context. I do not regard them as being, of
themselves, simply
determinative of the present application. I do think, however, that they are a
real consideration militating against
the grant of the present application.
<P>

51  	Doing the best I can to strike the balance described in the
decision, earlier cited, in <b>Walton</b>, I have come to the conclusion that
the plaintiff has not made good his claim for relief.
<P>

<b><u>Orders</u></b>
<P>

52  	For the whole of the foregoing reasons, I make the following
orders:
<P>

(1)	That the plaintiff's summons be dismissed.
<P>

(2)	That the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

(3)	That the exhibits remain in Court for a period of 28 days from today. If,
within that period, an appeal is lodged against this
judgment, then the
exhibits are to remain in Court pending further order. If within that period no
such appeal is lodged, then the
exhibits thereafter may be returned to the
persons or bodies respectively entitled to them.
