<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Interrogatory - circulation - readership)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  This matter was commenced by the filing of a
Statement of Claim on 23 September 1991 in respect of a publication
in "<i>The
Armidale Express</i>" of 25 March 1991.
<P>

2   	The pleadings closed on 5 September 1996, according to the
court file, on which date was filed the Reply by the plaintiff.
<P>

3   	Interrogatories were filed and presumably delivered by the
plaintiff on or about 6 January 1998 and, significantly, answered
by the
manager of the first defendant, on or about 27 March 1998.
<P>

4   	On 8 April 1999, in excess of one year after the provision
of the answers to the interrogatories, the List Judge fixed the
matter for
hearing on 7 June 1999 on which date I am presently informed the matter in fact
will be listed for hearing.
<P>

5   	Complaint is made by the plaintiff in relation to answers
given by the first defendant to interrogatories 2 and 3, the former
of which
asks, "<i>What was the circulation on or about 25 March 1991</i>?";  the
latter, "<i>What was the readership on or about 25 March 1991</i>?"
<P>

6   	The answers delivered by the first defendant, which is a
corporation, in relation to each interrogatory, was:  "<i>The first defendant
does not possess the circulation figures for the Armidale Express on or about
25 March 1991</i>", and a similar answer was given in relation to readership
figures.
<P>

7   	Strictly, of course, the answer in each case is not in
proper form with respect to knowledge, information or belief on the
part of the
corporation, founded upon inquiries a corporations is expected to make of its
servants and agents for the purposes of
providing sworn answers to
interrogatories.
<P>

8   	The authorities as to the requirements of the corporation
in answering interrogatories are referred to in the notes to SCR
Pt 24, Rule 7
and include the statement of principle by Sir Robert McGarry V.C. in
<b><i>Stanfield Properties Ltd v National Westminster Bank Plc</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20WLR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1
WLR 568</a>, particularly at 570 and 571.  Thus, on a strict basis there is merit
in the complaint made by the plaintiff.
<P>

9   	I gather the position to be, not surprisingly, given the
date of the publication, that the first defendant, if it provided
an answer in
proper form, as it should have done, would certainly provide no further
information to the plaintiff in respect of the
circulation of the relevant
publication on or about 25 March 1991.
<P>

10   	 In proper form, as I understand it, it would be able to
state that it has no knowledge, upon inquiry has obtained no information,
and I
must say, in the light of the information since given to me, probably would
have no reasonable ground for stating any belief,
either as to circulation or,
indeed, readership as focused on 25 March 1991.
<P>

11   	There has been an exchange of correspondence between the
parties in relation to the matter and it has been stated in open
court for the
first defendant that in respect of the period 1 October 1991 to 31 March 1992
the net average sales figures for the
"<i>Armidale Express"</i> was 3692 per
issue, and the defendant admits that fact.
<P>

12   	It is apparently the case that that figure is derived from
sales figures for the period to which I refer which is, of course,
far later
than the date of publication sued upon.
<P>

13   	The position now taken by the defendant and the
information disclosed in its letter of 11 May 1999, does persuade me that
had
the proper form of an answer been adopted in the response to the interrogatory
at the time, (in excess of one year before complaint
was made about it, I
hasten to note), the plaintiff would have been in no better position in terms
of the information he now has.
<P>

14   	This matter has been described as a waste of the court's
time, a waste of counsel's time, sterile and futile, leading to a
submission
that the plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs of the application, (which
will be dismissed), on an indemnity basis.
<P>

15   	Whilst I find that the first defendant has failed properly
to comply with the rules of court in relation to the provision
of answers to
interrogatories by a corporation, I do not propose, in the light of the
information now before me, to make any further
order requiring it to re-swear
either the affidavit of Miss Coffey or to provide further answers.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff should avail himself of that information
which, on the material before me, clearly appears to be the best the
defendant
can give.
<P>

17   	I am not persuaded that the defendant should be compelled
to retrospectively assess readership, that is the matter the subject
of the
second interrogatory, based upon its sales figures so late in time.
<P>

18   	This matter, as I have said, is fixed for hearing on 7
June.
<P>

19   	The direction I give is for the defendant, in an open
letter, to provide the material hitherto provided in the letter of 11
May
1999.
<P>

20   	I do not propose to order any further discovery.  The
plaintiff is at liberty, of course, to issue any subpoenas he chooses
to
issue.
<P>

21   	The point taken was of such extreme technicality and one
that, in my view, could have been resolved otherwise than by moving
the court
for specific relief.
<P>

22   	I dismiss the application.  I do not propose to make an
order for indemnity costs.
<P>

23   	In the light of the information of 11 May 1999, I am
presently disposed to order that the plaintiff to pay the defendant's
costs,
but by reason of the particular quality attending the letter of 11 May 1999
providing the information to which I have  referred,
and the matter there being
left by the defendant, I think in the end the ultimate result should be that
each party pay its own costs.
<P>
