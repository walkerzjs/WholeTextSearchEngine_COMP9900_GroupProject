<i>Thursday, 25 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4793/97	MARGARET SYLVIA JANDA   -v-   DONALD JOHN McNEALL   -   ESTATE OF
SYLVIA McNEALL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.  
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 17 November 1997 the plaintiff,
Margaret Sylvia Janda, claims an order for provision for her maintenance
out of
the estate of her late mother, Sylvia McNeall (to whom I shall refer as "the
deceased")
<P>

3   	The deceased died, aged ninety-two, on 22 May 1996.  She
left a will dated 7 November 1991, probate whereof was, on 5 August
1996,
granted to Donald John McNeall, the executor named in such will (who is the
defendant to the present proceedings).
<P>

4   	The defendant is one of the three children of the deceased.
By her will the deceased gave the entirety of her estate to the
defendant.  The
estate assets consist of a home unit situate at and known as 5/21 Kangaroo
Street, Manly, which has a present estimated
value of $290,000; the contents of
that home unit; shares in National Australia Bank, having a present value of a
little over $44,000;
an indebtedness owed by McNeall Industrial Technologies
Pty Ltd in a present amount of $5,438; and moneys held in an account with
the
Commonwealth Bank in an amount of $21,853.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff was born on 17 December 1932; she is
presently sixty-six years of age.  The defendant was born on 17 September
1935
and is presently sixty-three years of age.  The other child of the deceased,
Malcolm McNeall, was the eldest child.  He makes
no claim against the estate of
his late mother.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff, as a child of the deceased, is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  As such she has the standing
to bring the present proceedings.  The defendant also, and their brother,
Malcolm, are each an eligible
person within the same paragraph of the
definition.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff, when aged in her twenties, travelled to
Canada in 1957.  She married the following year, on 4 October 1958,
her present
husband Lubomer Janda (known as Louis Janda).  They have remained married since
that time for a period of more than forty
years.  There were three children of
that marriage, all of whom are adults with families of their own.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff, although resident in Canada for more than
forty years, maintained contact with her mother, both by letter and
by visits
made by the deceased to the plaintiff and by the plaintiff returning to
Australia to stay with her mother.  Despite attempts
on behalf of the defendant
to suggest that the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased was not
as close, as regular or
as frequent as the plaintiff's evidence would have the
Court believe, I am satisfied that there was a close and affectionate
relationship
between the plaintiff and her mother.
<P>

9   	The visits by the deceased to Canada were always of some
months' duration; at least one of those visits extended over a period
of six
months.  They continued until the advancing years and declining health of the
deceased made them impractical.  The plaintiff
herself continued to make visits
to her mother in Sydney thereafter.
<P>

10   	I have referred to the fact that the plaintiff has been
married to her husband for a period exceeding forty years.  The plaintiff's
husband is a professional engineer, who is now sixty-nine years of age.
However, the plaintiff and her husband have now reached a
stage in their
marriage where it is likely that they will follow separate paths.  The
plaintiff wishes to continue to reside in the
house property in Vancouver.  Her
husband, however, wishes to reside on a property on Cortez Island, located on
Vancouver Island.
 Each of those two pieces of real estate --- the residence in
Vancouver and the rural estate in a somewhat remote location on Cortez
Island
--- is owned jointly by the plaintiff and her husband.
<P>

11   	The house property at 3175 Canfield Crescent, North
Vancouver, has an estimated value of $280,000, whilst the rural property
at Sea
Vista Road, Cortez Island, has an estimated value of $500,000.  I would here
interpolate that the evidence discloses that
there is almost equal parity
between the Canadian currency and the Australian currency at the present
time.
<P>

12   	Each of those properties is subject to a mortgage, the
amount outstanding on the residential property being $136,917, whilst
the
amount outstanding on the Cortez Island property is $102,564.
<P>

13   	Apart from those two jointly owned assets the plaintiff
owns a 1981 Buick sedan motor vehicle with a present estimated value
of $1,000;
she has a small share portfolio worth $4,681; and she has a very small amount
of $55 in a bank account.
<P>

14   	Although the plaintiff is a qualified secretary and
although she has, for some years, been on the books of an employment agency,
she has received no remunerative work in the past two years.  Her only income
is a small pension of $6,200 gross a year.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff's husband is still continuing in employment.
He works for the Canadian Department of Public Works.  His most
recent income
tax return discloses a total income of in excess of $105,000 and a nett income
of $95,659, on which tax of $36,183
was assessed.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff's husband is in the process of negotiating a
contract with the Department of Public Works which will require
him to work on
Vancouver Island, as I understand it, in the city of Victoria.  He proposes in
those circumstances to reside on the
Cortez Island estate.
<P>

17   	At that point the plaintiff and her husband would cease to
live together; their relationship is an amicable one.  They have
no present
plans for divorce or for legal separation.  However, if, as appears to be
likely, the situation shortly arises where the
plaintiff and her husband reside
separately and apart, the plaintiff will find herself in a house property in
Vancouver, subject
to a substantial mortgage, with no other assets, and a
minimal income.
<P>

18   	It should here, however, be recorded that the evidence
discloses that the Cortez Island estate is likely to be subdivided
at some
future time.  There is no evidence before the Court as to the expected return
upon the sale of subdivided parts of that estate.
 However, the evidence
suggests that if the estate is subdivided and if, as he apparently proposes to
do, the plaintiff's husband
continues to reside in one of the subdivided parts
of that estate, then the sale of the other subdivided parts would be sufficient
to discharge the mortgages on each of the two pieces of property owned
conjointly by the plaintiff and her husband.  The evidence
does not disclose
whether any amount would be left over after discharging those mortgages.
<P>

19   	The Court, in approaching the claim of the plaintiff, is
required to look to the circumstances as they exist at the present
time.  It
seems to me that the evidence concerning the plaintiff's matrimonial
arrangements with her husband and the likely separation
which will almost
certainly shortly occur, so far as concern the living arrangements of the
plaintiff and her husband, are such that
the plaintiff has established a degree
of need sufficient to enliven the discretion vested in the court by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.
<P>

20   	It is necessary to consider the claim of the plaintiff in
the light of any competing claims upon the testamentary bounty of
the deceased.
The only other competing claim which the Court must consider is that of the
defendant, who, it should be emphasised,
is the chosen object of the
testamentary beneficence of the deceased.
<P>

21   	It is not necessary for the defendant to prove or
establish anything.  It is for the plaintiff to establish her case upon
its own
merits.  The financial and material circumstances of the defendant might,
however, then be such as to reduce, or even to
extinguish, any order for
provision an entitlement to which the plaintiff has otherwise established.
<P>

22   	The defendant lived with his parents until he married and
left home in 1974.  Three years later his marriage broke down and
he returned
to live with his mother, the father of the parties having died in 1958.  From
1977 until her death in 1996 the defendant
resided in the home unit at Manly
with his mother.  He looked after her, cared for her and, when her health and
mobility deteriorated,
he even went so far as to retire from his employment as
a sales engineer in March 1991 in order to become the full-time carer for
the
deceased.
<P>

23   	It is obvious that the deceased recognised the devotion of
her son in looking after her by the terms of her will, in which
she gave the
entirety of her estate to the defendant.
<P>

24   	Evidence has been placed before the Court by the defendant
concerning his present financial and material circumstances.  Apart
from his
interest in the estate of his mother the defendant owns two investment
properties, neither of which is in any way encumbered.
 They are, firstly, a
home unit at Lauderdale Avenue, Fairlight, which has an estimated present value
of $350,000; and, secondly,
a home unit at Peachtree Road, North Ryde, which
has an estimated value of $180,000.  Each of those properties is presently
tenanted
and is producing income.
<P>

25   	The defendant has about $600 in two bank accounts with
Westpac.  He has a total of slightly in excess of $50,000 in two accounts
with
the Commercial Bank of Australia.  He holds units in Westfield Trust, having a
present value of $46,315, and units in General
Property Trust, having a value
of about $20,700.
<P>

26   	In addition he has shares in Coles Myer, having a present
value of $25,518, and shares in Dominion Mining, having a present
value of
$481.  He has a 1996 Holden Commodore motor vehicle, having a present estimated
value of $15,000.
<P>

27   	The defendant has expressed the desire, which I consider a
very understandable and a proper desire, that he should be able
to remain in
residence in the home unit at Kangaroo Street, Manly, which has been his home
for the past twenty-two years and which
he shared with his mother for nineteen
years until her death in 1996.  
<P>

28   	Evidence has been placed before the Court concerning the
likely costs of the parties in the present proceedings.  There is
an estimate
that the costs of the plaintiff will total about $15,000 and that the costs of
the defendant will total about $20,000,
although Counsel for the defendant has
said that it is possible that the defendant's costs may be somewhat less than
that amount.
 They certainly will not be any more.
<P>

29   	Apart from the home unit at Manly and its contents, the
other assets in the estate of the deceased total about $72,000.  After
allowance is made for the costs of both parties of the present proceedings,
there would be an amount available of at least $37,000,
perhaps a little
more.
<P>

30   	I have already recorded that in my view the plaintiff has
established need.  In the absence of any specific information concerning
the
likely return from the subdivision of the Cortez Island estate, it is difficult
for the Court to predict the extent to which
that present need will or may
continue in the future.  But at the present time, it seems to me that the
plaintiff is entitled to
receive from the estate an amount which would enable
her to upgrade her present motor vehicle and to provide for her a fund which,
upon the separation of herself and her husband, would enable her to meet
contingencies.
<P>

31   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that any
order for provision which might be made in favour of the plaintiff
should not
be of such a size which would require the defendant, if he is to remain --- as
he desires to do --- in residence in the
Kangaroo Street unit, to have recourse
to his own separate assets.
<P>

32   	In general I am in agreement with that submission.  It
seems to me that upon the evidence the benefit which I am satisfied
the
plaintiff has established an entitlement to receive out of the estate of her
late mother, should be in an amount of $40,000.
When allowance is made for the
costs of the present proceedings, it would be necessary for the defendant to
have recourse to his
own assets, if at all, only to a very limited extent, and
certainly to no more than $3,000.
<P>

33   	I propose, therefore, to order that the plaintiff receive
out of the estate of the deceased a legacy in the sum of $40,000,
and I propose
also to make an order that each party receive her or his costs out of the
estate.
<P>

34   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the plaintiff receive out of the estate of the late Sylvia
McNeall ("the deceased"), a legacy in the sum of $40,000,
such legacy not to
bear interest if paid on or before 22 June 1999.
<P>

2.	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and the
costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
