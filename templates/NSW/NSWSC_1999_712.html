<b><u>2732/99 KIM THAN TY &amp; ANOR v KIM ENG LO</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter the plaintiff seeks an order
that caveat 3905007 be extended.  The basis of that claim, although
it is not
in any way articulated clearly in the caveat, is apparently that the plaintiffs
assert that they have a lien over the subject
property because the purchase
moneys owing to them by the new registered proprietors have not been paid.
<P>

2   	It seems from the limited evidence available that the
plaintiffs, as registered proprietors of property 123 Hughes Street,
Cabramatta, instructed a solicitor, Mr Lim, to act for them on the sale of that
property to a Mr Kim Eng Lo. The contract is not
in evidence, although it is
said to have been dated 22 December 1997, the consideration being $170,000.
Mr. Lim apparently acted
for the purchaser as well.
<P>

3   	The evidence is that Mrs Ty, one of the plaintiffs, has not
received that money and I accept that her husband, the other vendor,
has not
received any money either.  The transfer document seems to be undated but, as
is normal in these matters, acknowledges the
receipt of the consideration of
$170,000.
<P>

4   	The purchaser's husband says that the purchase moneys were
provided to Mr Lim as to $80,000 by advance from St George Bank
Limited and as
to $100,000 in cash.  Mr Lim says that $90,000 was provided in cash and $80,000
by mortgage and that "as a direct
result of the payment of the total settlement
moneys I arranged for the transfer of the property to the name of Kim Eng Lo".
He also
states a receiver has been appointed to his practice and his files are
held by that receiver, Miss Jean Sayer.
<P>

5   	It is I think clear enough, at least on the evidence before
me, that the Court can take the view that at least at this stage
that moneys
have been misappropriated.  The only question is from whom they have been
misappropriated, namely, whether they have
been misappropriated from the vendor
or from the purchaser.
<P>

6   	On the evidence as it stands at the moment, it seems far
more likely that they have been misappropriated from the vendor, in
other
words, the solicitor at the time of failure to pay those moneys held them on
behalf of the vendor not the purchaser.
<P>

7   	That is supported by the action that has been taken by  the
plaintiff in the District Court of New South Wales claiming the
moneys from the
solicitor and not claiming the moneys from the purchaser.  I should add that it
might possibly be shown to have been
otherwise had the documents held by the
receiver been before the Court, but, in the absence of any of those documents,
I am unable
to say that the plaintiffs have an interest in the property, or may
have an interest in the property, and in those circumstances
the summons should
be dismissed with costs and I so order.
<P>
