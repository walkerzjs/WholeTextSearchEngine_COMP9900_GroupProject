<P>

<b>Judgment (use of Pseudonyms)</b>
<P>

1   	This application is concerned with whether or not those who
have hitherto been described as "<i>complainants"</i> should have the benefit
of the continuation of the pseudonym orders presently in place.
<P>

2   	For a history of the use of pseudonyms see my judgment of
20 November 1998 (DLJT: 6).  It fairly can be said that the orders
hitherto in
operation were made against a background of consent.  The argument recently
heard was the first occasion on which the
question of whether there should be
any such orders at all was considered and full submissions made on the
subject.
<P>

3   	Contrary to the usual practice, no formal Notice of Motion
has been filed.  A preliminary question therefore is the identity
of the moving
party.  That shortly can be answered:  the plaintiff.  The defendant has been
content with the orders presently in
place (to the effect that, until further
order, the names of the complainants - the D persons - should not be mentioned
in open Court).
 The defendant opposes the vacation of the present order.  It
is the plaintiff who seeks to have the order dissolved. 
<P>

4   	On 28 October at the commencement of submissions, orders
were made discharging the application of a pseudonym to the persons
hitherto
referred to as D2 (who is deceased), D3, D14, D19 and D22.
<P>

5   	The D persons with whom this application is concerned, in
the end, are D1, D5, D6, D13, D15, D16, D17, D18, D21, D23 and D24.
<P>

6   	The evidence tendered for the plaintiff is made up of a
bundle of documents (Exhibit A) parts only of which were relied upon
in
relation to several of the D persons.  Further reference will be made to it
below.  Three affidavits, used on a previous occasion,
were also relied upon
being those of Mr Richard William Potter of 5 and 18 September 1998 and Kate
Louise Gillingham of 18 September
1998, together with an affidavit of John
Patrick Deane sworn 26 October 1999.  
<P>

7   	For the defendant the affidavits of Mr Ian Robert Angus
sworn 17 April 1996, 10 May 1996, 13 January 1996 and David Charles
Price sworn
14 January 1999 and 27 October 1999 (there are two such affidavits) were relied
upon.
<P>

8   	Earlier written submissions and outline of submissions were
usefully provided together with two schedules prepared for the
defendants.  The
first schedule is headed "<i>Schedule of References to D Witnesses</i>" which I
will mark as MFI 1 and keep with the papers;  the second schedule a "<i>cut and
paste</i>" compilation of material said to be relevant on both sides, will be
MFI 2.  
<P>

9   	The evidence contains no <i>"direct</i>" evidence from the
"<i>complainants</i>".  For the defendant the evidence is on information and
belief, updated in the recent affidavits, of communications with complainants
or persons acting on their behalf.  The evidence for the plaintiff similarly
can be characterised;  it does not however have the
more direct connection with
the complainants disclosed in the defendant's affidavit.
<P>

<b>10   	</b>It is appropriate, first, to summarise the state of
the evidence as to the "<i>position</i>" of the complainants and my
conclusions.
<P>

<b>D1</b>
<P>

11   	D1 appeared prominently on the "<i>Witness</i>" program.
In a statement made to the police on 29 July 1998 produced under subpoena (part
of Exhibit A) he states:
<P>

<i>"13.	On 6 May 1996 the Channel 7 programme `Witness' went to air which
showed me under the nickname `Bill'.  I decided to appear on
television `full
face' without masking and without disguising my voice because of my concern
that the public would only see the victims
as blank faces, not real people.  I
was standing up for the victims.</i>
<P>

<i>14.	Everything I have ever said in any of these statements has been true to
the best of my knowledge and recall.  I have been persuaded
by the police to be
re-interviewed to try and provide further detail, though I would sooner forget
about the whole thing.  But I
want to see justice done.  It hasn't been done so
far.  I stick to everything I have said, and I want to tell this story in
Court".</i>
<P>

12   	Annexure C to Mr Deane's affidavit is a Victim's
Compensation claim (or part thereof) which discloses the identity of the
complainant.  The claim is against the plaintiff.
<P>

13   	On or about 17 May 1995, according to Mr Angus' affidavit
of 17 April 1996, a conference took place between D1 and counsel
for the
defendant, Mr Wheelhouse, in which the following exchange took place:
<P>

<i>"Wheelhouse:	If you decide to give us a statement, that means, that you will
probably be called on to give evidence at the trial.
 We will take all steps
that are reasonably available to us to conceal your identity prior to the
trial, but it is unlikely that
we will be able to protect your identity at
trial.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	I have no problem with giving you a statement, as long as my name is
kept completely confidential, at least up to the trial. 
I want your
undertaking that I will not be called as a witness without my agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>Wheelhouse:	We can give you that undertaking.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	I am prepared to give evidence at the trial, as long as the evidence is
in camera and my name is kept confidential at all times.
 The decision to
appear as a witness is to be mine if the in camera application is
unsuccessful.</i>
<P>

<i>Wheelhouse:	That's fine."</i>
<P>

14   	In his affidavit of 10 May 1996 Mr Angus deposes to a
telephone conversation he had with D1 in April of that year as follows:
 
<P>

<i>"Angus:	An application has been made to the Court by Mr Marsden in the
defamation proceedings between him and Channel 7 for an order
that your
identity be revealed to Mr Marsden as part of the particulars of Channel 7's
defence.  Do you have any objection to your
name being publicly disclosed to Mr
Marsden?  DO you have any objection to your name being publicly disclosed
during the defamation
proceedings either now or at the trial?  Would you agree
to a meeting with Mr Marsden or his solicitors, if asked?</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	I do not want my name published or made available to John Marsden or his
lawyers.  I want my name suppressed both before and during
any trial.  If John
Marsden is given my name, I fear harassment by him.  If my name were to be
given to Mr Marsden and he or his
lawyers were to approach me for a meeting or
interview, I would refuse to agree".</i>
<P>

15   	Mr Price in his affidavit of 9 February 1999 deposes to a
conversation he had with D1:  
<P>

<i>"DCP:	You know that the Court has made orders preventing your name from
being published in open Court.  Justice Levine confirmed that
order this
morning.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	That's good.  You have to do everything you can to keep my name out of
the papers and off the TV.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	We'll do our best.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	Mate you've got to.  I've got custody proceedings about to start over my
little girl.  She's the most important thing in my life.
 I don't want any
media thing to stuff that case up.  I'm about to start university this year and
I don't want to have to turn up
on the first day and have all these people
pointing and talking about my past.  I'm going to have spend a lot of time with
these
people.  It'll be bad enough for me just trying to learn to study, I
don't need these people talking about me".</i>
<P>

16   	Another conversation with D1 took place on 21 October this
year to which Mr Price deposes as follows:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	I need to talk to you about the issue of pseudonym orders
again.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	What is that?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I'm sorry the pseudonym orders are the orders that witnesses names not
be used in Court.  Code names are used instead.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	Yes.  I know about that.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Marsden has made an application for the orders to be change.</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	In what way?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	He wants to be able to name people in Court.  Do you still want us to
seek to have the orders kept in place?</i>
<P>

<i>D1:	Absolutely.  I have no desire whatsoever for my name to be splashed all
over the newspapers or on TV.  I have an outside life
and I don't want my past
to become to become common knowledge.  I've got a daughter and family to think
of.  I would not be at all
happy if my identity was published during this
trial".</i>
<P>

17   	It is not easy to reconcile the desire of D1 not to have
name splashed all over newspapers or on television with his behaviour
in
appearing, even with the nickname "<i>Bill</i>", in the program in 1996.  It is
to be borne in mind that that program was publicly shown as an exhibit in the
trial of this action
in February of 1999.  The face of D1 would have been known
both in 1996 and 1999 to anyone who knew him.  No further mention was
made of
<i>"harassment"</i>.
<P>

<b>18   	</b>He was concerned in February of this year about
custody proceedings in relation to a child the details of whom are unknown.  It
appears
to me that D1 is expressing what might be described as a firm
preference or wish about disclosure of his identity in terms of
"<i>embarrassment</i>".  He would not be "<i>happy" </i>if his identity was
published.  Whether or not the custody proceedings would bring about exposure
not merely, of course, of his identity,
but also of the details of his conduct
as alleged vis-a-vis the plaintiff is a matter open to question.
<P>

<b>D5</b>
<P>

19   	In May 1995 D5 conferred with Mr Wheelhouse during which
(Angus affidavit 17 April 1996) the following exchange took place:
<P>

<i>"Wheelhouse:	If you decide to give us a statement, that means that you will
probably be called on to give evidence at the trial. 
We will take all steps
that are reasonably available to us to conceal your identity prior to the
trial, but it is unlikely that we
will be able to protect your identity at the
trial.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I am prepared to give you a statement, as long as my name is not
revealed publicly or in any way".</i>
<P>

20   	In April 1996 a telephone conversation took place between
D5 and Mr Angus (affidavit 10 May 1996):  
<P>

<i>"Angus:	An application has been made to the Court by Mr Marsden in the
defamation proceedings between him and Channel 7 for an order
that your
identity be disclosed to Mr Marsden as part of the particulars of Channel 7's
defence.  Do you have any objection to your
name being revealed to Mr Marsden?
Do you have any objection to your name being publicly disclosed during the
defamation proceedings
either now or at the trial.  Would you agree to a
meeting with Mr Marsden or his solicitors, if asked?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I do not want my name revealed either to Mr Marsden or publicly in
Court. I am afraid of harassment of myself and my family from
Mr Marsden and
others.  I have three children, one of whom is only four months old. I believe
three attempts were made on my life
last year.  I want my name suppressed now
and at the trial.  I do not wish to speak to Mr Marsden or his lawyers.  If my
name is
given to Mr Marsden, I would refuse to talk to him or his
lawyers".</i>
<P>

21   	Mr Price had a conversation with D5 on 25 October 1999 it
was in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	Do you remember that orders have been made in these proceedings
preventing you being named in Court?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I remember something like that.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Well, so far in this case, whenever references have had to be made to
witnesses, they have been referred to by code names.  You
have been given the
code name `D5'.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I knew they couldn't say my name but I didn't know I had a code
name.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Marsden has made application to change those orders so that he can name
you in Court.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	Fuck him.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	By that, I take it that you still don't want your name
published.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	Too fuckin' right.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Can you tell me why you don't want your name published?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	Mate, I don't want my kids seeing or hearing about this shit.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	How old are they?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	The oldest is 4 but they know who I am?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Do they live with you.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	No, my wife has them and she has cut off access to them.  I'm meant to
see them on weekends, but she won't let me. I've got to
go back to court to get
a variation of the access orders.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	When will that be?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I don't really know. Either late this year or early next year. </i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Are you concerned about the effect of this matter on those
proceedings?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	What do you mean?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Are you concerned that the publication of your name in the defamation
case might affect your access to your kids?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	It better fuckin' not.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	OK.  I also need to ask you about another matter.  One of Marsden's
lawyers has sworn an affidavit in which he says, I'll just
read this to you: Mr
John Marsden has informed me that in relation to D5, Ron Kinchela, Mr John
Marsden and Marsdens the Attorneys
act for many members of the Aboriginal
Community in Campbelltown who are well aware of Ron Kinchela's allegations of
underage sex
against Mr John Marsden.  Mr John Marsden has advised me that Ron
Kinchela's daughter, his two ex-defacto's and a number of his friends
including
Gary Stewart and Ron Webb.  Do you have anything to say about that?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	Does it say who my ex-defacto's are?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	No, it doesn't.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	Well my daughter is only about 21.  The only thing she knows about this
case is what she has seen on television..  </i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Have you spoken to her about this case.</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	No.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Did you ever speak about this case with any of your defacto's?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	They knew I was involved in it, but I never said much about it to any of
them.  Did you know that Marsdens' are representing one
of my ex's in the case
about access to my kids?.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	No I didn't.  Which one is that?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	Veronica.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	How long have you known Gary Stewart and Ron Webb?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I met Gary Stewart in about 1987.  I've never heard of Ron Webb. Who's
he?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I don't know, just one of the names in this affidavit. How often do you
see Gary Stewart?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	I don't.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Is he a friend of yours?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	No.  He's the guy who swore that stat dec saying that we were in Dharruk
together.  I can prove he's full of shit because I've
never been in Dharruk.
</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	And you've never heard of Ron Webb?</i>
<P>

<i>D5:	No."</i>
<P>

<b>22   	</b>In his affidavit of 26 October 1999 Mr Deane (for
the plaintiff) swears as to conversations he has had with other solicitors in
the
plaintiff's firm which apparently acted for a former wife of D5 who was
aware of allegations of under age sex that D5 had made against
the plaintiff.
The plaintiff's daughter Tammy Mathieson also is aware of the allegations.
Statements from solicitors in the plaintiff's
firm are attached to Mr Deane's
affidavit.  I can draw the inference from the material in Mr Deane's affidavit,
the statements in
the affidavit of Mr Tom Charles Reid another solicitor in the
employ of Marsdens that the fact of the allegations is well known amongst
the
Campbelltown Aboriginal Community in which both the plaintiff and D5 move.  D5
has had four ex-defacto's;  it is well known that
he has made the allegations
about events that he said took place in 1970 and said that he anticipates
getting a lot of money by way
of compensation.  The plaintiff's firm has
received information from two of the ex-defacto's of D5 and his daughter.
Again in this
instance there is some question of "<i>access</i>" to children.
One might well query whether any of this conduct nearly 30 years ago would
arise during any contested applications
in the Family Court or otherwise in
relation to access however, at its best, given the attitude evidenced in the
last conversation
with Mr Price on 25 October 1999 it represents on the part of
D5 (and I stress only for the purposes of this current application)
an attitude
of hostility and an expression of a preference and a wish.  It is very
difficult to see even "<i>embarrassment" </i>in the ordinarily understood
meaning of that word.  Again, there is no further mention of harassment.
<P>

<b>D6</b>
<P>

23   	Annexed to Mr Price's affidavit of 25 October 1999 is an
exchange of correspondence with the solicitor for the person referred
to as D6.
The defendant's solicitors indicate that their client <i>"intends to call D6 to
give evidence"</i>.  D6's solicitors state "<i>whilst our client is unsure of
what assistance he can provide to these proceedings having regard to the
subject matter and nature
of questions likely to be asked we would request our
client remain being referred to by a pseudonym".</i>  It is then pointed out
that D6 has young school age children and an extended family who would be
"<i>subject of ridicule and embarrassment</i>" if the name was published even
if he was to play "<i>no part</i>" in the proceedings.
<P>

24   	Mr Deane (for the plaintiff) in his affidavit swears to D6
being among the D persons whose identity has been made known to
other clients,
people in custody, investigators and as I understand it, nearly three hundred
people connected with the plaintiff
in the course of his general preparation of
the case.
<P>

25   	It seems to me on the material available that D6 falls
into the category of a witness who would be "<i>embarrassed</i>".
<P>

<b>26   	</b>I gather that D6 has not hitherto been interviewed
by or on behalf of the defendant.
<P>

<b>D13</b>
<P>

27   	D13 is D14's brother.  Mr Price swears to two
conversations with D13.  The first occurred on 13 January 1999 and is in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>"DCP:  Hello, [D13]?</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	Yes, hello.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	My name is David Price.  I am a solicitor assisting Channel 7 in the
defamation proceedings brought by John Marsden.</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	So far in these proceedings, you have only been referred to as D13.
John Marsden's solicitors have asked us to tell them your
name.  We have told
them that we will only tell them your name when the Court makes an order that
they are not to published your
name in open Court.  The Court has made that
type of order in respect of other witnesses in this case.  Do you want us to
seek an
order like that to protect your name.</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Thanks.</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	is that all?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	OK.  Thanks.  Bye.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Goodbye".</i>
<P>

28   	The second conversation occurred on 3 February, this year,
the relevant part of which is as follows:
<P>

<i>"DCP: ... Do you still want us to try and get an order like that for your
name?</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	Yes.  I don't want anyone to know that I'm involved in this
case?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	Mate, my family is dead set against me doing this.  They don't know
much about what's going on.  It could also affect my access
to my kids.  I
don't mind helping you as long as my name is not going to end up all over the
papers.  It's just not worth the hassle.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Do you mean you might not give evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>D13:	I'd have to consider whether it was worth it.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I can't promise what the judge will do, but we'll try our best to get
an order preventing publication of your name".</i>
<P>

29   	D13, as I understand the defendant's case, will be giving
evidence as to what is alleged to have happened between the plaintiff
and D14.
D13 was named in the <i>"Witness"</i> program.  D14 I am informed will be a
witness for the plaintiff, if necessary. 
<P>

30   	D13 in fact is interviewed in the second program in
relation to his brothers who were involved in one of the most notorious
murders
in New South Wales in recent times (the Anita Coby murder).  The two brothers
in fact involved were shown in the second program.
 
<P>

<b>31   	</b>It seems to me (and strangely there is the
coincidence of concern about access to children) that D13 does not elevate his
position
beyond a wish not to be involved.  He is concerned about the
"<i>hassle".  </i>I would characterise the position of D13 insofar as it can be
ascertained from the evidence in his application as the expression of
a
preference.
<P>

<b>D15 and D16</b>
<P>

32   	These are brothers.  Mr Price for the defendant swears
that on 4 February 1999 he had a conversation with D15:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	Do you remember that I spoke to you on Tuesday afternoon about seeking
orders 	preventing your name being published in court
in these
proceedings?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I would like to talk to you a little bit more about that.  We have had
to give your name to Marsden's lawyers because we have
given them particulars
of your circumstances.</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Do you have to tell him?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Yes.  We had to tell his lawyers, so it is likely that he has been
told. The judge has made confidentiality orders in respect
of other witnesses
and has said that he would 	be minded to extend those orders to other witnesses
in similar positions. I expect
that the Court will deal with confidentiality of
your name and some other witnesses later today.  I need you to tell me the
reasons
why you don't want your name published.</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I don't want my name put all over the papers.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	'Cause I might not be allowed to see my kids. </i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Do you have custody proceedings pending?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	When will they be?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Are there any other reasons why you don't want your name
published?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I don't want my name dragged into the gutter.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Do you mean that you are concerned about your general
reputation?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Yeah. But also I don't want my all my family and friends knowing
everything I've done and I don't want to lose access to my kids.
I never had a
chance to lead a normal life. I want to have a normal life with my kids.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Is there anything else?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I'm worried about my safety.  Would it be possible for me to give
evidence by video or something?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I don't think so. I'll have to check. But let me know if you if have
any concerns about your safety.  Are there any other reasons
why you don't want
your name published?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	No, that's about it. </i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Can I just go over what you have told me to make sure I've got it
right? </i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I understand that there are 3 main reasons why you don't want your name
published. First, you are concerned about your reputation.
Second you are
concerned about access to children and your relationships with your family and
friends. Third, you are concerned about
your personal safety.  Is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Yeah."</i>
<P>

33   	On 22 October 1999 he had a further conversation with
D15:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	Do you remember that orders have been made in these proceedings
preventing you being named in Court?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Marsden has made an application to the Court for those orders to be
changed so that he can name in you Court. We will oppose
his application, but I
need to know whether you still want your name kept out of Court. Do you still
want to be referred to by a
code name? </i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I'd prefer not to be named in Court.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I don't want my kids hearing about me like that.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Do you see your children?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	I'm trying to get access to see them. I'm going to have to go to
Court.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Where do they live?</i>
<P>

<i>D15:	They live with their mother and her new bloke. He really hates me, so
I'd prefer that he didn't get any further ammunition to
use against me."</i>
<P>

34   	In relation to D16 Mr Price had a conversation on 20
October 1999:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	You know that an order has been made in this case that prevents you
being named in Court. Instead, you are referred to by a
code name.</i>
<P>

<i>D16:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Well, Marsden wants the judge to change that order so witnesses can be
named in Court. We will oppose that and seek to maintain
those orders. Do you
still want to be referred to by a code name?</i>
<P>

<i>D16:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Can you tell me why you don't want to be named in Court?</i>
<P>

<i>D16:	Well family reasons mainly.  I don't want all the world knowing about
my involvement in this and the effect that it would have
on my family.  I'm
also involved in other cases and I don't want them to be affected by
publicity."</i>
<P>

35   	Insofar as D15 has said he is concerned about his
children's mother and her "<i>new bloke</i>" and his preference that he did not
get any ammunition to use against him, that must be viewed in the light of the
fact that her
"<i>new bloke</i>" is D16, his own brother.
<P>

36   	The allegations in relation D15 and D16 concerning the
plaintiff is that the alleged conduct occurred in the course of a
"<i>threesome</i>".  
<P>

37   	In Exhibit A there is a statement from D15 and D16's
mother, Pamela Mary Kemp dated 13 August 1998 in paragraph 17 of which
she
states:  "<i>Even though the boys admitted that they had sexual relations with
Marsden they would not discuss the finer details with me and I was
not aware of
when the boys became involved with him or for how long they had been with him.
Thinking back now it adds up because
the boys would come home from time to time
with money and I knew that they did not have a job and were only on the
dole".</i> 
<P>

38   	Also in Exhibit A is a statement of Deane Lee Maynard, the
wife of D16 in paragraph 3 of which she states:
<P>

<i>"I grew up in Coonabarabran, my parents also live in the area.  I am
presently living at my home address with john Maynard, who is
26 years old and
I have been living with him since December 1994.  At first we lived together in
Taree then moved to Coonabarabran
in June 1996.  I have a child to John his
name is Torey and he is two years old.  John's mother, Pam Kemp, also resides
with us.
 Before I met John I was married to his brother, David.  David and I
were married in 1990 in Taree.  I have three children to David.
 They are
Ashleigh who is 7 years old, David who is 5 years old and Breannon who is 3
years old.  All the children are living with
me and John supports them".</i>
<P>

39   	In paragraph 6 of her statement she states:
<P>

<i>"I have some knowledge of David and John's background n regards to when they
were young because from time to time they had discussed
their lives with me.
Their mother also discussed the boys early lives with me and over the years I
had a general overview of the
way they were raised and an insight into their
childhood.  As a result I was aware that both boys had been `street kids' and
were
involved in drugs and child prostitution".</i>
<P>

<b>40   	</b>The "<i>concern"</i> on the part of both D15 and
D16 in relation to (as usual) access and not wanting to be named in Court and
keeping things from their
family seems to me somewhat artificial in the light
of the information available to me in this application.  D15 did not mention
again his safety concerns.  It is again a matter of preference.
<P>

<b>D17</b>
<P>

41   	D17 had a telephone conversation with Mr Price on 21
October 1999:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	Do you remember that orders have been made that prevent you from being
named in Court?</i>
<P>

<i>D17:	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Code names have been used to identify the various witness that Channel
7 will to call to prove that what it said was true. Marsden
has applied to the
Court to change that order so that witnesses names can be used in Court. Do you
still want to be referred to by
a code name?</i>
<P>

<i>D17:	Yes. I would prefer not to have my name published.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>D17:	Because I don't want my family dragged through the mud over this.  It's
got nothing to do with them.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	We have received an affidavit from one of Marsden's lawyers that says
you have told people about this case.  I'll just read the
paragraph to you:
</i>
<P>

<i>Mr John Marsden tells me that Les Murphy, D14 and Jason Muntz Summons as
well as others who are clients of Marsdens the Attorneys
and are in custody at
Kirkconnel have advised Mr John Marsden that Jason Lilburn, D17, Shane Olive,
D18, Jason Stevens D21, have
told a number of people that they are making
allegations of under-age sex against Mr John Marsden.</i>
<P>

<i>Do you have anything to say about that?</i>
<P>

<i>D17:	I spoke to Les Murphy about it at Goulburn last year because he brought
it up and I've spoken to the Police but its not something
that I talk about,
particularly in gaol because it's not good for your health.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	What do you mean?</i>
<P>

<i>D17:	You can get bashed if people find out you've talked to the
Police."</i>
<P>

42   	D17's approach seems to be, in my view, a matter of
preference.  Indirectly from the material set out above it can be seen
that the
reference to Les Murphy is indicative of a widespread knowledge certainly
throughout the jail system about these events.
 In relation to D17 there is no
other evidence as to the realisation of fears.  
<P>

43   	As to concern about family involvement there is a report
of the Department of Family and Community Services dated 7 August
1991 (part of
Exhibit A). in relation to D17, in which it is stated that his mother had been
interviewed and was then still unwilling
to take D17 mainly because of previous
difficulties and also a restraining order that was currently in force between
D17 and D17's
step father.  She was of the view according to the report that
D17 should then be made a Ward of the State.  The position in 1991
in relation
to D17's relationship with the family is supported to some extent by a
Probation and Parole Service Court Duty Officer
Report of 1 April 1998 (also
part of Exhibit A).
<P>

44   	In relation to D17 any concern about effect upon the
family (save for an 11 year old sister) cannot be elevated even to
embarrassment,
in my view.  It is again an expression of his particular desire
in relation to this affair and his preference in the light of what
he asserts
to be his reasons.
<P>

<b>D18</b>
<P>

45   	D18 had a conversation with Mr Price on 20 October 1999 in
the following terms:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	Orders were made earlier in the year that prevent you being named in
Court.  Marsden is applying to the Court for those orders
to be changed.  Do
you want us to seek to have the orders continued?</i>
<P>

<i>D18:	Definitely. </i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I have a life outside of this case.  All this stuff is in the past. I
don't want people at work knowing all about it. </i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I want to read to you part of an affidavit that we received from a
lawyer working for Marsden.  It says:</i>
<P>

<i>Mr John Marsden tells me that Les Murphy, D14 and Jason Muntz Summons as
well as others who are clients of Marsdens the Attorneys
and are in custody at
Kirkconnel have advised Mr John Marsden that Jason Lilburn, D17, Shane Olive,
D18, Jason Stevens D21, have
told a number of people that they are making
allegations of under-age sex against Mr John Marsden.</i>
<P>

<i>	Do you have anything to say about that? </i>
<P>

<i>D18:	Did you say `Les Murphy'?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>D18:	One of the guys who done that murder?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>D18:	I met him once about 5 or 6 years when I was inside but I didn't say
anything to him. Who is the other guy you mentioned?</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Jason Muntz Summons.</i>
<P>

<i>D18:	I've never heard of him. Where's he from.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	I think he was in Berrima for a while.</i>
<P>

<i>D18:	I don't know anything about him.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Have you told people about this matter.</i>
<P>

<i>D18:	Apart from you and the other lawyers for Channel 7 the only other
people I've spoken to about this is are the police and they
tracked me down.  I
don't talk about this stuff to anyone."</i>
<P>

46   	It is interesting to note the notoriety in relation to Les
Murphy.  This material again, in my view, cannot easily be elevated
to the
level of embarrassment.  It is a question of preference and not wishing people
at work to know about it.
<P>

<b>D20 and D24</b>
<P>

47   	The only information in relation to these
<i>"complainants</i>" is that contained in an exchange of correspondence
referred to by Mr Price in his affidavit.  The defendant's solicitors wrote to
a Mr McKimmie, solicitor, informing him that the defendant intends to call D20
and requesting whether D20 seeks to be referred to
in Court by a pseudonym.
The response was "<i>I do not have any instructions that my client is prepared
to resile from the use of a pseudonym</i>".  
<P>

48   	The same expression is used by the same solicitor in
relation to D24.  The very best that can be said of this response as
indicative
of any "<i>position</i>" of D20 and D24 is that it is equivocal.  No
information of any assistance is provided.
<P>

49   	Mr Deane annexes to his affidavit of 26 October 1999 a
communication from Mr McKimmie in relation to D20 addressed to Mallesons
for
the defendant which indicates that at that time (prior to the later equivocal
response) that D20 was not willing to cooperate.
 In relation to D24 Mr Deane
annexes a letter of 2 July 1999 to Mallesons from Mr McKimmie indicating an
intention not to cooperate
with the defendant. 
<P>

<b>D21</b>
<P>

50   	There is simply no information as to any requirement of a
pseudonym for this person or any reason for one.
<P>

<b>D23</b>
<P>

51   	On 26 October 1999 Mr Price had a conversation with D23 to
the following effect:
<P>

<i>"DCP:	So far in these proceedings witnesses have been referred to by
codenames.  You have been referred to as `D23'.  Marsden has
made an
application to the Court that these orders be changed so that he can name you
in Court.  This would mean that your name could
be published.  We are opposing
Marsden's application to change the orders.  Do you still want to be referred
to by a code name?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Can you tell me why you want to be referred to by a code name?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	The embarrassment.  I have lost a lot of friends over the whole
situation and I have lost my marriage over this and I had to
leave my job
because the people at work found out it about it.  I don't want everyone to
know about my past.  When I first spoke
to the Royal Commission in 1996, no one
told me that my name would be published.  I'm going through a divorce at the
moment and I
don't want any of this to affect my wife and kids or make things
any worse for me.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Is there anything else?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	This all happened when I was a ward of the State.  I've wanted to put
all this behind me.  I only became involved when investigators
from the Royal
Commission asked me to assist them.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	So you had no idea that it was going to develop into being involved in
this defamation case?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	No.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Did you talk about any of these matters with your wife before you spoke
to the Royal Commission?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	No.  She knew that I was having nightmares but I never told her what
was causing them.  Eventually she wanted to see the statements
that I had made
to the Police.  After she had seen them, she couldn't handle it and our
marriage started falling apart.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Are you employed now?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	No, I haven't been employed since 26 May this year.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Why did you leave your job?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	People at work found out that I had been talking to the Royal
Commission and the Police and what I had been talking to them about.
 It got to
the point where I couldn't stay any longer.</i>
<P>

<i>DCP:	Are you looking for work now?</i>
<P>

<i>D23:	Yes.  I'm trying to get a job where people don't know about my
past".</i>
<P>

52   	D23, of course, uses the word "<i>embarrassment</i>".  It
would certainly appear from this relating of the conversation that the people
he does not wish to know in fact know.  This
is a question of exacerbation
perhaps of embarrassment.  He like many of the other D persons, so it would
appear, made no specific
application on his behalf for a pseudonym order.
<P>

53   	I have come to the view that on the material available
(and bearing in mind its limitations) that none of the complainants
really
elevate their position above "<i>embarrassment</i>".  As can be seen in respect
to one there is no explanation at all, in respect to two there is the equivocal
response from the solicitor.
 I mention this in the context of a submission in
due course made by Mr Sackar Q.C. for the defendant that what one can really do
in relation to those that do give some sort of explanation is come to the view
that they are really talking about "<i>shame</i>".  In my opinion, that view is
not open.  Insofar as Mr Price interviewed these people they were "<i>lead</i>"
into their responses.  Their spontaneous replies seemed to focus on
embarrassment or something less and in the context generally
of circumstances
wherein the people they feared would know in fact do know.  There is a common
feature about concern in relation
to child access.
<P>

54   	It might well be as Mr Sackar suggested that it turns out
that each of these complainants does have an appalling personal
history that
lead him to the life which, one is to understand, was an imperative at the time
of the alleged events.  They were not
the "<i>winners</i>" in society, it is
said.  It is argued that they perhaps could not articulate their feeling of
shame.  I am simply in no position
to make any judgments in relation to any of
them on the material in this regard.  This application will be determined on
the material
I have to the extent that it does establish something sought to be
relied upon by the defendant in support of the maintenance of
the status quo
(that is, that present order).
<P>

55   	I further should add that any views that I have expressed
above as to individual complainants are expressed solely in the
context of this
application.  I will be the judge of the facts:  the facts on the trial issues
will be determined on the evidence
called in relation to them.
<P>

56   	As stated at the outset of these reasons, this is the
first occasion on which the question of whether or not there should
be, at all,
any pseudonym orders has been argued.  My judgment of 20 November 1998 was
against a backdrop of consent.  What is clear
from Order 3 is that the order
then made as to non-publication of the then D persons names in open court would
operate "<i>until further order</i>" (page 26).  Nothing that has been put to
me has been persuasive that the situation is otherwise than it has always been
available
to either party to seek a "<i>further order</i>" in relation to any
of the D people who by reason of amendment of the Defence, either by consent or
as a result of a ruling (23 June
1999), became embraced by the order made on 20
November 1998.
<P>

57   	A context which must be borne in mind is that this is a
civil action in which the plaintiff is claiming damages for defamation.
 It is
not a criminal case at all.  The imputations found by the jury are of the
utmost gravity;  the defendant has chosen to justify
them and the relevant
standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities.  From time to time
reference has been made to the criminal
nature of the charges constituted by
the imputations but this litigation cannot be viewed otherwise than civil
litigation in the
strict sense.
<P>

58   	There was no issue that the use of "<i>pseudonyms</i>"
could be characterised as a "<i>suppression</i>" order, or as an order of a
kind, (for example, hearing in camera), that would derogate from "<i>open
justice</i>".
<P>

59   	For the plaintiff it was submitted that what is described
as the principle of <i>"open justice</i>" is paramount and that whoever seeks
to depart from it must make out a case therefor (<b><i>Scott v Scott</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1913%5d%20AC%20417" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1913] AC 417</a> at 437-8;  <b><i>Mirror Newspapers Limited v Waller

<P>

60   	The test which must be satisfied before the Court can or
should depart from the principle of open justice is whether or not
it is
"<i>necessary</i>" for the administration of justice that such an order be
made:  <b><i>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited v Police Tribunal of NSW &amp;

<P>

61   	The material available in this application, at its
highest, suggests that the witnesses or third parties identified by the
witness
such as their families would suffer "<i>embarrassment"</i>.
"<i>Embarrassment</i>" can never justify such an order:  <b><i>Scott v
Scott</i></b> at 438 and 439;  <b><i>Raybos</i></b> at 54C;  <b><i>Fairfax v

instant case in relation to none of the complainants is there material that
would permit any application on his
behalf to maintain the status quo or to
preclude the vacation of the order by reason of any such complainant falling
into categories
recognised, more often in the criminal law:  informers, victims
of blackmail or where interests of the security of State are involved;
or, in
civil cases, the protection of confidentiality.
<P>

62   	Examples of witnesses in criminal trials being given a
pseudonym because it is "<i>necessary to secure the proper administration of
justice</i>" can be found in <b><i>Savvas </i></b>at 335-336;  <b><i>Mr

<P>

63   	The inherent power of the Court to deal with this matter
has been at least recognised (<b><i>Reid v Howard</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 1</a> at
16); it is not "<i>at large</i>" (<b><i>Reid</i></b> <i>(supra)</i>) nor is the
jurisdiction conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a></i>

derogate from the nature of the power the Court can exercise as identified
especially in <b><i>Scott v Scott</i></b> at 438:  not a matter resting in the

<P>

64   	Pausing there, it is submitted, as a matter of general
principle, on the material available in this application, no case at
all has
been made out to establish that it is necessary for the proper administration
of "<i>open justice</i>" for the orders presently in place to be maintained.

<P>

65   	It is further submitted that the principles of open
justice and "<i>necessity</i>" as applying in the circumstances of this
litigation direct attention to factors that would make pseudonym orders
inimical to the
administration of open justice. 
<P>

66   	Orders in relation to pseudonyms would prevent what is
described as the beneficial aspects of an "<i>open trial"</i> as identified by
<i>Wigmore, </i><u>Evidence</u> 3rd ed. Volume 6 para 1834 where it is stated
that the publicity of the judicial proceeding is a requirement of much broader
bearing
that its mere effect upon the quality of testimony.  Its operation
tends to <i>"improve</i>" the quality of testimony especially in the modern era
where publicity given by media reports of trials is often the means of securing
useful evidence.  The openness of the trial would discourage false testimony,
might induce people to come forward once the identity
of witnesses is disclosed
(and this can operate in the defendant's favour as well as the plaintiff's) and
it would increase public
respect for the trial process (see also
<b><i>Raybos</i></b> at 52B per Kirby P).
<P>

67   	It is argued that it would be inimical to the
administration of justice to permit pseudonym orders in this litigation because
the quality of any vindication ultimately received by the plaintiff by a
verdict in his favour would be undermined.  A verdict in
favour of the
plaintiff would constitute vindication in the face of the imputations found by
the jury as having been carried by the
defendant's publications.  He would be
vindicated in the face of the defendant having sought to justify those
imputations by calling
evidence from people to establish the truth of those
imputations.  The quality of the vindication would be adversely affected if
anonymity attended those who accused him.  The charges could be repeated, the
verdict could not be pointed at in clear terms as identifying
the finding of
this Court that the defendant had failed in its case on justification in
respect of the precise allegations made against
the plaintiff by particular
persons.

43 FLR 129</a> at 157 Deane J said:
<P>

<i>"In some case, the prima facie right of the individual litigant to open
justice within the Court room may be of a heightened importance
because of the
nature of the proceedings.  In, for example, proceedings for defamation where
the vindication of reputation may be
more important to the plaintiff than the
solace of pecuniary damages, the plaintiff may have a special interest in
ensuring that
it is apparent to the public that all the evidence is open to
public scrutiny so as to ensure that the proceedings which were legitimately
regarded as a vehicle to clear his name cannot be wrongly seen as indicating
that there is secret material which might tend to confirm
the blackening of
it".</i>
<P>

68   	This submission is not without substance, in my view.  It
was not addressed by the defendant.
<P>

69   	It is also submitted that the use of pseudonyms would
encourage blackmail.  A person could threaten to give true testimony
or worse,
false testimony in the comfort of his knowledge that his identity would not be
disclosed.  A precedent could be set.  This
was not merely a rhetorical
submission.  There was a suggestion in the evidence (annexure C to Mr Deane's
affidavit) that one of
the complainants (D3 Pearce) had been, in effect,
assured by a representative of the defendant (Mr Quail) of the availability of
a pseudonym. It is however that type of conduct whether by a private or
corporate litigant or by a prosecuting authority which attracts
the
disapprobation of the Courts.  <b><i>Rockett v Smith </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20Qd%20R%20660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) Qd R 660</a> at
667-8;  <b><i>John Fairfax Group v Local Court </i></b>at 143B.
<P>

70   	It is further submitted that the maintenance of the
present regime would introduce the "<i>newspaper rule</i>" into the
proceedings.  A distinction of course has to be drawn between the
identification of the defendant's sources used for the
preparation of the
publication of the matter complained of (the television programs) and such
"<i>sources</i>" who may give evidence in support of the plea of justification,
and those witnesses who are not connected with the compilation of
the programs
but rather have been located as persons who can support the defence of
justification.  Only in relation to the former
can the fear expressed in the
submission attach.  Further in relation to the former it would be the defendant
who would be compelled
at some stage to disclose identity.  In relation to the
latter it is acutely the subject of the present application.  This was an
interesting submission but is by no means determinative.
<P>

71   	It was additionally submitted that there would be immense
practical difficulties in the maintenance of the present regime.
 Senior
counsel for the plaintiff curiously had difficulty in preventing himself from
time to time mentioning by name certain of
the D persons.  He has not been
alone however in this unfortunate mishap.  One of course can anticipate
practical difficulties: the
requirement for some sort of secret list as to the
identity of D persons being used both by counsel and query by witnesses
themselves
to avoid confusion.  This again is not a major determinative matter
but the realities of it must be recognised.
<P>

72   	It was also argued that the orders would in effect be
futile.  The orders merely preclude the naming of the persons in open
Court.
Investigations by both parties have no doubt spread their identities abroad.
When one looks at individual cases especially,
for example, D1 the submission
has merit. As to D13, (even if it be the case that he has changed his name),
the notoriety of his
name and its connection with a notorious murder is clear.
Setting to one side all other matters (as to applicable principle and the
merits hitherto considered), I do not agree that pseudonym orders would be of
no utility.  Media exposure (which most complainants
do not wish) would be, at
least, constrained:  see <b><i>Fairfax v Police Tribunal </i></b>at 477C-D per
McHugh JA.
<P>

73   	I accept the submissions for the plaintiff subject to the
reservations as I have expressed above.
<P>

74   	I reject the submission for the defendant, which was truly
rhetorical in nature, as to the complainants really talking about
"<i>being
ashamed</i>".  By saying that I must not be taken as suggesting that they may
in fact not be <i>"ashamed</i>".  It is merely that the evidence, such as it
is, and given the leading nature of the questions asked by Mr Price of those D
persons
in respect of whom he swore on affidavit, the material simply cannot be
elevated to that level.  In those cases where I have so indicated
it amounts to
no more than embarrassment and conformably with authority that is insufficient
a basis for the making of a pseudonym
order.
<P>

75   	As was submitted by Mr Hall of junior counsel for the
plaintiff in Reply the question of onus in the end does not really matter
given
the state of the evidence overall viewed in the context of the principles to
which I have referred.  It was certainly the plaintiff's
application to have
the orders vacated;  the plaintiff has succeed in persuading me that on that
evidence there is no basis for taking
that step which would constitute a
radical departure from the principle of open justice and in respect of which I
am persuaded that
there is no necessity in terms of the ends of justice being
met and in respect of which, as I have indicated, that are positive reasons
that to make such orders would be inimical to that principle of necessity in
the context of open justice.  
<P>

76   	Mr Sackar Q.C. sought to draw a distinction between the
period of time up to the commencement of the trial and the trial itself.
 The
trial commences on 15 November and to a great extent the division into time
zones to that effect has become academic.  In any
event, I am not persuaded
that there is any basis in principle or upon the material placed before me that
would warrant the drawing
of that distinction.  
<P>

77   	Reliance was placed upon the observations of Lord Woolf MR
in <b><i>Reg v Legal Aid Board</i></b> <b><i>ex parte Kaim Todner</i></b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/958.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] EWCA Civ 958</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20QB%20966" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] QB 966</a> at 978.  His Lordship was concerned with contempt proceedings
(<i>Contempt of Land Act 1981 (UK) </i>s11) and rules of the High Court (Ord.
106 r 12).  In that context is his Lordship's review of the "<i>general
approach</i>" (at 975H) is useful and clear.  In the end however, the
references to "<i>unacceptable inroads on the general rule"</i> (978G) and
"<i>Although the foundation of the exceptions is the need to avoid frustrating
the ability of the courts to do justice, a party cannot
be allowed to achieve
anonymity by insisting upon it as a condition for being involved in the
proceedings irrespective of whether
the demand is reasonable" </i>(978H),
accord with the general approach of the Court of Appeal in this State.  Nothing
in <b><i>Todner</i></b>, in my view, justifies the isolation of witnesses from
the operation of the principles to which I have referred, at any stage of
the
proceedings.
<P>

78   	In <b><i>John Fairfax Group v Local Court of NSW</i></b>
Kirby P said at 141C:
<P>

<i>"At common law the rule is absolute, as the Law Lords were at pains to
stress in <b>Scott v Scott</b> and have done since both in the Privy Council
... and in the House of Lords... Exceptions have been allowed by the common law
to
protect police informers ... blackmail cases ... and cases involving
national security... The common justification for these special
exceptions is a
reminder that the open administration of justice serves the interests of
society and is not an absolute end in itself.
 If the very openness of Court
proceedings would destroy the attainment of justice in the particular case (as
by vindicating the
activities of the blackmailer) or discourage its attainment
in cases generally (as by frightening off blackmail victims or informers)
or
would derogate from even more urgent considerations of public interest (as by
endangering national security) the rule of openness
must be modified to meet
the exigencies of the particular case".</i>
<P>

79   	No exigencies have been established that would warrant the
modification of the openness of justice or as necessary for the
administration
of justice in this defamation action.  The usual incidents of a witness giving
evidence will apply.
<P>

80   	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	I vacate the order made by me on 20 November 1998 as it applied to the D
persons therein referred to and as has been applied
to all remaining D persons.
Persons hitherto who have been referred to by the pseudonym followed by a
number may now be referred
to in open Court by name.
<P>

2.	The costs are reserved.
<P>

3.	The exhibits are to be returned.
