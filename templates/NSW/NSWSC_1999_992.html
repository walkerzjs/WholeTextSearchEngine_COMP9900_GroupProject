<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR: <u>The Proceedings</u>
<P>

<u>Statement of Claim</u>
<P>

1  	By her second further amended statement of claim the plaintiff,
Winnifred Wai Yue Yu, claimed against the defendants, Allan
Ni Kwan Kwok and
others, being the partners of the accountancy firm, Powell Kwok Baker, a
declaration that upon receipt by the defendants
of the sums of $486,043.61 and
$82,077.15 on or about 16 and 23 November 1990 respectively from the plaintiff,
each of the defendants
held the said sums upon trust for the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff also claimed an order that the defendants account to the plaintiff
as
constructive trustees in respect of the said sums received by them from the
plaintiff, as well as damages, including equitable
damages and interest
thereon.  
<P>

2  	The moneys claimed by the plaintiff were paid into the trust
account of the defendants on the dates mentioned, and were placed
by the
defendants on interest bearing deposit with BCC Australia Limited ("BCC").  The
plaintiff claimed that her solicitor had instructed
the defendants to deposit
the moneys into the cheque account of the plaintiff, and that in depositing
those moneys into the trust
account of the defendant and thereafter placing
them on interest bearing deposit with BCC, the defendants had acted contrary to
her
instructions.  Subsequently, on 8 July 1991, a provisional liquidator was
appointed to BCC as a result of which the plaintiff, after
receiving certain
dividends from the provisional liquidator, lost $300,929.21.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff claimed that in these circumstances the defendants
had "converted each of the said cheques to their own use and
(had) wrongfully
deprived the plaintiff of the same and (that) as a result thereof the plaintiff
had suffered loss and damage." 
The plaintiff claimed, alternatively, that, in
the circumstances, the defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff to
apply
the said cheques in accordance with the plaintiff's instructions and that
in failing to do so the defendants were in breach of their
fiduciary duty.  
<P>

4  	In the further alternative, the plaintiff claimed that the
defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff "to advise the plaintiff
of the
nature of the investment into which the defendants intended to deposit the said
cheques" and that, in breach of that duty
of care, the defendant failed to
disclose to the plaintiff certain matters relating to BCC .
<P>

5  	Further and alternatively, the plaintiff claimed that the
defendants held the said sums on trust for the plaintiff and were
trustees
thereof and that in breach of trust the defendants deposited the said funds
with BCC which was not an investment authorised
by the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act
1925</a></i></b>. 
<P>

<u>Defence</u>
<P>

6  	By their amended defence to the second further amended statement
of claim the defendants, inter alia, denied that they were
instructed by the
plaintiff's solicitor to place the funds with the plaintiff's cheque account
with the Westpac Banking Corporation
and claimed that they were instructed,
inter alia, to place the funds in a short-term investment account in the name
of the plaintiff.
 The defendants admitted that they deposited the moneys
referred to in their trust account, and that those moneys were then placed
on
deposit with BCC on trust for the plaintiff.  The defendants claim that at all
times they acted in accordance with the instructions
received for and on behalf
of the plaintiff.  The defendants admitted that the funds which were received
by the defendants were held
by them subject to a fiduciary duty owed to the
plaintiff.  The defendants admitted that they did not advise the plaintiff of
the
various matters relating to BCC but denied that they owed a duty of care to
the plaintiff to do so.  They also admitted that they
did not advise the
plaintiff of their intention to deposit the moneys of the plaintiff into their
trust account and invest the proceeds
with BCC.  The defendants also admitted
that they did not advise the plaintiff of any of the matters relating to BCC
prior to any
subsequent roll over of the deposits with BCC.
<P>

7  	The defendants claimed that, at least on 23 November 1990 or 12
December 1990, or on both dates, and on or about 27 February
1991, they advised
the plaintiff that the said proceeds had been invested on her behalf with BCC
and advised her of the term of the
deposit and the current interest rate.  They
also claimed that, on or about 12 December 1990, the plaintiff instructed the
defendants
to roll over the deposit at 30 days call and further, that the
plaintiff did not request any advice in relation to the risks of the
investment, and that the plaintiff did not rely on the defendants to provide
her with any such advice, nor did the defendants assume
any responsibility to
give any advice, but only to give the information in fact given to the
plaintiff.  The defendants denied that
they owed the plaintiff a duty of care
as alleged.  
<P>

8  	The defendants admitted that the funds were placed on deposit
with BCC on trust on behalf of the plaintiff but claimed that
the plaintiff
expressly conferred on the defendants the power to invest the said funds in
such securities as in the defendants' full
discretion were considered to
provide the best short-term interest rate.  The defendants admitted that
interest bearing deposits
with BCC were not authorised investments under the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a></i></b> but denied that they had committed any breach of
trust, and claimed that if they had acted in breach of trust (which was denied)
they were entitled to relief from liability under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a>.</i></b>
<P>

9  	Further and in the alternative the defendants claimed that the
plaintiff by reason of certain facts "impliedly affirmed the
defendants'
instructions, that they were to place the funds in such securities, as in their
full discretion, provided the best short-term
interest rate."  The defendants
further claimed that the plaintiff had consented to and concurred in the funds
being placed on short-term
deposit with BCC and was estopped from bringing
these proceedings against the defendants.  Finally, the defendants claimed that
if
the plaintiff was entitled to damages, equitable damages or equitable
compensation, such damages or compensation should be reduced
to such extent as
the Court thought fit by reason of the plaintiff's contributory negligence or
share of responsibility for the loss.
<P>

<u>The Facts</u>
<P>

<u>Delivery of the Cheques of the Plaintiff to the Defendants and Instructions
Given by the Plaintiff to the Defendants.</u>
<P>

10  	The plaintiff was the owner of a certain property in Bankstown,
which she sold in October 1990. Contracts were exchanged on
3 October 1990 and
the contract was completed on 16 November 1990. Susan McAlpine, the plaintiff's
solicitor, whose evidence I accept,
stated that at around lunchtime on that
day, and prior to the completion of the contract, she sought instructions from
the plaintiff
as to what the plaintiff required to be done with the balance of
the purchase price to be received on completion.   Instructions
were sought in
the course of a telephone call made by Ms McAlpine to the plaintiff who was in
Hong Kong.  
<P>

11  	After some initial conversation concerning the issue of interest
payable by the purchaser for late completion of the contract,
Ms McAlpine
informed the plaintiff that she would be receiving approximately $480,000 on
behalf of the plaintiff on completion of
the contract, and about another
$80,000 from the agent some time after completion of the contract, and asked
the plaintiff what she
wanted Ms McAlpine to do with these moneys.  Ms McAlpine
inquired whether the plaintiff had a bank account in Australia as she only
had
details of a bank account for Jedili Pty Limited, a company in which the
plaintiff was interested.  Ms McAlpine told the plaintiff
that she could put
the money into the trust account of the firm of solicitors by which she was
employed, but pointed out that it
would not earn any interest in that trust
account unless it was put into an interest bearing deposit.  The plaintiff
informed Ms
McAlpine that she did have a bank account in Australia and that the
money could go into that account and earn interest there.  When
Ms McAlpine
asked the plaintiff for details of the plaintiff's bank account the plaintiff
replied that she did not have them with
her but that the office of her
accountant, Alan Kwok, of Powell Kwok Baker, had all the details.  When Ms
McAlpine asked whether
the plaintiff wanted her to ring Mr. Kwok, the plaintiff
replied that Mr. Kwok was too busy, but that Grace (Law) looked after all
her
affairs and had the account details.  The plaintiff instructed Ms McAlpine to
take the cheques up to Grace (Law)" and ask her
to bank it for me."  Ms
McAlpine stated, in effect, that she could herself arrange for the moneys to be
banked in the bank account
if she had the bank account details.  The plaintiff
replied that she should give the cheque to Grace (Law) who looked after her
accounts
for her and whom she rang whenever she wanted something.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff, whose evidence, in general, I accept because she
impressed me as a truthful witness, although somewhat nervous
in the witness
box, gave evidence to the same effect, namely, that she said to Ms McAlpine
words to the effect:-
<P>

<i>"I have a bank account in Australia, the money can go into my bank account
and earn interest there.  I haven't got my details with
me.  Give the cheque to
Alan's office, Grace knows my bank account details.  Take the cheque to her and
ask her to bank it for me."</i>
<P>

13  	It is common ground that at this time the plaintiff had a
non-interest bearing cheque account with Westpac Banking Corporation,
as well
as an interest bearing deposit with that bank.
<P>

14  	Despite some answers to the contrary, as to which I am not
entirely satisfied that the witness understood the purport of the
questions
and/or answers, the plaintiff in cross-examination stated in effect that she
wanted the proceeds of the sale of her Bankstown
property to be put into her
Westpac cheque account and that she intended Ms. Law to be instructed to do
that.  The plaintiff also
said that she assumed that the moneys would be
deposited with the "Westpac Bank in a term deposit, earning interest."  She
also said
that she "intended Grace Law to be instructed to put the money in
(her) bank account with Westpac", and that she expected that Mr.
Kwok would be
putting the money for me to earn some interest."  She said that she thought
Powell Kwok Baker could operate on her
cheque account although she agreed that
she had not given Mr. Kwok authority to do so.
<P>

15  	I am satisfied that, during this initial conversation between
the plaintiff and Ms. McAlpine, the plaintiff instructed Ms.
McAlpine to give
the cheques comprising the balance of the proceeds of sale of the Bankstown
property to Ms. Law so that Ms. Law
could bank those cheques in the plaintiff's
cheque account with Westpac, and so that those moneys could earn interest.  It
is common
ground, as stated above, that the plaintiff's cheque account with
Westpac was not an account which earned interest .  It should be
noted,
however, that what Ms. McAlpine later said to Ms. Law differed in certain
respects from what was said previously between Ms.
McAlpine and the
plaintiff.
<P>

16  	Thus, later, on 16 November 1990 Ms. McAlpine telephoned Ms. Law
and informed her that the plaintiff's sale of her Bankstown
property was being
completed that afternoon, and that she needed certain details as to the land
tax payable in respect of the property.
 In the course of this conversation Ms.
McAlpine told Ms. Law that she (Ms. McAlpine) had been told by the plaintiff
that Ms. Law
had details of the plaintiff's bank account and was told by Ms.
Law that they would be on file.  Ms. McAlpine then informed Ms. Law
that the
plaintiff had asked her to give the balance of the settlement moneys to Ms. Law
"to bank for her" (the plaintiff).  In my
opinion the effect of this
conversation is that Ms. McAlpine conveyed to Ms. Law that the plaintiff wanted
Ms. Law to "bank" the
balance of the settlement moneys of the plaintiff in the
plaintiff's "bank account".
<P>

17  	Ms. McAlpine also told Ms. Law that she would not have the
cheque until late that afternoon and requested Ms. Law to make sure
that she
had the bank account details by then.  In my opinion, the words "bank account"
as used in the relevant circumstances of
the present case, meant, and would
have been understood to mean, the (Westpac) cheque account of the plaintiff,
there being no evidence
that either Ms. McAlpine or Ms. Law actually knew that
the plaintiff also had a Westpac interest bearing deposit account into which,
in any event, it would not have been possible for Ms. Law to deposit the
plaintiff's cheques.
<P>

18  	On completion of the sale later that day Ms. McAlpine received
two ANZ bank cheques in favour of the plaintiff, one for $441,569-02
and
another for $44,474-59.  Ms. McAlpine asked Ms. Law if she had managed to find
the plaintiff's bank account details to which
Ms. Law replied in the
affirmative.  Ms. McAlpine then handed the two cheques to Ms. Law and asked her
whether she had time to get
the cheques into the bank before it closed, to
which Ms. Law again replied in the affirmative.  Ms. McAlpine then said words
to the
effect that that was good, because clients did not like missing out on
interest when there was such a large amount involved, even
if it was only a
couple of days' interest.  Ms. McAlpine also informed Ms. Law that there would
be another cheque some time during
the following week, being the balance of the
deposit which was still with the agent.  In the course of the remainder of the
conversation
Ms. McAlpine informed Ms. Law that the plaintiff and her husband,
Dr. Yu, did not want their son, Patrick, "getting his hands on
the money".
<P>

19  	Ms. McAlpine received the balance of the deposit from the agent
on 22 November 1990 in the form of a Westpac bank cheque for
$82,077-15, which
she took to Ms. Law on 23 November 1990 when she asked Ms. Law whether she
could "deposit it to the same account
for Winnie".  Ms. Law replied that she
could and inquired what the plaintiff was going to do with the money now and,
in particular,
was she going to buy another property.  Ms. McAlpine replied
that she really did not know but that the plaintiff had been looking
and buying
a house but that nothing was definite at the moment.  She said that she thought
that the plaintiff just wanted to leave
the moneys in the bank for a while but
"if you need to know any more details you had better check with her".
<P>

20  	During this period Ms. McAlpine was involved in litigation for
clients including Jedili Pty Limited, the directors of which
were Dr. and Mrs.
Yu, and, accordingly, did not write reporting details of the settlement to the
plaintiff until 13 February 1991.
 That letter was addressed to the plaintiff
at her Chatswood address and included the following paragraphs:-
<P>

<i>"The final cheque being the balance of the settlement proceeds was made
payable to you, and handed to Powell Kwok Baker &amp; Co.
to be invested on
your behalf.</i>
<P>

<i>Following settlement we also received the balance of the deposit being
$82,077.15.  We note that commission of $34,800.00 had been
deducted from the
deposit and that your half share of the interest was $877.15.  These funds were
also forwarded to Powell Kwok Baker
&amp; Co. to be invested on your
behalf....".</i>
<P>

21  	Ms. McAlpine said that during late 1990 and early 1991 she spoke
to Dr. Yu frequently and, on some occasions, to the plaintiff.
 Most of the
conversations concerned the litigation but Ms. McAlpine recalled at least one
telephone call where she discussed the
Bankstown sale with both Dr. Yu and the
plaintiff.  She recalled that during one telephone call, after she had received
the balance
of the deposit, Dr. Yu or the plaintiff asked her if she knew what
interest the money was earning.  Ms. McAlpine replied that she
didn't know and
that the plaintiff or Dr. Yu would have to confirm those details with Grace
(Law) or someone from Powell Kwok Baker.
 She said she could try to find out
for them but the plaintiff replied with words to the effect that it was not
necessary as she
needed to speak to Powell Kwok Baker about some other matters
and could find out then.
<P>

22  	In cross-examination Ms. McAlpine said that she first learned
that the moneys had been deposited with BCC some time in mid-1991
after July.
Ms. McAlpine said that prior to that time she presumed it was with Westpac
although she had no specific knowledge.  Ms.
McAlpine agreed that she conveyed
to Ms. Law that it was the plaintiff's expectation that the moneys would earn
interest.  
<P>

23  	Ms. Law's evidence in relation to the conversation differed from
Ms. McAlpine in one significant respect, namely, Ms. Law's
evidence was to the
effect that Ms. McAlpine made no reference in any conversations with Ms. Law to
the plaintiff's "bank account"
(being the plaintiff's (Westpac) cheque account)
(see above).  The relevant words of the conversation between Ms. McAlpine and
Ms.
Law, so far as Ms. Law was concerned, were that Ms. McAlpine said, inter
alia, words to the following effect:-
<P>

<i>"The cheques will be brought up to you to arrange to bank the funds on
interest bearing deposit.  The money should be easily accessible.
 I don't know
when Mrs. Yu will need it as she may return to Australia.  We don't want to
lose a day's interest."</i>
<P>

24  	She did agree, however, that on 23 November 1990 she had a
telephone conversation with Ms. McAlpine during which Ms. McAlpine
said words
to the following effect:-
<P>

<i>"I have the other cheque.  Can I bring it up to you to bank with the rest."
</i>
<P>

25  	Ms. Law said in cross-examination that she could not remember
the exact words used by Ms. McAlpine and that her evidence in
this connection
was as to the substance or effect of what Ms. McAlpine said.  Ms. Law's
evidence was to the effect that the substance
of what Ms. McAlpine said to her
was that the plaintiff's funds were to be "banked" on interest bearing deposit,
with the word "bank"
being used as equivalent to the word "invest", without any
instruction that those funds were to be banked in the bank account of
the
plaintiff.
<P>

26  	In relation to the significant matter of difference between Ms.
McAlpine and Ms. Law, namely, as to whether Ms. McAlpine instructed
Ms. Law
that the plaintiff's funds were to be banked in the "bank account" of the
plaintiff, I am of the opinion that the evidence
of Ms. McAlpine is to be
preferred . I am of this opinion principally because, in my opinion,  it is
plain from the evidence of Ms.
Law quoted above, as well as from her other
evidence, that in the course of giving all her evidence and even where
expressed in the
first person, Ms. Law was more concerned to state the "effect"
of what was said as she remembers that  "effect", rather than doing
her best to
remember in more detail and with precision what was actually said. One example
only of Ms. Laws approach can be seen
in the following answer given by her in
cross-examination:-  
<P>

<i>"A.  ...Like I said, I cannot recall what was said between Ms. McAlpine and
me but I do know that the substance</i><cite> </cite><i>of it, like you said,
is come down to the point that I have deposited the previous two cheques with a
bank, if you like to call it,
and when the second time, when you gave me the
cheque it obviously would be for the same institution.  She would have no
reason to
ask me or to tell me to invest the cheque somewhere else."</i>
<P>

27  	On the other hand, in my opinion, the nature of Ms. McAlpine's
evidence and her demeanour in the witness box made it plain
to me that she was
trying much harder to be accurate and detailed in relation to what was said,
even allowing for the fact that the
conversations occurred many years ago, even
as at the date of her first affidavit in 1994.  
<P>

28  	Ms. McAlpine's evidence was calm and consistent and well
considered and was relevantly consistent with the evidence of the
plaintiff in
respect of these matters (the plaintiff was not shaken in cross-examination in
relation to these matters).  Ms. McAlpine's
evidence in this respect was also
consistent with her evidence, and the evidence of others, including Mr.
Hancock, as to what she
said in later meetings had been said in these initial
conversations.
<P>

29  	So far as concerns the evidence of Ms. McAlpine on this issue, I
have also had regard, inter alia, to the consistency of her
account as to what
was said between her and Ms. Law in November 1990 as recounted by her,
according to her evidence, at a meeting
in February 1992 at Mr. Kwok's office,
attended, inter alia, by the plaintiff and Dr. Yu, Mr. Kwok and Ms. Law, as
well as Ms. McAlpine
and Mr. Leong, her solicitor employer, and to the fact
that, what she said in February 1992 had been said in her conversations with
Ms. Law in November 1990, was corroborated by others.

Australia.</u>
<P>

30  	Following her first conversation with Ms. McAlpine on 16
November 1990 in which Ms. McAlpine told Ms. Law that she would be
bringing to
Ms. Law the cheques for the proceeds of settlement of the sale of the
plaintiff's Bankstown property, Ms. Law spoke to
a fellow employee at the
offices of Powell Kwok Baker &amp; Co., namely, Miss Nancy Wong.  In answer to
an inquiry from Ms. Law as
to whether she knew of anyone with whom the
plaintiff's proceeds of sale could be deposited with interest that day, Ms.
Wong said
words to the effect:-
<P>

<i>"I would recommend BCC Australia as it has high interest rates for short
term deposits and also good accessibility.  A few of our
clients have
investments with BCC at the moment.  I know the contact person there.  He is
Mr. Wazay."</i>
<P>

31  	It was not in dispute that Ms. Wong had no expertise in relation
to investments 
<P>

32  	Ms. Law then telephoned Mr. Wazay of BCC and informed him that
she would like to arrange for some money to be deposited that
day with BCC.
Mr. Wazay of BCC informed Ms. Law that if the settlement cheques were to be
deposited later that day it could only
be by way of a Powell Kwok Baker trust
account cheque as the plaintiff did not have an account with BCC, whereas
Powell Kwok Baker
did.  Later that day, after Ms. McAlpine delivered the two
bank cheques drawn in favour of the plaintiff to Ms. Law at approximately
4.00pm, and Ms. Law had informed Ms. McAlpine that she would be able to get the
cheques into the bank before it closed, Ms. Law arranged
for Ms. Lynette Evans,
a partner of the accountancy firm of the defendant, to sign a Powell Kwok Baker
trust account withdrawal voucher
and trust cheque in the amount of the total of
the two cheques, namely, $486,043.61 in favour of BCC.  Ms. Law then deposited
the
two settlement cheques in favour of the plaintiff into the trust account of
the defendants after which the trust account cheque of
Powell Kwok Baker was
deposited into an account of BCC with the National Australia Bank nominated by
Mr. Wazay, in the name of Powell
Kwok Baker but on trust for the plaintiff.
<P>

33  	On 23 November 1990 Ms. McAlpine delivered to Ms. Law a cheque
in favour of the plaintiff in the amount of $82,077.15, being
the balance of
the deposit received the previous day from Ms. McAlpine from the agent on the
sale.  According to Ms. McAlpine at
that time she said to Ms. Law words to the
effect:-
<P>

<i>"This is the balance of the sale proceeds for Winnie Yu.  Can you deposit it
to the same account for Winnie?"</i>
<P>

34  	According to Ms. Law Ms. McAlpine said to her on the telephone
prior to delivery of the cheque words to the effect:-
<P>

<i>"I have the other cheque.  Can I bring it up to you to bank with the
rest."</i>
<P>

35  	Presumably this cheque was dealt with in the same way as the
other two cheques, namely, it was paid into the trust account
of Powell Kwok
Baker and a trust account cheque drawn on the trust account of Powell Kwok
Baker in favour of BCC in the sum of $82,077.15
was deposited in the account of
BCC with the National Australia Bank making the total of the deposits into the
BCC account $568,120.76.
<P>

<u>Subsequent Events</u>
<P>

36  	Ms. Law gave evidence and the plaintiff denied, that she (Ms.
Law) had a telephone conversation with the plaintiff in late
November or early
December 1990 during which Ms. Law informed the plaintiff that she had "banked"
the settlement cheques with BCC
at call.  According to Ms. Law the plaintiff
said that she would probably come back (to Sydney) early in the new year to
look for
"a comfortable house with security".  According to Ms. Law she (Ms.
Law) said that, in that case, the money should be placed on 30
days' call "as
the interest rate is higher", and that as the legal work for the purchase of
the property after payment of a deposit
would probably take around three to
four weeks there should be no problem in getting the money in time.  According
to Ms. Law the
plaintiff replied "Okay", and at the end of some further
conversation said that she would call Ms. Law when she arrived in Sydney.
 Ms.
Law says that when the plaintiff did not call her early in the new year she
made some enquiries and found out that she was very
ill in hospital. 
<P>

37  	In a subsequent affidavit Ms. Law stated that she believed that
it was more probable that she had this conversation with the
plaintiff on 12
December 1990 having regard to the fact that on 13 December 1990 she sent a
facsimile to BCC requesting that the
terms of the BCC deposit be changed from
call to thirty days.  The facsimile was in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"We confirm that we have deposited the following amounts in trust for Mrs.
Winnifred Wai Yue Yu with your bank, details of which are
as follows:</i>
<P>

<cite>Date Deposited</cite><i>          </i><cite>Amount</cite><i>
           </i><cite>Rate</cite><i>
</i><cite>Terms</cite>
<P>

16/11/90                   $486,043.61                   12.75%             7
day
<P>

23/11/90                   $82,077.15                     12.75%             24
hrs.
<P>

<i>We advise that as from today's date please rollover the above deposits with
accrued interest to thirty days' term deposit @ 12.5%
..."</i>
<P>

38  	In her later affidavit Ms. Law also referred to her diary entry
for 12 December 1990 on which beside the name and number for
the plaintiff she
had written "call confirmation of deposit. Confirm with Mr. Wazay of BCC"
followed by some abbreviated reference
to withholding tax.
<P>

39  	Ms. Law also referred in her later affidavit to her time sheet
for 23 November 1990 which, again beside the "cost centre name"
and "cost
centre number" for the plaintiff reads "phone HK re banking funds", but for
both these entries as Ms. Law said, the reference
to the name of the plaintiff
is limited to identifying the "cost centre name" and in my opinion does not
necessarily convey that
the phone calls referred to were with the plaintiff.
Moreover, the initials said to be "HK" are almost illegible and, in addition,
I
note that there was a fellow employee of Ms. Law in the offices of Powell Kwok
Baker who had the initials "HK" being H Kong.  Ms.
Law agreed in
cross-examination that these two time sheet entries had, in effect, not caused
her to remember the day upon which she
says she had the relevant call with the
plaintiff.  The facsimile from Ms. Law to BCC Australia dated 13/12/90 does,
however, lend
some support to Ms. Law's evidence as to that telephone
conversation with the plaintiff, and, in addition, it seems to me to accord
with the probabilities that the plaintiff, having asked Ms. McAlpine to deliver
the settlement cheques to Ms. Law, would have wished
to speak to Ms. Law about
them and about their investment.  
<P>

40  	Indeed there is, in this connection, the evidence of Ms.
McAlpine, referred to earlier, to the effect that during a telephone
conversation between Ms. McAlpine, the plaintiff and the plaintiff's husband in
late 1990 or early 1991 the plaintiff or her husband
asked her if she knew what
interest the plaintiff's money was earning, in reply to which Ms. McAlpine said
they would have to confirm
details with Ms. Law.
<P>

41  	Accordingly, I find that on the balance of probabilities, Ms.
Law did have a telephone conversation with the plaintiff on or
about 12
December 1990 generally along the lines as to which Ms. Law gave evidence but
with one significant exception.  I am satisfied
that in that conversation Ms.
Law did not refer to or mention BCC.  I am of this opinion principally, inter
alia, because of the
evidence as to what was said in certain later
conversations at which the plaintiff and her husband and others were present,
and because
of the subsequent conduct of the plaintiff who made no attempt to
contact the defendants about her investment immediately after becoming
aware of
adverse publicity concerning BCC.(see later).  I also have regard to the
plaintiff's evidence to the effect that she assumed
her funds had been invested
in a Westpac term deposit so that, in my opinion, the plaintiff would not have
required to be told the
identity of the entity with which the funds had been
invested. 
<P>

42  	Ms. Law also gave evidence that she had a conversation with the
plaintiff on 27 February 1991 by reference to her time sheet
for that day which
read:-
<P>

<i>"Winnifred Yu - meeting with her re land tax and others."</i>
<P>

43  	According to Ms. Law the plaintiff and her husband and others
attended a meeting at the offices of  Powell Kwok Baker on that
day in which
Ms. Law did not participate but saw the plaintiff separately.  Ms. Law said
that to the best of her recollection, during
the course of her discussion with
the plaintiff, she said to the plaintiff words to the effect that "Your funds
are invested with
BCC on thirty day call", and told the plaintiff the current
interest rate.  Ms. Law also said that during the conversation the plaintiff
handed to her a completed land tax variation form which Powell Kwok Baker had
sent her earlier under cover of a letter dated 8 February
1991.  Ms. Law also
produced a letter dated 28 February 1991 from Powell Kwok Baker to the
Commissioner of Land Tax enclosing the
completed 1991 variation return by way
of lodgment.  I note that the time sheet makes no mention of anything to do
with the deposit
of the plaintiff's funds with BCC, and I also note that the a
diary note of the plaintiff for that date, although it contains various
details
of the deposit, also makes no mention of BCC.  
<P>

44  	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, more
particularly having regard, inter alia, to the diary note of the plaintiff,
which makes no mention of BCC, that on 27 February 1991 Ms. Law did have a
conversation with the plaintiff in which she informed
the plaintiff of details
as to the investment of her funds.  I am satisfied, however, that in the course
of this conversation Ms.
Law again did not refer to BCC.  I am of this opinion,
principally, inter alia, because of the evidence as to what was said in later
conversations at which the plaintiff and her husband, among others, were
present and also, as stated above, because the plaintiff
did not contact the
defendants immediately upon becoming aware of unfavourable publicity concerning
BCC nor indeed later.  I am also
of the opinion that it is probable that BCC
was not mentioned by Ms. Law, either in this conversation or in her earlier
conversation
with the plaintiff, because, as revealed by Ms. Law's evidence as
to her early conversations with Ms. McAlpine quoted earlier, Ms.
Law's
principal concern was with the fact that the moneys were earning interest and
just as she was unconcerned, as I have found
in effect, with Ms. McAlpine's
instructions in the earlier conversation to bank the moneys in Mrs. Yu's bank
account, so in later
conversations she was, in my opinion, unconcerned with the
identity of the bank or financial institution with which the interest
bearing
deposit had been made and because, as stated above, so far as Mrs. Yu was
concerned, she had assumed her funds were in a
Westpac term deposit.
<P>

45  	Ms. Law did not have any further communication with the
plaintiff about the interest bearing deposit with BCC after February
1991 until
a meeting on 7 May 1992 with the plaintiff and others at the offices of Powell
Kwok Baker.  In the meantime Ms. Law arranged
for the funds deposited on behalf
of the plaintiff with BCC, to be rolled over each month, with the last roll
over of the deposit
together with interest occurring on 17 June 1991 for the
further period of one month to 17 July 1991.
<P>

<u>Appointment of Provisional Liquidator to BCC on 8 July 1991 and Events
Thereafter</u>
<P>

46  	On 8 July 1991 a provisional liquidator was appointed to BCC.
There followed certain correspondence between Mr. Kwok and the
provisional
liquidator, Mr. O'Brien, culminating in the submission of a formal proof of
debt by Powell Kwok Baker on 30 August 1991.
 It appears that neither the
plaintiff nor her husband were informed either by Ms. Law or by Mr. Kwok of the
appointment of a provisional
liquidator, although I note that the evidence is
that as from the date of appointment of the provisional liquidator the matter
of
the deposit with the plaintiff's funds with BCC was taken over by Mr. Kwok
from Ms. Law.
<P>

47  	According to the plaintiff she heard nothing from Powell Kwok
Baker about her interest bearing deposit until approximately
one year after her
funds had been handed to Ms. Law, namely, in November 1991 in which month she
and her husband had taken a week's
holiday with Mr. Kwok, his wife and
mother-in-law.  Following their return from Thailand to Hong Kong on 13
November 1991, Mr. Kwok,
just prior to him returning to Sydney, informed the
plaintiff that her money had been deposited with BCC which was in financial
difficulties.
 He told the plaintiff not to worry about this because the
company's assets exceeded it's liabilities, and she would get her money
back in
full, although the company was not selling anything until the market improved.
Mr. Kwok said he had not mentioned this before
because he wanted to find out
more about the current position, and that Mr. Leong, the plaintiff's solicitor,
had also agreed to
him delaying in informing the plaintiff and her husband
about the deposit with BCC.  Mr. Kwok also handed the plaintiff an envelope
containing the company's first report to creditors dated 23 August 1991 saying
words to the effect "You don't have to read this.
 Everything is okay.  This is
not important.  Your investment is quite safe.  Don't worry."
<P>

48  	The plaintiff said that prior to this meeting she was aware that
BCC was in financial difficulties, as that fact had been well
publicised in
Hong Kong both in newspapers and on television.  In my opinion, as stated
above, if the plaintiff had been previously
informed by Ms. Law that her moneys
were deposited with BCC she would certainly have raised the matter with Ms. Law
or Mr. Kwok immediately
upon her becoming aware of the adverse publicity
concerning BCC.  The fact that she did not do so is part of the reason why I
have
formed the view referred to above that the plaintiff was not informed by
Ms. Law of the fact that her moneys had been deposited with
BCC in either of
the two conversations to which they were parties referred to earlier.  I have
also, as stated above, had regard
to the fact that the plaintiff was consistent
in her evidence as to what was said at later meetings relevant to what had been
said
in earlier conversations and that, in that regard, her evidence was
generally corroborated by others including Ms. McAlpine and Mr.
Hancock as well
as her husband.  I am also of the view that to the extent that in her affidavit
and oral evidence the plaintiff denied
that she had spoken to Ms. Law about the
investment of her funds she was genuinely mistaken because she had genuinely
forgotten the
relevant conversations.
<P>

49  	Dr. Yu, the plaintiff's husband, also gave evidence that he
first learnt that the plaintiff's funds were deposited with BCC
Australia when
he was so informed by Mr. Kwok in November 1991 in Hong Kong.  Dr. Yu generally
corroborated the evidence of the plaintiff
as to what was said at this meeting
but also gave evidence that when he said to Mr. Kwok words to the effect "Why
did you put it
in BCC?  We don't even use such banks in Hong Kong", Mr. Kwok
did not reply.
<P>

50  	Mr. Kwok's reply to the evidence of the plaintiff and her
husband in relation to the meeting in Hong Kong in November 1991
was contained
in paragraph 20 of his affidavit of 2 June 1998 which was in the following
terms:-
<P>

<i>"20.	I refer to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the affidavit of Mrs. Yu.  I admit
that in or about November 1991 I went to Hong Kong and
that myself, my wife and
her mother, accompanied Mrs. Yu on a trip to Thailand.  I deny the contents of
the conversations referred
to in those affidavits which are attributed to me
and I do not otherwise have an accurate recollection of the contents of those
conversations.
 I recall that during that trip, I advised Mrs. Yu that BCC was
in financial difficulties.  I do not precisely recall the details
I provided to
Mrs. Yu regarding the circumstances of BCC's collapse or regarding the
likelihood of a distribution being made to creditors
although I do recall that
I initially believed that it was possible that a full distribution would be
made."</i>
<P>

51  	It is plain from this paragraph of his affidavit, as well as
from other paragraphs of his affidavit, and from his oral evidence
generally,
that Mr. Kwok had no real recollection of what was said in the course of the
conversation in Hong Kong in November 1991,
nor indeed in the course of other
conversations of which other parties gave evidence and at which he was present.
Thus, for example,
the plaintiff gave evidence of a meeting at the offices of
Powell Kwok Baker on 7 May 1992 attended by the plaintiff, her husband,
Ken
Hancock, Susan McAlpine, Gary Leong, for a short while, Grace Law and Glen
Bourke (an employee from Mr. Kwok's office).  She
said that after discussion of
certain other matters her husband said words to the effect "I want to discuss
the BCC money.  Why wasn't
the money deposited with Westpac?"  The plaintiff
said that Mr. Kwok did not reply but that Susan McAlpine said words to the
effect
that she had telephoned the plaintiff in Hong Kong and offered to bank
the money for her but that she didn't have the bank account
details.  Ms.
McAlpine then said that she took the cheque up to Ms. Law and asked her to bank
it and was told by Ms. Law that she
had the plaintiff's bank account details
and said that she would bank it.  The plaintiff also gave evidence that her
husband asked
why the money was put with BCC, and why they were never told
about it, and further, that he (her husband) did not know that the money
as
with BCC until Mr. Kwok came to Hong Kong.  Her husband also asked why nobody
asked them what to do with the money.  She said
that Mr. Kwok said nothing.
Ms. Law then said words to the effect "You are putting me in an embarrassing
situation."  Dr. Yu then
asked Ms. Law why she didn't tell the plaintiff about
the BCC investment to which Ms. Law replied, according to the plaintiff, that
she was not supposed to phone the plaintiff.  Again, Alan Kwok said nothing,
according to the plaintiff.
<P>

52  	The plaintiff's husband, Dr. Yu, gave evidence to similar effect
although with a little more detail in response to those two
affidavits yet Mr.
Kwok's affidavit contained only the following paragraphs:-
<P>

<i>"21.	I refer to paragraph 16 of the affidavit of Mrs. Yu.  Although I do not
have an accurate recollection of the content of the discussions
at that
meeting, I do not believe that I said nothing throughout the entire course of
that meeting.  It is probable that I said little
in substance because of the
fact that there were people at that meeting for whom I believe it in
inappropriate for the BCC investment
to be discussed ...</i>
<P>

<i>23.	I refer to paragraph 5 of the affidavit of Dr. Chi Yu sworn 14 December
1993.  I do not have an accurate recollection of the content
of the discussions
at that meeting.  I refer to paragraph 21 above."</i>
<P>

53  	Ms. McAlpine also gave evidence as to what was said at this
meeting in considerably more detail, including evidence of conversation
to the
effect that both the plaintiff and her husband said that they were not aware
that the plaintiff's moneys had been invested
with BCC until Mr. Kwok informed
them of that fact in Hong Kong in November 1991.  
<P>

54  	Ms. McAlpine also gave evidence that during this conversation
Ms. Law said words to the effect that she thought the plaintiff
knew where the
money was and she thought that she had spoken to once about it and that later
Ms. Law said that she was not allowed
to ring the plaintiff.
<P>

55  	Mr. Kwok's response to Ms. McAlpine's affidavit was no more than
the following paragraph contained in his affidavit of 2 June
1998:-
<P>

<i>"22.	I refer to paragraphs 2 and 13 of the affidavit of Susan McAlpine sworn
21 January 1994.  I do not have an accurate recollection
of the content of the
discussions at that meeting.  I refer to paragraph 21 above."</i>
<P>

56  	It is plain also from these paragraphs in the affidavit of Mr.
Kwok of 2 June 1998 that Mr. Kwok also had no real recollection
of what was
said at the meeting of 7 May 1992.  Accordingly, and notwithstanding some
evidence to the contrary of Ms. Law as to what
was said at this meeting I
prefer the evidence in general of the plaintiff, her husband, Dr. Yu, and in
particular Ms. McAlpine as
to what was said at that meeting.  The evidence of
these three witnesses is, in general, consistent between themselves, and also,
in general, with the evidence of Mr. Hancock, although Dr. Yu and, in
particular, Ms. McAlpine, were able to give more detail as
to the substance of
what was said.  
<P>

57  	On the other hand, in my opinion, as stated earlier, Ms. Law was
in her oral evidence more concerned to debate and interpret
the substance of
what she said she believed was said rather than to direct attention to her
recollection of the words actually used
in response to questions of that
nature.  I observe, in particular, but without limiting the generality of my
comments, that in her
affidavit of 15 March 1994 Ms. Law said in relation to
the meeting of 7 May 1992 at the offices of Powell Kwok Baker that she said
that the plaintiff "must have known where the money was as we spoke about it on
the phone" but shortly after that said that she "didn't
call Mrs. Yu".  In oral
evidence Ms. Law explained that she was intending to convey only that she had
not phoned the plaintiff, and
not that she had not spoken to the plaintiff in a
telephone call made by the plaintiff.  Notwithstanding this, however, I remain,
as stated above, of the opinion that the probabilities are that Ms. Law did
speak to the plaintiff informing her that the moneys
had been placed on
interest bearing deposit, but that she did not inform the plaintiff that those
moneys had been placed with BCC
having regard, inter alia, to the fact, as I
have said earlier, that in my opinion Ms. Law was more concerned with the fact
that
the moneys had been placed on interest bearing deposit than with the
identity of the financial institution with which they had been
placed and to
the various other matters that I have referred to above.  
<P>

58  	I note again in this connection that the evidence of the
plaintiff (and others) which I accept as to what was said in the meeting
in
Hong Kong in November 1991, as well as in the meeting at the offices of Powell
Kwok Baker on 7 May 1992, is inconsistent with
the plaintiff (or her husband)
having been told prior to the meeting of November 1991 that the plaintiff's
moneys were invested with
BCC.  I also note again that the plaintiff's inaction
in relation to her first learning that BCC was in financial trouble from the
newspapers and television in Hong Kong is also inconsistent with her having
been told prior to the meeting in Hong Kong in November
1991 that her moneys
were invested with BCC.  I further note in passing that there was a further
meeting in February 1992 between
the plaintiff and her husband with Mr. Kwok
and another member of his staff in which that member of the staff informed the
plaintiff
and her husband that he had attended a BCC's creditors' meeting and
that it looked as though they would recover at least 80 cents
in the dollar.
This meeting, however, in my opinion, is of no consequence in relation to the
findings of fact I have made above.
<P>

59  	The provisional liquidator and subsequently the liquidator of
BCC have paid certain dividends to the plaintiff which in aggregate
have on
some basis reduced the amount of the plaintiff's loss to a net amount of
$300,929.21.  I propose, however, the hear further
argument as to the precise
amount of damages and interest to which the plaintiff is entitled.
<P>

60  	Counsel for the defendant submitted that it was unlikely that
the plaintiff had failed to make enquiries about the proceeds
of sale of the
Bankstown property, in effect, until the meeting of November 1991 in Hong Kong,
notwithstanding her illness.  However,
as I have found, the plaintiff was aware
in December 1990 and in December 1990 and in February 1991 of the details of
the interest
bearing deposit, although not of the identity of the financial
institution with which the deposit had been made, and said that she
assumed
that the moneys were on interest bearing deposit with Westpac, so that
thereafter she was not particularly concerned, more
especially having regard to
her undoubted ill health at the time and even accepting that that did not
prevent her from undertaking
many other activities, including activities of a
business nature.  I also note that according to the evidence, which I accept,
of
Mr. Patrick Yu, a son of the plaintiff, he had a telephone conversation with
Mr. Kwok on 9 March 1992 in which Mr Kwok admitted that
the plaintiff did not
know that the moneys had been deposited with BCC.
<P>

<u>Decision As to Instructions Given by the Plaintiff to the Defendants</u>
<P>

61  	In my opinion the relevant substance of the instructions given
by Ms McAlpine, on behalf of the plaintiff, to Ms Law, on behalf
of the
defendants, was that the various cheques of the plaintiff should first be
deposited to the credit of the plaintiff's non-interest
bearing Westpac cheque
account and thereafter, as soon as reasonably practicable, the proceeds of
those cheques should be deposited
at interest by the defendants on behalf of
the plaintiff with some suitable deposit-taking entity.  In the relevant
circumstances
these instructions plainly required the defendants, first to
deposit the cheques to the plaintiff's non-interest bearing Westpac
cheque
account and thereafter, having regard to the practicalities of the situation,
including the location of the plaintiff, in
Hong Kong, to obtain as soon as
reasonably practicable a cheque drawn by the plaintiff on her Westpac cheque
account in favour of
the relevant deposit-taking entity.  There might, of
course, have been other ways of achieving the desired result.  This would
probably
have meant that interest was not earned on the proceeds of the cheques
as from the date of their deposit to the credit of the plaintiff's
Westpac
cheque account, but this would have been unavoidable (yet still in accordance
with the plaintiff's instructions).
<P>

62  	There was, in my opinion, no ambiguity or contradiction in the
instructions from Ms McAlpine on behalf of the plaintiff.  It
was, in my
opinion, unambiguously clear that the instructions were to the effect that the
cheques should first be credited to the
bank account of the plaintiff, as to
which Ms Law had the details, and which was the plaintiff's non-interest
bearing Westpac cheque
account.  It was also, in my opinion, unambiguously
clear that the plaintiff's instructions were to the effect that the proceeds
of
the cheques should be deposited at interest, as soon as reasonably practicable,
as Ms McAlpine made clear by her implied request
that the cheques should be
deposited to the plaintiff's cheque account on the day they were received
(perhaps with a view to expediting
the clearance of the cheques) and by her
statement to the effect that clients do not like to lose even one day's
interest.
<P>

63  	It is common ground that Ms Law did not follow strictly the
instructions of the plaintiff, but instead took it upon herself
to deposit the
cheques of the plaintiff to the credit of the trust account of the defendants
and thereafter, by means of cheques
drawn on the trust account of the
defendants, to deposit the funds of the plaintiff with BCC in the name of the
defendants on trust
for the plaintiff.
<P>

<u>Submissions on Behalf of the Plaintiff</u>
<P>

64  	In this context, it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff as
follows:-
<P>

(1)	that the defendants were guilty of the tort of conversion in relation to
the cheques, by reason of their failing to deposit
the cheques to the credit of
the plaintiff's Westpac cheque account as instructed, and instead, depositing
them to the credit of
the trust account of the defendants; 
<P>

(2)	that the defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff to deposit the
plaintiff's cheques to the credit of the plaintiff's
Westpac cheque account in
respect of which duty the defendants committed a breach;  
<P>

(3)	that the defendants owed the plaintiff a duty of care in tort to advise the
plaintiff of the  nature of the investment into
which they proposed to deposit
or invest the proceeds of the cheques and subsequently re-invest on a monthly
basis [including the
investment risk involved] before so depositing or
investing or reinvesting the proceeds (counsel for the plaintiff expressly
disclaimed
any submission to the effect that the defendants had committed any
breach of any duty in tort to take care in the selection of an
interest-bearing
investment for the plaintiff notwithstanding that it was conceded on behalf of
the defendants that such a duty of
care did exist);  and 
<P>

(4)	that the defendants were trustees of the plaintiff's funds within the
meaning of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act, 1925</a> and committed breaches of trust by investing
the plaintiff's funds in an investment not authorised under that Act.
<P>

<u>Conspectus</u>
<P>

<u>Conversion</u>
<P>

65  	For reasons which will appear hereafter I am of the opinion that
the defendants were guilty of conversion of the cheques of
the plaintiff on the
basis alleged by the plaintiff, but that the damages claimed in that connection
were not caused by the acts
of conversion in depositing the plaintiff's cheques
to the credit of the trust account of the defendants, contrary to the
instructions
of the plaintiff, but rather were caused, in the context of the
submissions on behalf of the plaintiff, by the depositing of the
plaintiff's
funds with BCC before advising (informing) the plaintiff of the nature of the
proposed investment, including the investment
risk involved.
<P>

<u>Fiduciary Duty</u>
<P>

66  	I am further of the opinion that a fiduciary relationship arose
between the plaintiff and the defendants, upon the defendants
accepting the
instructions of the plaintiff in all the circumstances, and that an incident of
that fiduciary relationship was a fiduciary
duty owed by the defendants to the
plaintiff to deposit the cheques of the plaintiff to the credit of the
plaintiff's Westpac cheque
account.  That fiduciary relationship and fiduciary
duty came into existence, in my opinion, inter alia, because of the
relationship
of principal and agent that came into existence between the
parties in all the circumstances of the case, including the obvious reposing
by
the plaintiff of trust and confidence in the defendants, having regard to their
past and present relationship and the course of
prior dealings between them, as
well as the acceptance by the defendants of the responsibility involved in
accepting the plaintiff's
instructions.
<P>

67  	This relationship and duty may, in my opinion, properly be
described as fiduciary because it clearly involved obligations of
loyalty and
fidelity and because any breach in performance of the duty by the defendants
would almost certainly (although not in
the present case) involve disloyalty,
dishonesty and/or lack of bona fides in a context of potential conflict of
interest in which
the defendants had preferred their personal interest to their
duty to the plaintiff.
<P>

68  	I am further of the opinion, however, that the plaintiff
suffered no loss by reason of the defendants having breached their
fiduciary
duty by failing to deposit the cheques to the credit of the plaintiff's Westpac
cheque account, and that any loss suffered
by the plaintiff was the result of
the defendants depositing the funds of the plaintiff with BCC without first
advising the plaintiff
of the nature and details of the investment including
the proposed investment risk involved.
<P>

<u>Duty of Care</u>
<P>

69  	So far as concerns the alleged duty of care in tort, I am of the
opinion that such a duty as is alleged on behalf of the plaintiff
did come into
existence in all the circumstances of the case, namely, a positive duty, in
effect, owed by the defendants, to advise
(inform) the plaintiff of the nature
and details of the investment the defendants were proposing to make (including
advice (information)
as to investment risk) prior to the investment or
reinvestment.  In my opinion, the defendants committed breaches of that duty
which
breaches were causative of the plaintiff's loss because, in my opinion,
on the evidence, if the duty had been performed, the plaintiff
would not have
approved the investment and reinvestment with BCC.  I am further of the
opinion, however, that, for reasons which
will appear hereafter, the plaintiff
was responsible (contributed) as to 15% for (to) the loss suffered by her.
<P>

70  	To the extent to which it has been suggested that the defendants
owed to the plaintiff a fiduciary duty co-extensive or substantially
co-extensive with this duty of care in tort, I am of the opinion that no such
"fiduciary" duty arose as an incident of the fiduciary
relationship between the
parties, and this conclusion accords with the submissions on behalf of the
plaintiff.  I am of this opinion
principally because the breach of the duty of
care as formulated on behalf of the plaintiff is, in my opinion, not such that
its
breach would ordinarily involve (and certainly did not involve in the
present case) any disloyalty, dishonesty and/or lack of bona
fides in a context
of potential conflict of interest in which the defendants had preferred their
personal interest to their duty
to the client.  It might well have been
otherwise, however, if the defendants had chosen to invest the plaintiff's
funds with BCC
because they thereby earned secret commissions from BCC.  There
was of course no evidence or suggestion to that effect.

<P>

71  	So far as concerns the submissions on behalf of the plaintiff to
the effect that the defendants were trustees within the meaning
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee
Act 1925</a>, and committed breaches of trust by investing the funds of the
plaintiff in an investment (with BCC) which was admittedly not authorised
under
that Act, I am of the opinion that these submissions should be rejected.  In
this connection it is plain in my opinion, from,
inter alia, the present and
past relationship between the parties, from the course of prior dealings
between the parties, and from
the terms of the instructions given by Ms
McAlpine to Ms Law (which contained no limitations as to any particular or any
class of
investment at interest) that the defendants were not, nor was it the
plaintiff's intention that they should be, limited to making
investments on
behalf of the plaintiff which were authorised under that Act.

<P>

72  	Finally, I am of the opinion that to the extent to which,
contrary to my view, the defendants may be eligible to claim relief
from
personal liability pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act, 1925</a>, the
defendants are not entitled to any such relief by reason of the fact that they
did not, in all the circumstances, act reasonably,
although it is common ground
that they acted honestly.
<P>

<u>Conversion</u>
<P>

73  	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the deposit of
the cheques of the plaintiff to the credit of the trust account
of the
defendants, contrary to the express instructions, in effect, of the plaintiff
to deposit those cheques first to the credit
of the plaintiff's Westpac cheque
account, constituted the commission by the defendants of the tort of conversion
of those cheques.
 Alternatively, so it was submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff,  the conversion was the act of the defendants in first depositing
the plaintiff's cheques to the credit of their trust account and subsequently
investing the proceeds of the cheques with BCC.
<P>

74  	As the tort of conversion in relation to cheques is based upon
the legal fiction that cheques are to be regarded as chattels,
any conduct of
the defendants in relation to the proceeds of cheques is, in my opinion,
irrelevant for present purposes.  It follows,
in my opinion, that the
subsequent conduct of the defendants in depositing the proceeds of the cheques
with BCC is irrelevant for
present purposes and that, to that extent, the
alternative submission on behalf of the plaintiff must be rejected.
<P>

75  	The distinction between the cheque as a piece of paper (chattel)
on the one hand, and the proceeds of the cheque on the other
hand, appears in
the following passages from Weaver &amp; Craigie: <b><i> The Law Relating
to</i><u> </u><i>Banker and Customer in Australia</i><u> </u></b>(2nd ed -
1990) par 15.230 at page 7093:-

<i>"The well-established but somewhat artificial position is that the true
owner of a cheque sues for conversion of the piece of paper,
the cheque as a
piece of paper being treated as having a value equivalent to its face
value."</i>
<P>

77  	In my opinion the defendants are guilty of the tort of
conversion in relation to the plaintiff's cheques on the basis of the
primary
submission made on behalf of the plaintiff.  The basic principles in relation
to conversion were expounded by Dixon J (as
he then was) in the High Court in
the case of <b>Penfolds Wines Pty Ltd v Elliott</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1946/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2074%20CLR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 74 CLR 204</a> at 229 in
the following passage:-
<P>

<i>"The essence of conversion is a dealing with a chattel in a manner repugnant
to the immediate right of possession of the person who
has the property or
special property in the chattel.  It may take the form of </i><cite>a disposal
of the goods by way of sale or pledge or other intended transfer of an interest
followed by delivery,</cite><i> or the destruction or change of the nature or
character of the thing, as for example, pouring water into wine, or cutting
the seals
from a deed, </i><cite>or of an appropriation evidenced by refusal to
deliver or denial of title.</cite><i>  But damage to the chattel is not
conversion, nor is use, nor is a transfer of possession otherwise than for the
purpose of affecting
the immediate right to possession, nor is it always
conversion to lose the goods beyond hope of recovery. </i><cite>An intent to do
that which would deprive `the true owner of his immediate right to possession
or impair it may be said to form the
essential ground of tort.</cite><i>"
(underlining supplied)</i>
<P>

78  	A learned academic has defined conversion as follows:
<P>

<i>"Conversion may be defined as an intentional exercise of control over a
chattel which so seriously interferes with the right of another
to control it
that the intermeddler may justly be required to pay its full value... In truth,
the action is proprietary in substance,
only tortious in form.  As has been
perceptively observed, the action in effect forces an involuntary purchase on
the converter;
 it permits the plaintiff to say to him:  `You have bought
yourself something'.  This in turn provides the clue for determining whether
a
tortious intermeddling is serious enough to justify the drastic sanction of
compelling the wrongdoer to buy the plaintiff out":
John G Fleming, </i><b>The
Law of Torts</b><i> (9th ed - 1998) at 60-61.</i>
<P>

79  	It was argued on behalf of the defendants that they were not
guilty of conversion of the plaintiff's cheques because they did
not deal with
the cheques in such a way as to deny the plaintiff's title to the cheques when
they deposited them to the credit of
their trust account where the proceeds
were held on trust for the plaintiff, so that the plaintiff was not deprived of
her money,
the proceeds of the cheques.
<P>

80  	In my opinion however, when it  is recognised, correctly, as
stated above, that the tort of conversion deals with the cheques
as chattels
(pieces of paper), and not with the proceeds of the cheques, the conditions
necessary to give rise to the tort have been
satisfied.  The plaintiff was
plainly entitled to immediate possession of the cheques, subject only to the
instructions  to deposit
them to the credit of her Westpac cheque account, and
that right of the plaintiff to immediate possession of the cheques was
seriously
interfered with when they were deposited to the credit of the trust
account of the defendants, albeit on trust for the plaintiff.
<P>

81  	By reason of that depositing, the plaintiff was deprived of her
immediate right to possession of the cheques and thereafter,
the cheques were
relevantly not recoverable.  The conduct of the defendants clearly involved a
denial by the defendants of the title
of the plaintiff to immediate possession
of the cheques and was, in my opinion, sufficiently serious, having regard to
the fact that
the cheques were relevantly not recoverable, "to justify the
drastic sanction of compelling the wrongdoer to buy the plaintiff out".
<P>

82  	As stated above, however, I am of the opinion that in the
present case, the conversion by the defendants of the plaintiff's
cheques was
not the cause of the loss claimed to have been suffered by the plaintiff.   In
my opinion, the cause of that loss was,
in the context of the submissions made
on behalf of the plaintiff, the breach by the defendants of their positive duty
in tort to
advise (inform) the plaintiff of the notice of the investment into
which the defendants proposed to deposit or invest the proceeds
of the
plaintiff's cheques [including the investment risk involved] prior to making
the proposed investment.
<P>

<u>Fiduciary Duty</u>
<P>

83  	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the plaintiff
instructed the defendants, who were her accountants, and in
whom she reposed
substantial trust and confidence, to deposit her cheques to the credit of her
Westpac cheque account, and that thereupon
a fiduciary relationship arose in
that connection between the parties.  It was further submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff that
the defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff to deposit
the plaintiff's cheques to the credit of her Westpac cheque account
in
accordance with her instructions.  It was further alleged on behalf of the
plaintiff that the defendants committed a breach of
that fiduciary duty by
depositing the cheques of the plaintiff to the credit of their own trust
account, albeit on trust for the
plaintiff.
<P>

84  	I am of the opinion that a fiduciary relationship did arise, in
all the circumstances, between the plaintiff and the defendants
upon the
defendants accepting the instructions of the plaintiff.  That fiduciary
relationship came into existence, in my opinion,
inter alia, because of the
relationship of principal and agent which thereby came into existence, but also
because of their past
and present relationship including the course of prior
dealings between them.
<P>

85  	That past and present relationship between the parties was one
of accountant and client, but went beyond that to some extent
in respect of
which it is plain that the plaintiff reposed significant trust and confidence
in the defendants.
<P>

86  	The course of prior dealings between the parties included, as
appears from Mr Kwok's affidavit, the following facts:-
<P>

(1)	that the defendants in about 1978 commenced acting as accountants for the
plaintiff, the plaintiff's husband and their family
company;  
<P>

(2)	that since that time the defendants were responsible for most, if not all,
the plaintiff's accounting work, including the preparation
of her personal
income tax returns and the provision of general taxation advice to her;  
<P>

(3)	that during the period from 1978 to 1992 Mr Kwok occasionally provided
investment advice to the plaintiff and made a number
of investments on her
behalf;  
<P>

(4)	that during the period from the late 1980's to 1992 Mr Kwok discussed with
the plaintiff both in Sydney and in Hong Kong her
marital affairs and personal
problems, including the fact that the plaintiff and her husband were
experiencing some marital problems;
 
<P>

(5) 	that the plaintiff told Mr Kwok on several occasions in the course of
those discussions that she was concerned that her husband
might divorce her,
and she would be left penniless, and 
<P>

(6)	that she wished to accumulate some personal moneys in case that happened;
and that it was not Mr Kwok's practice to invest funds
for clients with whom he
did not have a personal relationship beyond the professional relationship of
client and accountant, but
that the plaintiff was a client with whom he had
such a personal relationship and that, in view of that relationship, Mr Kwok
made
a number of recommendations to the plaintiff in relation to certain
investments.  
<P>

87  	Those investments were investments made by the plaintiff in New
South Wales Treasury Corporation Premier State Bonds (early
1986 - $35,000),
Westpac Term Deposit (March 1986), MLC Capital Guaranteed Bond (February 1987)
and capital guaranteed bonds from
Capita Financial Group (February 1987
$45,000).  Relevant also, in my opinion, were the facts that a relatively large
sum of money
was involved and that the proposed deposit was to be unsecured,
which would have been of significance for the plaintiff, having regard
to her
known requirements.
<P>

88  	Mr. Kwok's knowledge of the importance of guarding against
posible loss in respect of the plaintiff's investments appears from
the
following questions and answers in his cross-examination:-
<P>

<i>"Q.	You knew, Mr Kwok, that at all times when you provided investment advice
to Mrs Yu, that Mrs Yu was relying on you to invest the
money in a safe and
conservative manner, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	She only wanted me to invest the money for her, without any restriction
on my recommendation ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was crucial, wasn't it, to Mrs Yu, that this money was not to be
lost?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you knew that, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did. ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And on all occasions you knew that you should look after that money,
didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you wouldn't put it anywhere where it might be lost, would
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I wouldn't.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you would be careful to ensure that the investments you placed that
money in was secure and well protected, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	At all times."</i>
<P>

89  	I am further of the opinion, as stated above, that an incident
of that fiduciary relationship between the parties was a duty
owed by the
defendants to the plaintiff to comply with her instructions, and that that duty
may properly be described as fiduciary
because it involved obligations of
loyalty and fidelity in the context of, inter alia, the trust and confidence
reposed by the plaintiff
in the defendants, and also because breach of that
duty by the defendants would almost certainly (although not in this particular
case) involve disloyalty, dishonesty and/or lack of bona fides in a context of
potential conflict of interest in which the defendants
would have preferred
their personal interest to the duty they owed to the plaintiff.
<P>

90  	Nevertheless, although it is plain, in my opinion, that that
fiduciary duty was breached by the defendants in depositing the
plaintiff's
cheques to the credit of their trust account instead of following the
plaintiff's instructions, I am of the opinion,
as stated earlier, that the
breach did not cause the plaintiff any relevant loss.  Rather, in my opinion,
any loss suffered by the
plaintiff was relevantly caused by the conduct of the
defendants in depositing and renewing the deposit of the plaintiff's funds
with
BCC by reason of, in the context of the submissions on behalf of the plaintiff,
the failure of the defendants to inform the
plaintiff of the nature of the
proposed investment (including the investment risk involved) before actually
making the investment
since, as submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, if this
had been done, the plaintiff would not have approved the investment  with
BCC
and her funds would have been invested elsewhere.
<P>

91  	In this context of the plaintiff's submissions it becomes
necessary to identify, if it exists, a duty owed by the defendants
to the
plaintiff to advise (inform) the plaintiff of the nature of a proposed
investment (including the investment risk involved)
before making any such
investment, and to determine whether any such duty was a "fiduciary" duty.  In
my opinion no such "fiduciary"
duty came into existence between the parties
(see later) although a duty to that effect arising in tort did come into
existence,
and this view accords with the submission on behalf of the plaintiff
which was as follows:-
<P>

<i>"The Plaintiff submits that the better view is that the duty alleged arises
in tort rather than by reason of any fiduciary duties
that might be owed by the
Defendants to the Plaintiff."</i>
<P>

92  	Alternatively, in my opinion, such a duty arose in equity,
although not fiduciary in nature, in the context of the fiduciary
relationship
which existed between the parties arising from their present and past
relationship and the course of prior dealings
between them as referred to
earlier.
<P>

93  	In my opinion, although the parties were in a fiduciary
relationship, this particular equitable duty was not a fiduciary duty
because
it did not, in its essential nature, involve duties of loyalty and/or fidelity,
nor was it such that any breach would almost
certainly involve disloyalty,
dishonesty and/or lack of bona fides in a context of conflict of interest in
which the defendants had
preferred their personal interest to their duty to the
plaintiff.
<P>

94  	That considerations such as these are relevant to the
description of a particular duty as being fiduciary, appears, inter alia,
from
the following passages in judgments and a text:  In <b><u>Bristol and West
Building Society v Mothew</u></b> [1998] Ch 1 at 16-18, Millett LJ held as
follows:-
<P>

<i>"Breach of fiduciary duty</i>
<P>

<i>Despite the warning given by Fletcher Moulton L.J. in In re Coomber; Coomber
v Coomber  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%201%20Ch%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 1 Ch. 723</a>, 728, this branch of the law has been bedevilled by
unthinking resort to verbal formulae.  It is therefore necessary to begin by
defining one's terms.  The expression "fiduciary duty" is properly confined to
those duties which are peculiar to fiduciaries and
the breach of which attracts
legal consequences differing from those consequent upon the breach of other
duties.  Unless the expression
is so limited it is lacking in practical
utility. In this sense it is obvious that not every breach of duty by a
fiduciary is a breach
of fiduciary duty.  I would endorse the observations of
Southin J in Girardet v crease &amp; Co.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20BCLR%20%282d%29%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 B.C.L.R. (2d)
361</a>,362:-</i>
<P>

<i>`The word `fiduciary' is flung around now as if it applied to all breaches
of duty by solicitors, directors of companies and so forth....That
a lawyer can
commit a breach of the special duty [of a fiduciary] ... by entering into a
contract with the client without full disclosure
... and so forth is clear.
But to say that simple carelessness in giving advice is such a breach is a
perversion of words.'</i>
<P>

<i>These remarks were approved by La Forest J. in <b>LAC Minerals Ltd</b> <b>v
International Cornoa Resources Ltd</b>  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989scr2-574/1989scr2-574.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 61 D.L.R. (4th) 14</a>, 28 where he
said: "not every legal claim arising out of a relationship with fiduciary
incidents will give rise to a claim for breach
of fiduciary duty."</i>
<P>

<i>It is similarly inappropriate to apply the expression to the obligation of a
trustee or other fiduciary to use proper skill and care
in the discharge of his
duties.  If it is confined to cases where the fiduciary nature of the duty has
special legal consequences,
then the fact that the source of the duty is to be
found in equity rather than the common law does not make it a fiduciary duty.
The common law and equity each developed the duty of care, but they did so
independently of each other and the standard of care required
is not always the
same.  But they influenced each other, and today the substance of the resulting
obligations is more significant
than their particular historic origin.  In

Browne-Wilkinson said:</i>
<P>

<i>"The liability of a fiduciary for the negligent transaction of his duties is
not a separate head of liability but the paradigm of
the general duty to act
with care imposed by law on those who take it upon themselves to act for or
advise others.  Although the
historical development of the rules of law and
equity have, in the past, caused different labels to be stuck on different
manifestations
of the duty, in truth the duty of care imposed on bailees,
carriers, trustees, directors, agents and others is the same duty: it
arises
from the circumstances in which the defendants were acting, not from their
status or description.  It is the fact that they
have all assumed
responsibility for the property or affairs of others which renders them liable
for the careless performance of what
they have undertaken to do, not the
description of the trade or position which they hold."</i>
<P>

<i>I respectfully agree, and endorse the comment of Ipp J in <b>Permanent
Building Society v Wheeler</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2014%20ACSR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 14 A.C.S.R. 109</a>, 157:-</i>
<P>

<i>"It is essential to bear in mind that the existence of a fiduciary
relationship does not mean that every duty owed by a fiduciary
to the
beneficiary is a fiduciary duty.  In particular, a trustee's duty to exercise
reasonable care, though equitable, is not specifically
a fiduciary
duty..."</i>
<P>

<i>Ipp J explained, at p. 158:</i>
<P>

<i>"The director's duty to exercise care and sill has nothing to do with any
position of disadvantage or vulnerability on the part of
the company.  It is
not a duty that stems from the requirements of trust and confidence imposed on
a fiduciary. In my opinion, that
duty is not a fiduciary duty, although it is a
duty actionable in the equitable jurisdiction of this court....I consider that
Hamilton
owed P.B.S. a duty, both in law and in equity, to exercise reasonable
care and skill, and P.B.S. was able to mount a claim against
him for breach of
the legal duty, and, in the alternative, breach of the equitable duty.  For the
reasons I have expressed, in my
view the equitable duty is not to be equated
with or termed a `fiduciary' duty."</i>
<P>

<i>I agree.  Historical support for this analysis may be found in Viscount
Haldane L.C.'s speech in </i><b>Nocton v Lord Ashburton</b><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%20AC%20932" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] A.C. 932</a>,
956.  Discussing the old bill in Chancery for equitable compensation for breach
of fiduciary duty, he said that he thought it probable
that a demurrer for want
of equity would always have lain to a bill which did no more than seek to
enforce a claim for damages for
negligence against a solicitor.</i>
<P>

<i>In my judgment this is not just a question of semantics.  It goes to the
very heart of the concept of breach of fiduciary duty and
the availability of
equitable remedies.</i>
<P>

<i>Although the remedy which equity makes available for breach of the equitable
duty of skill and care is equitable compensation rather
than damages, this is
merely the product of history and in this context is in my opinion a
distinction without a difference.  Equitable
compensation for breach of the
duty of skill and care resembles common law damages in that it is awarded by
way of compensation to
the plaintiff for his loss.  There is no reason in
principle why the common law rules of causation, remoteness of damage and
measure
of damages should not be applied by analogy in such a case  It should
not be confused with equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary
duty, which
may be awarded in lieu of rescission or specific restitution.</i>
<P>

<i>This leaves those duties which are special to fiduciaries and which attract
those remedies which are peculiar to the equitable jurisdiction
and are
primarily restitutionary or restorative rather than compensatory.  A fiduciary
is someone who has undertaken to act for or
on behalf of another in a
particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust
and confidence.  The distinguishing
obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation
of loyalty.  The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his
fiduciary.
 This core liability has several facets.  A fiduciary must act in
good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must
not place
himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not
act for his own benefit or the benefit of
a third person without the informed
consent of his principal.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but
it is sufficient
to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations.  They are the
defining characteristics of the fiduciary.  As Dr Finn pointed out
in his
classic work </i><b>Fiduciary</b> <b>Obligations</b><i> (1977), p.2, he is not
subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is because he is
subject to them that he is
a fiduciary...</i>
<P>

<i>The nature of the obligation determines the nature of the breach.  The
various obligations of a fiduciary merely reflect different
aspects of his core
duties of loyalty and fidelity.  Breach of fiduciary obligation, therefore,
connotes disloyalty or infidelity.
 Mere incompetence is not enough.  A servant
who loyally does his incompetent best for his master is not unfaithful and is
not guilty
of a breach of fiduciary duty."</i>
<P>

95  	In Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, <b>Equity:  Doctrine and<u>
</u>Remedies</b> (3rd ed 1992) at 131 the following passage appears:-
<P>

<i>"To say that a relationship is fiduciary is not - usually, at least - to
provide a complete description of the legal nature of the
relationship.
Aspects of it may be governed by statute, common law principles - contract or
tort - or other equitable rules which
have nothing to do with fiduciary
principles.  Thus a trustee's duty to exercise reasonable care, though
equitable, is not specifically
a fiduciary obligation.  More obviously, the
relationship between partners or between agent and principal is contractual as
well
as fiduciary, between an employer and an employee there is a contract of
employment as well as a fiduciary relationship;  a solicitor
occupies a
fiduciary position vis-&agrave;-vis his client, but also owes his client duties
arising out of the contract of retainer
and under the law of tort (he has a
duty of care in giving advice not because the purpose of the relationship may
be described as
the furtherance of the client's interests, but because his
contract with his client and the law of tort both impose such a duty on
him)."</i>
<P>

96  	And in <b>Chan v Zachariah</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2054%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 54 CLR 178</a> AT 198-9 Deane
J held as follows:
<P>

<i>"There is a wide variety of formulations, of the general principle of equity
requiring a person in a fiduciary relationship to account
for personal benefit
or gain...[these variations] are largely the result of the fact that what is
conveniently regarded as the one
`fundamental rule' embodies two themes.  The
first is that which appropriates for the benefit of the person to whom the
fiduciary
duty is owed any benefit or gain obtained or received by the
fiduciary in circumstances where there existed a conflict of personal
interest
and fiduciary duty or a significant possibility of such conflict: the objective
is to preclude the fiduciary from being
swayed by considerations of personal
interest.  The second is that which requires the fiduciary to account for any
benefit or gain
obtained or received by reason or by use of his fiduciary
position or of opportunity or knowledge resulting from it:  the objective
is to
preclude the fiduciary from actually misusing his position for his personal
advantage.  Notwithstanding authoritative statements
to the effect that the
`use of fiduciary position' doctrine (see, e.g., Phipps v Boardman, NZ
Netherlands Society `Oranje' Inc v
Kuys), the two themes, while overlapping,
are distinct.  Neither theme fully comprehends the other and a formulation of
the principle
by reference to one only of them will be incomplete.  Stated
comprehensively in terms of the liability to account, the principle
of equity
is that a person who is under a fiduciary obligation must account to the person
to whom the duty is owed for any benefit
or gain (i) which has been obtained or
received in circumstances where a conflict or significant possibility of
conflict existed
between his fiduciary duty and his personal interest in the
pursuit or possible receipt of such a benefit or gain or (ii) which was
obtained or received by use or by reason of his fiduciary position or of
opportunity or knowledge resulting from it."</i>

463-467 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.
<P>

98  	The application of these principles to the circumstances of the
present case, leads, in my opinion, to the conclusion expressed
above that the
alleged duty of care here being considered was not fiduciary in its nature.
<P>

<u>Alleged Consent to Breach of Alleged Fiduciary Duty</u>
<P>

99  	On the assumption, contrary to my view, that there was a
fiduciary duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiff which was substantially
co-extensive with the duty in tort owed by the defendants to the plaintiff, it
was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
plaintiff had, in effect,
consented to the alleged breach of that fiduciary duty by reason of her having
been informed by Ms Law
of the details of the investment with BCC some time
after that investment had been made and before any loss was incurred.
<P>

100  	In my opinion however, any consent which might have been given
by the plaintiff, in this way, by implication or otherwise,
was not fully
informed, and therefore not legally effective, by reason of the fact that she
was informed, as I have found, only of
the term and rate of interest of the
investment with BCC, and was not informed at any relevant time prior to the
loss being incurred,
either of the identity of BCC, or of the investment risk
involved in investing with that entity.
<P>

<u>Duty of Care in Tort</u>
<P>

101  	As stated above, it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff
that, in all the circumstances of the present case, there came
into existence a
duty in tort owed by the defendants to the plaintiff to advise the plaintiff of
the nature of the proposed investment
or reinvestment (including the investment
risk involved) prior to the investment or reinvestment being made.
<P>

102  	Although described in the Outline of Plaintiff's submissions as
"a duty of care to advise the Plaintiff of the nature of the
investment into
which they proposed to deposit or invest the proceeds of the Settlement
Cheques", the duty contended for on behalf
of the plaintiff is, in substance a
positive duty to advise, in the sense of "inform", rather than "a duty t take
care to advise".
 I also note in passing that, as stated earlier, although it
was conceded on behalf of the defendants in the "Defendants' Written
Submissions" that the defendants "owed a duty of care in making that
investment, it is not alleged on behalf of the plaintiff that
there has been
any breach by the defendants of that duty of care."
<P>

103  	As also stated above, I am of the opinion that this submission
should be upheld.  In my opinion, many of the hallmarks of
the coming into
existence of a duty of care in tort are present in the circumstances of the
present case having regard, inter alia,
to the past and present relationship
between the parties and to the course of prior dealings between them referred
to above, including
reasonable foreseeability of loss to the plaintiff, a
relationship of proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant, assumption
of responsibility on the part of the defendants in accepting the plaintiff's
instructions, reliance (and vulnerability) by the plaintiff
on the defendants
and the absence of any reasons of public policy for holding that a duty of care
does not exist.
<P>

104  	Against this background, the plaintiff's instructions to the
defendants to invest her funds, cannot, in my opinion, be construed
as giving
the defendants a completely unfettered discretion as to choice of investments,
particularly as the plaintiff had previously
made clear to Mr Kwok that her
financial and marital position was such that any investment made on her behalf
should not involve
any risk of loss.  It is therefore plain, in my opinion,
that the plaintiff's instructions must be construed as having been to the
effect that her funds were to be invested in an interest-bearing investment
which did not involve any risk of loss, and as having
been accepted by the
defendants on that basis. 
<P>

105  	Further, in my opinion, against that background, and
notwithstanding that the plaintiff gave evidence that she did not expect
subjectively to receive any recommendation, the plaintiff's instructions
implied that the defendants would make a recommendation
to the plaintiff in
respect of any investment proposed to be made by them prior to the investment
being made and that any such recommendation
would include information as to
investment risk, so that the plaintiff could be satisfied that the proposed
investment met her known
requirements before the investment was made.
(Previous investments made by the defendants for the plaintiff had been
preceded by
such recommendations from Mr Kwok and it appears, prima facie, that
all previous investments conformed to the plaintiff's requirements.)
 Without
information as to investment risk and other details of the proposed investment,
the plaintiff's decision to approve or disapprove
the proposed investment could
not be an informed decision.
<P>

106  	In my further opinion, the acceptance by the defendants of the
instructions of the plaintiff against this background involved
an assumption of
responsibility by the defendants to act accordingly, a course which simple
prudence and concern for the best interests
of the plaintiff would have
dictated in any event.
<P>

107  	Against this background it was, in my opinion, also
foreseeable, in my opinion, that, despite the plaintiff's relative lack
of
experience in business matters, if the plaintiff was not given the opportunity
to make an informed choice, the proposed investment
might not satisfy the
plaintiff's view of her own requirements, and might, accordingly, result in
loss. 
<P>

108  	It was certainly Mr Kwok's view in all the circumstances that
he should discuss any proposed investment with his client before
making the
investment to make sure the client understood the investment, including the
relative risk of the proposed investment compared
with other available
short-term deposit investments.
<P>

109  	This was made clear in the following passages from Mr Kwok's
cross-examination:-
<P>

<i>"Q.  In addition to undertaking enquiries as to what might be available in
the market, and forming an assessment as to relevant matters
of risk, you would
also make it your business, wouldn't you, to discuss the proposed investment
with your client before it was made,
wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.:  I would.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Because at the end of the day when you made an investment on behalf of a
client, you wanted to make sure that the client understood
the investment that
you were making, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  And that explanation would include, wouldn't it, an explanation of the
relative risk of the investment that you were proposing,
compared with other
available short-term deposit investments, wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes. ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  What did you mean when you said that neither you or PKB had standing
instructions in relation to Mrs Yu's investments?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Pre-arranged.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.   So do I take it that it was therefore necessary prior to an investment
that PKB or you made on Mrs Yu's behalf, for you to obtains
specific
instructions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Was it your understanding that before your firm placed Mrs Yu's funds on
deposit with BCC, it would have been necessary for someone
from your firm to
have obtained instructions from Mrs Yu to do that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Consistent with your understanding would it be necessary for your office
to confirm with her the suggested investment before the
investment was
made?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  If Mrs Yu did it in Sydney, would it be necessary for your office to
confirm with her, according to your understanding, before
the investment was
made with a particular financial institution?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Before - yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  And if it was Mrs Yu's solicitor saying that it was Mrs Yu's instruction
to place it on short-term deposit without specifying
where, is it your
understanding that your office would have to confirm with Mrs Yu the identity
of the proposed investment before
making the investment?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  It was your understanding, wasn't it, that prior to each roll over of
Mrs Yu's investment with BCC, it would be necessary for
somebody from your
office to confirm with Mrs Yu that that roll over was appropriate?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  And you would also expect, to the extent that there was any developments
in the market, that it may well be necessary prior to
each roll over, to
provide an explanation to Mrs Yu of the investment risk of keeping funds with
BCC?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes."</i>

in tort include
the following:

<u>Public Policy</u>
<P>

<i>`Inevitably, the policy considerations which are legitimately taken into
account in determining whether sufficient proximity exists
in a novel category
will be influenced by the courts' assessment of community standards and
demands.</i>
<P>

<i>One policy consideration which may militate against recognition of a
relationship of proximity in a category of case involving mere
economic loss is
the law's concern to avoid the imposition of liability "in an indeterminate
amount for an indeterminate time to
an indeterminate class".  Another
consideration is the perception that, in a competitive world where one person's
economic gain is
commonly another's loss, a duty to take reasonable care to
avoid causing mere economic loss to another, as distinct from physical
injury
to another's person or property, may be inconsistent with community standards
in relation to what is ordinarily legitimate
in pursuit of personal advantage.
The combined effect of those two distinct policy considerations is that the
categories of case
in which the requisite relationship of proximity with
respect to mere economic loss is to be found are properly to be seen as
special.
 Commonly, but not necessarily, they will involve an identified
element of known reliance (or dependence) or the assumption of responsibility
or a combination of the two.':  Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609 at 618-19

<P>

<i>`Questions of legal policy, reflecting the need sometimes to limit the
imposition of a duty of care to that which is fair and reasonable,
have also
been recognised by this Court.  Although this last consideration is sometimes
overlooked, it should not be, for the law
of negligence must ultimately respond
to common notions of fairness and justice.  If foreseeability and proximity,
alone, take the
law into the imposition of duties of care which are unfair,
unreasonable and unrealistic, the time will have come to re-express the
preconditions for the existence of the duty in a way more harmonious to such
considerations.':  Romeo v Conservation Commission of

111  	The most recent decision of the High Court<b> Perre v Apand Pty
Ltd</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 36</a> (12 August 1999) includes the following passages:
<P>

<i>`It may well be that, at this stage, the notion of proximity can serve no
purpose beyond signifying that it is necessary to identify
a factor or factors
of special significance in addition to the foreseeability of harm before the
law will impose liability for the
negligent infliction of economic loss.' (para
27) per Gaudron J.</i>
<P>

<i>`...[T]he ultimate issue is always whether the defendant in pursuing a
course of conduct which would have prevented injury to the
plaintiff, or
failing to pursue a course of conduct that caused injury to the plaintiff,
should have had the interest or interests
of the plaintiff in contemplation
before he or she pursued or failed to pursue that course of conduct...If the
defendant should have
had those interests in mind, the law will impose a duty
of care.  If not, the law will not impose a duty.' (para 100) per McHugh
J.</i>
<P>

<i>`The principles concerned with reasonable foreseeability of loss,
indeterminacy of liability, autonomy of the individual, vulnerability
to risk
and the defendant's knowledge of the risk and its magnitude are, I think,
relevant in determining whether a duty exists in
all cases of liability for
economic loss.' (para 105) per McHugh J.</i>
<P>

<i>`In my view, reliance and assumption of responsibility are merely indicators
of the plaintiff's vulnerability to harm from the defendant's
conduct, and it
is the concept of vulnerability rather than these evidentiary indicators which
is the relevant criterion for determining
whether a duty of care exists.' (para
125) per McHugh J.</i>
<P>

<i>`Reliance may therefore be seen - for the purposes of duty of care - as an
indicator of vulnerability:  the plaintiff is especially
vulnerable to the
words and/or conduct of the defendant because he or she reasonably relied on
the defendant...'  (para 126) per
McHugh J.</i>
<P>

<i>`The emergency of a coherent body of precedents will be impeded, not
assisted, by the imposition of  fixed system of categories in
which damages in
negligence for economic loss may be recovered.' (para 200) per Gummow J.</i>
<P>

<i>`I turn now to a consideration of the factors which in combination I think
relevant in this case and which establish a sufficient
degree of proximity,
foreseeability, a special relationship, determinacy of a relatively small
class, a large measure of control
on the part of the respondent, and special
circumstances justifying the compensation of the appellants for their losses.'
(para 406)
per Callinan J.</i>
<P>

112  	As to reasonable foreseeability, in my opinion it was
reasonably foreseeable by a reasonable person in the position of the
defendants, and, indeed, by the defendants themselves, that if they did not
advise (inform) the plaintiff of the nature of the investment
(and of any
reinvestment) they proposed to make on her behalf, including the investment
risk involved, prior to the investment (or
reinvestment) being made (all
previous investments of the plaintiff had been made pursuant to a prior
recommendation by Mr Kwok),
the plaintiff would be deprived of the opportunity
of deciding for herself  (albeit after receiving information, inter alia, as to
the investment risk involved) whether or not the proposed investment or
reinvestment was acceptable for her purposes.  The loss of
that opportunity
might well result in an investment being made on behalf of the plaintiff which
was unacceptable to the plaintiff
and which might ultimately cause loss to the
plaintiff.
<P>

113  	In this respect the evidence establishes that if the plaintiff
had been told that the funds were to be invested with BCC she
would not have
consented.  The relevant passages in the cross-examination of the plaintiff
include the following:-
<P>

<i>"Q.	If Mr Kwok or Grace Law recommended that you invest the proceeds with
BCC you would probably have done as they suggested, wouldn't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't think so because I don't want to.  I don't know what is
BCC.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If they had told you that BCC was part of Bank Credit Commercial you
would have known what that meant, wouldn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  To my mind I only knew about Westpac.  I have been dealing with
Westpac since I moved to Australia in 1978 so I only know
Westpac.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You don't know anything about Capita Finance do you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  But he told me that is a very good insurance bond and very
safe.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you know anything about MLC before you invested the money in
that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, but I rely upon Mr Kwok's advice.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the advice of Mr Kwok which you relied on was that you should invest
moneys there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There or MILC.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It's probable then, isn't it, that if you had been advised to invest
moneys with BCC Australia, you would have done so?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't think I will because it's a lot of money and when I invest with
MLC it is only about $45,000 but this is nearly half a
million dollars.  I
don't think I would put it in BCC."</i>
<P>

114  	In my opinion, there was also, in the present case, a
sufficient relationship of proximity in relation to the matters here
being
considered, having regard, inter alia, to the past and present relationship of
the parties and the course of prior dealings
between them to which reference
has been made above.
<P>

115  	There was also, in my opinion, arising from the same
circumstances, an assumption of responsibility by the defendants upon
their
acceptance of the plaintiff's instructions, together with, inter alia, Mr
Kwok's knowledge from past experience of the plaintiff's
requirements in
relation to investments, to advise (inform) the plaintiff of the nature of the
proposed investment including the
investment risk involved, prior to the
investment being made (in accordance with past practice) and a reliance by the
plaintiff (again
in accordance with past practice) who was relatively
inexperienced in business matters (and thus vulnerable) upon the defendants
to
do this.  Moreover, in my opinion, there are no reasons of public policy, in
the particular circumstances of the present case,
why it should be held that
such a duty of care does not exist. [There is also the consideration that Mr
Kwok gave the evidence quoted
above to the effect that it was consistent with
his understanding that the defendants should confirm with the plaintiff the
proposed
investment before any investment was made.  This was consistent with
the course of previous dealings between the parties and would
have engendered
in the plaintiff an expectation that that would be done in the present case:
see and cf <b><i>Belsand Pty Ltd v Bridgewater Securities Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955)
Aust Torts  R  81-353</a>; <b><i>Turner v Belsand Pty Ltd </i></b>(unreported, Fed
Ct (Full Ct), 10 July 1997].  
<P>

116  	In all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the
defendants were subject to a duty of care in tort owed to the plaintiff
to
advise (inform) the plaintiff of the nature of any proposed investment,
including the investment risk involved, as well as the
identity of the deposit
taker, prior to the investment being made or renewed.
<P>

117  	This conclusion is also consistent with the authorities dealing
with the duties of gratuitous agents, although those authorities
deal with such
duties at a higher level of generality.  Thus Article 44 in Reynolds,
<b><i>Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</i></b> (16th ed - 1996) at paragraphs
6-025 is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>	     "LIABILITY OF GRATUITOUS AGENTS</i>
<P>

<i>A gratuitous agent will be liable to his principal if in carrying out the
work he fails to exercise the degree of care which may reasonably
be expected
of him in all the circumstances."</i><b><cite> </cite></b><i> </i>
<P>

118  	Further, as stated above, I am also of the opinion that a
non-fiduciary equitable duty to the same effect came into existence
between the
parties arising from the fiduciary relationship between the parties and
including the whole of their past and present
professional and personal
relationship and the course of prior  dealings between them.  Those
circumstances, in my opinion, plainly
gave rise to an equitable (although not
fiduciary) duty owed by the defendants to use their best endeavours to protect
and advance
the interests of the plaintiff, having regard, in particular, to
her known requirements in relation to investments.  In the context
of all the
relevant circumstances and, in particular, the course of prior dealings between
the parties, that objective and that equitable
duty, in my opinion, also
required the defendants to advise (inform) the plaintiff of the nature
(details) of the proposed investment,
including the investment risk involved,
prior to the investment being made or renewed so as to give the opportunity to
the plaintiff
to finally approve or not the proposed investment.  However,
whether or not any such non-fiduciary equitable duty arose, the result
of the
present proceedings for the plaintiff remains the same (see later).
<P>

<u>Standard of Care</u>
<P>

119  	The precise matters relevant to investment risk which it was
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff should have been brought
to the attention
of the plaintiff by the defendants were as follows, as set out in paragraph 32
of the Outline of Plaintiff's Submissions:-
<P>

<i>"32.	In breach of that duty of care, the Defendants failed to advise the
Plaintiff that they proposed to invest the Settlement Cheques
with BCC, and in
particular failed to advise the Plaintiff prior to the initial investment and
each subsequent monthly rollover that
(Joyner pages 4-5):</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	BCC was part of the unofficial money market and accepted deposits only
on an unsecured basis with no government or Reserve Bank
support likely in the
event of its failure to meet client withdrawal requests;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the risks associated with investing with BCC on a unsecured basis were
significantly higher than the risks with other short term
investments
available;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	BCC was a relatively small player on the money market with individual
customer deposits of less than $50 million and therefore
a substantial deposit
of over $500,000 by Mrs Yu, representing in excess of 1% of overall non-bank
deposits, would exceed reasonable
prudential limits for a single investment;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	there had been some articles in the press relating primarily to some
problems with the overseas parent company of BCC which might
necessitate
further research into its financial security before making any substantial
individual deposit."</i>
<P>

120  	This submission, in my opinion, relates in substance, to the
standard of care relevant to the discharge of that part of the
general duty of
care in tort that required the defendants to advise the plaintiff of the
investment risk involved in the proposed
investment with BCC.
<P>

121  	This submission was sought to be supported on behalf of the
plaintiff by allegedly "expert" evidence from a financial adviser,
Mr A R
Joyner, who made an affidavit to the effect, inter alia, that a licensed
investment adviser, or other professional persons
(presumably not being
licensed investment advisers) who provide investment recommendations or
suggestions to clients incidental to
their profession, in the position of the
defendants, would be acting unreasonably if they failed to bring the above
matters to the
plaintiff's attention prior to investing or depositing the
plaintiff's funds with BCC.
<P>

122  	Presumably Mr Joyner was intending to convey, at least by
implication that, on the stated assumptions contained in his report,
the
defendants would be acting unreasonably if they failed to bring these matters
to the attention of the plaintiff, because it was
the practice amongst the
class of persons he identified, to "always fully research and explain the
nature of the investment being
recommended."  I say by implication, because Mr
Joyner's report was not expressed in terms of what his opinion was in relation
to
any such practice, but rather was expressed in terms that it would be
unreasonable for the identified class of persons in the position
of the
defendants to act otherwise, the implication being that it was the practice of
such persons to act reasonably.
<P>

123  	In my opinion, appropriate evidence of a relevant practice
existing amongst accountants giving investment advice to clients
in comparable
circumstances, if there was such a practice, if the circumstances were truly
comparable, and if it could be established
that the practice was general, would
be admissible both in relation to the initial question whether a duty of care
existed and also
as to the relevant standard of care.  However, in my opinion,
Mr Joyner's evidence was not sufficient to establish the existence
of a general
practice of the kind sought to be relied upon by the plaintiff if that is what
he was, by implication, seeking to do.
 In my opinion, although I am satisfied
that Mr Joyner had some knowledge and experience of the investment advice that
some accountants
give or gave to some of their clients, I am by no means
persuaded that his experience is sufficiently wide to enable him to express
a
useful opinion as to what is or was the general practice in relation to all
such accountants and clients.
<P>

124  	Moreover, I am, in any event, of the opinion that the
relationship between such accountants and their clients is very likely
to
depend on the particular circumstances of the particular case so as to make it
unwise to attempt to generalise about such matters.
 Relevant, for example,
would be the degree of business acumen and experience of the client and the
accountant's knowledge of the
client's requirements, as well as any particular
circumstances that may exist.  In the final analysis I am accordingly unable to
attribute any relevant weight to Mr Joyner's opinion on either the issue of the
existence of a duty of care or the standard of care
involved in any such duty
in the particular circumstances of this particular case.
<P>

125  	For the same reasons I am also unable to attribute any relevant
weight to Mr. Joyner's opinion to the extent to which his
opinion was tendered
as being relevant to the claim by the defendants for relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of
the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a>.</i></b>
<P>

126  	Mr P M Simpson, a financial consultant, was called on behalf of
the defendants to give "expert" evidence to the effect that
on the various
assumptions set out in his report, the defendants had acted "reasonably" in
placing the funds of the plaintiff with
BCC.  His conclusion at the end of his
report was expressed as follows:- 
<P>

<i>"I conclude, on the assumption that the defendants had an absolute
discretion as to where to invest the funds, that at the relevant
time in 1990,
given the circumstances and facts existing at that time which were known as
</i><cite>ought to have been known</cite><i> by the defendants, the placement
of the funds on short term deposit with BCC was `reasonable' ".  (underlining
supplied)</i>
<P>

127  	In my opinion, Mr. Joyner's first assumption is not in
accordance with the facts in that, in my opinion, the defendants did
not, in
the present case, for all the reasons discussed above, have an absolute
discretion as to where to invest the plaintiff's
funds.
<P>

128  	Further, it is clear that, not ignoring his oral evidence, Mr
Kwok was unaware of many of the facts relating to BCC , as set
out in Mr
Simpson's report, that Mr Simpson says he (Mr Kwok) "ought to have been aware
of".   What Mr Kwok first said about his
reasons for the investment of the
plaintiff's funds with BCC Australia is contained in paragraph 17 of his
affidavit of 2 June 1998
which is in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"PKB had arranged for the investment of two other client's funds with BCC
Australia in May and July 1990.  It was not my general practice
to recommend to
clients that they invest in non-local banks when they were local clients but in
view of the fact that BCC were offering
a good interest rate for deposits at 24
hour call within the range of rates being offered by other banks and other
deposits taken
at the time, and since I had no reason to believe or suspect
that BCC might be in financial difficulties, I believed that BCC was
a
relatively safe and appropriate investment."</i>
<P>

129  	Moreover, Mr Simpson did not, even by implication, purport in
his report to give evidence of any general practice amongst
accountants who
gave investment advice as incidental to the practice of their profession, but
rather was retained as he stated in
his report, as was Mr Joyner, to provide
his "opinion based on my experience as a banker, as to whether, on the
assumptions listed
below at the relevant time in November 1990, given the
circumstances and facts existing at that time and which were known or ought
to
have been known by the defendants at that same time, the placement of the
deposits by the defendants with BCC `reasonable'."
<P>

130  	Most significantly, however, the question which Mr Simpson was
asked to address was not the question which is relevant for
present purposes,
namely, the question whether it was reasonable for the defendants to invest the
plaintiff's moneys with BCC without
first advising (informing) her of the
nature and details of the proposed investment (including the investment risk
involved).  The
question addressed by Mr Simpson was whether in the assumed
circumstances it was reasonable for the defendants to deposit the plaintiff's
funds with BCC, quite apart from any question of whether they should first have
advised the plaintiff of the nature of the proposed
investment (including the
investment risk involved).  Nor, in my opinion, was the correct question
relevantly addressed by Mr Simpson
in his oral evidence.
<P>

131  	By contrast, although Mr Joyner and Mr Simpson were asked to
express their opinion on the same question, only Mr Joyner's
opinion purported
to deal with the relevant question as to whether the defendants should have
advised the plaintiff the nature of
the proposed investment with BCC (including
the investment risk involved) before that investment was made (notwithstanding
that I
consider, as stated above, that I am unable to give that opinion any
weight for present purposes).
<P>

132  	And in this connection I note that although most of the
material contained under the heading "Factual Assumptions" in Mr Joyner's
report, is also contained under the heading "Factual Background" in Mr
Simpson's report, Mr Joyner's "Factual Assumptions" include
and Mr Simpson's
"Factual Background" does not include, the following paragraph:-
<P>

<i>"9.	The nature of the investments being made and the possible risks
associated with the investments was not explained by PKB to Mrs
Yu prior to or
at the time of the placement of the moneys with BCC."</i>
<P>

133  	In all the circumstances, and as was the case with Mr Joyner, I
am unable to attribute any relevant weight to Mr Simpson's
evidence on either
the issue of the existence of a duty of care or the standard of care involved
in any such duty in the particular
circumstances of this particular case, or on
the issue as to the claim by the defendants for relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a>.</b>
<P>

134  	In my opinion, however, it is unnecessary to formulate the
precise content of what the relevant standard of care required
the defendants
to advise the plaintiff in relation to investment risk in the present case
since the defendants made no attempt to
so advise the plaintiff.  It is
sufficient for present purposes to observe that the formulation of the terms of
the relevant duty
of care in effect required the defendants to give the
plaintiff information as to the investment risk involved in the investment
of
the plaintiff's funds with BCC, and that such information should have had
regard to the plaintiff's requirements, known to Mr
Kwok from the course of
prior dealings, that any investment on her behalf should be safe and secure and
not involve any risk of loss.
 The relevant standard of care would, in my
opinion, require at the very least that such information should include the
giving to
the plaintiff of details as to the relative degrees of risk as
between various investments at interest, although not necessarily
the whole of
the information which the plaintiff submits should have been given.  As no
information of any kind relevant to investment
risk was given by the defendants
to the plaintiff at any relevant time, it follows that the defendants were in
breach in this respect
of their general duty of care without it being
necessary, as stated above, to determine with any precision the standard of
care relevant
to discharge the duty of care owed by the defendants.
<P>

135  	The standard of care required to discharge the  duty of care
owed by the defendants also required, in my opinion, the defendants
to give
other details of the proposed investment to the plaintiff including, at least,
the identity of the deposit taker as well
as the term of the deposit and the
interest rate.
<P>

<u>Breach of Duty of Care</u>
<P>

136  	In my opinion, as stated above, the defendants committed
breaches of their duty of care, in failing to advise (inform) the
plaintiff of
the nature of the proposed investment with BCC including the investment risk
involved prior to the investment being
made or renewed.  Notwithstanding that I
have found that Ms Law did inform the plaintiff that her funds had been
invested at interest
for a certain term and at a certain rate of interest
(although without informing her of the identity of BCC or the investment risk
involved).  In my further opinion, as stated above, if the defendants had
informed the plaintiff of the proposed investment with
BCC and the investment
risk involved, prior to the investment being made or renewed, the plaintiff
would not have approved it and
thus not suffered the loss she in fact suffered.
The relevant passages from the cross-examination of the plaintiff have been
quoted
above.
<P>

137  	It follows in my opinion that the breach of their duty of care
by the defendants was relevantly causative of the plaintiff's
loss.
<P>

<u>Contributory Negligence</u>
<P>

138  	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
plaintiff, by her own negligence, inter alia, in failing to inquire
as to the
details of the investment made on her behalf by the defendants, beyond what she
had been told by Ms Law, contributed to
the loss she sustained and that the
plaintiff's damages should be reduced accordingly.  In my opinion, if the
plaintiff had made
such an inquiry of the defendants she would have been
informed of the identity of BCC and may well also have been informed of the
investment risk involved in investing with that entity and in either case would
have required her funds to be withdrawn and deposited
elsewhere, thereby
avoiding the loss she sustained.
<P>

139  	It is true that the plaintiff had other concerns during the
relevant period, not least of all serious concerns in respect
of her health,
but the evidence establishes that those concerns did not make business and
social activity impossible.  Moreover she
knew or ought to have known, from her
Westpac bank statements that her funds had not been deposited to the credit of
her Westpac
cheque account.  The plaintiff also gave evidence to the effect
that she expected that her funds would have been invested in a Westpac
term
deposit but she received no documents from Westpac confirming this.  On the
other hand it was not in my opinion, unreasonable
for her to assume that any
such documents had been sent only to the defendants.  In my opinion,
nevertheless, if the plaintiff had
acted reasonably to protect her own
interests, especially having regard to the relatively large sum of money
involved, she would
have sought further details of how the funds had been
invested including details of the investment risk involved before she suffered
any loss and the probability is that she would have directed that her funds be
withdrawn from BCC before sustaining any loss.
<P>

140  	On the other hand, although the defendants informed the
plaintiff of the term and rate of interest payable in respect of her
investment, they were in breach of their duty in failing to inform her of the
identity of BCC and of the investment risk involved
in investing with that
entity.  That failure was in my opinion, a much more significant cause of the
plaintiff's loss having regard,
in particular, to the professional and personal
relationship between the parties, to the relatively large sum involved, to the
course
of prior dealings between the parties in the course of which the
plaintiff had been informed of the details of any proposed investment,
including the investment risk involved, prior to the investment being made, and
to the fact that the deposit was unsecured, all in
a context in which the
defendants were aware through Mr Kwok of the plaintiff's requirement that any
investment made on her behalf
should be safe and secure and not involve any
risk of loss.
<P>

141  	In all the circumstances I am of the opinion that the plaintiff
should be regarded as being responsible as to 15% for the
loss she sustained as
a result of the breach by the defendants of their duty to her.
<P>

<u>Alleged Breach of Trust under<b> </b></u><b><cite><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act
1925</a></cite></b>
<P>

142  	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the defendants
were trustees of the funds of the plaintiff within the meaning
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee
Act, 1925</a> and were accordingly limited to investing those funds in investments
authorised by or under that Act.  As it was common ground that
an investment
with BCC was not an investment authorised by or under that Act, it followed
that the defendants had committed breaches
of trust in so investing the funds
of the plaintiff and were liable accordingly.
<P>

143  	In my opinion, however, as stated earlier, whilst it is
undoubtedly true that the plaintiff's funds were held by the defendants
on
trust for the plaintiff while those funds were held in the trust account of the
defendants and, indeed, whilst they were deposited
with BCC in the defendants'
name, it is plain from the past and present relationship between the parties
and from the course of prior
dealings between them, and from the terms of the
instructions given by Ms McAlpine to Ms Law, which contained no limitation as
to
any particular investments at interest, that the defendants were not, nor
was it the plaintiff's intention that they should be, limited
to making
investments, on behalf of the plaintiff, which were authorised by or under that
Act.  There was accordingly, in my opinion
no breach by the defendants of any
duty to invest the plaintiff's funds only in investments authorised by or under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act, 1925</a>.

<u>Claim for Relief Under the<b> </b></u><b><cite><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act, 1925</a></cite><u>
</u></b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Section 85)</a></u>
<P>

144  	In my opinion, the defendants in the present case are not
guilty of any breach of any duty in respect of which they were acting
as
trustees within the meaning of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act, 1925</a>.  Rather, in my opinion,
the breach which, in my opinion, the defendants committed in the present case
was the breach of a duty in
tort as described earlier.
<P>

145  	However, to the extent to which, contrary to my view, the
defendants may be eligible to claim relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act,
1925</a>, I am of the opinion that they are not entitled to any such relief by
reason of the fact that they did not, in my opinion, act reasonably,
although
it is common ground that they acted honestly.
<P>

146  	In my opinion, in all the circumstances of the present case,
including, inter alia, in particular, the past and present professional
and
personal relationship between the parties, the course of prior dealings between
them in the course of which the plaintiff had
been provided with details of any
proposed investment, including the investment risk involved prior to the
investment being made,
the relatively large sum of money involved, and the fact
that the investment with BCC was unsecured, all in a context in which the
defendants, through Mr Kwok were aware of the requirement of the plaintiff that
any investment made by them on her behalf should
be safe and secure and not
involve any risk of loss, the defendants did not act reasonably in failing to
inform the plaintiff of
any details of the investment with BCC, including
details of the investment risk involved, prior to the loss being incurred,
beyond
informing her, through Ms Law, of the term and interest rate applicable
to the investment.
<P>

147  	Having regard to all these considerations it would have been
reasonable for the defendants to advise (inform) the plaintiff
of the nature of
the proposed investment, including the investment risk involved, prior to
investing and renewing the investment
of the plaintiff's funds with BCC.  The
failure of the defendants to act reasonably in this way, disentitles the
defendants, in my
opinion, to any relief to which they might otherwise have
been entitled pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a>.  I add that I have
also had regard in reaching this conclusion to the conduct of the defendants,
including in particular, the conduct
of Mr Kwok, in failing to inform the
plaintiff immediately of any adverse newspaper publicity concerning BCC of
which he became aware,
in failing to inform the plaintiff immediately of the
appointment of a provisional liquidator to BCC and in failing to take care
in
the selection of BCC as an investment suitable to the plaintiff's requirements.
The relevant passages from Mr Kwok's cross-examination
include the following at
T335:-
<P>

<i>"Q.  And investments in the unofficial or secondary market were the most
risky</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  And BCC fell into the category of unofficial or secondary market, didn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Do you recall in November 1990, speaking to anybody in your office about
how your firm come to deposit over half a million dollars
on trust for Mrs. Yu
with BCC?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Not that I can remember.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Do you remember having any discussion in December 1990 about that with
any person in your office?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  No ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  So, is your evidence that you can't remember ever talking to anybody in
your office about Mrs. Yu's investment with BCC at any
time, at least proper to
November 1991?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  When you say `Yes", you mean you cannot remember any such
discussion?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  I cannot remember such a discussion ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Because it wasn't a systematic part of your practice to read in detail
the financial press every day for the purpose of obtaining
comfort about the
investments that you might recommend to your clients from time to time, was
it</i>
<P>

<i>A.  It wasn't ...</i>
<P>

148  	(See also the passage from Mr. Kwok's affidavit quoted
earlier.)
<P>

<i>Q.  So the fact is, you made no enquiries to satisfy yourself that BCC
remained a safe investment for Mrs. Yu at any time in the period
between late
November 1990 and the appointment of the provisional liquidator on 8 July 1991,
did you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  I did.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  What enquiries did you make?</i>
<P>

<i>A. I haven't got a recollection of that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  How do you know that you made enquiries then?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  I must have done something, but I can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Did you speak to anybody else in your office about whether or not you
should tell Mrs. Yu that a provisional liquidator had been
appointed to
BCC?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  So it was solely your decision not to tell Mrs. Yu until November
1991?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  If not November 1991, it could have been earlier if I had made the trip
(earlier).</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  There was nothing to stop you ringing Mrs. Yu, was there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  There wasn't."</i>
<P>

149  	Nor did Mrs Law take care in the selection of BCC as an
investment suitable to the plaintiff's requirements as the following
parts of
her cross-examination reveal:-
<P>

<i>"Q.  What did you know of BCC prior to your discussion with Nancy Wong on 16
November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Not very much I must admit.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  What was the extent of your knowledge?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Just by name only.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  It's fair to say that an explanation of investment risk to a client of
the firm would be something quite outside your expertise?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  That's right, if it is an investment for the client, but at this time
it's just a short-term deposit, I understand, very short.
 That's you know,
been pointed to me all along, it's just a very short-term deposit ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  So did you understand from that instruction that you could place the
money on short-term deposit with any financial institution
that you
selected?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  No, I didn't think as such, I did go to Nancy Wong for
instructions."</i>
<P>

150  	As stated earlier, it was not in dispute that Ms. Wong had no
expertise in relation to investments.
<P>

<u>Damages</u>
<P>

151  	In my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled to damages to
compensate her for the loss she sustained by reason of the breach by
the
defendants of their duty of care in tort, or, more accurately, the positive
duty owed by them to advise (inform) the plaintiff
of the nature of the
proposed investment of the plaintiff's funds with BCC, including the investment
risk involved, prior to actually
investing or reinvesting those funds with
BCC.
<P>

152  	In my opinion, the relevant measure of damages in the present
case is that amount which will put the plaintiff in the position
that she would
have been in if the breach of duty had not occurred.
<P>

153  	The relevant principles in this connection have been expounded,
inter alia, in the following passages:-
<P>

<i>"...[T]he general principle upon which compensatory damages are assessed,
whether in actions of contract or of tort ... is that the
injured party should
receive compensation in a sum which, so far as money can do, will put him in
the same position as he would have
been in if the contract had been performed
or the tort had not been committed":  <b>Butler v Egg and Egg Pulp
Marketing</b> <b>Board</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20114%20CLR%20185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 114 CLR 185</a> at 191 per Taylor and Owen
JJ.</i>
<P>

<i>"In tort...damages are awarded with the object of placing the plaintiff in a
position in which he would have been had the tort not
been committed...":
<b>Gates v City Mutual</b> <b>Life Assurance Society Ltd</b> (1986) 160 CLR 1
at 12 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ.</i>
<P>

<i>"The settled principle governing the assessment of compensatory damages,
whether in actions of tort or contract, is that the injured
party should
receive compensation in a sum which, so far as money can do, will put that
party in the same position as he or she would
have been in if the contract had
been performed or the tort had not been committed.  Compensation is the
cardinal concept": <b>Haines v Bendall</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%2060" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172 CLR 60</a> at 63 per Mason
CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.</i>
<P>

154  	In my present opinion, if the defendants had not breached their
duty to the plaintiff, they, or the plaintiff, would have
invested the
plaintiff's funds in an interest earning investment which did not, for all
practical purposes, involve any risk of loss
during the period from the receipt
by the defendants of the plaintiff's funds to the date of the plaintiff's first
letter of demand
before commencement of the present proceedings.
<P>

155  	I propose to hear further argument and, as appropriate, further
evidence, as to what interest rate would have been payable
in respect of such
an investment, and generally, but I would have expected the rate to be
something in excess of the rate payable
on short-term Commonwealth bonds and
perhaps of the order of the rate payable in respect of short term deposits with
a major trading
bank such as the Commonwealth Bank, the National Australia Bank
or Westpac.  I would also have expected the interest to be compounded
on say,
monthly rests.
<P>

156  	As from the date of the plaintiff's first letter of demand
before action and until payment, I see no reason why the plaintiff
should not
be entitled to simple interest on the relevant amount of damages, at the lesser
of the prime overdraft bank interest rate
payable from time to time in respect
of commercial loans of approximately $500,000, and the Supreme Court rate
payable from time
to time in respect of judgments.  In my present opinion, the
plaintiff was entitled to be repaid an amount equivalent to the amount
of her
funds together with interest not later than the date of the plaintiff's first
letter of demand and there is, in my opinion,
no reason why the interest
payable thereafter should be at any lesser rate than would be payable in a debt
recovery action.
<P>

157  	It is also the case, in my opinion, that the defendants have
committed breaches of their equitable (but non-fiduciary) duty
of care, that
duty being relevantly co-extensive with their duty in tort, in respect of which
breaches the plaintiff is entitled
to equitable compensation in the nature of
restitution.
<P>

158  	I am, however, of the opinion whether or not any such equitable
duty came into existence, the result in the present case is
the same because in
the present case, the measure of damages for breach of duty in tort is the same
as the measure of equitable compensation
for breach of the relevant equitable
duty namely, that amount which will put the plaintiff in the position in which
she would have
been if there had been no breach of duty.
<P>

159  	The relevant approach in this connection, in the circumstances
of the present case, is that reflected in the relevant paragraph
in the extract
from the judgment of Millett LJ in <b><i>Bristol and West Building Society
v</i><u> </u><i>Mothew</i></b> (supra) which has been quoted above.
<P>

160  	I will direct the entry of judgment in favour of the plaintiff
with costs in due course after the damages or compensation
and interest to
which the plaintiff is entitled have been decided by the Court or by
agreement.
