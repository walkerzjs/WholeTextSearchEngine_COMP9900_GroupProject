<b>3145/99 - RE BABY A</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The first defendant, baby A, was born
on 20 July 1999.  Her mother is the second defendant and her father the third
defendant.  The
birth was actually after the proceedings were commenced.
However, to avoid any doubt as to the applicability of parens patriae
jurisdiction
no orders were made in the proceedings until after the first
defendant's birth.
<P>

2   	The second defendant was born in Peru.  She is now 30 years
of age and has resided in Australia since November 1995.  The third
and second
defendant married in March 1996.
<P>

3   	The second defendant became HIV positive accidently while
working in a hospital in Argentina.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff became concerned about the first defendant
before she was born.  Medical evidence shows that the chances of the
baby of an
HIV positive mother being herself HIV positive is greatly increased if she is
born vaginally and does not take anti HIV
medication or is breast-fed.
<P>

5   	After extensive discussion between the plaintiff's officers
and the second and third defendants the latter eventually agreed
that the baby
have a caesarean birth and be given medication.  Although the second and third
defendants tell the court that the second
defendant does not intend to
breast-feed the first defendant, they declined to consent to an injunction.
<P>

6   	Mr Moore who appeared for the second and third defendants
put to the court that their word was sufficient and they do not want
the sword
of Damocles over their heads.
<P>

7   	Mr Singleton, who appeared for the plaintiff, says an
injunction must be granted in this case.  He says the risk to the first
defendant is so great that the ultimate protection should be given to her.
<P>

8   	At the end of the hearing on 20 July I made orders up to
today so that I could consider the matters of principle that arise.
 When I
reserved I was particularly concerned by the passage in <b>Kerr on
Injunctions</b> 6th ed (Sweet and Maxwell, London, 1927) p 411 that:
<P>

"The Court will not assume that a man means to violate his agreement."
<P>

9   	On further research that proposition is too widely stated.
It is certainly true that a party is not entitled to an injunction
merely
because when asked for an undertaking the defendant declined to give one;
see<b> Cowley (Lord) v Byas</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%205%20Ch%20D%20944" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) 5 Ch D 944.</a>
<P>

10   	The true position is put more precisely by Dr Spry in his
<b>Equitable Remedies</b> 5th ed (LBC, Sydney, 1997) p 382 that:
<P>

"Statements by the defendant of his intention may be of importance, but it must
be remembered that they are merely of evidentiary
value, as tending to show a
sufficient or an insufficient risk of injury, as the case may be, and that
often other evidentiary matters
are present that are of equal or greater
weight."
<P>

11   	In the instant case, I accept that the second and third
defendants currently have the view which they state. However, it is
of concern
that statements have been made in the past as to the second and third
defendants' reliability. Dr Danny Challis reports
that he was endeavouring at a
preliminary stage to convince the second defendant that she should have therapy
and she and the third
defendant agreed to go to the appropriate medical clinic
"but they didn't, so they don't always do what they say they'll do."
<P>

12   	Secondly, the matter of breast-feeding a child is a very
emotive issue and the emotions of a new mother may lead her to do
things which
her head has told her she should not be doing.
<P>

13   	Thirdly, it is very clear that the consequences for the
first defendant should she be breast-fed are extremely serious indeed.
 The
evidence is that unless all the precautions, including no direct
breast-feeding, are carried out babies infected with HIV have
a 20 percent
chance of dying within the first year or two of life and proportions of such
children develop brain damage such that
 normal development is not achieved.
<P>

14   	In tort it is a settled rule that the graver the
consequences the greater is the degree of care that must be taken.  I
paraphrase
<b>Charlesworth on Negligence</b> 7th ed (Sweet and Maxwell, London,
1983) para 6-09.  The statement is well supported by the authorities, in
particular<b> Northwestern Utilities Ltd v London Guarantee and Accident Co
Ltd</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ResJud/1938/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1936] AC 108</a>, 126 and<b> Glasgow Corporation v Muir</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1943/1943_SC_HL_3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1943] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1943%5d%20AC%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1943] AC 448</a>,
456.
<P>

15   	A similar rule applies in Equity when the court is
assessing the evidence as to whether, in all the circumstances, there is
such a
risk of irreparable injury that the grant of an injunction is justified.  The
court always leans towards a fail-safe solution
should it make a wrong decision
in granting an injunction, and the risk of grievous injury is one of the
matters that the court takes
into account; see eg <b>Films Rover International
Ltd v Cannon Film Sales Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20WLR%20670" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 WLR 670</a>, 680 and<b> R v Transport
Secretary; Ex parte Factortame Ltd (No 2)</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] UKHL 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20AC%20603" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 AC 603</a>, 683.
<P>

16   	In my view, even giving full force and effect to the
second and third defendants' statement, the risk of irreparable injury
to the
first defendant is such as would demand the grant of an injunction.
<P>

17   	However, in any event, the present case falls within the
exercise of the court's parens patriae jurisdiction.
<P>

18   	Although in the circumstances no wardship order is called
for, the powers of the court in a wardship matter are activated.
 That power is
an extremely wide one.  As Lord Eldon said in<b> Wellesley v Beaufort</b>
(1827) 2 Russ 1, 18; <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1804/233.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1804] EngR 233</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=38%20ER%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">38 ER 236</a>, 242:
<P>

"It has always been the principle of this Court, not to risk the incurring of
damage to children which it cannot repair, but rather
to prevent the damage
being done."
<P>

19   	On appeal the House of Lords reported as<b> Wellesley v
Wellesley</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281828%29%202%20Bli%20NS%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1828) 2 Bligh NS 124</a>, 136;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20ER%201078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 ER 1078</a>, 1083 the decision was
affirmed, Lord Redesdale saying that the jurisdiction is very wide and extends
as far as possible to protect
the person of the child under the King's care.
<P>

20   	These principles were applied recently by the English
Court of Appeal in<b> Re X</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20Fam%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] Fam 47</a>, particularly at pp 51-53. <b> Re
X</b> shows that in such cases the protection of the child is to a considerable
extent elevated above all other interests, though other
interests are not
completely disregarded.
<P>

21   	If instead of applying the ordinary injunction principles
one applied the principles in the wardship cases it would be even
clearer that
the injunction should be given.
<P>

22   	Accordingly, I make permanently orders 1 and 2 in the
amended summons of 20 July 1999.  However, as I indicated during the
oral
hearing, I will reserve further consideration so that if at any stage the
second and third defendants wish to move for these
orders to be discharged,
after due notice to the plaintiff, they will be at liberty to do so.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

                                             oOo
