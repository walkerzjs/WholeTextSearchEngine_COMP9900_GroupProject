<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  By Notice of Motion filed on 28 January 1999 the first
and second defendants (the applicants) apply to set aside a judgment entered
in
default of appearance for possession of premises known as 131 The Grand Parade,
Brighton-Le-Sands.  The application for judgment
was filed on 16 December 1998,
the Statement of Claim having been served on 28 November 1998 and the judgment
took effect on 5 January
1999.  A stay of execution on the judgment is
presently in force until further order.  
<P>

2	By its Statement of Claim filed 23 November 1998 the plaintiff alleged a Loan
Agreement dated 26 May 1998 under which the plaintiff
advanced $331,500 to the
three defendants secured by a registered mortgage under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act 1900</a>,</i></b> registered no. 5051250 dated 2 May 1998 by the first and
second defendants as registered proprietors of the subject premises.  The
Statement of Claim further alleged default by way of arrears under the Loan
Agreement and the Mortgage.  
<P>

3	The explanation proffered for the failure to file a Notice of Appearance in
time is essentially that the first and second defendants
changed their
solicitors, their fresh solicitor took holidays over the Christmas period and
when her office re-opened in mid January
the judgment had been entered and the
writ of possession issued.  The explanation is not entirely satisfactory but it
is not such
as would prevent the judgement being set aside if the first and
second defendants were able to show a bona fide defence on the merits.
 The
defence sought to be raised by the first and second defendants, who are husband
and wife and parents of the third defendant
is that they never signed the
relevant Loan Agreement or had anything to do with it, they never signed the
Mortgage and they never
received the money, all of these things being done in
their name apparently by their son who it appears forged or caused to be forged
their signatures on the relevant documents.  
<P>

4	The facts were set out in more detail in the affidavits sworn by the
applicants.  Those affidavits show the following history
which has not been
challenged and which I accept for the purposes of this application.  The first
and second defendants are the registered
proprietors for an estate in fee
simple of the subject property and about 4 December 1990 executed a mortgage in
favour of the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia to secure a loan of $20,000 which
was used for the purchase of a motor vehicle.  A copy of the mortgage is
annexed
to their affidavits and the signatures thereon are genuine.  When the
loan was repaid the Certificate of Title was left with the
Commonwealth Bank
for safe keeping.
<P>

5	Subsequently in 1996 the three defendants applied to the Commonwealth Bank
for a further loan of $180,000 for construction of
a second level which they
were proposing to build on their existing property and the loan was
subsequently approved.  However, the
local council would not approve the
extensions, and so far as the applicants were concerned the loan from the
Commonwealth Bank and
the mortgage did not proceed and the applicants signed a
letter, prepared by their son the third defendant, which they believed was
to
notify the bank that they would not be taking up the loan, and which they
assumed their son delivered to the bank.  The applicants
are of Greek origin
and their spoken English is poor and their written English very weak.  They
never received any part of the $180,000,
the subject of the proposed loan nor
any correspondence in relation to it.  There was however, a mortgage to the
Commonwealth Bank
purporting to be from the applicants registered on the
Certificate of Title and they say their signatures on this document were
forged,
and the witness who purported to witness their signatures was a friend
of their son.  The inference is open that the son forged their
signatures and
appropriated the whole of the money for his own purposes.  
<P>

6	Subsequently, at about the end of 1997 their son approached the applicants
and told them of a scheme whereby a large amount of
money from overseas could
be deposited in an account in Australia, 30% of which would be available to the
person establishing the
account, apparently as some sort of fee for the use of
the account.  The first defendant told his son that he would be willing to
go
ahead so long as he did not have to use his property as a guarantee and the
second defendant said she would be prepared to go
ahead with the scheme
provided there was no problem with the Taxation Department and the transaction
was legal.  The second defendant
recalls that at about this time she overheard
her son have a number of telephone conversations with a man called "Robert"
from the
company Eurofinance (Eurofinance Corporation Pty Limited) and she
believed these conversations related to the transfer of the overseas
funds.  A
mortgage loan application was presented to Eurofinance dated 27 March 1998
purporting to be signed by both applicants on
the referral of Adam Moustakis of
Adam Partners.  It was an application for a loan of $340,000 and the purpose
given was to re-finance
a Commonwealth Bank loan and purchase an investment
property for approximately $200,000.  Both applicants deny that the purported
signatures on that application are theirs.  On 30 March 1998 Eurofinance sent a
Letter of Offer of Loan to the applicants and their
son, and the letter
contains an endorsement purporting to be by the three defendants accepting the
terms of the letter.  Both applicants
deny that the signatures purporting to be
theirs were signed by them.
<P>

7	At the beginning of May 1996 their son said to the second defendant "We have
to go and see a solicitor in connection with the
scheme for the transfer of the
money from overseas.  He is the solicitor preparing the documents for the
transfer of the funds".
 He also told her "Do not ask too many questions
because he will require a higher commission." They then went to see Mr James
Dimitrious,
a Greek speaking solicitor, at Burwood.  They visited Mr Dimitrious
twice and on the second occasion he showed them some documents
which appeared
to relate to the subject property and said to the second defendant something to
the effect of "One bank will have
to pay another, that is the Commonwealth
Bank".  She became concerned when she heard this but did not ask any questions
because of
what her son had told her previously.  
<P>

8	At about that time the applicants received a bundle of documents.  They went
to see Mr Robert Miles, solicitor from Barter Perry,
who said to them "Do not
sign the documents as they are strong documents for a loan.  Do not sign the
documents."  (I infer that
the applicants were referred to Mr Miles as an
independent solicitor as they were going guarantors for the loan agreement to
which
their son was also a party but offering no security.)  They then went to
the Hilton Hotel where their son made a telephone call to
"Robert" and said to
him "My parents will not sign the documents because their solicitor will not
allow them."  Their son told them
"Robert said that its too late now, that the
moneys have arrived from overseas and that we have to go ahead," to which the
second
defendant said "If I do not have to sign them I will proceed.  If I have
to sign the documents I do not want to proceed".  
<P>

9	The Loan Agreement dated 26 May 1998 and the Mortgage to the plaintiff dated
22 May 1998 purport to be signed by the first and
second defendants and the
Loan Agreement also by the third defendant.  The first and second defendants
deny that they signed the
documents.  All signatures purport to be witnessed by
Stanley Christy of 35/195 Gardeners Road, Eastlakes whom the second defendant
says is known to her as a friend of her son, but she denies ever signing any
documents in his presence.  On 6 May 1998, the second
defendant opened a St
George Bank Priority Saver Account with the sum of $500 in anticipation of the
depositing of the overseas funds.
 
<P>

10	On settlement, $15,000 was paid to Adam Partners presumably as a commission,
$1,624 to Mr James Dimitrious as solicitor acting
on behalf of the mortgagors,
$158,542.59 to discharge the loan to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (which
loan the applicants believed
had never been taken up) and $149,299.41 was drawn
in favour of G &amp; A Frazis and paid into Mrs Frazis' St George Bank Priority
Saver Account.  At the time she believed this was part of the funds coming from
overseas.  In June 1998 she signed a withdrawal slip
for $149, 299 on her son
telling her such moneys had to be paid to the Commonwealth Bank to discharge
the tax liability for the remainder
of the moneys that would be transferred
from overseas into the account.  Needless to say those moneys were never seen
again and no
funds ever came from overseas.
<P>

11	On behalf of the plaintiff/respondent, it has been submitted that its
mortgage having been registered, its title is indefeasible
and reliance is
placed on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>.</i></b>  The applicants on
the other hand submit that they have a good defence on the merits and rely on a
number of different grounds, namely:
<P>

1.	Fraud;
<P>

2.	The fact that they were in occupation at the relevant time;
<P>

3.	Unconscionability;
<P>

4.	<b><i>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a></i></b>; and 
<P>

5.	An equitable right to have the transaction set aside.
<P>

12	There is evidence of fraud particularly, but not limited to, the forgery of
the relevant Loan Agreement and registered Mortgage,
but there is no evidence
that the plaintiff played any part in, or was aware of, such fraud; and in
order to defeat the indefeasibility
of title established by s 42 and the other
provisions of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a></i></b>, the fraud must be that
of the person acquiring the title, in this case the plaintiff.  A number of
cases have established that notwithstanding
forgery of the mortgage, the
mortgagee acquires an indefeasible title provided that the fraud cannot be
sheeted home in some way
to such mortgagee: <b><i>Grgic v Australian and New
Zealand Banking Group Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 202</a>, <b><i>Vassos v State
Bank of South Australia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1993/74.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] VicRp 74</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20VR%20316" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 VR 316</a>, and can enforce the mortgage,
not only against the security, but also on the personal covenants: <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p1050ted" class="autolink_findacts">PT
Limited</a> v Maradona Pty Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2025%20NSWLR%20643" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 25 NSWLR 643.</a>  
<P>

13	As I say, there is no evidence of the plaintiff being involved in, or aware
of, the fraud but the applicants seek to suggest
that there was involvement or
at least knowledge of the fraud on the part of Eurofinance, and seek to fix the
plaintiff with responsibility
for such fraud.  The position of Eurofinance in
the transaction is not entirely clear but the application for the loan was made
to
that company, and although the Loan Agreement nominates the plaintiff as the
lender, Eurofinance is designated the "manager" and
under the agreement is
given the authority to set the variable rate of interest and change it at any
time, to approve fortnightly
in lieu of monthly repayments, to change any of
the financial information in the Loan Agreement without the borrower's consent,
including
fees and charges, to suspend repayments in the event of illness or
unemployment and other powers.  The powers and authorities conferred
on
Eurofinance as manager are in my opinion sufficient to establish a prima facie
case that Eurofinance was the agent of the plaintiff
in respect of the Loan
Agreement and the Mortgage, and I would be prepared to hold that the
involvement in or notice of, the fraud
by Eurofinance, could defeat the
indefeasible title of the plaintiff; but I can see no such evidence; the
highest the evidence goes
in this regard is the reference in the second
defendant's affidavit to her son having conversations with "Robert" from
Eurofinance,
and on one occasion telling him that she and her husband would not
sign the documents.  Assuming that "Robert" was told that, it
would seem
Eurofinance was subsequently presented with documents apparently regular and
apparently signed by the applicants.  In
my view this is not sufficient
evidence to establish fraud on the part of the plaintiff's agent.
<P>

14	There is also a passage in the Statement of the first defendant annexed to
the solicitor's affidavit as follows:
<P>

	"On some occasions I recall that my son would telephone the company known as
Eurofinance and he would speak to a person by the
name of Robert and make
enquiries as to when the documents would be prepared for the overseas funds.
<P>

	I recall that I received a telephone call from a man by the name of Robert
from Eurofinance and he said I am calling about the
30% of the monies.  I asked
for his telephone number and I informed him that Mike Frazis would call him
back."
<P>

but this passage is not re-produced in his affidavit.  It is difficult to see
any valid reason why "Robert", if he was from Eurofinance,
or anyone speaking
to him, would be referring to "overseas funds" or "30%" but this of itself
would not provide evidence that Eurofinance
was involved in the fraud.  As I
say, the passage was not reproduced in the first defendant's affidavit.
<P>

15	It was further claimed that Adam Moustakas trading as Adam Finance was also
an agent of the plaintiff, but the material in the
affidavits goes no further
than to show Adam Finance as mortgage brokers, whom it would seem arranged and
negotiated the loan from
the plaintiff and Eurofinance on behalf of the third
defendant.  I can see no evidence which suggests that Adam Finance were in any
way acting on behalf of the plaintiff or Eurofinance and accordingly, even if
there were evidence of Adam Finance being a party to
the fraud or having
knowledge of it (and there is no such evidence), such fraud could not be
brought home to the plaintiff.
<P>

16	Next it was submitted that, as the applicants were in actual occupation and
possession of the subject premises at the time the
mortgage was given, the
plaintiff as mortgagee had notice of their interest, and accordingly took the
mortgage subject to that interest.
 There was a principle at common law that a
purchaser had constructive notice of the interest of any person in occupation
of the
land; this was sometimes known as the Rule in <b><i>Daniels v
Davidson</i></b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1809/448.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1809] EngR 448</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281809%29%2016%20Ves%20249" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1809) 16 Ves 249</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=33%20ER%20978" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">33 ER 978</a>, see also <b><i>Hunt v
Luck</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%201%20Ch%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] 1 Ch 45</a>, affirmed  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%201%20Ch%20428" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] 1 Ch 428</a>, but that principle only
applied where a person other than a person with apparent title was in
occupation, and here the applicants
were the registered proprietors, and the
principle does not apply to land under Torrens Title except in the
circumstances set out
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42(1)(d)</a>, and the applicants were not in possession
as tenants but as registered proprietors for an estate in fee simple.
<P>

17	Thirdly, the defendants seek to rely on the provisions of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a></i></b> and they allege that the contract was
unfair both in the manner in which it was made and its terms: cf <b><i>AGC
(Advances) Limited v West</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 590</a> at 620; but the
applicant's complaint in this case is not that a contract they entered into
with the plaintiff was unjust, their
case is that they never entered into such
a contract at all; and I fail to see how parties who deny that they entered
into a contract
can at the same time argue that such contract was unjust.  The
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a> </i></b>is an Act designed to review unfair
contracts, not an Act to set aside relationships or obligations constituted by
forged documents.
 The applicants' present predicament is not due to them
having entered into a contract which was "unjust" within the meaning of that
Act, but to the operation of the relevant provisions of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act 1900</a></i></b> and in particular to the force and effect which that Act
gives, on registration, to forged instruments.  I am not aware of, and was
not
referred to, any case where relief has been granted under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act 1980</a></i></b> to set aside a contract where the documents evidencing
such alleged contract have been forged.
<P>

18	The next two grounds can be taken together, namely that it would be
unconscientious for the plaintiff to enforce the Loan Agreement
and Mortgage
against the applicants, or that they have some other equitable ground for
having those documents set aside or not enforced,
and reliance is placed
particularly on <b><i>Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983)
151 CLR 447.</a>  Once again, the applicants are confronted by the same problem,
namely that they cannot show that the plaintiff or any of its agents
was
responsible for, or had any knowledge of, any unconscientious or fraudulent
conduct.
<P>

19	It would appear that on the evidence presented, and assuming the forgery can
be proved at a final hearing, the applicants would
have a claim for damages
against the third defendant, and if the judgment cannot otherwise be satisfied,
rights against the Torrens
Assurance Fund: <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act
1900</a></i></b>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 126</a>, but that does not give them a defence to the plaintiff's
claim for possession.  The position of Mr Dimitrious is unclear, he acted
as
solicitor for all the three defendants on the discharge of the Commonwealth
Bank Mortgage and the fresh Mortgage to the plaintiff
and also the Loan
Agreement and the Fees Agreement indicated that he charged for acting on each
of these matters.  However, although
the plaintiffs apparently went to his
office twice, the affidavit is silent as to whether or not he ever explained to
them the nature
of the transactions which he believed they were entering into,
and he certainly did not have them sign the relevant documents in
front of him.
If he had, it would seem the forgery could not have taken place; but Mr
Dimitrious is not before the Court and his
version of what transpired may be
significantly different from that of the applicants.
<P>

20	It follows that the evidence adduced on the application does not show a
prima facie defence on the merits to the plaintiffs claim
for possession and in
the circumstances I have no alternative but to dismiss the application with
costs.  I consider that execution
of the writ of possession should be stayed
for a further six weeks to enable the applicants to consider their position and
obtain
advice on the possibilities of an appeal, or alternatively to find
alternative accommodation.
