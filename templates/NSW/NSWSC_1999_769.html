<b>2517/99 - McGETTIGAN &amp; ORS V ELIRAN PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The Kincumber Hotel Unit Trust is a
trust of which the defendant is the trustee and, broadly speaking, there are
three sets of beneficiaries,
the McGettigan interests, who hold about 35
percent, the McGuinness interests who hold about 60 percent and a third person
who holds
5 percent.  The beneficiaries have been in dispute and earlier this
year, in accordance with the trust deed, the McGettigan interests
asked that
their interest be redeemed.
<P>

2   	In order to fund the redemption, the trustee put up for
sale the only significant asset of the trust, namely the hotel, but
the reserve
was not met.
<P>

3   	The McGettigans then sought to have a receiver appointed
and to force the sale of the property.  Those steps resulted in a
settlement
being reached on 16 June 1999, which involved a referee working out various
accounting issues based on the common assumption
that the hotel was worth $6.5
million gross, and the referee would come to a calculation as to the value of
the McGettigans' interest.
 Although the referee was to be appointed within two
days of 16 June, no time was laid down for his or her determination.
<P>

4   	Clauses 4 to 7 of the terms of settlement were then as
follows:
<P>

"4.  The Defendant shall have until 30 June 1999 to find an investor willing
and able to invest sufficient funds to <u>enable the Defendant to</u> pay out
the Plaintiffs in accordance with clause 7 of the Kincumber Hotel Unit Trust
Deed.  On such funds being paid to the Defendant,
the Plaintiffs shall
forthwith be paid the following sums on account of their entitlements as unit
holders, with any further payment
or refund to be made forthwith upon the
Court's adoption of the Referee's report:
<P>

 
<P>

	First and Second Plaintiffs - $955,000 less $30,125 by way of repayment of
their share of the $100,000 loan made by the Defendant
to all unitholders in
1998/99.
<P>

 
<P>

	Third Plaintiff - $150,980.90 less $7,155.00, being $4,750 by way of repayment
of his share of the $100,000 loan made by the Defendant
to all unitholders in
1998/99, and earlier loan of $2,405.00.
<P>

 
<P>

5.   If no such investor is found by 30 June 1999, the Hotel shall be submitted
to public auction by 31 July 1999 at a reserve price
of $5,850,000.  The terms
of the Contract of Sale shall be submitted by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs
on or before 7 July 1999.
 Any dispute as to the terms of the Contract of Sale
shall be resolved by the President of the Law Society of NSW (or her
nominee).
<P>

 
<P>

6.   If the Hotel is sold at the said auction, the amounts set out in Paragraph
4 shall be paid to the Plaintiffs (or at their direction)
on completion.
<P>

 
<P>

7.   If the Hotel does not sell at the said auction, then the First and Second
Plaintiffs (or their nominee) may purchase it, if
they wish, for $6,500,000 in
accordance with the said contract and they shall receive (or at their election
be given credit for)
$1,000,000 as being the amount payable consequent upon
cancellation of their units in the Kincumber Hotel Unit Trust."
<P>

5   	The factual material on which I have to deal with the
present problem is a little nebulous.  On 29 June 1999 the McGuinness'
solicitors wrote to the McGettigans' solicitors a letter, the first paragraph
of which is as follows:
<P>

"We note that the Investors will not be in a position to invest by 30 June,
1999.  They have had difficulties due to the missing
documents, however, have
confirmed the availability of funds and expectations of achieving investment in
the next 7 - 10 days."
<P>

6   	This was replied to by the opposing solicitors the same
day, who said inter alia:
<P>

"In view of the fact that your client shall be unable to pay our clients their
entitlements on or before 30 June, Terms of Settlement
require that the auction
sale proceed."
<P>

7   	The party, for what it is worth, then proceeded to arrange
an auction to occur on 29 July.  However, on 13 July the McGuinness'
solicitors
indicated that:
<P>

"The proposed investors with whom the trustee have been negotiating have now
confirmed that they wish to proceed with investment.
 We understand they wish
to make this investment on Friday 23rd instant.
<P>

 
<P>

Accordingly, we would be pleased if you could confirm that you require the
expenses of your clients to be drawn as follows ... "
<P>

8   	They then suggested settlement at the Law Society
settlement rooms at noon on 23 July.
<P>

9   	Today a notice of motion was filed by the McGettigans
seeking a declaration that in the events which have happened the McGettigans
are able to reject any tender of the sums referred to in cl 4 of the terms of
settlement and are entitled to require that the hotel
go to auction in
accordance with cl 5.
<P>

10   	One, accordingly, has to construe what is meant by cl 4.
There are two major problems; (a) whether as a matter of fact the
defendant has
found an investor; and (b) whether the time of 30 June should be read as being
of the essence, or whether it should
be read liberally as 30 June 1999 or
reasonable time thereafter.
<P>

11   	It is to be noted in cl 4 that the duty is to find an
investor.  The investor is to be willing and able to invest sufficient
funds to
meet the payout specified to the plaintiffs.
<P>

12   	It is hard to work out exactly what "such funds" in cl 4
means,  but it probably means that someone has to make an estimate
of what
amount of money is required to pay out the plaintiffs.  It cannot mean that the
referee has actually determined what is due
because if that were the case it
would be quite otiose to make the provisional payments that have to be made
forthwith after the
funds are paid to the trustee.
<P>

13   	As I have said, there is no time limit given for the
referee's report, but cl 4 contemplates that the investor will be paying
money
to the trustee before that report is handed down.
<P>

14   	The plaintiffs, for whom Mr Wales SC and Mr Hadley appear,
say that the investor must be found and must have provided the
funds so that
the provisional payment could be made no later than 30 June and that that date,
in the light of cll 5 to 7, was an
essential date.  They say that,
alternatively, the investor must have been located by 30 June, who was at that
date in a position
to pay the funds within a reasonable time thereafter and a
reasonable time has now gone.
<P>

15   	On the other hand, Miss J Needham for the defendant, says
that so long as the investor is found before the due date, whatever
that is,
the balance of the Terms cease to apply and that there is no requirement for
money to be paid on or before 30 June 1999.
<P>

16   	I have gained some assistance in construing the expression
"find an investor" from the cases dealing with commission agents
selling real
estate whose commission is dependent upon them finding a purchaser.
Ordinarily, that connotes "find and introduce a
person able and willing to buy,
with whom a binding contract with the principal is subsequently entered into,
and who thereby becomes
a purchaser" per Jordan CJ in<b> Turnbull v
Wightman</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1945/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] NSWStRp 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2045%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20369" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 45 SR (NSW) 369</a>, 371-2;<b> Gerlach v Pearson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1950/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] VicLawRp 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%20VLR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] VLR
321</a>, 324.
<P>

17   	Although I appreciate the argument of Mr Wales SC that the
estate agent cases are being decided in quite a different context,
I do believe
that they give some assistance as to what it was that the defendant had to do
before 30 June.  It did not have to obtain
an investment, in my view, but
merely find an investor who as at that date was willing and able to provide the
funds within a reasonable
time.
<P>

18   	What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. However,
under the terms of cll 5 to 7 the matter was not to be resolved
until at least
the end of July.  Although cl 5 talks about "by 31 July" it is clear that the
auction could not be arranged before
30 June, and it would ordinarily take
about three weeks for advertising, et cetera, so that the parties were
contemplating that the
earliest that the money would flow through would be on
completion after an auction that would be held somewhere after 21 July.
Accordingly,
the money would probably flow through somewhere in September.
This is the only guide in the document as to when, if cl 4 does not
come into
play, the McGettigan interests might receive cash, but it is of some value.
<P>

19   	Accordingly, I find that the clause means much as Miss
Needham  says it means, though this is also close to Mr Wales SC's
alternative
position.
<P>

20   	The next question is whether as a matter of fact the
defendant did find such a person.  The word "find" ordinarily means "meet
with"
or "come across".  It does not mean "discover for the first time"; see for
instance<b> Re R</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%203%20All%20ER%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 3 All ER 613</a>, 616.  In the present context it means
more than merely "come across" an investor.  It means deal with the investor to
such an extent
that it is established that he or she is willing and able to
invest the funds when required,  the requirement being to provide them
within a
reasonable time after the investor is found.
<P>

21   	There is no evidence from the investor.  There is no
strong evidence from those with whom the negotiations took place.  All
we have
is the paragraph of the defendant's solicitors' letter of 29 June 1999, to
which I have already referred, and a statement
in Mr Graham McGuinness'
affidavit of 20 July, that the trustee had been negotiating with Messrs
Dickenson, that as at 29 June they
were able to confirm their investment and
that on 12 July the Dickensons indicated that they wished to proceed with the
investment
in the trust.  It was the next day that the defendant's solicitors
communicated that fact to the plaintiffs.
<P>

22   	I indicated during the running of the case that I thought
that that evidence was a bit thin.  Nothing further, however, eventuated
and I
must assume that there is nothing further that can be put in the way of
evidence.
<P>

23   	The question then is whether on the balance of
probabilities the Dickensons were people who as at 30 June 1999 were willing
and able to invest "sufficient funds".   I could not be satisfied on the
balance of probabilities that they were as at that date.
 It would seem that it
was only on 12 July that the Dickensons had sufficient documentation and
reached that conclusion.  Up until
12 July it was not possible for anyone in
either camp to know whether they were willing and able to invest sufficient
funds.
<P>

24   	Accordingly, although on the question of construction the
defendant succeeds, on applying the facts to that construction,
the event in cl
4, if 30 June is a time of the essence, does not enable the defendant to
succeed.
<P>

25   	One then turns to the question as to whether 30 June is an
essential date.
<P>

26   	Ordinarily courts of Equity read agreements in a way that
dates are not essential unless the circumstances show that the parties
intended
that they were essential.  In commercial cases the court is more likely to find
that time is essential than in non commercial
cases; see the matters referred
to in the judgment of Rath J in<b> Lindsay v Mahoney </b>(1979) 1 BPR 9584,
9587-9589.
<P>

27   	It seems to me on the proper construction of the present
document time is essential.  One finds that although the referee's
decision is
not caught up in a time provision almost every other provision is and the word
"forthwith" appears in cl 4.
<P>

28   	In my view, on the proper construction of the Terms, 30
June 1999 was an essential date and as at that date there was not
an investor
willing and able to invest sufficient funds, hence that provision has ceased to
be of any contractual significance and
one proceeds to cl 5.
<P>

29   	Accordingly, I should make the declarations 2(a) and (b)
in the notice of motion and order that the defendant pay the costs
of the
motion and reserve further consideration.
<P>

30   	I note that the matter is to be listed again before the
Registrar on 3 August 1999.
<P>
