<b><u><center></u>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b></center></b><p>
<b><center>MAHONEY ACJ</b>:  On 3 June 1995 Mr George Lattouf was concerned
with two other men in an armed robbery.  They were arrested.  Mr Lattouf was
charged
with an offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 97(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</i> 1900</a>:  that on 3
June 1995 at Lakemba when armed with a dangerous weapon namely a revolver, he
did rob the persons there named of $2,600
in cash and a quantity of electrical
equipment.  The maximum penalty for the offence is penal servitude for
twenty-five years.<p>
</center>	Mr Lattouf and the other participants in the robbery pleaded guilty.
He was remanded in custody for some two months.  On 27 June
1996 he was
sentenced to periodic detention for a period of three years to commence on 5
July 1996.  <p>
	One of the participants in the offence of armed robbery, Mr Pogorilic,  was
sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for four
years to date from 4
June 1995 with an additional term of two years;  Mr Attie, the other
participant, was sentenced to a minimum
term of penal servitude for four years
to date from 22 August 1995 and, in respect of another offence, to a minimum
term of penal
servitude for twelve months to commence from 21 August 1999.  As
the sentencing judge said, there was an effective sentence of five
years for Mr
Attie and four years for Mr Pogorilic.<p>
	The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed to this Court pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s5d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
5D</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act</i> 1912</a> against the sentence imposed upon Mr
Lattouf.  <p>
	The facts and circumstances giving rise to the sentences were stated by the
sentencing judge his Honour Judge Johnston as follows:<p>
<p>
	"The facts and circumstances giving rise to these series of charges can best
be summarised as follows:  At about 4.15 pm on Saturday,
3 June 1995, the
prisoners went to the Scorpio Car Audio and Communications store at 969
Canterbury Road, Lakemba.  There they parked
the vehicle they were driving, an
Ascot hire utility hired from the BP service station at Kingsgrove in a laneway
at the rear of
the store.  The prisoners then entered the store via a back
door.  Once inside they began to talk to the store salesman in relation
to the
purchase of car audio equipment.  After all customers had left the store,
Pogorilic removed from his clothing a large silver
revolver.  He then
threatened staff and made demands for money.  A quantity of money totalling
$2600 was taken from a desk drawer.
 After removing the money, Lattouf and
Attie commenced to remove equipment from inside the store to their vehicle.<p>
<p>
	Whilst this was taking place, Pogorilic remained inside the premises, holding
the staff at bay with a pistol.  Whilst Lattouf was
outside loading equipment
into the vehicle, Pogorilic fired a single shot from the pistol narrowly
missing one of the staff members.
 He then ran from the store and joined the
others at the vehicle parked in the laneway.  The three offenders then left the
area in
the hired utility.<p>
<p>
	Lattouf stated that prior to them removing the stereo equipment from the
warehouse floor, he remained near the doorway to the premises
to act as a
lookout.  He claimed to only have received three hundred dollars from his part
of the money.  He said the money was to
be divided evenly but he was told by
his co-offenders that the proceeds only totalled one thousand.<p>
<p>
	The shot that was fired by Pogorilic hit a mobile metal pamphlet display unit
and deflected off in a different direction, coming
to rest on the carpet
approximately four metres away.  The salesman at the time was taking cover
behind the display unit.  The projectile
failed to penetrate the unit and no
person was injured.<p>
<p>
	Inquiries were made in regard to the utility.  These inquiries revealed that
the utility was hired on 27 May 1995 in the name of
Fadre Attie from a service
station on Kingsgrove Road, Kingsgrove.  On Sunday, 4 June 1995, Pogorilic was
arrested whilst attempting
to return the utility to the service station.  He
was taken to the Lakemba Police Station and interviewed by way of ERISP.
During
the interview he made admissions as to his involvement.  He was searched
and located inside his jacket pocket was a small plastic
bag containing four
small plastic bags each containing a white powdery substance which he admitted
was 'speed'.<p>
<p>
	The prisoner refused to supply the names of his co-offenders or the present
location of the firearm.  The finding of those four
packages became the subject
of the Form Two.<p>
<p>
	The prisoner, Attie was picked from a selection of photographs shown by way of
video to the salesman, Mr Merry.  On 3 August 1995
a vehicle belonging to the
prisoner was located and found to contain property stolen during the armed
robbery offence.<p>
<p>
	Inquiries by the investigating detectives revealed that the prisoner, Attie
was living with his girlfriend, Nikki Thomasini and
another couple on a five
acre lot known as Lot 5, Mersey Road, Bringelly.  A perimeter was established
by the State Protection Group
police and the prisoner was called upon to come
out of the house by negotiators.  Initially the prisoner was spoken to by
telephone.
 However, he broke off communications with negotiators and was seen
to walk into the backyard of the premises looking for police.
 A short time
later the prisoner emerged from the front of the house armed with a knife and
threatening his girlfriend.  At the time
he was holding the knife close to her.
He forced her into a car which was parked nearby and placed her in the driver's
seat.  The
prisoner got into the back seat and held the knife to her neck.  He
then made her drive the car a short distance.  However, she managed
to escape
from the car and it was at this time that the prisoner was arrested by the
State Protection Group police.<p>
<p>
	The prisoner was subsequently interviewed at Liverpool Police Station where he
took part in an interview which was recorded by way
ERISP.  During the
interview the prisoner admitted his involvement in the armed robbery at Scorpio
Car Audio on 3 June 1995.  He
also admitted that he had armed himself with a
knife and forced his girlfriend from the house and into the car for the purpose
of
attempting to avoid arrest by police."<p>
	From the remarks of the learned judge upon the sentencing proceeding the
following facts emerged.  Mr Lattouf was a single man aged
nineteen at the time
of the offence.  He was residing with his family at Campsie.  Apart from one
minor matter early in 1995 which
was dealt with under the provisions of s 556A
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></i> he had led a crime free life.  He lived in "a warm and
caring family" and his parents had experienced "no problems with his behaviour
prior to the commission of the offence".  <p>
	He had a good record of employment.  At the date of the appeal to this Court,
he was in the employment of an employer who was aware
of the circumstances of
his offence but had found him diligent and trustworthy and had, in substance,
expressed particular confidence
in his behaviour.  <p>
	The probation and parole officer, in his report to the sentencing judge, said
that it appeared that Mr Lattouf "is not a hard drug
user and drinks very
little alcohol.  He has enjoyed the support of family life and apart from an
abrupt end, due to injury, of a
promising football career has suffered no
adverse circumstances in his life". <p>
	A psychiatrist Dr Malcolm Dent, who had examined him, concluded that he
suffered a "depressive illness" and the judge said that
"... we have a valid
psychological explanation of behaviour that is quite out of character".  Dr
Dent expressed the opinion "that
if the prisoner received expert and trained
counselling from psychiatrists or psychologists, and in his local area someone
such as
psychiatrist  Dr Osman Ali, then this will assist in relieving his
shame and residual depression".<p>
	A psychologist Mr KA Barrie had reported that, in his opinion, Mr Lattouf<p>
<p>
	 "is currently suffering levels of anxiety and depression.  He is clearly very
uncomfortable with his offending behaviour ... He
expresses deeply felt remorse
for his actions and for the humiliation and distress he had caused his family.
He indicated that gaol
had taught him to thing (sic) more carefully about the
consequences of his actions.  George is fortunate in having a family who has
remained loyal and supportive and he is grateful for that.  He also has a
full-time job waiting for him on his release and other
positive supports in the
community amongst relatives and neighbours.  He is speaking in generally
positive terms about his future
and appears prepared to be guided by his
parents and other significant adults in his life."<p>
	The judge was satisfied that the robbery was "not a spontaneous agreement as
claimed and that some degree of planning went into"
it.  His Honour concluded
that the three accused knew the gun was loaded before they went into the
premises and he rejected Mr Pogorilic's
claim that he believed the gun was
loaded with blanks.  <p>
	His Honour said:<p>
<p>
	"Lattouf, who was only nineteen at the time, had led a crime-free life, being
a person of good character who comes from a stable
and religious family.  As I
have earlier observed, he has expressed remorse and contrition for his actions
and I accept that his
participation in the offence is very much unexplained in
light of his prior good character and family situation.  I am inclined to
believe that he was more of a follower than a leader and was caught up in these
events without giving it much thought.  He has been
in custody since 24 April
and no doubt the trauma of his short spell in prison has had a dramatic effect
upon him.<p>
<p>
	As has been noted by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the prevalence of this type
of offence is a matter of grave social concern. 
It is now well recognised that
the victims of such armed robberies may suffer devastating psychological damage
upon the trauma necessarily
involved with the commission of such offences.  In
these circumstances, sentencing judges would be recreant to the trust which the
community places in them if they were not to impose sentence consistent with
the seriousness and the prevalence of such offence.<p>
<p>
	Turning now back to Lattouf, having considered both the objective gravity of
the offence, together with the strong subjective case
that has been made out on
behalf of the prisoner, I believe that the appropriate sentence is one of
periodic detention."<p>
	The principles applicable to the sentencing of a person convicted of an
offence such as the present are not in contest.  Mr Carmody,
for the appellant
Director of Public Prosecutions, submitted that a sentence must give effect to
the objective circumstances of the
offence:  <i>R v Rushby</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20NSWLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1 NSWLR
594</a>;  <i>R v Dodd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A Crim R 349</a>;  the punishment, he submitted,
must accord with the general moral sense of the community in relation to the
offence in question:
 <i>R v Geddes</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1936/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] NSWStRp 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2036%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554</a> at 555.  Mr
Carmody submitted that this Court has made clear that armed robbery is to be
regarded as an offence of the utmost gravity
and that it is to be punished by a
full time custodial sentence "except in the most exceptional circumstances":
reference was made
to <i>R v Readman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2047%20A%20Crim%20R%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 47 A Crim R 181</a>;  <i>R v
Roberts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2073%20A%20Crim%20R%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 73 A Crim R 306.</a>  His submission was that in this case the
subjective and objective factors to be taken into account in sentencing the
respondent
Mr Lattouf did not fall and could not be seen to fall within the
category of "most exceptional circumstances".  <p>
	Mr Carmody's submissions suggested, in addition, that the sentence imposed in
the present case was inadequate because it would operate
to weaken the public
perception of the seriousness with which the courts of this State regard the
offence of armed robbery and in
particular an offence in which a firearm has
been used and discharged.  His submission has, in effect, suggested that
notwithstanding
such subjective factors as may in the present case have
operated in favour of Mr Lattouf, the effect of a periodic sentence as distinct
from a full custodial sentence will inevitably be to weaken the public
appreciation of the seriousness with which an offence of this
kind is to be
regarded. <p>
	It is not to be taken from what the Court does in this case that the offence
of armed robbery is regarded or will be treated less
seriously than has been
indicated in cases such as <i>Readman</i> and <i>Roberts</i>.  There should be
no doubt but that an offence of this kind will, exceptional circumstances
apart, attract a full-time custodial
sentence.  Sentencing judges will not take
a different view.<p>
	However, in the present case there are, inter alia, several matters which have
influenced me to conclude that this appeal should
not be upheld.  First, this
is a case in which it was necessary and appropriate that the judge exercise a
careful discretion in arriving
at the sentence to be imposed.  It is in my
opinion necessary that the law allow to a sentencing judge a discretion to
determine
the sentence appropriate for the particular offence, for the
particular offender, and for the circumstances of the particular case.
 General
sentencing principles must be established, so that the community may know the
sentences which will be imposed and so that
sentencing judges will know the
kind and the order of sentence which it is appropriate that they impose.  But,
of course, principles
are necessarily framed in general terms.  General
principles must, of their nature, be adjusted to the individual case if justice
is to be achieved.  For this reason, it is in my opinion important in the
public interest that the sentencing process recognise and
maintain a residual
discretion in the sentencing judge.  	 <p>
	Second, it is important to recognise the nature of the interests involved in
the sentencing process.  There is a public interest
in the adoption and
articulation of sentencing principles which will deter the commission of
serious crime and punish those who commit
it.  That is clear from what I have
said as to the principles in <i>Readman</i> and <i>Roberts</i>.  But there are
other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard;  there are
other objectives which the sentencing
process must seek to achieve.  Paramount
amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case.  To see the
sentencing
process as involving no more than stern punishment for each offender
is not merely simplistic;  it damages the public interest. 
A sentencing
process which is seen by the public merely as draconian and not just will lose
the support of those whom it is designed
to protect.  If a sentencing process
does not achieve justice, it should be be put aside.  As I have elsewhere said,
if justice is
not individual, it is nothing:  <i>Kable v Deputy Director of
Public Prosecutions </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 374</a> at 394.<p>
	But, in addition, a sentencing process must be capable of discriminating
between cases.  There is, as I have said, a public interest
in punishment.  But
if the desire to punish results in a person who would otherwise not become a
confirmed criminal becoming such,
that sentencing process is inconsistent with
the public interest.  <p>
	It is to be recognised that imprisonment may convert a person who will not be
a persistent criminal into one who is.  Particularly
is this so where the
person to be sentenced is a first offender of a comparatively young age whose
family circumstances are such
that he may, with assistance, not become a
criminal.  It would be wrong to the individual and costly to the community not
to attempt
the rehabilitation of such a person. <p>
	In my opinion, this is an important factor in the present case.  The present
offender had no relevant criminal record.  He was young,
his family
circumstances were such as to provide hope for his future in the community.
And there were those who were prepared to
trust him with employment.  That is
the kind of case to which heavy punishment is, in my opinion, not appropriate.
It is a case in
which, notwithstanding the gravity of the offence, it is proper
for a sentencing judge, with appropriate safeguards, to seek rehabilitation.<p>
	There is in what the judge did an element of faith.  The judge placed faith in
the assurances given by Mr Lattouf and his family
as to his future conduct.  If
that faith be misplaced, Mr Lattouf will bear the burden of it.  He is unlikely
to be seen as a person
in whose word confidence can be placed and he is apt to
be dealt with accordingly.  That no doubt he will recognise.<p>
	Taking all these matters into account, and bearing in mind the onus which the
State bears in an appeal such as the present, I am
not satisfied that the
sentence in the present case was wrong.<p>
	In all the circumstances, I accept the judge's sentence as correct.  I would
dismiss the appeal.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SULLY J:</b>	I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of
Mahoney ACJ. With considerable hesitation I concur in the making of an
order
dismissing this Crown appeal. Because of that hesitation, I wish to make some
observations of my own. <p>
<p>
	I take it to be trite law that the correct first step in the sentencing of any
prisoner is the making by the sentencing Judge of
a proper assessment of the
objective gravity of the particular offence(s). I take it to be equally trite
law that the offence of
armed robbery is always to be regarded as an offence of
the utmost gravity. And, further, I take it to be now well settled, in
accordance
with the authorities cited by Mahoney ACJ, that such offence
requires to be punished by the imposition of a full time custodial sentence
<i>"except in the most exceptional circumstances"</i>. <p>
<p>
	Those latter words mean, so far as I am concerned, what they say; and I
consider it to be of the first importance that they should
be seen by all
concerned, not excluding primary sentencing Judges, as meaning what they say.
The Courts, - not excluding, if I may
say so with respectful bluntness this
Court, - do no service to the proper protection of law-abiding citizens by
encouraging in any
way a perception on the part of a person who is
contemplating the carrying out, whether alone or in company, of any form of
armed
robbery, that he or she can, in effect, proceed upon the assumption that,
if caught, a full time custodial sentence can be avoided
by a combination of:
<p>
[1]	A sentencing Judge predisposed to leniency; and<p>
<p>
[2}	The fact that he or she has never done such a thing previously; and<p>
<p>
[3]	The fact that he or she has never been previously subject to a full time
custodial sentence; and<p>
<p>
[4]	The fact that he or she can cobble together, should the need arise, a
conveniently attractive collection of subjective features.<p>
<p>
	I acknowledge, of course, that Mahoney ACJ has said in clear terms in his
Honour's judgment in the present case that:<p>
<i>	"It is not to be taken from what the Court does in this case that the
offence of armed robbery is regarded or will be treated less
seriously than has
been indicated in cases such as </i>Redman <i>and </i>Roberts<i> There should
be no doubt but that an offence of this kind will, exceptional circumstances
apart, attract a full-time custodial sentence.
Sentencing judges will not take
a different view."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	In the present case, the plain fact is, in my opinion, that the learned
sentencing Judge did <i>"take a different view"</i>.<p>
<p>
	I can see readily how the learned sentencing Judge found personal facts that
were very favourable to the respondent. I can see as
readily that, given those
findings, his Honour would have concluded, as does Mahoney ACJ, that, to quote
the latter, <i>"(this) is the kind of case to which heavy punishment is,
....... not appropriate".</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	</i>What I cannot see in the remarks on sentence of the learned primary
Judge is a process of reasoning apt to support the proposition
that, in
accordance with what this Court has said plainly to be the law, there exist in
the present case <i>"most exceptional circumstances"</i> such as, alone, will
justify less than some full-time custodial sentence for any participant in any
armed robbery. <p>
<p>
	In my opinion it needs to be spelled out clearly by this Court that, absent
such exceptional circumstances, it is wrong in principle
to suppose that
<i>any</i> full-time custodial sentence is <i>"heavy punishment"</i>, and apt
to erode, in the ways propounded by Mahoney ACJ, public confidence in the law.
<p>
<p>
	I would wish to say plainly that, had I been the proprietor of the shop that
was robbed in the present case; or a staff member terrorised
at gun-point by
one of three armed robbers acting in concert; or the salesman who might easily
have been killed or wounded by the
shot fired by the gunman accomplice of the
respondent; then I do not believe that I would have thought a sentence of
periodic detention
to have been an appropriate punishment for any of my
assailants.<p>
<p>
	Of course, no Judge can deal with any sentencing problem upon such a basis.
That is why our system of criminal justice is administered
by independent
Judges who have sworn to do justice according to law <i>"without fear or
favour, affection or ill-will"</i>.<p>
<p>
	All that said, I think that if the Court is to speak about the need to
maintain public confidence in the current system of administering
public
criminal justice, then, in my opinion, the Court should do what it properly can
to reassure all citizens of ordinary good
sense and ordinary good will that the
Courts and the Judges do understand, and do care about, proper public concerns
respecting the
punishment and deterrence of serious crime.<p>
<p>
	My own view, then, is that the learned sentencing Judge did err in not
imposing <i>some</i> proper full-time custodial sentence. By <i>"proper"</i>, I
mean a sentence brining into a measured, sensible balance the objective and
subjective factors as established by the evidence
before his Honour. In the
case of the present respondent, I would have thought that what is often
described as a "<i>short, sharp shock", </i>was called for; and that a fixed
term of full-time custody in the order of 9 months or thereabouts would have
been a justly proportioned
outcome.<p>
<p>
	Initially, I thought that this Court should do in that regard what, in my
respectful view, the learned primary Judge should have
done. That I have
decided, finally, to concur in the dismissal of this appeal, is the result of,
and only of, the way in which I
think that the element of this Court's
over-arching discretion should operate. <p>
<p>
	The respondent has in fact served 2 months odd of full-time custody. He is
entitled to additional consideration on account of the
28 days, spread over 14
week-ends, of periodic detention that he has in fact served pursuant to the
sentence imposed in the Court
below. Any sentence now to be imposed by this
Court, would require, in addition, to be discounted, in accordance with the
well established
principle governing any re-sentencing by this Court after a
successful Crown appeal against sentence. There is only one further matter
that
I consider to be of real weight for present purposes, and that is the
consideration that, to quote again from the judgment of
Mahoney ACJ: <i>"(The
respondent has) a good record of employment. At the date of appeal to this
Court he was in the employment of an employer who
was aware of the
circumstances of his offence but had found him diligent and trustworthy and
had, in substance, expressed particular
confidence in his behaviour"</i>.<p>
<p>
	When these various factors are accumulated, then, in my opinion, to impose now
an aggregate full-time sentence of the order previously
suggested would risk,
to a degree that I do not find ultimately acceptable, the disruption, and
perhaps the destruction, of the respondent's
rehabilitation, which appears to
be progressing promisingly. That would risk, in its turn, the mistaking of
vindictiveness for vindication.<p>
<p>
	Even so, the result of this appeal is, so far as I am concerned, a near-run
thing. I expressly join Mahoney ACJ in his Honour's
explicit warning to this
respondent that he should not expect another such chance as he is given by this
Court on the present occasion.
<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u><center></u>ADAMS AJ:</b>  I have had the benefit of reading in draft the
judgment of Mahoney ACJ and agree with his Honour's conclusion that this appeal
should
be dismissed and with his Honour's reasons.  I wish, however, to
emphasise that the crime of armed robbery is extremely serious.
 Indeed, if I
had been the sentencing judge, I would have passed on this appellant a sentence
involving full-time custody, despite
the strong subjective factors that
militated otherwise.  Nevertheless, for the reasons set out in the judgment of
Mahoney ACJ, I
am not prepared to conclude that the sentence passed below was
incorrect.  Mere difference of opinion does not demonstrate error,
let alone
appealable error.  Having regard both to the nature of the sentencing
discretion available and appropriate at first instance
and the principles
governing, and rightly governing, the exercise by this Court of its appellate
jurisdiction when activated by Crown
appeals, I agree that the appeal should be
dismissed.<p>
