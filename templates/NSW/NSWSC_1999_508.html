<P>

<b>		  GOVERNMENT INSURANCE OFFICE 	</b>
<P>

<b>		  OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Indemnity Costs)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion dated 20 January 1999 the
plaintiff seek that the his costs be assessed and/or taxed on an indemnity
basis as
and from 30 July 1997.  The plaintiff relied on the affidavits of Earl
Patrick Fosse sworn 19 January 1999 and Thomas Edgar Edmunds,
the plaintiff's
solicitor sworn 18 January 1999.  
<P>

2  	The following facts are not in dispute.
<P>

(1)	On 24 July 1996 Mr D A Wheelahan QC, counsel for the plaintiff provided
written advice to the plaintiff that:
<P>

<b>"A well judged Offer of Compromise can lead to an entitlement to indemnity
costs.</b>
<P>

<b>It is critical that an appropriate offer of compromise be made as soon as
possible to enable the plaintiff to take advantage of this
possibility.</b>
<P>

<b>The defendant will offer this plaintiff nothing because it will believe it
is likely to win the case.  Accordingly, a modest offer
of compromise can be
served.</b>
<P>

<b>If the plaintiff's claim, at full value, would approximate $3 million then
any sum over $2.5 million would represent an excellent
outcome for him.</b>
<P>

<b>For reasons which I explained in conference I recommend that an Offer of
Compromise in the sum of $2 million plus costs out of pocket
expenses be served
upon the defendant forthwith."</b>
<P>

(2)	On 30 July 1997 the plaintiff made on offer of compromise to the defendant.
The offer was for a verdict for the plaintiff in
the sum of $2,200,000 plus
$35,000 costs.  The offer was expressed to be made in accordance with Pt 22 of
the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> (the Rules) and expired after 28 days from
service.
<P>

(3)	On 3 September 1998, the defendant made an offer of compromise in the sum
of $2,325,000 inclusive of out-of-pocket expenses
but exclusive of legal costs
against the defendant.  The offer was expressed to be subject to the terms and
conditions set out in
the accompanying terms of settlement and stipulated that
these terms must be filed prior to seeking payment.  This offer was open
for 28
days and costs were to be assessed or taxed.  The offer did not state that it
was made in accordance with Pt 22 of the Rules.
<P>

(4)	On 19 January 1999 the plaintiff's father who is the next best friend
accepted the offer of compromise.
<P>

(5)	Paragraph (1) of the terms of settlement entitled verdict (without
admission of liability) for the plaintiff for personal injuries
in the sum of
$2.325 million plus costs.
<P>

(6)	On 20 February 1999 the court approved the terms of settlement.  
<P>

3  	I turn to the relevant law.  The relevant portions of Pt 22 of
the Rules provide:
<P>

<b>"Time for making or accepting offer (Pt 52 r 17: costs)</b>
<P>

<b>3(1)	An offer may be made at any time before the time prescribed by subrule
(8) in respect of the claim to which it relates.</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	A party may make more than one offer.</b>
<P>

<b>  (3)	An offer may be expressed to be limited as to the time it is open to
be accepted but the time expressed shall not be less than
28 days after it is
made.</b>
<P>

<b>  (4)	...</b>
<P>

<b>  (5)	An offeree may accept the offer by serving notice of acceptance in
writing on the offeror before--</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the expiration of the time specified in accordance with subrule (3) or,
if no time is specified, the expiration of 28 days after
the offer is made;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the time prescribed by subrule (8) in respect of the claim to which the
offer relates, whichever is sooner.</b>
<P>

<b>  (6)	An offer shall not be withdrawn during the time it is open to be
accepted, unless the Court otherwise orders.</b>
<P>

<b>  (7)	An offer is open to be accepted within the period referred to in
subrule (5) notwithstanding that during that period the party
to whom the offer
(the "first offer") is made makes an offer (the "second offer") to the party
who made the first offer whether or
not the second offer is made in accordance
with this Division.</b>
<P>

<b>  (8)	The time prescribed for the purposes of subrules (1) and (5) and Part
52A rule 22(3) is--</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	where the trial is before a jury -- after the Judge begins to sum up to
the jury;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	where the proceedings have been referred under Section 76B(1) of the Act
for determination pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration (Civil Actions) Act 1983</a> -- after
the conclusion of the arbitration hearing; or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	in any other case -- after the Judge or master gives his decision or
begins to give his reasons for decision on a judgment (except
an interlocutory
judgment).</b>
<P>

<b>  (9)	Where an offer is accepted under this rule, any party to the
compromise may enter judgment accordingly.</b>
<P>

4  	The relevant parts of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r 22 of the Rules state:
<P>

<b>"Offer of compromise</b>
<P>

<b>22(1)	...</b>
<P>

<b>    (2)	...</b>
<P>

<b>    (3)	Subrules (4)-(6) apply to an offer which has not been accepted at
the time prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p22" class="autolink_findacts">Part 22</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 3(8).</a></b>
<P>

<b>    (4)	Where an offer is made by a plaintiff and not accepted by the
defendant, and the plaintiff obtains an order or judgment on
the claim to which
the offer relates no less favourable to the plaintiff than the terms of the
offer, then, unless the Court otherwise
orders, the plaintiff shall, subject to
rule 33, be entitled to an order against the defendant for the plaintiff's
costs in respect
of the claim from the day on which the offer was made,
assessed on an indemnity basis in addition to his costs incurred before and
on
that day, assessed on a party and party basis.</b>
<P>

<b>    (5)	For the purpose of subrule (4), where the offer was made on the
first or a later day of the trial of the proceedings, then,
unless the Court
otherwise orders, the plaintiff shall be entitled to the plaintiff's costs in
respect of the claim from 11 am on
the day following the day on which the offer
was made, assessed on an indemnity basis, in addition to the plaintiff's costs
incurred
before that time, assessed on a party and party basis.</b>
<P>

<b>    (6)	Where an offer is made by a defendant and not accepted by the
plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains an order or judgment on
the claim to which
the offer relates not more favourable to him than the terms of the offer, then,
unless the Court otherwise orders,
the plaintiff shall, subject to rule 33, be
entitled to an order against the defendant for the plaintiff's costs in respect
of the
claim up to and including the day the offer was made, assessed on a
party and party basis, and the defendant shall be entitled to
an order against
the plaintiff for the defendant's costs in respect of the claim thereafter
assessed on a party and party basis.</b>
<P>

<b>    (7)	...</b>
<P>

<b>    (8)	...</b>
<P>

<b>    (9)	...</b>
<P>

<b>   (10)	...</b>
<P>

<b>   (11)	Unless the Court otherwise orders, any application for an order for
costs under subrule (4) or subrule (6) must be made immediately
after the order
or judgment giving rise to the entitlement to the order for costs is made or
given."</b>
<P>

5  	The plaintiff accepted the defendant's offer outside the time
prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p22" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 22</a> r 3(8).  Thus <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r 22(4) to (6) applies.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r
22(4) applies to this case.  The defendant submitted that the terms of
settlement stipulated that the defendant was to pay the
plaintiff's costs and
the words "plus costs" should be given the settled meaning of plus costs to the
date of settlment on a party/party
basis.  The defendant also submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
52A</a> r 22(4) requires an order for costs to be made immediately after the order
for judgment giving rise to the entitlement to the order
for costs is made or
given.
<P>

6  	By entering into the terms of settlement which included that
costs be paid, I do not think the parties intended to preclude
the operation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r 22(4).  The approval of the terms of settlement was done in chambers
and the notice of motion seeking indemnity costs had to be

<P>

listed in court to give the defendant an opportunity to be heard as to whether
it was appropriate to award indemnity costs.  It
is my view that the
application for costs on an indemnity basis was made immediately after the
judgment was made.
<P>

7  	The plaintiff's counsel referred to <b><u>Hillier v
Sheather</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 414</a>;  <b><u>Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No
2)</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20NSWLR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) NSWLR 721</a> and <b><u>Hansen v GIO of New South Wales</u></b>
(NSWCA, unreported Studdert J, 17 June 1994).  In <b><u>Fisher (No 2)</u></b>
the Court of Appeal referred to the objects of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52</a> r 17 of the Rules which
applied to former regime of the taxation of costs.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r 22 is its
counterpart and applies to the costs assessment regime introduced by the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW).  The Court of Appeal identified the
objects of the rule.
<P>

8  	They are:
<P>

<b>"1.	To encourage the saving of private costs and the avoidance of the
inherent risks, delays and uncertainties of litigation by promoting
early
offers of compromise by defendants which amount to a realistic assessment of
the plaintiff's real claim which can be placed
before its opponent without risk
that its "bottom line" will be revealed to the court;</b>
<P>

<b>2.	To save the public costs which are necessarily incurred in litigation
which events demonstrate to have been unnecessary, having
regard to an earlier
(and, as found, reasonable) offer of compromise made by a plaintiff to a
defendant;  and</b>
<P>

<b>3.	To indemnify the plaintiff who has made the offer of compromise, later
found to have been reasonable, against the costs thereafter
incurred.  This is
deemed appropriate because, from the time of the rejection or deemed rejection
of the compromise offer, notionally
the real cause and occasion of the
litigation is the attitude adopted by the defendant which has rejected the
compromise.  In such
circumstances, that party should ordinarily bear the costs
of litigation."</b>
<P>

9  	In <b><u>Hillier</u></b> the Court of Appeal considered what was
meant by "unless otherwise orders" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p19a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 19A</a> r 4 of the <b>District Court
Rules</b> which relates to offers of compromise.  The phrase "unless otherwise
orders" requires the case to be in some way exceptional (at
p 422t).  Once a
plaintiff has made an offer of compromise which complies with the Rules and he
later succeeds in recovering no less
than the amount of his offer then he
becomes prima facie entitled to indemnity costs from the date that the offer
was made.  This
is what the sub-rule contemplates "unless the court otherwise
orders".  This interpretation is equally applicable to Pt 52A r 22.
<P>

10  	Is the present case one in which the court should "otherwise
order"?  Liability was in issue.  The plaintiff was an 11 year
old pedestrian
who may have been found at trial to have been running at the point of impact
and not crossing at the pedestrian control
lights.  Although it would seem that
the defendant would have been found guilty of negligence, the plaintiff may
have been found
guilty of contributory negligence.  The plaintiff was very
seriously injured.  He will not be able to work and will require future
care,
medical treatment and the like.  The defendant did not submit that it was not
in a position to assess the plaintiff's offer
of compromise when it was made.
The offer of compromise made by the plaintiff was a genuine attempt to settle
the matter and to take
advantage of Pt 52A r 22.  The plaintiff bettered his
offer of compromise.
<P>

11  	It is my view that in accordance with Pt 52A r 22(4) the
defendant should pay the plaintiff's costs from 30 July 1997 to the
date of
settlment on an indemnity basis. 
<P>

12  	If I am wrong and the provisions of Pt 52A r 22(4) do not apply,
the court has a discretion to award costs on an indemnity
basis (see s 76 of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970).
<P>

13  	In <b><u>Colgate Palmolive Pty Limited v Cussons</u>
</b>(1993)<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/536.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 536</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=46%20FCR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">46 FCR 225</a> at 233-234 Sheppard J<b> </b>reviewed the relevant
common law principles and said:
<P>

<b>"In consequence of the settled practice which exists, the court ought not
usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis
other than the
party and party basis.  The circumstances of the case must be such as to
warrant the court in departing from the usual
course."</b>
<P>

14  	This passage was cited with approval by Badgery-Parker J in
<b><u>Rouse v Shepherd (No 2)</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 279.</a>  In making an
indemnity costs, the question must always be whether particular facts and
circumstances of the case warrant the making
of an order for payment of costs
other than on a party/party basis.
<P>

15  	It is my view that the plaintiff, by making a reasonable offer
of compromise early in the proceedings, was genuinely attempting
to settle the
matter and avoid incurring costs and court time.  The plaintiff ultimately
bettered this offer of compromise and should
be entitled to costs on an
indemnity basis.  Costs of the motion should follow the event.  However, it was
necessary for the defendant
to be given the opportunity to be heard on this
issue.  In the exercise of my discretion the defendant should pay the
plaintiff's
costs of the motion on a party/party basis.
<P>

16  	The order I make is:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff's costs be assessed on an indemnity basis as from 30 July
1997 except the defendant is to pay the plaintiff's
costs of the notice of
motion dated 20 January 1999 on a party/party basis.
