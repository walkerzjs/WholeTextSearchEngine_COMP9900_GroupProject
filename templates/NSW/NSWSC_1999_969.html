<b>3563/99	HEALTH SERVICES FOR MEN PTY LTD &amp; ORS v OSCAR D'SOUZA &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings relate to the affairs of medical
clinics which are widely distributed around Australia and conducted
under the
name "Health Services for Men". Their primary focus is treating sexual
dysfunction in male patients.  The first, second
and third defendants are
medical practitioners who until 9 August 1999 carried on medical practice in
clinics owned and operated
by the plaintiffs.  The issues relate to ownership
and control of files relating to patients and of confidential information in
the
files, and to the use of telephone numbers which were formerly used in
association with the plaintiffs' clinics.
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs are four related companies.  They have different
functions in the conduct of the clinics.  The plaintiffs claim
that all four
plaintiffs own and operate the clinics; the defendants did not admit this in
terms but the identity of the particular
companies which conduct the clinics
was not an important issue.  At present, there are said to be 21 clinics which
are widely distributed
around Australia.  Until 9 August 1999 ten different
medical practitioners worked in them.
<P>

3  	The first three defendants, Dr D'Souza, Dr Condoleon and Dr
Wadan, are medical practitioners.  All three practiced from clinics
before
March 1998 when the plaintiffs began to operate them.  Since 9 August 1999
these defendants have continued to practice in
the same field, but not in
clinics conducted by the plaintiffs.
<P>

4  	The fourth defendant Australian Momentum Health Pty Limited is a
company in some way associated with the professional work of
Dr D'Souza and Dr
Condoleon; it is the subscriber with Telstra for telephone services for clinics
at Norwood, South Australia and
Upper Mount Gravatt, Queensland.  Australian
Momentum Health Pty Limited was formed on 23 June 1999 and its only director
and secretary
is Forhad Ahmed Khan, who was formerly an officer of the
plaintiffs.  The fifth defendant is a practice company associated with conduct
by Dr D'Souza of his professional affairs.  
<P>

5  	The plaintiffs are the successors in business to other
organisations which conducted the same group of clinics since April 1994
when
Dr Condoleon began to work in this field, and possibly earlier.  In April 1994
clinics were conducted by a company called On-Clinic
Pty Limited.  In 1996 the
clinics began to be conducted by Australian Men's Health Pty Limited; it is
said in evidence that On-Clinic
Pty Limited sold its clinics to Australian
Men's Health Pty Limited although no details of the transaction and no real
proof that
there was a sale have been put in evidence, and the terms on which
the business changed hands are not known.  It is then said, again
without any
real proof of what in detail happened, that Australian Men's Health Pty Limited
went into receivership about March 1998
and that after that the plaintiffs took
over the clinics which that company had previously conducted.  The dates of
these events
are not clearly established and slightly different dates are given
at different places in evidence.  
<P>

6  	Doctors D'Souza, Condoleon and Wadan have not been the only
medical practitioners to work in the clinics; some other doctors
have done so
and some continue.  In 1996 On-Clinic Australia Pty Limited made written
consultancy agreements with a number of medical
practitioners who then worked
in its clinics.  Mr Mark Ryan who at that time was Managing Director of
On-Clinic Australia Pty Limited
has produced in evidence an agreement between
On-Clinic and another practitioner, Dr Short.  Mr Ryan said in evidence to the
effect
that about August 1996 a number of medical practitioners including the
first to third defendants signed agreements in the same form
as Dr Short.
There is some difficulty about this statement as Dr Short's agreement is dated
7 June 1997. The consultancy agreement
signed by Dr Short contains clauses
relating to preserving the confidentiality of confidential information, not
using confidential
information otherwise than for the benefit of the principal
after termination and not removing confidential information from the
clinic
without written consent; the practitioner is expressly required to ensure that
records are not removed from the clinic.  There
are also restrictive covenants
before and after termination.  No written agreement of On-Clinic Australia with
any of these defendants
has been produced in evidence, and each has denied
making one; according to their evidence, they indicated to Mr Ryan
modifications
which they required to the form, and the project of making a
written agreement did not go any further.  In any event there is no
evidence
that the benefit of any such agreement has passed through a chain of
assignments from On-Clinic Australia Pty Limited to
the plaintiffs.  The
obligations undertaken by both sides were such that the benefit of the contract
would not be assignable.  These
defendants are not parties to any express or
implied arrangement for compliance with provisions like those in the form
produced by
Mr Ryan; nor are the plaintiffs.
<P>

7  	Each of these defendants made a written agreement with the first
plaintiff on a standard form headed "Short Form of Agreement".
 Dr D'Souza's
Short Form of Agreement is an example.  It was dated 15 April 1998 and its
material terms were:
<P>

<i>"I hereby authorise Health Services For Men Pty Limited (HSM) to deposit
all of my consultation, consumables and medication receipts
into the HSM
Doctors Fees Holding Account (the Trust Account) and to manage on my behalf
these funds.  The monies will be deposited
either by the Staff of Medical
Intergrated Services Pty Ltd (MIS) attending to the Clinics serviced by me
and/or Medical Admin Services
Pty Ltd (MAS).  The monies in the Trust Account
will be sourced from the daily Clinic payments and all payments received from
Medicare
under the Providor numbers included below and any extra Providor
numbers that may be added at a later date and group linked to P.O.
Box 273
Edgecliff.</i>
<P>

<i>I am aware that HSM has an obligation to pay MIS, MAS and Asire Pty Ltd for
services provided to HSM.  I consent to payments being
made out of the Trust
Account directly to these services companies as long as the payments do not
exceed the charges which I am liable
to pay HSM for services, consumables and
medication."</i>
<P>

8  	There is no other written arrangement between these defendants
and the plaintiffs, so that no express contractual terms are
established
between them relating to ownership of medical records, control of confidential
information or use of telephone numbers.
 It should be taken that the
arrangements actually followed in conducting the clinics were authorised by the
parties.  The general
effect of those arrangements and the way they operated
are as follows.  The clinics are conducted from premises leased and staffed
by
one or other of the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs decide when and where to
establish or to close or to move a clinic and make all
arrangements to do so.
Patients at the clinics are given a variety of treatments for sexual
dysfunction, and in many cases erectile
dysfunction is treated by
self-injection therapy.  A patient using self-injection therapy is in need of
and receives medical advice
relating to the suitability of the therapy and the
quantity of medication required, and is also in need of medical supplies such
as an auto-injector, medication and a self-injection video.  The plaintiffs
advertise very extensively, particularly in metropolitan
Sunday newspapers and
are said to spend approximately $30,000 per week on advertising.  They solicit
business from the public by
way of a 1300 telephone number which is shown
prominently in the advertisements.  Business is largely generated by the
newspaper
advertisements, but there are also repeat consultations from
established patients, and consultations initiated when patients establish
contact with particular practitioners in other ways.  
<P>

9  	When prospective patients telephone a clinic, they speak to a
staff member, who enters the prospective patient's name, address
and contact
details in a computer system and asks a series of questions about his medical
condition; the answers give a general indication
of the prospective patient's
problem.  If the responses given are regarded as indicating that a consultation
at a clinic is appropriate,
the staff member makes an appointment, and records
it in the computer system for the clinic which the patient is to attend.
Particulars
of appointments are transmitted to clinics by facsimile.  Clinic
staff prepare a hard copy (cardboard and paper) file for a new patient
using
various pro-formas which the plaintiffs prepare.  Exhibit A is a copy of a
typical file but without material identifying the
patient.  A new patient
attending on such an appointment sees the doctor rostered to be present at the
clinic at that time.  If a
patient attends again he may attend on appointment
to see the same doctor; however that does not always happen.  Sometimes
patients
see another doctor, and sometimes they attend at another clinic.  Most
repeat attendances are attendances to obtain further medication
or equipment.
At an initial consultation, which takes approximately an hour, the doctor takes
a medical history from the patient,
makes a physiological examination and if in
the judgment of the doctor it is appropriate, may give a metered test injection
and ascertain
the dosage which is regarded as appropriate.  The doctor then
prescribes medication for the patient if appropriate.  In the majority
of cases
repeat visits are brief.
<P>

10  	The staff of the plaintiffs prepare rosters setting out which
clinic each doctor is to attend and the times of attendance.
 Sometimes the
roster sets out arrangements for a particular doctor to travel interstate or
otherwise to attend clinics requiring
lengthy journeys.  Roster arrangements
are made co-operatively between the plaintiffs' staff and particular doctors,
and doctors
are not required to attend the clinics except in accordance with
their own wishes and convenience; they are not under discipline.
 On the other
hand they have apparent motivations to contribute to successful operation of
the clinics.  Dr D'Souza usually attended
at clinics in and near Melbourne, Dr
Condoleon at clinics in Melbourne and Southport and Dr Wadan at a clinic
conducted at one time
at Edgecliff and later at Bondi Junction.  Each of them
has at times attended elsewhere, not however while the plaintiffs were
operating
the clinics.  
<P>

11  	In New South Wales fees for medical practitioners' attendance
are bulk-billed.  That is to say, a claim is made to Medicare
in the name of
the doctor and with the patient's authority for a payment to which the doctor
is entitled.  The Short Form Agreement
recognises that the fees are the medical
practitioner's fees.  Fees when received are paid into the HSFM Fee Holding
Account as authorised
by the Short Form Agreement.  In other States the
plaintiffs directly charge the patients for consultation and the fees received
are paid to the HSFM Fee Holding Account.  Presumably patients who are charged
in this way receive some documentation nominating
the medical practitioner as
service provider to whom the fee is payable, so that the patient can obtain
whatever payment is available
from Medicare.  
<P>

12  	Patients pay the plaintiffs directly for prescribed medication
and equipment, and those payments are also paid into the HSFM
Fee Holding
Account.  Arrangements between the plaintiffs and each doctor establish the
proportion of the money received into the
HSFM Fee Holding Account which is
paid out to the plaintiffs and to the medical practitioners; proportions vary
and are related to
the number of consultations which the doctor conducts, and
are typically about 78% to the first plaintiff and 22% to the medical
practitioner.  Fees for consultations give rise to about 15% of the plaintiffs'
total income and sale of medication and equipment
gives rise to about 85%.  
<P>

13  	In the clinics overall there are medical records for about
300,000 patients.  Many of these relate to patients who have not
attended the
clinics while the plaintiffs have conducted them and have not attended for some
years.  Mr Meehan, an officer of the
plaintiffs, estimated that approximately
100,000 files are active.
<P>

14  	The typical file -  Exhibit A  - consists of a manilla folder
bearing the patient's name, and slips recording particulars of
the dates of
attendance and materials supplied are stapled to the folder.  There is also a
two page Examination Sheet, a pro forma
completed in handwriting by the medical
practitioner.  The pro forma provides for an array of social and medical
information.  When
completed the sheet constitutes a comprehensive relevant
medical history.  It also contains records of treatment prescribed and matters
observed on examination.  The  file also contains an Informed Consent form,
relating to the self-treatment therapy.  This is a standard
form signed by the
patient and its terms show that it is directed to the medical practitioner.
Exhibit A also contains a Pathology
Report from a consultant pathologist
directed to the medical practitioner.  The last document in Exhibit A is a
sheet completed by
the patient giving personal particulars and stating whether
the patient is on medication.  
<P>

15  	In describing the operation of the clinics Mr Meehan spoke in
terms which attributed all acts and events to the plaintiffs
and treated the
conduct of the medical practitioners as if it were conduct on behalf of and in
an agency relationship with the plaintiffs.
 The defendants' evidence speaks
from a different viewpoint in which the medical practitioners conduct their
medical practices and
see their patients with the benefit of services supplied
by the plaintiffs which support their conduct of medical practice. These
services include premises, furniture and office equipment, clerical and other
staff to attend to arranging rosters and appointments
and notifying doctors of
these arrangements.  In the plaintiffs' point of view the doctors function as
part of the plaintiffs' organisation
and the plaintiff is providing medical
services through their agency, and in the defendants' point of view the doctors
are practising
medicine and providing professional services, and receiving very
full assistance from the plaintiffs in their practical needs as
they do so.

<P>

16  	There is in my finding nothing in the nature of an employment
relationship or employment discipline between the plaintiffs
and the medical
practitioners.  Support given by the plaintiffs to the doctors in their work is
very full indeed, even extending
to paying their travelling and other expenses
of attending at clinics, it may be interstate, to fulfil the rosters.  There is
no
indication in evidence that doctors are ever constrained by the plaintiffs'
direction to do anything otherwise than exactly as the
doctors choose to act.
There is no indication of any source for a right to control them in any such
way. 
<P>

17  	My interpretation of what takes place accords with the view put
forward by the defendants.  The essence of what is taking place
is that
patients who need medical treatment are consulting medical practitioners and
obtaining the opinion and advice of the medical
practitioners; the patients are
not interested in consulting persons who are not medical practitioners but
conduct clinics through
the agency of medical practitioners who form part of
their organisation.  It would be unlawful for persons who are not medical
practitioners
to give medical advice and prescribe treatment.  The medical
practitioners do not receive and prescribe to a standardised chain of
patients
with standardised conditions; patients and medical practice are just not like
that, and the need for individual personal
judgment on the medical
practitioner's professional responsibility presents itself anew for each
patient.  It would not be possible
for consultations to be bulk-billed to
Medicare unless they were consultations with medical practitioners for which
medical practitioners
were entitled to charge the patients.  In my
interpretation it is the plaintiffs' business to provide services to medical
practitioners
to support their practising medicine and in so doing to enhance,
I would think greatly, the medical practitioners' opportunity to
receive and
treat patients in numbers. 
<P>

18  	On or about 9 August Dr D'Souza arranged for the removal, by a
courier company which he engaged, of some thousands of patient
files.  Dr
Condoleon similarly arranged for the removal of some thousands of patient files
from the premises of clinics conducted
by the plaintiffs.  Within a few days
the medical files so removed were returned to the control of the plaintiffs
under interlocutory
orders which, of course, were not based on any decision
about the entitlement of a party to own or have the custody of the files.
 
<P>

19  	The circumstances in which the clinics were conducted and the
nature of the professional work of medical practitioners makes
it obvious that
the patients have a right to confidentiality of the information in their files
and to restriction of access to the
information and use of it to purposes
related to the interests of the patients.  The plaintiffs' case is that the
plaintiffs are
entitled as against the doctors to confidentiality with respect
to information in the files.  The plaintiffs claim to be entitled
to control
use by the doctors of information identifying the patients and recording
medical histories and particulars of consultations,
diagnoses and
prescriptions.  There is no express arrangement between the parties dealing
with this subject.  By contrast, the form
of contract between On-Line Australia
Pty Limited and another doctor did create express restrictions of that kind.
In the absence
of express contractual restrictions there is in my view no
circumstance of any kind which would impose an obligation of confidence
on the
doctors towards the plaintiffs with respect to use of information obtained
during their association.  
<P>

20  	To address the remaining issues it is necessary to consider the
law relating to ownership and possession of medical records.
 The plaintiff
makes a claim to recover possession of files based on a right to own or retain
and recover possession of the patient
files.  There was no express agreement
between the parties about ownership or possesion.  As a matter of first
principles, the ownership
of the files, which are pieces of paper, can,
assessing the events with reference to the probabilities, be taken first to
have been
with the person conducting the clinic when the files were created;
the probability is that that person used manilla folders and pieces
of paper
which that person had purchased.  A manilla folder, file and pieces of paper in
it would remain the property of their owner
until they were dealt with in some
way which transferred ownership to someone else according to the intentions of
the owner.  
<P>

21  	Observations relating to ownership of medical records were made
in the judgments in the Court of Appeal  and also in the High
Court in <b>Breen
v. Williams</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 522</a> and (1996) 186 CLR 71, and in my unreported
judgment at first instance.  That case was principally concerned with the right
of a
patient to have access to the patient's medical records, and ownership
questions were considered only incidentally.  This is not
a field in which
there is a large or clear body of judicial opinion and regard must be paid to
expressions of opinion even though
they were not grounds for decision.
<P>

22  	<b>Breen v Williams</b> related to papers held by a medical
specialist in private practice, including notes made by the medical specialist
himself, and the
plaintiff did not establish any right which would overcome the
medical specialist's entitlement as owner to control access to the
papers.  The
case did not turn on a disputed claim to ownership or possession.  There was
nothing in the facts with any analogy to
a conflict as to ownership between the
medical practitioner and the institution in which he worked.  
<P>

23  	In the High Court (1996) 186 CLR 71 the question of ownership of
the documents was raised in argument: see p75. Brennan CJ
dealt with property
in records at p80 in these words:
<P>

<i>"Property</i>
<P>

<i>The appellant concedes that the property in the records as chattels is in
the respondent.  The concession is rightly made.  Documents
prepared by a
professional person to assist the professional to perform his or her
professional duties are not the property of the
lay client; they remain the
property of the professional (Leicestershire County Council v. Michael Faraday
&amp; Partners Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%202%20KB%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 2 KB 205</a> at 216; Chantrey Martin v. Martin [1953] 2
QB 286"</i>
<P>

24  	Dawson &amp; Toohey JJ also approved the concession: see 88-90,
and said at 88:
<P>

<i>"The appellant did not claim ownership of the actual documents comprising
her medical records.  It is understandable that she did
not do so, because they
do not include any documents obtained on her behalf and paid for by her, such
as X-ray photographs or pathology
reports, the ownership of which she may well
be able to claim."  </i>
<P>

25  	This is an obiter dictum on a subject which did not call for
decision.  I am impressed with the force of the consideration
that as pathology
reports are prepared on behalf of the patient and paid for by the patient, the
patient ought to be able to claim
ownership of them; the patient ought to be
able to do that because the intention which as a matter of probability should
be attributed
to the consultant supplying the report, in the absence of any
other evidence, is that the medical practitioner to whom the report
was
supplied was to receive it and use it only in the interest of the patient, and
payment for it and the relationship of the report
to the patient's interests
support imputing that intention.  The alternative, that the intention to be
imputed to the consultant
is that the recipient should own the report, also has
claims for consideration but seems to be less probable.  By way of a test,
it
could be asked what intention should be imputed to the consultant for the
possibility that the patient decided to show the consultant's
report to some
other practitioner to obtain a further opinion; it seems improbable that the
consultant would intend that the recipient
practitioner would be entitled to
withhold it.
<P>

26  	See also the observations of Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 101.  At
126 Gummow J treated the concession as correctly made. 
<P>

27  	If the transfer of ownership is dealt with by a contractual
term, it can be taken, as a matter of probability, that the owner
intended to
comply with the term, and intended that ownership should pass in the way which
compliance with the contractual term would
require.  Consideration of the
intention to be imputed to an owner who expressed no intention leads on to
consideration of what contractual
terms existed: the significance of the
contractual term is attenuated when the term itself is also unexpressed and
must be ascertained
by a process of implication.  In <b>Breen v Williams</b>
Gummow J referred to the implication of a term in a contract, and referred to
<b>Hawkins v Clayton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20539%2d573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 539-573</a> and <b>Byrne v Australian
Airlines Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20185%20CLR%20401" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 185 CLR 401</a> at 420-423, 440-447.  At 123-124 his Honour
said:
<P>

<i>"Where, as here, the contract was not reduced to any complete written form,
the question is whether the implication of the term was
necessary for the
reasonable or effective operation of the contract in the circumstances of the
case; only where this can be seen
to be so will the term be implied."</i>
<P>

28  	The views of Brennan CJ Dawson and Toohey JJ in <b>Byrne v
Australian Airlines Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20185%20CLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 185 CLR 410</a> at 422 were:
<P>

<i>"Implied term</i>
<P>

<i>The implication which the appellants seek to make is based upon the presumed
or imputed intention of the parties.  In that context,
the remarks of the
majority in the Privy Council in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of
Hastings are frequently called in
aid: `(1) [the implication] must be
reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to
the contract,
so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective
without it; (3) it must be so obvious that `it goes without saying';
(4) it
must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express
term of the contract.'  In laying down those criteria,
it was recognised that
there was a degree of overlap.  Further, as Deane J has observed, (See Hospital
Products Ltd v United States
Surgical Corporation <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a> at 12), the
cases in which the criteria in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of
Hastings have been applied in this Court
are cases in which there was a formal
contract, complete on its face.  He pointed out that a rigid approach should be
avoided in
cases, such as the present, where there is no formal contract.  In
those cases the actual terms of the contract must first be inferred
before any
question of implication arises.  That is to say, it is necessary to arrive at
some conclusion as to the actual intention
of the parties before considering
any presumed or imputed intention.  And the test to be then applied was in a
later case formulated
by Deane J in these terms (See Hawkins v Clayton (1988)
164 CLR 539 at 573):</i>
<P>

<i>`The most that can be said consistently with the need for some degree of
flexibility is that, in a case where it is apparent that
the parties have not
attempted to spell out the full terms of their contact, a court should imply a
term by reference to the imputed
intention of the parties if, but only if, it
can be seen that the implication of the particular term is necessary for the
reasonable
or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the
circumstances of the case.  That general statement of principle is subject
to
the qualification that a term may be implied in a contract by established
mercantile usage or professional practice or by a past
course of dealing
between the parties.'"</i>
<P>

29  	McHugh and Gummow JJ said at 446: "<i>In contracts of this
nature, apparently lacking written formality and detailed specificity, it is
still necessary to show that the
term in question would have been accepted by
the contracting parties as a matter so obvious that it would go without
saying."</i>  
<P>

30  	The tests for implication of a term into a contract stated in
the opinion of the majority of the Privy Council in <b>BP Refinery
(Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings</b> (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283 have
been applied in Australia many times, most notably in <b>Codelfa Construction
Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a> at 351-352, 404.
The nature of the subject shows that the criteria given by their Lordships
cannot be applied in an inflexible way;
it remains necessary to establish, so
far as possible, what the parties did expressly agree on and to consider the
operation of the
supposed implication in relation to that, and it is less easy
to apply formally expressed criteria where the parties' agreement is
itself
informal and there is no complete expression of it.  That is the present case;
the Short Form Agreements were obviously not
intended to be a complete
expression of the parties' relationship.  I should consider whether the
contractual relationship between
the plaintiffs and the doctors contained an
implied term dealing with whether the ownership of the Examination Sheets was
to pass
to the doctors when they used them.  The test which I am required by
authority to apply is whether the implication of a proposed
term is necessary
for the reasonable and effective operation of a contract of the nature which
was actually made.  
<P>

31  	In my unreported decision in <b>Breen v Williams</b> on 10
October 1994 at page 19 and following I dealt with ownership of records in
these terms:
<P>

<i>"Ownership of the records.</i>
<P>

<i>	On first principles, a person who brings into existence a document by
writing on a piece of paper which he owns continues to be its
owner, and it
passes into other ownership according to its earlier owner's conduct and
intentions.  It can usually be taken that
he intended to pass ownership to
another if he had a contractual obligation to do so.</i>
<P>

<i>	Cases relating to ownership by professional persons of papers which come to
existence in the course of their work were reviewed in
the judgment of Hope JA
in Wentworth -v- de Montfort  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%20348" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 15 NSWLR 348.</a>  </i>
<P>

<i>	Many considerations have influenced these decisions, but the most important
consideration for documents produced or created while
doing professional work
appears to be the express or implied terms of the contract under which the work
was performed, and documents
prepared by the professional person for his own
benefit and protection while doing the work are usually held to be the property
of
the professional person.  There are fairly well established broad categories
of documents relating to solicitors, but the decisions
are not without their
difficulties, and other professions have not produced a corresponding body of
judicial experience.  </i>
<P>

<i>	In Leicestershire County Council -v- Michael Faraday &amp; Partners Ltd
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1941%5d%202%20All%20ER%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1941] 2 All ER 483</a> the Court of Appeal of England dismissed a claim that
documents prepared collected and held by valuers retained by it under contract
were the property of the council after the contract retaining the valuers
expired.  </i>
<P>

<i>	The claim was put in terms of an assertion of ownership and a right to
possession of the papers and was rejected by the Court of
Appeal on that basis.
MacKinnon LJ (at 487) distinguished between the papers of a professional man to
whom a client resorts for advice
and the papers of an agent who brings
documents into existence while in the employment of a principal.</i>
<P>

<i>	In Chantrey Martin -v- Martin  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%202%20QB%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] 2 QB 287</a> an auditor's working papers
were held by the Court of Appeal to be the property of the auditor.</i>
<P>

<i>	Ownership of a document received from another person depends on the
intention of the person who brought it into existence and sent
it.  The fact
that a professional person's client or patient paid for a document is an
indication that it was intended that the patient
should own it, but not an
unequivocal or exhaustive indication, and the question cannot be answered
without evidence of what was
intended, conceivably including evidence of
practice.  </i>
<P>

<i>	Medical records often include test results and reports from medical
practitioners such as consultants, pathologists, and radiologists,
or from
medical ancillaries.  As the evidence does not show that there are such
documents, I make no decision about them.  A patient
who has been charged for
and has paid for such documents has a stronger claim to own them and hence to
be entitled to access to them,
than a patient's claim to access to notes made
by the treating doctor, and to correspondence for which the patient has not
been charged
passing between the treating doctor and others.  </i>
<P>

<i>	Legal ownership of a document is a strong claim to have access to it and
indeed to have possession of it; this is the strength of
the defendant's claim
in respect of notes made by him.  </i>
<P>

<i>	Analogies based on judicial decisions for other professions and
occupations, such as preliminary and final plans produced by architects,
letters and copies of letters sent to and from solicitors, solicitors' diary
notes and counsel's advices are imperfect and not readily
applicable to medical
practice.  </i>
<P>

<i>	On the evidence I do not find that the defendant or any other person whose
intentions are relevant has ever intended that ownership
of any of the
documents in the defendant's possession should pass to the plaintiff.  This is
particularly clear for hand-written
notes made by the defendant on his own
sheets of paper and photographs taken by the defendant himself for his own use.
Dr MacDougall
is not a consultant to the defendant and chose to write to him
about the plaintiff and her treatment, and it is extremely unlikely
that he
intended that that letter should become the property of the plaintiff."</i>
<P>

32  	In the Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 522</a> it was accepted that
the papers were exclusively the medical specialist's property.  See 529-530.
In the majority, Mahoney JA summarised
the matters in dispute (at 551) in a way
which did not include any question of ownership.  While considering (at pp559
and following)
the right of a patient as such to inspect the medical file
Mahoney JA addressed how the ownership of documents produced by professional
persons has been determined.  At 559D his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"In considering the ownership of such documents, it is, I think, of
assistance to consider at least three things: the nature of the
relationship
between the parties; the purpose to be achieved by that relationship; and the
particular terms of a contract between
them."</i>
<P>

  At 559 and 560 his Honour reviewed case law relating to documents produced by
professional persons and at 560E to 561F said:
<P>

<i>How do these considerations apply to the case of a general medical
practitioner of the present kind?  A medical practitioner is ordinarily
not a
mere agent for the patient.  He is a professional.  The purpose of the
professional relationship is ordinarily to diagnose,
to recommend treatment,
and to treat the patient.  What the doctor does, and the documents he creates,
are ordinarily directed essentially
ot the achievement  of these purposes.
Subject to what I shall say, the documents are created for the purpose  of such
diagnosis
and treatment and they are merely what the doctor uses to achieve
those purposes.  Accordingly, in my opinion, prima facie, a medical
file kept
by s doctor is the property of the doctor.</i>
<P>

<i>However, the position is, of course, more complicated.  It is necessary to
examine the circumstances surrounding the creation of each
document.  Documents
created merely for the purposes of the doctor, for example, as records of his
practice, as material from which
to assess charges and the like will be the
property of the doctor.  On the other hand, some documents created for the
purpose of
enabling the doctor to diagnose and to determine the treatment to be
recommended may be the property of the patient.  Thus, a document,
though held
by the doctor, may be the property of the patient because it was procured by or
for the patient and has been paid for
by her.  X-rays, pathology reports and
some reports by consultant specialists may be such: cf as to the case of a
solicitor Wentworth
v De Montfort (at 356B).  Correspondence with consultant
specialists or with treating hospitals may, if of this kind, be the property
of
the patient.</i>
<P>

<i>More difficult questions arise in relation to matters such as those
particularly referred to by Dr Cashman in the present case, namely,
notes taken
by the doctor to record the patient's medical history and her signs and her
symptoms.  In one sense, such records are
made for the purposes of the patient;
the making of them is one of the things which the doctor, by his engagement,
may undertake
to do.  In this sense, the document is created so that there may
be a record of what the patient has told the doctor and her signs
and symptoms
at the time.  The record may not merely help in the instant diagnosis and a
selection of treatment; it may provide a
valuable resource for future purposes.
Considered in isolation, a record of this kind, if it were contained in a
separate document,
would, I think, be the property of the patient.</i>
<P>

<i>On the other hand, the doctor may - as Dr Williams has said he ordinarily
will - include with the record of the history and the signs
and the symptoms of
the patient, comments and observations which are made and recorded for the
purpose of helping the doctor form
the diagnosis and the opinion to be formed
as to treatment.  There may be observations - Dr Williams used the term
`musings' - which,
if standing alone, would ordinarily be the property of the
doctor and not of the patient.  It is the fact that these things are combined
in the documents which illustrates the nature of the problem in a case such as
this.</i>
<P>

<i>The combination of such things: the history, signs and symptoms on the one
hand and the `musings' and other things on the other hand;
may be accidental in
the sense that the combination of the two in the one record is not inherent in
the process of medical knowledge.
 But the thrust of Dr Williams' evidence is,
I think, that such a combination is not accidental.  His evidence suggests that
the
combination of the two things is inherent in the way medical practice is
conducted or, at least, in the way he conducts his practice.
 The trial judge
accepted this portion of the judge's evidence.</i>
<P>

<i>If the records kept by the doctor be in this form, then, in my opinion, the
records remain the property of the doctor.  In so far
as the purpose of the
making of the records may be, as I have said, one of the things which the
contract between the doctor and the
patient requires the doctor to do, it will
ordinarily be implied that information as to the relevant portion of it, viz,
that relating
to history, signs and symptoms, will be made available to the
patient as and when required for medical purposes.  But, by reason
of the
nature of the record and the circumstances of its creation, the record is in my
opinion in principle the property of the doctor."</i>
<P>

33  	Meagher JA adopted the reasons at first instance (569F) and did
not deal with the question of ownership.  
<P>

34  	Counsel took me through a number of references in learned
publications relating to law and the medical profession.  I was referred
to
<i>Law of Doctor and Patient, </i>Speller, London 1973.  This work relates to
practice in England.  Its author, a member of the English Bar, held a position
as Director
of Education at the Institute of Health Service Administrators
which gave him advantages in expounding practice.  Chapter 10 dealing
with
ownership of medical records pp154 and following opens with the following
statement of general principle:  
<P>

<i>"In general terms it may be said that if a professional man in independent
private practice makes notes for his own guidance in advising
his patient or
client or in treating his illness or dealing with his affairs, those notes
ordinarily become the property of the maker,
nor is that the less true because
he may be under a duty to his patient or client as to the use he may make of
those notes."</i>
<P>

Doctor Speller went on to address a number of special situations relating to
hospital and specialist practice and the influence
of United Kingdom
legislation.  At 157 he discussed property in radiologist's reports X-ray films
and prints, and his tentative views
do not accord with the present state of
opinion in New South Wales.  At pp159 to 161 he discussed questions relating to
medical records,
including hospital records contributed to by several
practitioners, and in partnership practice.  At 160-161 he said:
<P>

<i>"Notes made by assistants and locum tenentes</i>
<P>

<i>Notes made by an assistant in medical practice or by a locum tenens in the
course of his duties ordinarily become the property of
his employer or
principals."</i>
<P>

The plaintiffs' counsel also referred me to "<i>Law for the Medical
Profession",</i> Dix, Errington, Nicholson and Powe, Sydney 1988.  All its
authors have legal qualifications and Messrs Dix and Errington have
associations
with medical practice.  At pp136-139 they address questions of
ownership of medical records in various situations, and their essential
view is
that a medical practitioner in private practice owns a medical record which he
has created, although fuller statement is
required for records in public
hospitals, private hospitals, corporations or government bodies, and for X-rays
and consultant's reports.
<P>

35  	Counsel also referred to <i>Medical Law</i>: <i>Text with
Materials</i> 2nd ed, Kennedy and Grubb, London 1994. Professor Kennedy was
then Professor of Medical Law and Ethics and head of the School of
Law at
King's College, London, and Mr Grubb was Reader in Medical Law also at King's
College.  Their expressions of view are related
to United Kingdom practice and
legislation.  In Ch8 at pp610-611 they discussed and illustrated the difficulty
of determining ownership
of medical records prepared by a medical practitioner
where the patient contracts with the clinic or institution in which the medical
practitioner works.  They said that there was no clear law on the terms to be
implied, and expressed the classic view that ownership
follows ownership of the
paper used.
<P>

36  	I was also taken to <i>Law and Medical Practice</i>, Skene,
Sydney 1998 which contains the following paragraphs at 184 and 185:
<P>

<i>"8.12	Medical records are generally owned by the treating doctor or the
institution in which they were prepared: Breen v Williams
(1996) 186 CLR 71;
138 ALR 259 (HCA) per Brennan CJ at CLR  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=80%20ALR%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">80; ALR 264.</a>  The documents `remain the
property of the professional': ibid.  This is because the notes were prepared
by the doctor or institution
for their use in caring for the patient, rather
than for the patient's use.  There seems to be a limited exception in the case
of
some reports ordered by the doctor for the patient and paid for by the
patient (or the patient's insurer) to help diagnose the patient's
condition:
for example, `X-ray photographs or pathology reports, the ownership of which [a
patient] may well be able to claim': Breen
at CLR  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=88%20ALR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">88; ALR 270</a> per Dawson and
Toohey JJ.</i>
<P>

<i>8.14	Ownership of records also entitles the owner to dispose of them like
any other asset, subject to an undertaking by the transferee
to keep their
contents confidential.  Thus, if a doctor dies, the ownership of the medical
files passes to the executor: Gummow J
in Breen at CLR  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=127%20ALR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">127; ALR 300</a>; citing
Estate of Finkle  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=395%20NYS%202d%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">395 NYS 2d 343</a> at 344-5 (1977).  Similarly, if the doctor
retires and the practice is sold to someone else, that person may acquire the
records
with the rest of the doctor's `stock in trade', and may offer the
patients the opportunity either to become patients of the new doctor
or
practice or to request that their records be sent to another doctor nominated
by the patient.</i>
<P>

<i>8.15	Similarly, if a patient moves to another district or to another doctor,
or wants the medical records for any other reason, the
first doctor cannot be
compelled to hand them over; that doctor owns the records and is entitled to
retain them.  The patient may,
however, request a report of the contents of the
records, for which the doctor may charge (the preparation of such a report is a
Medicare item for which the doctor may claim reimbursement)."</i>
<P>

37  	Text writers appear to me to support the view that ownership of
medical notes is determined by ownership of the paper on which
they are made,
and that ownership passes according to the intentions and acts of the owner.
They do not discuss any situation which
appears to me to be close to the
present facts.  In particular, experience relating to public or private
hospitals which are themselves
governed by medical practitioners appears to me
to be distant from the present facts, because it is much easier in cases like
those
to impute to all concerned an intention that the institution is to own
and control the medical records.
<P>

38  	It is necessary to consider what intention it should be found
that the plaintiffs had with respect to retaining ownership or
transferring
ownership of papers in the files.  The finding must be based on the intentions
to be imputed to the plaintiffs in the
circumstances, as there is no expression
of any actual intention.  The circumstances which are relevant include the
manner in which
the plaintiffs dealt with the files, and also the manner in
which medical practitioners dealt with them, the purposes for which they
existed and their utility to one side and to the other.
<P>

39  	The manner in which the files were dealt with was that each file
was kept in a clinic for use in the business and professional
services
conducted in the clinic.  Clinic staff had access to and wrote in the files for
the purpose of recording formal details
relating to patients, their treatment,
medications and goods supplied to them, their charges and payment.  The medical
practitioners
also had access to that information in the files, but they are
unlikely to have made much use of it.  Other papers in the files were
obviously
prepared for the purpose of use by medical practitioners for purposes in which
the plaintiffs had no direct concern.  The
first example is the Examination
Sheet, the form of which shows that it was brought into existence for the
doctor to use, to write
on, and to have available on the next occasion when the
patient was seen.  An Examination Sheet is a record of a kind which, to do
his
professional work properly, the doctor must make and keep, and the doctor has a
duty to the patient and a professional responsibility
to maintain the record
while it remains useful, and to have it available when and if resort to it is
needed for further treatment.
 In addressing the probabilities about what the
plaintiffs and also the medical practitioners intended should happen to
ownership
of the Examination Sheets these circumstances seem to me to make it
on the whole improbable that it was intended by both sides, and
in particular
that it was intended by the plaintiffs, that the plaintiffs should continue to
own the Examination Sheets; the plaintiffs
had, it seems to me, no real use for
Examination Sheets on any proper basis while medical practitioners did have a
real use for them.
 
<P>

40  	While the first, second and third defendants have practised in
clinics conducted by the plaintiffs they have continued, as
they did before, to
use in the course of practice paper supplied to them and make notes in files,
call for the files when they wish
to use them and be supplied with them to the
plaintiffs' staff for filing and for action relating to payments.  These
defendants
have not been subject to any controls by staff of the plaintiffs
over their access to files for purposes relating to the affairs
of patients,
and the files have been available for use by other medical practitioners who
worked in the clinics in some circumstances
such as that the doctor who held
the initial consultation was not in attendance when a patient wished to make a
repeat appointment,
or a patient presented without an appointment or at another
clinic.  
<P>

41  	I cannot see any proper purpose which would be served if the
relationship operated in such a way that the plaintiffs provided
paper for
doctors to use in their medical practices, doctors used it to create records
which the doctors needed to have in the future,
yet the plaintiffs continue to
own the paper.  Each piece of paper has been completely transformed in utility
and value by the writing
on it, and it would be a strange outcome indeed if the
paper was supplied so that it would go through this process, and went through
it, yet the plaintiffs should still own it.  From the plaintiffs' point of view
the paper is used up and gone, as much as the services
they supplied to the
doctors.
<P>

42  	My view of the intention which as a matter of probability should
be imputed to the original owner of the papers in the absence
of any expression
of intention is shaped by my overall view of the nature of the relationship to
which I earlier referred. The paper
was supplied to the defendants so that they
could function as doctors; they could not function well and appropriately
unless they
owned the paper they were using and had a owner's legal right to
control its disposition.  My view of the probabilities is that it
was intended
by the plaintiffs that when an Examination Sheet was used by a doctor for the
purposes of examining a particular patient,
the examination sheet should become
the property of the doctor.  The Informed Consent form speaks, at some length,
in terms of advice
which it was appropriate for the medical practitioner to
give the patient  -  including "<i>by advising you of any potential problems
much can be done to avoid complications</i>."  Then it speaks about potential
side effects and about care of the medication, and gives advice which it would
be appropriate for
a medical practitioner to give to a patient.  The consent
expressed in the form and signed by the patient should be understood to
be
directed to the medical practitioner  -  "<i>I confirm that I have read and
understand the above information all of which was explained fully prior to my
signing</i>."  That document too, when used, was also in my finding intended to
become the property of the medical practitioner.  
<P>

43  	Also in the file Exhibit A is a pathology report relating to the
patient but directed to the medical practitioner.  In my opinion,
in the
absence of any indication of a different intention, reports of tests of this
kind, for which the patient pays, directly or
indirectly, are the property of
the patient.  They are directed to the medical practitioner, and although the
patient is entitled
to call for them and take them, until the patient does so
the intention to be imputed to the patient is that they are to remain in
the
possession of the medical practitioner.
<P>

44  	The last sheet in the typical file is a sheet headed <i>("Must
be completed by the patient"</i>) with some personal particulars of the
patient.  It is also has a space for information about whether the patient is
on medication.
 Finally, there is a space for office use with a record of
medications prescribed on visits.  The use intended for this piece of
paper
which should be understood from its terms leads me to the finding that it was
not intended that ownership of this piece of
paper should move away from the
plaintiffs.  
<P>

45  	With respect to any one patient who was first seen by any of
these defendants at any time, I am of the view that material in
the patient
files corresponding to the Examination Sheet and to the Informed Consent form
is the property of that defendant, and
that the defendant is entitled to
possession of any report from a pathologist.  
<P>

46  	With respect to the telephone numbers the circumstances in which
two of the defendants came to be using the telephone numbers
are not well
explained by evidence.  In the first two weeks of August 1999 the clinics
conducted by the plaintiffs in Brisbane and
Adelaide were relocated and
obtained new telephone numbers.  Australian Momentum Health then made
applications to Telstra for the
old telephone numbers, and is now the
subscriber for those two numbers for clinics at Norwood, South Australia, and
at Upper Mt Gravatt,
Queensland, which are conducted by Australian Momentum
Health.
<P>

47  	Doctor Condoleon caused about 12350 files to be removed from the
plaintiffs' Brisbane and Gold Coast Clinic and took them to
premises at Upper
Mount Gravatt where he now conducts his practice; these premises had earlier
been occupied by the plaintiffs, which
left them within the previous two weeks
and set up its clinic in the premises of Ashley &amp; Martin in Brisbane City.
The Upper
Mount Gravatt Clinic is conducted by Australian Momentum Health and
the telephone number formerly used by the plaintiffs there and
recently
surrendered is now connected to a telephone at the Upper Mount Gravatt Clinic.
Doctor Condoleon does not have any interest
in Australian Momentum Health and
his relationship with it as a contractor is generally similar to the
relationship he formerly had
with the plaintiffs.  Doctor Condoleon did not
make any arrangements for the telephone number to be transferred.
<P>

48  	Doctor D'Souza arranged for the removal of about 5500 files from
premises in Albert Road where the plaintiffs had until recently
conducted their
clinic; the clinic there had closed and the operation was moved to premises of
Ashley &amp; Martin in Exhibition
Street in Melbourne City.  He sent the files
to premises in St Kilda Road where he now conducts a medical practice.
<P>

49  	On 17 August Dr D'Souza asked Telstra for access to telephone
number 03 98792 which had until a short time earlier been used
by the
plaintiffs for their clinic at Albert Street, and had been given up by the
plaintiffs at about the time the plaintiffs left
the Albert Street premises.
Doctor D'Souza arranged for his practice company to become the subscriber and
for calls to that number
to be diverted to his own mobile telephone.
<P>

50  	The effect is that if patients or prospective patients know of
the former telephone number for the Brisbane Clinic, from advertising
or from
business cards and stationery on which it has appeared, those persons will
telephone the number wishing to contact the plaintiffs
and will in fact make
contact with Australian Momentum Health and its clinic.  For all I know they
may be given a full and clear
explanation when they do so, but the use of the
telephone number appears to me to be inappropriate because in a way it is use
of
the business methods, public presentation, get-up and reputation of the
plaintiffs.  I infer that similar events would follow if
a person used the
number which Australian Momentum Health has now obtained for its Norwood
Clinic, or the number which Dr D'Souza's
practice company has obtained for his
clinic in St Kilda Road.  In my view the conduct of defendants in taking up and
using telephone
numbers which until recently were used by the plaintiffs and
must be widely known for their association with the plaintiffs is a
form of
passing-off and should be restrained. 
<P>

51  	Dr Wadan did not remove any files, and has not been shown to
have used any telephone numbers formerly used the plaintiffs.
 It is difficult
to understand why he was joined as a defendant at all.  There does not seem to
be any kind of case against him for
adjudication.  
<P>

52  	Not all the files removed have been brought into existence since
the plaintiffs began to conduct the clinics on or about 23
March 1998.  For
patient files prepared before 23 March 1998 the plaintiffs have not produced
any evidence of substance establishing
that they have acquired title to the
files from whoever may have been their owner before then, and the plaintiffs do
not have a right
based on ownership of the files to any order under which they
would recover possession of them.  The plaintiffs are in my opinion
entitled to
protection of their possession of old files, even though the files may be the
property of others, except against the
first second and third defendants and in
respect of documents owned by these defendants.  
<P>

53  	Where a patient first consulted one of the defendants that
defendant is entitled to have possession of the Examination Sheets
Informed
Consent forms and pathology reports.  Where another doctor later saw the same
patient and, as is likely, wrote on the same
sheet or perhaps added other
sheets, the question whether ownership of papers passed to the other doctor in
its turn depends on the
intention of the doctor who was first consulted.
Ownership would not leave that doctor unless that doctor so intended.  If a
medical
practitioner saw another medical practitioner's patient in the
character of a <i>locum tenens</i> or to meet some situation where the first
doctor was not available, or where the patient attended at a place where the
first doctor
was not in attendance and a fax copy was sent there, it is not
probable that it was intended that ownership of the medical records
should
change.  On the other hand if a patient was in some way definitively referred
from one doctor to another in the contemplation
that the first doctor would no
longer see the patient and control of the medical records would pass it might
be right to infer that
it was intended that ownership would also pass.  There
is no evidence dealing with particulars of any such cases, the subject is
speculative and in any event the first doctor would have a better right to the
documents than the plaintiffs.
<P>

54  	For these reasons I am prepared to make injunctions restraining
use of the telephone numbers.  I am also prepared to make orders
appointing a
referee who is to examine all the files in question and allocate the files, or
parts of the files, to the person entitled
to each sheet in accordance with the
views I have expressed.  I would hope that the parties could carry out the
process by agreement,
but the remedy available is a reference under Part 72.
Counsel should submit draft minutes of an order and nominate a suitable
referee.
