PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS - DUTY NOT TO MISLEAD COURT.
At the hearing of a contested application by the
lessee and/or occupant of two
properties for an interlocutory injunction, the defendant deliberately misled
the Court concerning
a proper occupation fee for one property.  On discovering
this, the plaintiffs applied for a review of the conditions of the injunction
imposed in relation to both properties.  HELD that, had the original judge
known that the defendant was deliberately misleading the
Court concerning a
proper occupation fee in respect of one property, this may have made a
difference in the conditions imposed in
respect of the other property; that
those conditions should be reviewed; and upon review, that less onerous
conditions should be
imposed.

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	On 27 July this year Young J decided an interlocutory application
for injunction in these proceedings. He granted an injunction
in favour of the
lessee and/or occupant of certain premises at Darling Harbour on a condition
that certain sums be paid to the defendant
lessor.  In relation to the premises
known as Cohibar, the condition was that $12,245.00 per month be paid in
respect of the period
from 1 May 1999 to 31 October 1999, and thereafter, until
further order, the sum of $15,000.00 per month. In respect of the premises
known as Jordans, the condition was that a sum of $105,000.00 be paid on or
before 30 September 1999, this being in respect of rent
prior to 1 May 1999,
and also the full rent under the lease of that premise in respect of the period
from 1 May 1999 until further
order, the amount of that rent being in the order
of $54,000.00 per month.
<P>

2  	It later appeared that Young J had been misled by the defendant
in relation to an appropriate occupation fee for Cohibar. The
plaintiffs then
filed a Notice of Motion seeking an order that the conditions of the injunction
be set aside and that, instead of
those conditions, the plaintiffs pay $6,250
per month from 1 May 1999 in respect of Cohibar, and one half of the stated
rent for
Jordans as from 1 August 1999. That application came before Santow J
on 18 August 1999, and it was stood over by him to be finally
dealt with by me
today.
<P>

3  	In the course of so doing, Santow J delivered a judgment setting
out the history of the matter and making a decision concerning
costs, namely,
that the defendant pay on an indemnity basis the plaintiffs' costs of and
incidental to the hearing on 18 August,
and the plaintiffs' costs of 27 July
1999.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

4  	Before me the parties have agreed that a figure of $11,875.00 per
month will be the occupation fee for Cohibar until further
order, or the final
hearing of the case. It is common ground that that figure should apply at least
as from 1 September 1999.  The
dispute on Cohibar before me concerns what
occupation fee should be paid in respect of the period from 1 May to 31 August.
The defendant
contends that it should be the same figure of $11,875.00 per
month; the plaintiffs contend  that it should be no more than $6,250.00
per
month.
<P>

5  	The main dispute before me, however, has concerned whether there
should be any revision of the conditions concerning the premises
Jordans. In
short, the defendant contends that the court was not misled in any way relevant
to those premises. The plaintiffs contend
that the circumstances justify a
reconsideration of that aspect of the conditions as well. In short, the
plaintiffs say that the
defendant should not get any advantage from a hearing
in which, on the plaintiffs' submission, the defendant deliberately misled
the
court; and further that there is now material, namely, evidence that the
defendant deliberately misled the court, which makes
it just that the matter be
reconsidered and a different result arrived at.
<P>

<b><u>MISLEADING THE COURT</u></b>
<P>

6  	One matter which I should first consider is how to characterize
the misleading of the court at the hearing before Young J. It
is apparent that
the court was misled by the tendering of the front pages of certain leases, of
premises said to be comparable to
Cohibar, showing a particular rent, without
also tendering other provisions of those leases which indicated that
substantial incentives
or rent holidays were given in relation to those leases.
That matter, it appears, was exacerbated by evidence led by the defendant
to
the effect that the rent stated in those leases was being paid, when in fact in
respect of some, or all, of the leases there were
rent holidays or concessions
still operative. The misleading of the court by that evidence, as Santow J
pointed out, could be innocent,
careless, or deliberate.
<P>

7  	Before Santow J, no attempt was made to explain how the
misleading of the court came about, and Santow J offered the defendant
an
opportunity to put on that material. Santow J noted:
<P>

<b><i>The defendant declined to take up that opportunity, rather it sought that
the matter wait for determination of what has been described
as a "final"
interlocutory hearing by Hodgson CJ in Eq on 10 September 1999.</i></b>
<P>

8  	Before me also no attempt has been made by the defendant to
explain how the court came to be misled. Quite plainly, the defendant
has had
an ample opportunity to offer such an explanation and has chosen not to do so.
It seems to me that if the misleading of the
court was innocent, or even
careless, one would have expected an explanation and an apology to be offered.
In circumstance where
this has not happened, and apparently has not happened by
a deliberate choice, I think I should infer that the misleading of the
court
was deliberate. In many cases such a finding would be the equivalent of a
finding of fraud.  However, this is not a case where
fraud has been
specifically charged, and certainly not specifically charged against any
person. In those circumstances, I would not
find fraud against any person.
However, I think it is appropriate to make a finding that the defendant
deliberately misled the court
in the hearing before Young J.  In making that
finding I would emphasise, as did Santow J, that there is no finding adverse to
the
legal advisers of the defendant.
<P>

9  	The effect of the misleading of the court, as it now appears, was
merely to support a finding that $15,000.00 per month  was
an appropriate
occupation fee for Cohibar, whereas the parties have now agreed that, at least
as from the present, an appropriate
fee would be just under $12,000.00. On one
view of the matter, therefore, the misleading of the court was not in relation
to a matter
having very significant financial consequences.
<P>

<b><u>SUBMISSIONS</u></b>
<P>

10  	As I have already said, it is common ground that the
circumstances justify varying the condition in relation to Cohibar. The
substantial question is whether they justify varying the conditions in relation
to Jordans.
<P>

11  	Mr Sullivan, QC, for the plaintiffs has provided written
submissions which I will leave with the papers.  In substance he submits
that
the defendant should get no advantage whatsoever from a hearing at which the
defendant misled the court. Furthermore, he submits
the Court was misled
indirectly in relation to matters affecting Jordans, in that it treated the
case as being one between two parties
acting bona fide, whereas in truth one
was deliberately seeking to mislead the court. He submitted that this was
relevant to the
court's approach to the discretionary adjustment of matters to
occur up to the final hearing of the case. 
<P>

12  	Mr Sullivan submitted that the restriction on applications to
vary interlocutory orders, being based inter alia on the public
policy of
finality of litigation, was displaced by the public policy supporting the right
of a party to a fair hearing. He submitted
that it was impossible to say
whether or not Young J would have resolved the matter in the same way had he
been aware of the deliberate
attempt to mislead him. Looking at the matter
having regard to that circumstance, there was a compelling case in favour of
the plaintiffs
that it should not be required to pay any rent in respect of
Jordans prior to 1 May this year, and that thereafter it should have
to pay no
more than about three quarters of the rent.
<P>

13  	Mr Robinson for the defendant submitted that Young J's decision
was based on matters of principle decided by him which were
entirely
independent of the value for occupation purposes of Cohibar.  Young J found
that there was no agreement between the parties
as to non-payment of rent, but
an arguable case for an estoppel, and that it was appropriate that the current
rent be paid for Jordans
plus some of the back rent. In imposing the conditions
which he imposed in relation to Jordans, there was an exercise of discretion
which has not miscarried and which is unassailable.
<P>

14  	Mr Robinson referred me to a number of cases dealing with the
limited circumstances in which interlocutory orders may be varied,
including<b>
</b><u>Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Limited v Philip Morris Inc</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981)
148 CLR 170</a>, <u>Woods v Sheriff of Queensland</u> (1895) QLJ 163 and<b>
</b><u>Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print</u>, McLelland CJ in Eq, 19 September
1988.
<P>

15  	In any event, Mr Robinson submitted, there was no probability
that, even if Young J had been aware of the misleading of the
court, he would
have come to any different view concerning Jordans. All the material he relied
on was material submitted by the plaintiffs.
There was no material relied on by
the defendant dependent upon the credibility of the defendant's principals or
employees. A closer
examination of the material confirmed that Young J was
correct in holding there was no concluded agreement, but that there was a
question to be tried concerning estoppel. In imposing the conditions, Young J
had struck a reasonable balance. 
<P>

16  	Mr Robinson pointed out that this was not a case in which any
application was made to set aside the whole of Justice Young's
decision.  It
was not an application based on fraud, but only an application to vary and, in
accordance with the principles concerning
variation of interlocutory orders, it
would be appropriate to vary only so much of the order as was really affected
by the misleading
of the court. Mr Robinson submitted that it was not
appropriate to treat this as an occasion for punishment of the defendant, in
that any appropriate punishment had occurred through the imposition of costs
orders by Santow J. Now the court should do no more
than seek to achieve the
just result on the material now before the court.
<P>

<b><u>DECISION</u></b>
<P>

17  	Both sides accepted the principle that the defendant should not
profit from misleading the court. However, as I indicated,
the defendant's
contention was that the only possible profit was a very small amount in respect
to the Cohibar rent. As I have also
noted, Mr Sullivan submitted that the
profit was more extensive than that. 
<P>

18  	In a sense, it might be said that the court was also misled
because in deciding the case, it did so in ignorance of the fact
that one party
was deliberately seeking to mislead it.
<P>

19  	However, it seems to me that in the circumstances of this case
it is a little artificial to treat that circumstance as a further
misleading of
the court from which the defendant should not profit.
<P>

20  	It is also common ground that the circumstances are sufficient
to justify reconsidering the interlocutory injunction to some
extent. In my
opinion, in this reconsideration, the court is not strictly limited to
reconsidering the matter in respect of which
the court was directly misled. The
court now knows that in the hearing before Young J there was a deliberate
attempt to mislead the
court, and I think it is fair to say that, had Young J
known of that, it could have affected the whole of his approach to the matter.
Accordingly, I do not accept that the court is limited to reconsidering the
conditions in relation to Cohibar. The real question
is whether I should
reconsider, and perhaps vary, the conditions in relation to Jordans, because of
the possibility that Young J
might have decided the case differently if he had
known that one party was deliberately trying to mislead him, as I now know.
<P>

21  	This is not a case where it is sought to set aside the whole
judgment, and there is no specific allegation of fraud. I think,
in those
circumstances, I must still give weight to the original decision. I accept the
submission that I am not now seeking to punish
the defendant, although I am
seeking to prevent an advantage being obtained by the defendant by its
misleading of the court, and
I am attempting to do what is fair between the
parties in the light of all the circumstances now known.
<P>

22  	On the whole, I think it would be unfair to the plaintiffs to
proceed on the basis that it would have made no difference to
Young J's
decision if he had known the truth about the conduct of the case before him. It
is impossible to know one way or the other,
but it seems to me  that this
impossibility should not redound to the benefit of the defendant.
<P>

23  	I am dealing with a situation which is only to apply for a few
months, and which can be adjusted after the final hearing, so
that it does not
in any way finally deal with the rights of the parties.  In those
circumstances, I think it is reasonable to take
a broad brush approach. Taking
that approach, I think it would be appropriate to remove the requirement for
payment of back rent
of $100,000.00.  It seems to me that that was
substantially foregone by the defendant, albeit not in a way that necessarily
made
it irrecoverable, but, in my opinion, in a way which, in all the
circumstances of the case, including the defendant's deliberate
attempt to
mislead the court, make it inappropriate to require payment of that amount as a
price of interlocutory relief.
<P>

24  	In relation to rent from 1 May onwards, in my opinion, the
appropriate condition is to require the payment of full rent from
the present,
but leaving standing the payment which occurred for the month of August.
<P>

25  	In relation to Cohibar, the only question is the rent between
May and August inclusive, and in my opinion that should be paid
at the rate of
$6,250.00.  Although there is some force in Mr Robinson's submission that the
agreement of the parties implies that
a fair figure is $11,875.00, the
agreement explicitly only applies from September into the future, and I am not
able to know all
the considerations that went into both parties agreeing to
that figure.  It seems to me that if I were to allow that figure for an
earlier
period, that may be giving the defendant some advantage from its misleading of
the court.  So for that reason, I would make
it the lower figure which was
offered by the plaintiffs.
<P>

26  	As regard costs, I am treating this as an ordinary contested
interlocutory application for injunction. The plaintiffs have
been
substantially successful, and I think it appropriate that the costs of this
application be the plaintiffs' costs in the proceedings.
<P>

27  	Mr Sullivan has applied for an order that the costs the subject
of Justice Santow's order be payable forthwith.  I am not minded
to make such
an order.
<P>

28  	I will direct that Short Minutes be brought in.
<P>

29  	The exhibits may be returned.
