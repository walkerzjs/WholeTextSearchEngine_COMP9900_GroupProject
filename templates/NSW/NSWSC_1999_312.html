<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - difference in substance - <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act, 1974</a> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(2))</a></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Amendments have been made to the imputations pleaded in
paragraphs 4 and 6 of the Statement of Claim which, I gather,
to a great
extent, have eliminated areas of dispute that hitherto existed.  Imputation
4(d):  delete the word "<i>underprivileged"</i> and insert "<i>Aboriginal
Community</i>".  Imputations 6(a), (b), (c) and (d):  substitute the word
"<i>organise</i>" for "<i>run</i>".  Imputation 8(e):  delete the word
"<i>underprivileged".</i>
<P>

2	In relation to the imputations as pleaded in paragraph 4 arising from the
first publication (Schedule A), I am not persuaded that
the use in the
imputations relevantly of the word "<i>run</i>" a two day conference, is
incapable of arising merely because in the body of the matter complained of,
there is reference to, amongst
other things, 28 days of preparation (in line
23) and 20 days of post conference implementation (in lines 4 and 5).
<P>

3	On the capacity argument, the imputations in that respect are reasonably
available by virtue of the reasonably arising sting as
to the "<i>fee"</i>, vis
a vis, a two day conference.  The ordinary reasonable reader, on reading the
whole of the matter in my view would not be induced
by its totality to focus on
"<i>pre"</i> and "<i>post"</i> periods to the elimination of that critical two
day factor.
<P>

4	As to the second component in relation to the imputations pleaded in
paragraph 4(a), that the matter is incapable of conveying
anything to the
effect that Mr Dodson charged "<i>personally"</i> the amount in dispute by
reason of there being reference to his company, again, the ordinary reasonable
reader could, on reading
the matter complained of, with facility, come to the
conclusion that it was personalised in terms of a payment of the $81,000 and
the mention of the consultant "<i>firm"</i> in my view would not derogate from
that. Imputations 4(a) to (e) will go to the jury.
<P>

5	In relation to the imputations pleaded in paragraph 6 arising from the second
matter complained of, the objection is taken to
imputations (b) and (e) in that
they do not differ in substance. Those imputations read:
<P>

	<i>"6(b)	that the plaintiff overcharged for his consultancy services by having
personally charged $81,000 to run a two day conference
which had no agenda for
the one of the two days other than a five hour dinner;</i>
<P>

	<i>(e)	that the plaintiff is such a greedy person that he had overcharged by
about $50,000 more than the standard applicable in the conference
organisation
industry".</i>
<P>

6	Of this I am not persuaded.  In relation to this matter complained of, by
reason especially of the component in the latter imputation
of the reference to
conference organisation "<i>industry standard"</i> which can be contrasted with
in (b) for example, the running of a two day conference which had no agenda for
one day, other than
a five hour dinner, there is the requisite difference.  The
imputations pleaded in paragraph 6 will go to the jury.
<P>

7	The remaining argument relates to imputations pleaded in paragraph 8 arising
from the third matter complained of.  That could
be disposed of by the capacity
argument in relation to imputation (f) where it is contended by the defendant
that the component of
"<i>fraudulently</i>" is incapable, on a reasonable
basis, of arising notwithstanding the one reference to the word "<i>fraud</i>"
in line 10 of Schedule C to the Statement of Claim.  Whilst it might be
arguably suggested for the plaintiff that it appears, or
could appear, rather
that lines 8 to 10 are irrelevant to the theme, the view available to that
effect would not be sufficient in
my view to sustain the component of
"<i>fraudulently"</i> in imputation 8(f).  Certainly that which is pleaded in
paragraph 6 is capable of arising from the whole of the matter, not indeed
excluding line 1 which refers to greed.  But, in the instant article,
notwithstanding its brevity, the use of the word "<i>fraud</i>" on a reasonable
reading gives focus to the matter being dealt with by ICAC and it would not be
a reasonable reading to extrapolate
from that one reference, that quality to
the plaintiff.
<P>

8	Imputation (f) as pleaded I find to be incapable of arising.
<P>

9	Imputations (a) to (e) will go to the jury.
<P>

10	This is the first occasion where, since a ruling in the trial I am hearing,
the issue has arisen where I find that a pleaded
imputation is incapable of
being conveyed.  Hitherto, it has been the usual practice that the order is
made that the imputation does
not go to the jury.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 2(a)</a> says: <i>"If the Court determines that the matter is not
reasonably capable of carrying the imputation pleaded by the plaintiff, the
Court
is to enter a verdict for the defendant in relation to the imputation
pleaded</i>".  That is the view I have, unless someone persuades me otherwise.
Accordingly I will enter a verdict for the defendant in relation
to imputation
8(f).  To make it clear, I accept the defendant's proposition in relation to
"<i>fraudulently</i>" in relation to imputation 8(f) and I enter the verdict
accordingly.  
<P>

11	I am not however persuaded that the motion of "<i>dishonestly"</i> is
incapable of arising.
<P>

12	The defendant in my view should pay the plaintiff's costs of today as it has
predominantly failed.  The parties have liberty
to file by consent orders and
directions in the Registry. Liberty to restore the matter to the defamation
list on three days' notice.
