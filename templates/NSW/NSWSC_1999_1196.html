<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>8 December 1999</b>
<P>

<b>THE CENTRAL ISSUE</b>
<P>

1   	Are breaches of the rules of procedural fairness -- in a
referee making additional enquiries about a matter of significance
to his
Report but only informing the parties in his report or in the aftermath  --  of
such significance as in the circumstances
to give rise to a reasonable
apprehension of bias against the party dissatisfied with the referee's
valuation?  Should such apprehended
bias be found, though subsequent orders be
made to permit the parties to make submissions and augment the evidence before
the Referee
on those matters of further enquiry, where the Referee's report was
not adopted but referred back to him for further report?  And
finally does a
refusal to participate in a further hearing, to enable the Referee to state his
or her position, amount to an imputed
waiver of any claim of apprehended
bias?
<P>

<b>OVERVIEW</b>
<P>

2   	The Plaintiffs on 29 June 1999 by Notice of Motion sought
the removal of Mr Frank Fischl as Referee, alleging reasonable apprehension
of
bias by reason of the likelihood of pre-judgment.  Mr Fischl was appointed as
an expert to determine the value of units in a unit
trust.  He had been
originally appointed by order dated 30 October 1997.  He has since reported
but, by virtue of orders I have earlier
made he was required to review his
determination of value, following further submissions from the parties.  Those
orders were made
because I was satisfied that the parties were denied
procedural fairness and my orders were directed to redressing that position.
This was because the referee had, as he disclosed openly in his Report, made
certain enquiries into receivership files bearing upon
his conclusions, though
after they had been reached;  this was without advising the parties at the
time, so they were denied the
opportunity to then consider that material and
make any submissions.  Subsequently, further enquiries form two <i>possible</i>
potential buyers of the underlying assets were revealed by the Referee.  The
Plaintiffs rely on the cumulative effect of those events
for their contention
that the Referee should be disqualified for apprehended bias by reason of
prejudgment and a new Referee appointed
in his stead to redetermine the same
questions.
<P>

3   	The Defendants contend that there can be no reasonable
apprehension of bias in the circumstances.  They contend that the present
Referee should rather be required, as contemplated by my previous orders, to
afford the parties the opportunity to review the consulted
material, call the
two possibly potential buyers to test why they did not proceed insofar as
relevant to value, and to make any further
submissions arising therefrom.
<P>

4   	Following written and oral argument, I concluded on 4
November 1999 against the Plaintiffs' application, with reasons to follow.
 I
now set out those reasons as well as foreshadow the orders which should be
made, subject to hearing the parties on their final
form.
<P>

<b>CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</b>
<P>

5   	The Plaintiffs submit that in the circumstances of this
reference, a fair-minded observer might reasonably doubt that the questions
now
before the Referee could be dealt with by him without bias by reason of the
likelihood of pre-judgment (<i>Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 288).</a>
<P>

6   	The Plaintiffs rely on the test propounded in
<i>Livesey</i> by the High Court (at 300) quoted below:
<P>

"A fair minded observer might entertain a reasonable apprehension of bias by
reason of pre-judgment if a Judge sits to hear a case
at first instance after
he has, in a previous case, expressed clear views either about a question of
fact which constitutes a live
and significant issue in the subsequent case or
about the credit of a witness whose evidence is of significance on such a
question
of fact."
<P>

7   	The Plaintiffs refer to the fact that the Referee in this
instance has already expressed clear views about a question of fact
as set out
in paragraph 7.6 of the Referee's report of 12 March 1999 which I quote
below:
<P>

"7.6	In my opinion, there can be no better indication of value of the plant and
equipment than that ($450,000) which was realised
by the Receiver and Manager
after having advertised the business for sale and not having received any offer
other than from Mr Wong."
<P>

8   	The Plaintiffs contend that in the circumstances described
below, the further consideration by the Referee of additional evidence
and
submissions, as contemplated by my orders of 21 April 1999 and 10 June 1999,
would involve that Referee having as a live and
significant issue in that
further consideration, that very question of fact about which the Referee had
already expressed clear views.
 That, they contend, necessarily gives rise to a
reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of pre-judgment on that matter.
<P>

9   	The Plaintiffs also put the case for bias as within either
the third or fourth categories identified by Deane J in <i>Webb v the Queen</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 41</a> at 74:
<P>

"The area covered by the doctrine of disqualification by reason of the
appearance of bias encompasses at least four distinct, though
sometimes
overlapping, main categories of case.  The first is disqualification by
interest, that is to say, cases where some direct
or indirect interest in the
proceedings, whether pecuniary or otherwise, gives rise to a reasonable
apprehension of prejudice, partiality
or prejudgment.  The second is
disqualification by conduct, including published statements.  That category
consists of cases in which
conduct, either in the course of, or outside, the
proceedings, gives rise to such an apprehension of bias.  The third category is
disqualification by association.  It will often overlap the first (28) and
consist of cases where the apprehension of prejudgment
or other bias results
from some direct or indirect relationship, experience or contact with a person
or persons interested in, or
otherwise involved in, the proceedings.  The
fourth is disqualification by extraneous information.  It will commonly overlap
the
third (29) and consists of cases where knowledge of some prejudicial but
inadmissible fact or circumstance gives rise to the apprehension
of bias."
<P>

(28)	e.g., a case where a dependent spouse or child has a direct pecuniary
interest in the proceedings.
<P>

(29)	e.g., a case where a judge is disqualified by reason of having heard some
earlier case:  see, e.g., <i>Livesey v NSW Bar Association</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR
288</a>;  <i>Australian National Industries Ltd v Spedley Securities Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
26 NSWLR 411.</a>
<P>

<b>LEGAL PRINCIPLES</b>
<P>

10   	It is convenient that I first set out the applicable legal
principles, in a series of propositions.  
<P>

<b>Bias - the legal test</b>
<P>

11   	The proper test for judicial or quasi judicial bias in
Australia is as stated by the High Court in <i>Webb v  The Queen </i>(supra) at
47 (per Mason CJ and McHugh J, affirming the statements of principle in
<i>Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 288</a> and <i>Re
JRL; Ex parte CJL</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 342</a> at 352):
<P>

"When it is alleged that a judge has been or might be actuated by bias, this
Court has held that the proper test is whether fair-minded
people might
reasonably apprehend or suspect that the judge has prejudged or might prejudge
the case.  The Court has applied the
same test to a Commissioner of the
Australian Industrial Relations Commission and to a member of the Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal.
 The Court has specifically rejected the real likelihood
of bias test.  The principle behind the reasonable apprehension or suspicion
test is that it is of `fundamental importance that justice should not only be
done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen
to be done' ".
<P>

Courts are reluctant to ascertain whether the decision-maker was actually
biased;  Deane J in <i>Webb</i> at 74 went so far as to indicate that the
Australian test is so broad as to make an appellate court enquiry into whether
an impugned
decision maker was in fact biased both unnecessary and
inappropriate but so far no other High Court judge has gone as far.  In any
event, reasonable apprehension of bias requires no finding of actual bias;
contrast <i>R v Gough</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%20646" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC 646</a> with its test of "real danger of bias"
in the UK.  See generally Aronson and Dyer "Judicial Review of Administrative
Action," LBC
Information Services 1996 at 590-591.
<P>

12   	The fair-minded person has been described in different
ways: for example, the reasonable person (<i>Vakauta v Kelly</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20167%20CLR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 167 CLR
568)</a>; the reasonably minded observer (<i>Goktas v GIO </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 684)</a>;
an objective and reasonable person (<i>Raybos Australia Pty Limited v Tectran
Corporation Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20272" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 272</a> at 275).  Thus Deane J in
<i>Webb</i> at 67 quoting <i>Livesey</i> (supra) at 293:
<P>

"whether, in all the circumstances, a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge
of the material objective facts `might entertain a
reasonable apprehension that
[the judge] might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the
resolution of the question' in
issue."
<P>

As was said in <i>Livesey</i> at 294 per Mason, Murphy, Brennan, Deane, and
Dawson JJ, this does not mean that a judge should automatically stand aside at
a suggestion
of prejudgment or apprehended bias:
<P>

"...it would be an abdication of judicial function and an encouragement of
procedural bias for a judge to adopt the approach that
he should automatically
disqualify himself whenever he was requested by one party so to do on the
grounds of a possible appearance
of prejudgment or bias, regardless of whether
the other party had desired that the matter be dealt with by him as the judge
to whom
the hearing of the case had been entrusted by the ordinary procedures
and practice of the particular court."
<P>

13   	Proof of bias in either sense is determined according to
the civil standard of proof. What must be established in relation
to
apprehended bias is a "reasonable" apprehension of "a possibility" of bias;
<i>Webb</i> per Deane J at 71.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s140.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 140</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act </i>1995</a>
(NSW) directs the Court's attention to the nature of the subject matter of what
has to be proven, in applying the civil standard
of proof.  Because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s140.html" class="autolink_findacts">s140(2)</a>
preserves the doctrine in <i>Briginshaw v Briginshaw </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336</a> at
361-2, an allegation of the gravity of bias, even apprehended, must be "firmly
established": <i>R v Lusink Ex parte Shaw </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2032%20ALR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 32 ALR 47</a>; <i>R v Carter
and the Attorney-General</i> (Supreme Court of Tasmania, Cox, Underwood and
Spicer JJ, October 1991, unreported).  Nonetheless it is "the possibility" of
bias
that must be so established, based on a criterion of reasonableness of
apprehension.
<P>

14   	In <i>Dovade Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Westpac Banking Group
&amp; Anor</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/113.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 113</a> (at para 92) the Court of Appeal approved the
following remarks of Tadgell JA in <i>Gascar v Ellicott</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20VR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 VR 332</a> at
342:
<P>

"Although the criterion of apprehension of partiality or prejudice is
possibility, not likelihood, a reasonable apprehension is
to be established to
the court's satisfaction:  it is a reasonable and not a fanciful or fantastic
apprehension that is to be established;
 and the apprehension is to be
attributed to an observer who is "fair-minded"  --  which means "reasonable".
As Mason CJ and McHugh
J pointed out in <i>Webb v R</i> at 52  "... it is the
court's view of the public's view, not the court's own view, which is
determinative".  Even so, the court is
to be satisfied that the criterion
<i>is</i> met not that it <i>might</i> be.  In <i>Builders' Registration Board
of Queensland v Rauber</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2057%20ALJR%20376" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 57 ALJR 376</a> at 384, Brennan J observed
that:
<P>

Each of the indicia which a party proves and relies upon to show a reasonable
suspicion [which is to be substantially equated with
a reasonable apprehension]
of bias must be examined, and the Court is called on to determine whether, upon
such indicia, a reasonable
suspicion of bias arises.
<P>

(The parenthetical clause in the passage cited from Brennan J is added by
Tadgell JA.)
<P>

15   	In <i>Re JRL; Ex parte CJL</i> (supra) Mason J at 352
emphasised that the test from <i>R v Watson ;  Ex parte Armstrong</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976)
136 CLR 248</a> and <i>Livesey</i> (supra) referred to a reasonable apprehension of
a lack of impartiality or of the existence of prejudice, not merely an
apprehension
that the judicial officer would decide the case adversely to a
party.  Thus previous statements or conduct of the judge which might
lead to an
expectation that the case will be decided in a particular way were insufficient
to constitute a ground for reasonably
apprehending bias.  What must be shown is
a propensity to prejudgment, derived from a prejudiced or partial mind, or
conduct giving
rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a prejudiced or
partial mind.  The relevant passage from Mason J's judgment concludes:
<P>

"There may be many situations in which previous decisions of a judicial officer
on issues of fact and law may generate an expectation
that he is likely to
decide issues in a particular case adversely to one of the parties.  But this
does not mean either that he will
approach the issues in that case otherwise
than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in the sense in which that
expression is
used in the authorities or that his previous decisions provide an
acceptable basis for inferring that there is a reasonable apprehension
that he
will approach the issues in this way.  In cases of this kind, disqualification
is only made out by showing that there is
a reasonable apprehension of bias by
reason of prejudgment and this must be `firmly established'."
<P>

16   	More recently in a striking case, <i>Barbosa v Di
Meglio</i> ([1999] NSWCA 307, 26 February 1999, unreported) the Court of Appeal
drew three distinctions.  They reflect a disinclination to find
a reasonable
apprehension of prejudgment merely because a prior finding might suggest one
outcome rather than another, or merely
by reason of error though persistent, or
of unappealing judicial behaviour.  At para 9 this is explained by Mason P (of
which the
first and third distinctions are of particular relevance here).  
<P>

"9	In the present context it is important to draw three distinctions.  First,
the litigant's right is to have a tribunal that is
free of prejudgment.  The
litigant is not entitled to a tribunal that is predisposed to accept or reject
any particular proposition.
 An open mind is not an empty one. .....
<P>

10	In the <i>Queen v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission;  ex
parte Angliss Group</i>  (1969) 122 CLR 546 at 553-4 the High Court reminds
that:
<P>

.... requirements of natural justice are not infringed by a mere lack of nicety
but only when it is firmly established that a suspicion
may reasonably be
engendered in the minds of those who come before the tribunal or in the minds
of the public that the tribunal or
a member or members of it may not bring to
the resolution of the questions arising before the tribunal fair and
unprejudiced minds.
 Such a mind is not necessarily a mind which has not given
thought to the subject matter or one which, having thought about it, has
not
formed any views or inclination of mind upon or with respect to it.
<P>

See also <i>Re JRL; Ex parte CJL</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 342</a> at 352.
<P>

11	The corollary is that error, even persisting error, in holding a particular
legal position is not the criterion of reasonable
apprehension of bias.  It may
be evidence of the same, but capacity for error is universal.  Error may be
corrigible through argument
or by appellate processes.  But it does not <i>per
se</i> establish a reasonable apprehension of bias.
<P>

12	The second distinction is that which lies between unappealing judicial
behaviour and appealable judicial behaviour (cf <i>Dovade</i> at 107).  Minds
and practices will inevitably differ as to how robust a judge may be (or
appear) before reasonable apprehension of
bias is established in a particular
case.  Ultimately an appellate judge must form his or her own judgment ....
.
<P>

13	The third distinction relates to attitudes disclosed by remarks made during
argument and attitudes evidenced by the final determination
of a trial judge
.... .  The vigour of the primary judge's early expressed reaction to the
[expert's] report may not be a model of
judicial behaviour, but it did not have
the effect of driving his Honour from the judgment seat."
<P>

17   	Pre-judgment may be of law or fact.  If of law, it is not
enough that a judge has determined a legal issue in the past in
a particular
way.  Indeed as Hayne J said in <i>Helljay Investments Pty Ltd v Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2032%20ACSR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 32 ACSR 625</a> at 630 (para 12):
<P>

"The principles about apprehension of bias must be understood in the context of
a judicial system founded in precedent and directed
to establishing, and
maintaining, consistency of judicial decision so that like cases are treated
alike and principles of law are
applied uniformly.  The bare fact that a
judicial officer has earlier expressed an opinion on questions of law will
therefore seldom,
if ever, warrant a conclusion of appearance of bias, no
matter how important that opinion may have been to the disposition of the
past
case or how important it may be to the outcome of the instant case.  Fidelity
to precedent and consistency may make it very
likely that the same opinion
about a question of law will be expressed in both cases.  But that stops well
short of saying that the
judicial officer will not listen to and properly
consider arguments against the earlier holding."
<P>

18   	What is necessary for prejudgment amounting to bias is
that the judge concerned has closed his or her mind to argument on
the point;
see Young J in <i>Challenge Finance Ltd v Forshaw No. 3</i> (Supreme Court of
NSW, 16 February 1995, unreported) and compare <i>Smits v Buckworth
</i>(Supreme Court of NSW, 22 September 1997, unreported).
<P>

19   	Where, <i>in a previous trial</i>, determinations of fact
or credit have been made, these prior findings may be sufficient to require the
disqualification of the judge
at a later trial on the ground of bias evidenced
through prejudgment (<i>Australian National Industries Ltd v Spedley Securities
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 411)</a>, though it is important not to express that
proposition in absolute terms.  Thus, for example, the same judge may without
appearance
of  bias sit in a series of interlocutory applications relating to
interconnected cases, as distinct from the later substantive trial;
compare
<i>Re JRL; Ex parte CJL</i> (supra) at 352, <i>R v Masters</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR
450</a>, <i>Rozenes &amp; Anor v Judge Kelly</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1996/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] VicRp 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20VR%20320" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 VR 320</a> and <i>Gascor v
Ellicott</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20VR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 VR 332.</a>  Further consideration of a particular factual
issue by a referee, before his report is adopted by the court, falls into a
similar
category.  The overriding test remains that of the reasonable
fair-minded observer in <i>Webb</i>.
<P>

20   	Indeed in the United Kingdom, though the arguably less
stringent "real danger of bias" test is applied, the Court of Appeal
in
<i>Locobail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield</i> Times Law Reports 9 November 1999 (Lord
Bingham, Lord Woolf and Sir Richard Scott in a joint judgment) addressed the
issue in terms
which differentiate the degree to which prior findings of credit
should matter in terms of apprehended bias concluding that it would
be found in
those more extreme cases:
<P>

"...if, in a case where the credibility of any individual were an issue to be
decided by the judge, he had in a previous case rejected
that person's evidence
in such outspoken terms as to throw doubt on his ability to approach such a
person's evidence with an open
mind on any later occasion:  or if on any
question at issue the judge had expressed views, particularly in the course of
the hearing,
in such extreme and unbalanced terms as to throw doubt on his
ability to try the issue, with an objective judicial mind or if for
any other
reason there were real ground for doubting the judge's ability to ignore
extraneous considerations, prejudices and predilections
and bring an objective
judgment to bear on the issues before him.
<P>

But then the Court importantly added:
<P>

The mere fact that a judge, earlier in the same case or in a previous case, had
commented adversely on a party or witness, or found
the evidence of a party or
witness to be unreliable, would not, without more, found a sustainable
objection."
<P>

21   	As Hayne J said in <i>Helljay Investments Pty Ltd</i>
(supra), "what must be demonstrated to the requisite degree is the appearance
of pre-judgment, not simply that a particular outcome
of the litigation is
likely or unlikely", citing Mason CJ in <i>Re JRL; Ex parte CJL</i> (supra).
<P>

22   	There can be a distinction between credit issues in regard
to non-expert evidence and observations on reliability or expertise
in regard
to expert witnesses, such that pre-conceived views in the latter may not
constitute bias where based on the judge's accumulated
experience from
observing such expert witnesses in prior cases:  <i>Vakauta v Kelly</i> (supra)
at 571; <i>Bilgin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20149%20ALR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 149 ALR 281</a> per Finkelstein J.
<P>

23   	And in <i>Galea v Galea</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 263</a> at 279 per
Kirby A-CJ:
<P>

"In judging the suggestion of a supervening apprehension of bias, it is
reasonable to assume that the hypothetical lay observer
would base the opinion
on a fair assessment of the judge's conduct in the context of the whole of the
trial.  A judgment of the loss
of impartiality and neutrality would not be made
from a short and emotional exchange taken out of context and then weighed in
isolation."
<P>

24   	Depending on its forensic context, comment may cross the
line into bias, tested by reference to the reasonable apprehension
of the
hypothetical observer;  see for example in <i>Goktas v Government Insurance
Office of NSW</i> (supra) and <i>R v Lars</i> (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 30
June 1994, unreported).  Thus there exists an "ill-defined line beyond which
the expression by
a trial judge of preconceived views about the reliability of
particular [expert] witnesses could threaten the appearance of imported
justice". (<i>Vakauta</i> at 571 per Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ).  Here, I
would add, we are weighing up whether there is the possibility of <i>future</i>
prejudgment in conclusions that are anticipated, following <i>after</i> the
opportunity for further evidence and submission and notwithstanding such
strictures as are expressed in this judgment to the
Referee.
<P>

<b>Waiver</b>
<P>

25   	It is the law in Australia that bias can be waived:
<i>Vakauta v Kelly</i>.
<P>

26   	A party should object at the time to the remarks or
conduct which go to the reasonable apprehension of bias.  But in certain
circumstances the view is taken that in the absence of a conscious waiver, the
Court should impute waiver only where it would be
unjust to both parties to
allow the point to be taken at a later stage (<i>Burwood Municipality v
Harvey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2086%20LGERA%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 86 LGERA 389</a> Mahoney JA, Kirby P and Handley JA).
<P>

In <i>Vakuata v Kelly</i> the comment was made by Dawson J at 577 (finding in
obiter that had bias been established it would have been waived because no
objection
was taken to the continuation of the trial before the judge):
<P>

"I do not mean to suggest that an objection will be waived if it is not made in
formal or even explicit terms.  The circumstances
may be such that it is plain,
without it being put into words, that a judge is being asked to consider his
position having regard
to the requirement of impartiality."
<P>

Once an objection is taken, the party's right to complain will not be waived
simply because the party continues to participate in
the case;  <i>Bilgin v The
Minister for Immigration and Multi-cultural Affairs</i> per Finkelstein J
(supra).
<P>

27   	I now deal with the relevant circumstances in more detail.
They are not themselves in dispute.
<P>

<b>RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES</b>
<P>

28   	On 30 October 1997 Young J made consent orders effecting
the purchase of the Plaintiffs' interest in two trusts ("the Trusts")
payment
for which would be the subject of a valuation to be determined by Mr Fischl
("the Referee") pursuant to a formal reference
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 72</a> Supreme Court
Rules.
<P>

29   	There was some delay on the Plaintiffs' part in the
serving and provision of documents required by them for the Referee to
prepare
his report, which was originally ordered to be handed down by 19 December
1997.
<P>

30   	Nonetheless, though these delays did ensue, the Referee
handed down his report on 12 March 1999, valuing the Plaintiffs' interest
in
the Trusts at nil.
<P>

31   	On 19 March 1998 the matter was re-listed before Young J
and the Plaintiffs were granted a further extension to 1 May 1998
to provide
the Referee with evidence and contentions.
<P>

32   	The matter subsequently came before me in April 1999 on a
contested application for the adoption of the Referee's report.
 The Plaintiffs
opposed adoption prompted by the incorporation in the Referee's report of the
following paragraph:
<P>

"At the time of the Court's referral to me (on 30 October 1997) pursuant to
Part 72 of the Supreme Court rules, I was a partner
of Price Waterhouse. On 1
July 1998, Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand merged to become
PricewaterhouseCoopers. As noted
in paragraph 3.3 above, the Receivers and
Managers of Mercap and ICM were from Coopers &amp; Lybrand. As such, I have
availed myself
of the opportunity to review relevant files of the receivership
for the purposes of satisfying myself that the conclusions I have
reached in
relation to the value of the Plumpton Property, the work in progress, the plant
and equipment, and the goodwill of the
business were not inconsistent with
either the available documentation at the time of receivership or my knowledge
of the precast
concrete industry which commenced in late 1974 when I was
involved with the then receivership of Rescrete Industries Pty Limited.
That
company has for some time now been a highly regarded participant in the
industry. My firm has continued to be involved with
the Rescrete group of
companies since then, as indeed have I other than for a period of some 4 years
(1981-1985) when I was with
Price Waterhouse in Fiji."
<P>

33   	The Plaintiffs successfully contended before me that the
Referee had denied natural justice by reason of procedural unfairness
to the
Plaintiffs.  Thus I concluded in my judgment of 17 May 1999 (at para 38):
<P>

"I am satisfied that there has in the present circumstances been a denial to
the Plaintiffs of the proper opportunity of putting
before the Referee
particulars of the contentions relied upon and an opportunity to comment on the
materials reviewed by the Referee
in the relevant files of the receivership. I
am further satisfied that this procedural unfairness can only be appropriately
remedied
by orders of the kind that I have earlier made."
<P>

34   	The orders to which I refer were earlier made on 21 April
1999 prior to giving reasons for the conclusion I had then announced.
I quote
the relevant paragraphs of those orders:
<P>

"1.	a.	Pursuant to Part 13 Rule 13(1)(c) of the Supreme Court Rules remit for
further consideration by the Referee the whole of
the matter referred for a
further Report; and
<P>

b.	Further direct the Referee to take into account in his further Report the
evidence and submissions referred to in order 3 herein
and my reasons, and
<P>

c.	Note that the purpose of the further Report is to resolve whether the
evidence and submissions referred to in Order 3 herein
impact in any way upon
the findings contained in the Referee's Report dated 12 March 1999 and if so,
what the impact is.
<P>

2.	Direct the Referee to provide to the Parties' solicitors by 12 noon on
Tuesday 27 April 1999 copies of the documents inspected
by him from the files
of the Receivership of Mercap and ICM referred to in Appendix A page 27 of his
Report.
<P>

3.	Direct the parties to submit any evidence and submissions to the Referee by
10 May 1999 in respect of the documents provided
pursuant Order 2 herein, or
such further date, subject to there being no delay in relation to the time
provided in Order 4, as the
Referee may direct <i>provided that</i> such
evidence and submissions must be directly relevant to the Referee's
determination of the matter before him.
<P>

4.	Direct the Referee to provide his further Report referred to in Order 1(a)
herein on or before 28 May 1999 by delivering the
same to the Registrar of the
Equity Division of this Court and to the parties."
<P>

35   	In my judgment (para 28) I made clear that there was
nothing improper in the Referee consulting the relevant files of the
receivership and that "one may trust the independence of the Referee in the
present circumstances, notwithstanding that the merger
latterly brought him
into partnership with the receivers".
<P>

36   	There then follows the basis for my making the orders that
I did:
<P>

"... Nonetheless information in the present case which the Receiver's files
would have revealed would necessarily include what is
highly relevant, namely
the efforts made by the Receiver to find purchasers and the responses to those
efforts. Though the Referee
has stated elsewhere in his report that the only
offer received was from Mr Wong that of itself should not deprive the
Plaintiffs
of the opportunity of testing to the extent reasonable the
information which would have been thus made available from the Receiver's
files
in the way I have indicated. It may be that at the end of that process nothing
would have emerged which would lead to any different
conclusion than the
Referee reached, but equally that cannot be assumed.
<P>

What needs to be emphasised is that significance and its consequences is not
diminished by the fact that the Referee reviewed these
files only after having
reached his conclusions. The very fact he saw fit to refer to the files means
they had a potential significance,
though in the end he said they simply
confirmed conclusions already reached. That can be tested by assuming that
instead of being
confirmatory they negated a conclusion earlier reached. "
<P>

37   	Thus it is clear from my earlier quoted orders, the matter
had been referred back to the Referee to provide the parties an
opportunity now
to furnish evidence and make submissions to the Referee in respect of the
document inspected by the Referee.  This
followed the Referee's inspection
earlier of the relevant files of the receivership of the two companies whose
value in turn bore
on the value of the relevant units in the unit trusts.  The
process which followed started on 27 April 1999 when the Referee wrote
the
following letter to both parties' solicitors:
<P>

"As you are aware, Order 2 of the Short Minutes of Order has directed me, as
referee, "to provide to the Parties' solicitors by
12 Noon on Tuesday 27 April
1999 copies of the documents inspected by (me) from the files of the
Receivership of Mercap and ICM referred
to in Appendix A page 27 of (my)
Report."
<P>

In the context of the relevant wording on Appendix A page 27 of my report, I
have interpreted that Order to mean that I have been
directed to provide a copy
of those documents into which I have looked closely.  Accordingly, I have not
considered it necessary
to provide copies of documents that I have not looked
into in any detail.
<P>

Documents that I have not looked into in any detail are those where it was
readily apparent to me from the face of the document(s)
that the document(s)
was not relevant to the valuation of either the goodwill of the business, the
work in progress, the plant and
equipment or the Plumpton Property or those
that were copies of or drafts of documents that I had either looked at in
detail or not.
 Examples of such documents include those relating to insurance
matters, correspondence relating to the receiver and manager's dispute
with Mr
Wong in relation to an assignation fee of $30,000, litigation relating to
collection of debts, sundry correspondence between
the liquidator and the
receivers and managers of ICM, follow up letters to prospective purchasers
seeking to progress efforts in
achieving a sale of the business and setting a
final date for offers to be submitted as well as confidentiality agreements,
and day
to day matters of the receivership.
<P>

Also, I have not provided any copies (drafts or otherwise) of the contracts for
the sale of the Plumpton Property and the plant
and equipment by Mercap to ICM
2000 Pty Limited (including related correspondence).  I understand the former
was executed by Messrs.
Ceccattini and de Michelis and the latter by the
receiver and manager.  Should you require a copy, please advise me.
<P>

Subject to the above, I am providing you herewith a copy "of the documents
inspected by (me) from the files of the Receivership
of Mercap and ICM referred
to in Appendix A page 27 of (my) Report."
<P>

In the event that you consider I have incorrectly interpreted the direction
tome, please let me know."
<P>

38   	On 29 April 1999 the Plaintiffs' solicitors informed the
Referee that he had misconstrued the Court's order and that they
sought
inspection of all documents to which he had referred.
<P>

39   	On 4 May 1999 the Referee responded to the solicitors for
both sides in a letter as follows:
<P>

"You will note that in section 6 of the documents forwarded to you on 27 April
1999 that there is correspondence from both Kevin
Curran of Corotec Pty Limited
and John Burke of Rescrete Industries Pty Limited in respect of the business
that was advertised for
sale by the receiver and manager.
<P>

To the extent that it may be relevant to you in so far as submitting any
evidence and submissions to me, I am advising you that
as I knew both John
Burke and Kevin Curran, I called them.  Notwithstanding that the above
correspondence indicated that neither
of them was going to proceed with an
offer, I nevertheless made the calls on the basis that information not known to
me at the time
may have come to light which may have given me cause to consider
reassessing upwards, the value I was intending to, and ultimately
did, adopt
for each of the goodwill, plant and equipment, work in progress and the
Plumpton Property.  No such information came to
light.  I did not prepare a
file note on my calls.
<P>

My recollection of what John Burke said was that he advised me of the
environmental problems with the site and that the business
suffered from
quality control problems, some of which still existed.
<P>

It is my recollection that Kevin Curran may not have returned my telephone call
until after I had issued my report of 12 March 1999.
 When I did speak to him,
he advised me that he had been looking to invest in a business and that what
was offered for sale did not
meet his criteria.
<P>

This letter also serves to confirm my invitation to you both, which Mr Pomare
has to date accepted, to inspect the files that I
had reviewed and to provide
you wish a copy of any documents that you so request.  This is in lieu of
providing to you from the outset,
a copy of the entire contents of 12
files."
<P>

40   	It should be appreciated that the Referee did not prepare
file notes of his calls on Messrs Curran and Burke, though I do
not attach any
particular significance to that.  The Referee is not a judge taking evidence by
transcript in accordance with the
formal rules.  Rather, Pt 72, r 8(2) Supreme
Court Rules, in its application to referees who are frequently experts,
contemplates
a degree of informality, consistent with an expeditious,
cost-saving approach, though requiring minimum procedural fairness.  Thus
it
simply states that, subject to any direction by the Court:  
<P>

"(a)	the Referee may conduct the proceedings under the reference in such manner
as the Referee thinks fit;
<P>

(b)	the Referee, in conducting proceedings under the reference, is not bound by
rules of evidence that may inform himself or herself
in relation to any matter
in such manner as the Referee thinks fit."
<P>

41   	Furthermore, Pt 72 r 8(3) permits evidence to be given
orally or in writing, again pointing to varying levels of formality.
<P>

42   	In relation to the earlier quoted correspondence, I am
satisfied that there is no suggestion of concealment by the Referee;
 indeed
quite the contrary.  Though in the first instance he was offering to provide
simply those documents into which he had looked
closely, he made quite clear
that there were other documents.  When he was asked for them he readily
provided them.  This was perfectly
reasonable given that there were twelve
files to be inspected.
<P>

43   	Nor is his conduct in writing the letter of 4 May 1999
fairly to be considered other than forthcoming.  The Plaintiffs' complaint
however is that the Referee should have referred to these oral exchanges
between the Referee and Messrs Curran and Burke much earlier;
 that is, at the
time of his original report if not when made.  This is particularly as they
bore upon a matter of central importance
to the valuation of the units, namely
the potential availability of offers other than from Mr Wong.  But for the
initial challenge
to the adoption of the Referee's report and the orders that I
made, these further, and in the Plaintiffs' submission, important,
conversations would never have come to light.
<P>

44   	That much can be accepted.  However, I do not consider
that this reflects on the Referee's frankness or willingness to be
forthcoming
once the orders made brought home to him that the substance of those
conversations was required to be made known to the
parties.  He did this
thereafter unprompted.  There would have been no way of knowing whether or not
those conversations had occurred
unless the Referee had volunteered them, as he
did.  Nor for reasons I develop below, do I consider that this sequence of
events
makes it reasonable to apprehend that the Referee would now close his
mind to any further evidence or submissions that might bear
on those oral
exchanges and their significance in terms of the valuation.
<P>

45   	It is necessary to put these exchanges in context.  The
Receivers when appointed on 18 April 1995 had themselves set about
commissioning a valuation of the plant and equipment together with the vehicles
which were included in the underlying assets and
undertakings of the units in
the relevant unit trust.  The Receivers subsequently prepared an information
memorandum concerning the
sale of the business, plant and equipment and the
land, to be accepted initially no later than 4 pm Wednesday 3 May 1995.
<P>

46   	Responses to the Information Memorandum were received
from:
<P>

(i)	L Crema of Crema Group on 3 May 1995 as to the then cut-off date for offers
for the business.  Mr Crema's letter (p14 Mr Pomare's
affidavit) says in
part
<P>

"Both Mirvac and Crema Group have only recently become aware that this business
is for sale and accordingly we are unable, as at
4 pm 3 May 1995, to provide
you with our office price and terms to purchase."
<P>

(ii)	Mr H Pollock of Mirvac Pty Ltd.
<P>

(iii)	Kevin Curran of Corotec Pty Ltd dated 4 May 1995 who said in his letter
(p16, Mr Pomare's affidavit)
<P>

"given more time to come to terms with all of the issues involved with this
business, we would be interested in pursuing it further.
 However, there is no
way we can satisfy the schedule as set out in your fax of 26/4/95, particularly
as we would need to carry out
a lot of investigations in relation to the
Council and EPA requirements for the site."
<P>

(iv)	John Burke of Rescrete Pty Ltd dated 16 May 1995 (p17 Mr Pomare's
affidavit).
<P>

On 12 May 1995 the receiver and manager extended the time for offers to 5 pm
Tuesday 16 May 1995 and wrote to those who had written
to him (pp18-21,
affidavit Franco Pomare 21 June 1999).
<P>

Given that 12 May was a Friday the receiver's actions in extending time in fact
allowed only two further business days.
<P>

47   	The Plaintiffs contend that the circumstances of the
advertisements and the time given to prospective purchasers to put forward
a
bid are relevant.  This was because the Referee had concluded, at para 7.6 of
his report, that "in my opinion there can be no better
indication of value of
the plant and equipment than that ($450,000) which was realised by the Receiver
and Manager after having advertised
the business for sale and not having
received any offer other than from Mr Wong".
<P>

48   	The Plaintiffs contend that therefore the reasons why Mr
Curran and Mr Burke did not pursue the bid are of significance. 
The valuation
(by Gray Edsel Timms) put the auction value of the plant and equipment at
between $471,386 to $556,386 and as a going
concern at the much higher figure
of $1,136,410.
<P>

49   	The valuer had earlier commented at page 12 of the
valuation in respect of the "Cato Truck Crane" (which had been valued at
$350,000-$400,000) that "truck crane of this capacity are well sought after in
the secondary market.  If the vehicle is in very good
mechanical condition, in
excess of $400,000 may be offered by an end user".
<P>

50   	As is clear from the report, the figure offered by Mr Wong
and subsequently accepted by the Receivers and Managers was less
than the
valuation amounts.
<P>

51   	Thus the Plaintiffs, correctly in my judgment, assert the
potential importance of the evidence of Mr Curran and Mr Burke as
to why they
did not proceed with the further enquiries and what steps they did take.  Also
of potential importance would be evidence
as to the reasons why they chose not
to make an offer.  That however is not to discount the Referee's capacity to
give proper weight
to such further evidence, if so ordered.
<P>

52   	The Referee in his letter of 4 May 1999 quotes his
recollection of what Mr Burke and Mr Curran had said.  I should add that
the
Referee makes clear that the informants were not mere strangers, though that
fact does not make consulting them suggestive of
bias.  Apposite to a referee
with that sort of industry experience is what Rogers CJ Comm D said in
<i>Telecomputing PLC v Bridges Wholesale Acceptance</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 513</a> at
522-3:
<P>

"... Again, the test in <i>Livesey</i> cannot be pressed too far when the
qualifications for membership of the tribunal are such that the members are
likely to have some
prior knowledge of the circumstances which give rise to the
issues for determination or to have formed an attitude about the way
in which
such issues should be determined, or the tribunal's powers exercised. ... The
prior involvement of a Deputy President with
associations or with governments
who are frequently parties to proceedings before the Commission cannot be
sufficient by itself to
amount to a disqualification from sitting in a
particular case;  nor can the prior acquisition of `skills and experience'
amount
to such a disqualification.  Deputy Presidents who are appointed on
account of their industrial background are not disqualified merely
because
persons with that background have a measure of knowledge or are likely to have
a particular attitude to the exercise of the
Commission's powers.  To adopt the
words of the Privy Council in <i>Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v John
East Ironworks Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20AC%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] AC 134</a> at 151, their background will not
necessarily lead them `to act otherwise than judicially, so far as that word
connotes a standard
of conduct' even though the background which it carries
experience and knowledge acquired extra-judicially `assuredly means that
the
subject-matter is such as profoundly to distinguish such a tribunal from the
courts ...'."
<P>

53   	The Plaintiffs' complaint is that, as with the Referee's
consultation of the Receivers' files, had the Referee advised the
Plaintiffs
that these conversations had occurred with Messrs Curran and Burke <i>prior</i>
to finalising their report, they would have been in a position <i>then</i> to
make submissions to the Referee.  Those submissions could then conceivably have
influenced the Referee's mind <i>before</i> he finalised his report.  The
Plaintiffs further contend that, based on Mr Curran's letter of 4 May 1995, the
real reason why no
further offer was forthcoming was that there was an
insufficient extension of time to enable Mr Curran to put in an offer, given
as
he says in his letter of 4 May 1995 that he "would need to carry out a lot of
investigations in relation to the Council and the
EPA requirements for the
site". I agree that the Plaintiffs should have had the opportunity to put these
submissions at the time.
<P>

54   	However, accepting those contentions is not to accept the
inevitable consequence said by the Plaintiffs to follow.  That consequence
is
that the fair-minded observer would reasonably apprehend that the Referee,
having already reached his conclusions, might not bring
to bear an impartial
mind in revisiting those conclusions in light of such further evidence and
submissions.  That is to say, having
once expressed his view, he would close
his mind to further evidence or submissions.  Such a consequence would be
surprising, for
it is not, for example, the assumption that is made when a case
is remitted back to the trial judge by an appellate court finding
error, as for
example where evidence was wrongly included.  Nor is it in conformity with the
proposition that in the interlocutory
stage of a case at least, a prior finding
on credit does not lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias, at least where
the finding
is not expressed in such outspoken terms as to throw doubt on the
ability to approach the case with an open mind;  see <i>Locobail (UK) Ltd v
Bayfield</i> (supra).  Thus I do not accept such a consequence automatically
follows;  it needs to be tested by the particular circumstances and
their
likely impact on the hypothetical observer.  It is to that I now turn.
<P>

<b>Resolving the Central Issue</b>
<P>

55   	I start with the procedure contemplated by the Defendants
--  and by my original orders in relation to the Receiver's files.
 Messrs
Curran and Burke would be asked to give evidence, if necessary by subpoena, as
to why they did not proceed with an offer.
 Then any submissions would be heard
from the Plaintiffs and the Defendants.  The Referee, like the jury in <i>Webb
v the Queen</i>,  would be warned that he must retain an open mind to any such
new evidence.  The question is whether a fair-minded and informed
observer
would nonetheless entertain a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality
on the part of the Referee, by reason of
pre-judgment, notwithstanding that the
procedures contemplate the taking of further evidence, the opportunity for
further submissions
and in a context where the Referee would be under no
misapprehension as to his duty of impartiality.  It is significant that the
High Court in <i>Webb</i> by majority concluded, in the case of a juror who
gave a bunch of flowers to the deceased's mother via a court officer during the
trial, that in the circumstances a fair-minded observer would not have had an
apprehension of lack of impartiality on the part of
the juror.  This conclusion
emphasised that the judge had impressed on the jury the need to have regard
only to the evidence, which
they were to consider in a dispassionate manner
putting aside all feelings of sympathy and emotion.  It can be taken that a
similar
stricture is made by this Court to the Referee;  to put aside any
earlier conclusion and take into account any new facts emerging
from that
procedure as well as the submissions of the parties.  
<P>

56   	Furthermore the Referee is not operating in a strict
<i>Livesey</i> situation in that, while the task before him is the
determination of the same matter of fact  -- the valuation of the units  -- 
ex
hypothesi he will have additional facts before him.  No-one suggests that a
trial judge cannot deal with a case remitted back
by an appeal court taking
into account the appeal court's directions, by reason of pre-judgment.  The
Referee's position is no different.
 The Referee, if he changes his mind, is
not necessarily admitting error but accommodating further evidence and
submissions.
<P>

57   	While a referee is not to be treated as in the same
position as a juror, nonetheless the supervisory role of the court in
relation
to the performance by a referee of his or her quasi-judicial function is such
that it could be expected that such a stricture
would be taken seriously.
<P>

58   	The Plaintiffs' case amounts to this.  The Referee both in
consulting the Receiver's files and now in the two further conversations
when
in the process of confirming his conclusions, the Referee denied procedural
fairness to the Plaintiffs.  That coupled with the
prior determination of the
factual issue of what the units were worth suffices to give rise to a
reasonable apprehension of bias,
based on pre-judgment. 
<P>

59   	It cannot be the case that every denial of procedural
fairness gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias though in a
more
serious case it may well do so, by bespeaking a closed mind or prejudice.  To
suppose otherwise would contradict the assumption
underlying the well
established <i>Hardiman </i>principle.  That assumption is that a referee, like
a tribunal, should not take any active role in proceedings which may bear upon
a failure to provide procedural fairness.  This is because the matter may
return to the Tribunal after an adverse finding on procedural
fairness for a
re-hearing and the assumption is that the Tribunal can still hear the matter.
Obviously in some cases the circumstances
of unfairness may be so serious that
another body should deal with it, but by no means is this inevitably so. 
<P>

60   	The question is therefore whether the circumstances that
gave rise to the procedural unfairness are such as to rise to the
level where a
reasonable and informed observer has a "reasonable apprehension" of bias.
First, I am satisfied that there is not sufficient
in the two stage production
of documents from the Receiver's files to justify a reasonable apprehension of
bias.  In particular,
I do not consider the two conversations tip the balance;
that is to say, taking all the circumstances in their context and considering
their cumulative effect on a fair-minded observer, I do not consider there
would be an apprehension of bias.  The volunteering of
the details of the two
conversations reinforces rather an impression of candour.  It is true, as I
have said, the evidence of the
two oral conversations bears upon the potential
availability of higher offers, if for example more time had been allowed.  But
that
matter can readily be tested against what Messrs Burke and Curran now say
would have influenced them in deciding to proceed or not
with an offer and
against other relevant facts.  
<P>

61   	The second issue is whether the Referee's prior finding in
those circumstances, coupled as it was by procedural unfairness
though
unwitting, would lead a fair-minded observer to conclude that the Referee was
<i>parti pris</i>, and thus might not bring a genuinely impartial mind to bear
on any new evidence or submissions so generated, however hard he tried.
 While
we all know that psychologically, admitting error is not easy, here the Referee
is simply required to take account of new
evidence and further submissions.  If
it be the case that, with all the other circumstances, a different conclusion
by the Referee
were warranted, there can be no embarrassment such as to
disincline the Referee from that course.  That is reinforced by the strictures
expressed in this judgment of the importance of giving fair and proper weight
to <i>all</i> relevant facts and submissions, retaining an open mind free of
prejudgment.  In saying that, I do not of course express any view
one way or
the other on the subject matter of the Referee's determination or whether the
further facts and submissions will require
a different conclusion to the
Referee's previous one.  The Referee must simply do his job in an impartial,
open-minded way.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

62   	I am satisfied that there should be no reasonable
apprehension by a fair-minded observer that the question of value now to
be
revisited will not be objectively and impartially determined by the Referee.
The earlier procedural unfairness was not a model
of (quasi) judicial behaviour
and in that sense, was unappealing (to use Mason P's words in <i>Barbosa v Di
Meglio</i> (supra)).  But it was not "appealable" in the sense of requiring the
Referee's disqualification.  Apprehension of bias must be "firmly
established"
as reasonable.  I am satisfied that it has not been in the present case.
<P>

<b>Waiver</b>
<P>

63   	Turning to the question of waiver, I do not consider that
the case for that has been made out.  The assumption in <i>Vakauta v Kelly</i>
at 572 (per Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ) is that waiver is constituted when
the party who might have complained waits first to
see the result and only
after that attacks the decision-maker for actual or apparent bias.  It is true
that if during a hearing a
party apprehends bias, he or she may make clear
objection thereby giving the decision-maker the opportunity if possible to
correct
that impression of bias.  But this cannot mean that the party
complaining of bias has first to participate in a further hearing to
put that
claim to the decision-maker for a response, as the Defendants suggest, if a
reasonable apprehension of bias has already
been formed.  It would be absurd to
suppose that the impugned decision-maker must first be given the opportunity to
dispel any apprehension
of bias before a well-founded application can be made.
Such a proposition wrongly pre-supposes some reciprocal obligation of bestowing
natural justice upon the decision-maker to defend itself.  Whereas, the
decision-maker is not there to defend itself, but to perform
the task
entrusted, whether judicial or quasi judicial.  It would rather be by
adventitious circumstance that the issue of apparent
bias emerges at a time
when the parties affected could protest.  That was not what occurred here.  The
circumstances giving rise
to the claim of potential bias arose progressively,
culminating in the Referee's report of his contact with the claimed potential
buyers.  Thereafter the Plaintiffs acted with reasonable promptness.  That the
Plaintiffs made submissions to the Referee, as they
did, in accordance with my
earlier orders, was not equivalent to waiting the result and only then seeking
disqualification.
<P>

<b>overall Conclusions</b>
<P>

64   	I am satisfied that in the events that happened, the
Plaintiffs flagged early enough that they reserved any rights they might
have
in relation to seeking a disqualification of the Referee.  This was on 10 June
1999 when the matter was then before me.  The
ensuing time was spent on
reviewing the twelve files produced by the Referee (being the Receiver's files
consulted) before disqualification
was pressed.  Thus waiver is not made
out.
<P>

65   	I am satisfied that the conduct of the Referee is not such
as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, based on
pre-judgment or
otherwise.  It is to be expected that the Referee will co-operate fully in
hearing submissions from the parties and
in considering evidence from Messrs
Burke and Curran when subpoenaed and will be conscious of the requirement to
bring an unbiased
mind to bear on the further material before him.
<P>

<b>ORDERS AND COSTS</b>
<P>

66   	While costs would ordinarily follow the event either party
may address me on costs if desired.
<P>

67   	The orders I contemplate are now to comprehend subpoenas
if necessary, addressed to Messrs Burke and Curran (unless willing
to attend
without that necessity) and a hearing by the Referee before the parties and
their legal representatives of any matters
pertaining to the likelihood that
Messrs Burke and Curran would have made offers for the relevant business and
the level of such
offers if they would have been made and for the parties to
have the opportunity to question Messrs Burke and Curran through their
legal
advisers.  The opportunity should then be afforded to both parties to make
submissions based upon that material and for the
Referee to provide his further
report by a designated date after the foregoing steps have taken place, taking
into account all of
the evidence including, but not limited to, the further
evidence and submissions.
<P>

68   	I invite the parties to agree orders or otherwise submit
draft orders in the alternative giving effect to the terms of this
judgment.
This should be done within seven days.
<P>
