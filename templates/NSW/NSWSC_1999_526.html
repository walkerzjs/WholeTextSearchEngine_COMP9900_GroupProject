	  <b>HER HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1	By summons filed on 26 May 1999 the plaintiffs, Macquarie Bank Limited
("MBL") and Andrew James Downe, seek an order restraining
the defendant,
Charles Joseph Berg, from publishing certain material on the Internet.  The
summons first came before B M James J
who abridged the time for service and
directed that service be effected by delivering a copy of the documentation on
Messrs Hickson
Wisewoulds (solicitors acting for the defendant in other
proceedings between the parties) and by sending copies of the documents,
marked
for the attention of the defendant, to a specified email address.  When the
matter came before me on 28 May 1999 I was satisfied
that the plaintiffs had
complied with the directions as to service.  Mr Dalgleish of counsel appeared,
as a courtesy to the court,
to acknowledge receipt of the documents by Hickson
Wisewoulds.  He did not appear for the purpose of representing the defendant
and
the matter proceeded  ex parte.   
<P>

2	It is convenient at this point to set out, as briefly as possible, the
circumstances in which the application is made.  
<P>

3	Some time before December 1997 MBL engaged the defendant to work in its
business.  Whether that engagement created a relationship
of employer and
employee is a matter of contention between the parties but is immaterial for
present purposes.  The relationship
terminated in circumstances that gave rise
to litigation in other courts.  The defendant has commenced proceedings against
MBL in
both the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW ("IRC") and the Federal
Court of Australia ("FCA").  MBL challenges the jurisdiction
of the IRC.   On
17 August 1998 an order was made for separate determination of that question.
The defendant unsuccessfully appealed
the order.  There is no evidence as to
when a hearing on the jurisdictional question might be expected.  On 23 April
1999 MBL filed
a summons in the Equity Division of this court claiming an
order, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i>,
that the IRC proceedings be removed to this court.  Messrs Hickson Wisewoulds,
although they are the solicitors acting for the defendant
in the IRC
proceedings, were instructed not to accept service of the summons.  It has not
been served on the defendant.  MBL is also
contemplating seeking a similar
order in relation to the FCA proceedings, with a view to having all matters
between the parties litigated
in a single forum.
<P>

4	From at least January 1999 material relating to the relationship and the
litigation has appeared on the Internet on a website
the address of which is
"www.brgvsmbl.com".  The defendant's name appears prominently in the material
which includes a document headed
"Letter From Charles Berg".  It is a
reasonable inference that this material has been placed on the site by the
defendant.  No complaint
is made about this publication.  
<P>

5	However, since at least 24 May 1999, material has been appearing on another
website the address of which is "macquarieontrial.com".
 This material, like
the other, is transmitted to and can be received in NSW.  It is the publication
of this material that the plaintiffs
seek to restrain.  It is unnecessary to go
into the detail of its contents.  I am satisfied that the material on the site
conveys
imputations defamatory of each plaintiff.  
<P>

6	While there is nothing in this material that specifically accepts or
acknowledges that it is published by the defendant, there
are sufficient
similarities with that on the previously mentioned website to permit an
inference that the defendant is also, if not
the author, at the very least
involved in and associated with its publication.
<P>

7	It is reasonably clear that the defendant is not present in NSW, and that any
acts done by him that result in publication of the
material in NSW are done
from outside the state.  The evidence as to his whereabouts suggests that he is
in the United States of
America.
<P>

8	A question of jurisdiction is therefore raised.  There is authority that a
court is empowered to restrain conduct occurring or
expected to occur outside
the territorial boundaries of the jurisdiction:  <b>Helicopter Utilities  v
Australian National Airlines Commission </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%2080%20WN%29%20%28NSW%29%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 80 WN) (NSW) 48</a> at 51;
<b>Dunlop Rubber Company  v  Dunlop</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1921%5d%201%20AC%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1921] 1 AC 367</a>;  <b>Tozier and Wife  v
Hawkins</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%2015%20QBD%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1885) 15 QBD 680.</a>
<P>

9	Whether that power should be exercised is a question of discretion.  Factors
relevant to the exercise of the discretion include
the potential enforceability
of any orders made, and whether another court is a more appropriate forum:
<b>Helicopter Utilities</b> (p 51).
<P>

10	Any order made by this court would be enforceable only if the defendant were
voluntarily to return to NSW.  He cannot be compelled
to do so for the purpose
of enforcement.   Senior counsel for the plaintiff urged that, having regard to
the litigation he has initiated
in NSW, there is every prospect that he will
return.   If and when he does so he will immediately become amenable to the
enforcement
processes of this court that would be set in train in the event of
disobedience of any orders made.  Unenforceability should not,
therefore, be
seen as a factor contraindicating the grant of the relief sought.  
<P>

11	I am not fully persuaded by this argument.  It seems to me unsatisfactory to
make orders the effectiveness of which is solely
dependent upon the voluntary
presence, at a time of his selection, of the person against whom the orders are
made.  The uncertainty
of unenforceability is a factor adverse to the exercise
of discretion in the plaintiff's favour.  It is unnecessary further to consider
this.  There are other, more compelling, factors that militate against the
making of the order sought.  
<P>

12	The first and most significant of these concerns the nature of the Internet
itself.   No evidence was adduced to explain the
mechanics of the operation of
the Internet.  It is reasonably plain, I think, that once published on the
Internet, material is transmitted
anywhere in the world that has an Internet
connection.  It may be received by anybody, anywhere, having the appropriate
facilities.
 Senior counsel conceded that, to make the order as initially
sought, would have the effect of restraining publication of all the
material
presently contained on the website to any place in the world.  Recognising the
difficulties associated with orders of such
breadth, he sought to narrow the
claim by limiting the order sought to publication or dissemination "<u>within
NSW</u>".  The limitation, however, is ineffective.  Senior counsel
acknowledged that he was aware of no means by which material, once published
on
the Internet, could be excluded from transmission to or receipt in any
geographical area.   Once published on the Internet material
can be received
anywhere, and it does not lie within the competence of the publisher to
restrict the reach of the publication.
<P>

13	The consequence is that, if I were to make the order sought (and the
defendant were to obey it) he would be restrained from publishing
anywhere in
the world via the medium of the Internet.
<P>

14	The difficulties are obvious.  An injunction to restrain defamation in NSW
is designed to ensure compliance with the laws of
NSW, and to protect the
rights of plaintiffs, as those rights are defined by the law of NSW.  Such an
injunction is not designed
to superimpose the law of NSW relating to defamation
on every other state, territory and country of the world.  Yet that would be
the effect of an order restraining publication on the Internet.  It is not to
be assumed that the law of defamation in other countries
is coextensive with
that of NSW, and indeed, one knows that it is not.   It may very well be that,
according to the law of the Bahamas,
Tazhakistan, or Mongolia, the defendant
has an unfettered right to publish the material.  To make an order interfering
with such
a right would exceed the proper limits of the use of the injunctive
power of this court.  
<P>

15	For this reason alone, I would refuse the order sought.
<P>

16	It may be that what I have said above expresses merely a technological
update of a long standing line of authority concerning
the discretion to
restrain defamatory publications.  Such a power is to be exercised with great
caution, and only in very clear cases:
  <b>Stocker  v  McElhinney (No.2)
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2079%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 79 WN (NSW) 541</a>;  <b>Church of Scientology of California Inc  v
Readers Digest Services Pty Limited </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20NSWLR%20344" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 NSWLR 344</a>;   <b>Chappell  v
TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 153.</a>  This, as I understand
it, is largely for two reasons of principle.  The first is that, while it may
be relatively easy to establish,
prima facie, that a publication is defamatory,
the key to a defamation action very often lies in the defences advanced, and
these
cannot ordinarily be determined at the stage of an interlocutory
injunction application.  To restrain the publication would unduly
override the
rights of a publisher and pre-empt the resolution of legitimate issues which
arise in claims for defamation.  The second
reason concerns the fundamental
public interest in freedom of speech and freedom of information.  An injunction
will ordinarily not
lie where it would have the effect of restraining
discussion in the media of matters of public interest or concern:
<b>Chappell</b>, p 158.
<P>

17	Contrary to the argument initially advanced (but, I think, abandoned) by
senior counsel, the public interest in freedom of speech
is not more deeply
embedded in the protection of the publications of the organs of the mass media
than in protection of publication
by individuals.   The courts will not be more
reluctant to enjoin a publication by a media outlet than one by an individual.
The
fact that the publication the plaintiffs seek to restrain is publication by
an individual and not a media outlet adds nothing to
the plaintiffs' case.
<P>

18	Senior counsel placed heavy emphasis on the decision of Hunt J (as he then
was) in <b>Chappell</b>.   That was a case in which his Honour, having
considered the history of, and the reasons for, the caution exercised in
relation
to applications for injunctions in defamation cases, nevertheless
proceeded to make such an order.
<P>

19	In that case the statement of claim had been filed, and the imputations upon
which reliance was to be placed had been formulated.
 The defendants, who were
represented, had identified the defences upon which they proposed to rely.  His
Honour was therefore able
to embark upon an examination of the defendants'
realistic prospects of success in defending the defamatory imputations.  A
single
focal issue emerged - whether the defendants would be able to show that
publication of the material was on a matter of public interest.
 He held that
it was not, and, in effect, that any other conclusion would have been
untenable.  There was therefore no impediment
to granting the injunction. 
<P>

20	In the present case, on the first day of hearing no statement of claim had
been prepared, although senior counsel formulated
the imputations which were to
be pleaded.  By the second day of hearing a statement of claim had been
prepared, but not filed or
served.  Accordingly, the defendant had no notice of
the precise imputations on which the plaintiffs proposed to rely, and was not
in a position (even if he had appeared or been represented on the proceedings)
to identify his defences, and therefore isolate the
issues for
determination.
<P>

21	Counsel for the plaintiffs referred also to <b>National Mutual Life
Association of Australasia Limited  v  GTV Corporation Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1989/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] VicRp 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20VR%20747" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989]
VR 747</a>, but it does not seem to me that the judgments in this case advance the
argument.  The issue to be determined, and the principles
to be applied, are
clearly stated in <b>Chappell</b>.  
<P>

22	Even leaving aside the considerations peculiar to publication on the
Internet, I would not be satisfied that this is the kind
of case that would
attract injunctive relief.
<P>

23	Counsel put three other arguments in relation to the exercise of discretion.
He argued that, having regard to the IRC and FCA
litigation already commenced
by the defendant, he has adequate alternative fora, in which he would have the
benefit of absolute privilege,
in which to make his assertions against the
plaintiff.  On the evidence before me, this argument rings very hollow indeed.
Although
the IRC proceedings were commenced in December 1997, by reason of
MBL's challenge to jurisdiction there appears no imminent hearing
on the
merits.   MBL has a perfect right to challenge jurisdiction, and it is no
criticism to say that it has exercised that right;
 but having done so, it can
hardly be heard to argue that the defendant has a forum in which to air his
grievances.  In any event,
what he might be able to say in those proceedings
will be limited to the issues properly raised thereby.  I do not know what
those
issues may be, but he will not have free rein to make his criticisms of
MBL.
<P>

24	Another matter argued by counsel was that freedom of speech does not extend
to the freedom to engage in scurrilous abuse, and,
properly analysed, that is
what the material on the website amounts to.  It is true that the content of
the website is at times couched
in strong language, and makes serious
allegations against the plaintiffs.   In the last few pages there are thumbnail
sketches of
a number of individuals apparently involved in the engagement
between MBL and the defendant, and these are not only critical of some
of those
individuals, but are illustrated by reference, apparently, to notable
characters from the world of entertainment.  The illustrations
are, apparently,
designed to ridicule some of the individuals named.   I am not persuaded that
they, or any other parts of the publication
warrant the epithet
"scurrilous".
<P>

25	It may be that, if and when the defamation proceedings come to a hearing, a
judge will conclude that the publication is defamatory,
is not protected by any
of the defences available under NSW law, and is so serious as to result in a
large award of damages.  That
possibility, of itself, does not militate against
the application of the principles stated in <b>Chappell.</b>
<P>

26	A final argument was that there is material to suggest that the defendant is
impecunious.  This arises from assertions in the
published material that MBL,
by its conduct of the litigation, has exhausted the defendant's funds.
Whatever the cause of his impecuniosity,
the argument was, it is likely that he
would be unable to meet any award of damages ordered.
<P>

27	The order I make is that the application for interlocutory injunction is
refused.
