<P>

<u>Thursday 23rd September 1999</u>
<P>

<b><u>NO. 3593 OF 1997</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY  V.  D'JAMIRZE &amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u> </b>(on admissibility of documents see page 10)
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  During the reading of affidavits in this matter Mr
Johnson, for the plaintiff, objected to the tender of certain
documents:
firstly, a document in Russian purporting to be an agreement by certain of the
defendants to give their interests in the
subject land to the cross-claimant in
exchange for the equivalent of $700,000; and secondly, another document in
Russian purporting
to be a receipt for the equivalent of $700,000.  
<P>

2  	The objection then articulated was that the purported agreement
was not stamped and was therefore inadmissible; and that no
documents would be
admissible to prove the transaction purportedly effected by that unstamped
document.
<P>

3  	Following that objection being taken, the cross-claimant
undertook the stamping of the purported agreement, and that has now
happened.
<P>

4  	The tender of these documents has been renewed, and Mr Johnson
has raised further objections to them.  He has referred to evidence
that, about
a year ago, notices were given to the solicitor for the cross-claimant pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s167.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.167</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, making a reasonable request for the purpose of
determining a question relating to the authenticity, identity or admissibility
of
these documents, the request being that the signatories to both documents
put on evidence in the case.
<P>

5  	The situation now is that five of the eight signatories of the
agreement have put on evidence, but the signatory to the receipt
document has
not; and no sworn evidence explaining the non-compliance with the request has
been put on.  
<P>

6  	In those circumstances Mr Johnson submitted that those documents
should be excluded, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s169.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.169(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  The signatory
to the receipt was apparently the only signatory to any document who was not a
member of the family of the defendants,
the cross-claimant being the husband of
one of the other defendants.  Only if that signatory was called could the
authenticity of
the receipt be properly tested.  As regards the purported
agreement, Mr Johnson submitted that there was no question of the availability
of the other three signatories:  indeed, a statement from the remaining three
had been provided, two of them sworn, yet no explanation
was offered for not
calling them to give evidence.  Mr Johnson submitted that the appropriate
course would be to exclude the document
or, alternatively, to admit it on the
basis that it could only affect the interests in the property of the
signatories who were called
to give evidence. 
<P>

7  	Mr Moore, for the cross-claimant, submitted that I should infer
that the signatory of the receipt was in Russia, and that it
was reasonable for
the defendants not to put on evidence from that signatory.  He submitted that
the evidence provided in relation
to the other document showed that the persons
principally involved had put on evidence, and that some of those less directly
involved
had also put on evidence.  The plaintiff had been provided with ample
opportunity through that evidence to test the authenticity
of the document.  He
also indicated that, if the objection was maintained and the Court was
otherwise minded to uphold it, the remaining
three signatories would be
produced for cross-examination.

following terms:
<P>

<b><i>166.	In this Division: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>"request" means a request that a party ("the requesting party") makes to
another party to do one or more of the following:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   to produce to the requesting party the whole or a part of a
specified document or thing, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   to permit the requesting party, adequately and in an appropriate
way, to examine, test or copy the whole or a part of a specified
document or
thing, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   to call as a witness a specified person believed to be concerned in
the production or maintenance of a specified document or
thing, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(d)   to call as a witness a specified person in whose possession or
under whose control a specified document or thing is believed
to be or to have
been at any time, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(e)   in relation to a document of the kind referred to in paragraph (b)
or (c) of the definition of "document" in the Dictionary---to
permit the
requesting party, adequately and in an appropriate way, to examine and test the
document and the way in which it was produced
and has been kept, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(f)   in relation to evidence of a previous representation---to call as a
witness the person who made the previous representation,
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(g)   in relation to evidence that a person has been convicted of an
offence, being evidence to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 92</a> (2) applies---to call as a witness
a person who gave evidence in the proceeding in which the person was so
convicted. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>167	A party may make a reasonable request to another party for the
purpose of determining a question that relates to: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   a previous representation, or </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   evidence of a conviction of a person for an offence, or </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   the authenticity, identity or admissibility of a document or thing.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>168   ...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>169(1)   If the party has, without reasonable cause, failed or refused to
comply with a request, the court may, on application, make
one or more of the
following orders: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   an order directing the party to comply with the request,
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   an order that the party produce a specified document or thing, or
call as a witness a specified person, as mentioned in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s166.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 166</a>, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   an order that the evidence in relation to which the request was
made is not to be admitted in evidence, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(d)   such order with respect to adjournment or costs as is just.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   If the party had, within a reasonable time after receiving the
request, informed the other party that it refuses to comply with
the request,
any application under subsection (1) by the other party must be made within a
reasonable time after being so informed.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(3)   The court may, on application, direct that evidence in relation to
which a request was made is not to be admitted in evidence
if an order made by
it under subsection (1) (a) or (b) is not complied with. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(4)   Without limiting the circumstances that may constitute reasonable
cause for a party to fail to comply with a request, it is
reasonable cause to
fail to comply with a request if: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   the document or thing to be produced is not available to the party,
or </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   the existence and contents of the document are not in issue in the
proceeding in which evidence of the document is proposed
to be adduced, or
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   the person to be called as a witness is not available. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(5)   Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account
in relation to the exercise of a power under subsection (1),
it is to take into
account: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   the importance in the proceeding of the evidence in relation to
which the request was made, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   whether there is likely to be a dispute about the matter to which
the evidence relates, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   whether there is a reasonable doubt as to the authenticity or
accuracy of the evidence that is, or the document the contents
of which are,
sought to be proved, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(d)   whether there is a reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of the
document or thing that is sought to be tendered, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(e)   if the request relates to evidence of a previous
representation---whether there is a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of
the
representation or of the evidence on which it was based, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(f)   in the case of a request referred to in paragraph (g) of the
definition of "request" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s166.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 166</a>---whether another person is available to
give evidence about the conviction or the facts that were in issue in the
proceeding in
which the conviction was obtained, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(g)   whether compliance with the request would involve undue expense or
delay or would not be reasonably practicable, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(h)   the nature of the proceeding. </i></b>
<P>

9  	Having regard to the considerations set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s169.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.169(1)(5)</a>, and
dealing first with the purported agreement, in my opinion, if all signatories
are at least produced for cross-examination, I
should not exercise the power
given by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s169.html" class="autolink_findacts">s169(1)(c)</a> to reject the document.
<P>

10  	I think the appropriate course is to admit the document, on the
basis that all signatories will be available for cross-examination.
 Should
that turn out not to be the case, for whatever reason, I will give further
consideration as to whether the document should
be excluded; or alternatively,
whether I should order that it be admitted on the basis that it may only affect
the interests of the
signatories who have been produced for
cross-examination.
<P>

11  	Turning to the receipt document, Mr Moore submitted, not merely
that should it be admitted, but that it should be treated as
a business
document, and thus as being evidence of the truth of the assertions made in
it.
<P>

12  	There is no sworn evidence as to how the document came into
existence, and no evidence extrinsic to the document itself that
it is part of
the business records of any company or organisation. The document appears to be
on a letterhead of Razvitie (Joint
Soviet Australian Company) and bears what
purports to be a common seal of that company.
<P>

13  	In my opinion, in circumstances where there is no sworn evidence
as to the origins of the document, when presumably such sworn
evidence could
have been given, and in circumstances where the signatory of the document has
not been called, notwithstanding a request,
I do not think I should admit the
document as being a business record, and thus as being evidence of the truth of
its contents.
<P>

14  	However, it might be said that the absence of any receipt
document is a matter positively counting against the evidence of
the
cross-claimant that he advanced a large sum of money in cash.  In my opinion
the document should be admitted into evidence, simply
as a receipt document
which the cross-claimant obtained, in so far as that fact may to some extent
count against an inference that
might otherwise be drawn against him. However,
I do not admit it otherwise as any evidence of the truth of its contents. 
<P>

15  	So on those bases, I will admit both documents.
