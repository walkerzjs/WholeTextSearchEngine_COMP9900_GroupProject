<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 35</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected
Estates Act 1983</a> that a protected person's declaration that she is incapable of
managing her affairs be revoked and consequential orders.  On such
an
application the onus is on the applicant to make out her case.  
<P>

2	The applicant is a person of Vietnamese origin, who migrated to Australia in
1983.  She was seriously injured as a result of a
motor vehicle accident in
1985 and received a substantial amount of damages in 1990.  Orders were made
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a> on 13 November 1990 to protect her and the
Protective Commissioner has managed her affairs ever since.
<P>

3	The relationship between the Protective Commissioner and the applicant, at
least in the last few years, has not been good, but
that statement does not
cast aspersions on either party.  The underlying reasons for the deterioration
in relations is that the applicant
has put up a series of schemes for use of
her money which, viewed objectively, left a lot to be desired, and when the
Protective
Commissioner said something to that effect it made the applicant
quite angry.
<P>

4	There is little doubt, looking objectively, that the Protective Commissioner
acted properly, but it is a fact of life in modern
society that if people do
not get what they want they get angry and always consider it must be the other
person's fault.
<P>

5	The situation at present is that there is very little left of the money
because of the provision of a house for the applicant,
which probably took out
a greater amount of the damages award than might have been best, if one was
looking at the matter objectively.
 However, that has been done and it was done
at the applicant's then request, but there is only sufficient moneys left to
provide
income at the current rate up until the year 2003.  The banning period,
if I can call it that, during which the applicant is not
entitled to social
security expires in 2001.
<P>

6	The applicant now wishes to take charge of her money to use part of it to
invest in a noodle business which she hopes will provide
an income and
employment for her, and to invest the balance.
<P>

7	The matter came on before me on 22 March 1999.  It seemed to me a borderline
case, but it also seemed to me that I should try
my hardest to ensure that the
applicant got proper advice as to the investments that she was about to make.
Probably the pressure
I exerted led to Miss Norton of counsel for the
applicant, making an application for an adjournment, which I granted, and the
time
during the adjournment has been utilised by getting advice from some
people.
<P>

8	The quality of the advice that Mrs C has got is not of the highest class, but
at least she has done something to get advice and
hopefully she is now in a
mind-set where she will continue to do that in the future.  However, I have no
right to make her do that
and there is no use at all in obtaining an
undertaking because the only consequence of breaching the undertaking would be
attachment,
which would be quite inappropriate in a protective matter.
<P>

9	As both counsel have put to me, the question that I have to determine as a
matter of law and fact is whether the applicant has
now shown that she is
capable of managing her own affairs.
<P>

10	Miss Norton said very firmly to me, and very correctly, that it is not a
question of whether the Protective Commissioner or somebody
else could manage
the affairs of the applicant better, or that if the applicant was left on her
own the likelihood would be that
her funds would soon be dissipated.  One
cannot be too paternalistic.  People have the right to manage their affairs,
unless they
fall below the level that is prescribed by the Act.
<P>

11	The level that is prescribed by the Act has been interpreted in decisions
such as<b> PY v RJS </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 700</a>, 702; <b> M and The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected
Estates Act</a></b> <b>1983</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%2096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 96</a> and<b> N v N</b> Hodgson J, 13
March 1997 unreported.  I myself have taken the same view in previous cases.
The Court applies the objective test,
that is it primarily looks to see whether
on the material it is more likely than not that the applicant is a person who
is able to
manage the ordinary affairs of mankind.
<P>

12	The evidence in the instant case is from people who are eminently qualified
in the disciplines required to make the assessment.
 Two of them are doctors
who gave reports for the purpose of the applicant's motor vehicle injury case.
They then took the view that
the applicant was not capable of managing her
affairs.  Dr Grady says that the applicant has made what appears to be a
remarkable
improvement in behavioural and cognitive estimates, with improvement
in depression and he has come to the view that the applicant
is now capable of
managing her affairs.  Dr Fearnside has taken the same view and so has Dr
Shores, a neuropsychologist.
<P>

13	On the other hand, Miss Jill Farrelly, clinical psychologist, who often
gives evidence in these matters and whose opinion is
always greatly valued, has
taken the opposite view.  She says that there are indications in the material
furnished both for the accident
case and for this case that the applicant has
not been fully cooperative with the examiners and has been, in the first
instance,
endeavouring to show herself less capable and, in the present
situation, more capable than she really is. When, however, the material
is
considered as a whole, the applicant has not reached the appropriate level.
<P>

14	Although the applicant bears the onus of proof and although what Miss
Farrelly says is strong material the other way, I do think
that on the balance
of probabilities the applicant has made out her case.
<P>

15	The court is always wary when someone who is awarded damages in a motor
vehicle accident case puts forward as part of her  damages
claim permanent
brain damage and then a few years later wishes to take up the opposing
position, that having got those damages she
should now be free to spend them.
The instant case is not as bad as some because as Miss Norton says there are
two factors that led
to the assessment in 1990; one was the brain damage and
two was the depression brought about by the accident in which the applicant
thought that she would never be able to be lead what she considered a normal
life with a husband and children.
<P>

16	The material generally shows that this depression has subsided and when that
factor is removed it is more likely that one can
find that she is now on what I
might call the right side of the line.
<P>

17	It is a difficult case.  I am very much indebted to Mr Durie, counsel for
the respondent, and the staff of the Protective Commissioner
for presenting the
case in the pastoral way they have, and the efforts that they have made to
protect the applicant really against
herself.  I think that if I was merely a
judge who had to judge the evidence as to what was best for the protection of
the person
I would agree with them, but as Miss Norton says that is not my
role.  There is no room in the legislation for benign paternalism.
 A person is
allowed to make whatever decision she likes about her property, good or bad,
with happy or disastrous effect, so long
as she is capable.  I think on the
balance of the evidence she is.
<P>

18	Accordingly, I make orders in accordance with the short minutes.
<P>

	                                         oOo
