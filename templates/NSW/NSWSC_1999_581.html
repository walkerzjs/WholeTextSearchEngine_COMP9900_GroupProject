<b>1684/97 : TOURPRINT INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD &amp; ANOR  V GEOFFREY EDWARD
BOTT</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This case is a cautionary tale for company
directors, especially in the small business sector.  The defendant,
Geoffrey
Bott, joined the board of directors of the plaintiff company less than a year
before it went into voluntary administration.
 He received no remuneration as a
director.  For at least a substantial part of that period, the company was
hopelessly insolvent.
 For the reasons I shall give, the consequence for the
defendant is that he is liable to the company's liquidator under the insolvent
trading provisions of the Corporations Law in a sum in excess of $500,000, plus
interest.
<P>

2  	The hearing of the case was delayed and made difficult because
for most of the hearing, Mr Bott was not legally represented,
and was inclined
to raise irrelevant allegations.  However, he secured legal representation of
high quality for the purpose of making
submissions, through the New South Wales
Bar Association's voluntary legal aid scheme.
<P>

<b>The company</b>
<P>

3  	From 1985 to December 1993 the company was involved in the
business of print broking in Sydney.  The business of print broking
involves
the broker obtaining printing orders from customers and then placing the work
with select printers.  Until 1989 the company
was a consultant to a print
broker providing the services of its director and sole employee, Mr Victor
Moore, to the print broking
company.  Commencing with the 1990 financial year,
the company traded as a print broker in a principal capacity.  It is worth
noting
that since a print broker acts in a principal capacity, it is a creditor
of the printing customers and a debtor to the printer, and
is unable to offset
debts of customers against amounts owed to printers.  
<P>

4  	The company operated from leased premises at St Leonards, and
subsequently at Neutral Bay.  The business was managed by Mr Moore.
 It
employed two office support staff and retained the services of a part-time
bookkeeper.  Its financial records were kept on a
computer maintained by the
bookkeeper.  It retained the services of several individuals who were described
as `independent sales
representatives', one of whom was Mr Bott.  
<P>

5  	Mr Moore and his wife were initially the holders of the company's
two shares, though eventually Mrs Moore's share was transferred
to Mr Bott in
trust for Mr Moore, as I shall explain.  
<P>

<b>Mr Bott's experience</b>
<P>

6  	Prior to 1987, Mr Bott appears to have had no experience in
corporate financial management.  He worked for a British sports
marketing
company in an operations rather than a financial capacity.  He describes his
job at Tourprint International as a `freelance
print broker', remunerated by
way of profit share for jobs done for customers whom he brought into the
business.  In traditional
terms, he was a commission agent.  He began to work
for the company in November 1991.  
<P>

7  	From 1987 to 1990 he had been managing director of Bilbette
Investments Pty Ltd, a company involved in the importation, production
and
distribution of prints, posters and associated paper products.  As managing
director of Bilbette, which had an annual turnover
of around $3.5 million, he
reviewed financial reports on a monthly basis.  According to Mr Bott's
evidence, he resigned as managing
director when he discovered that amounts of
money were being transferred, apparently without his authorisation, from
Bilbette to
its parent company to assist other subsidiaries which were in
financial difficulty.  He says he was aware of his responsibilities
under the
Corporations Law.  In my opinion the value of Mr Bott's experience in corporate
management at Bilbette is qualified by
the fact that Bilbette was a wholly
owned subsidiary, and he says himself that he was responsible principally to
the parent company,
which determined the form in which financial information
emerged.  
<P>

8  	Overall the evidence is consistent with the impression I formed
of Mr Bott in the witness box.  He has had substantial experience
in marketing
and sales of various products and services.  But his experience of corporate
financial management is very limited, and
his understanding of financial
matters is imperfect.  For example, in oral evidence he was asked to explain
how $250,000 would be
injected into Tourprint International by Tourprint
Publishing, the new publishing company which (as I shall explain) had been
formed
by mid-1993.  He said he believed the money would be lent by Tourprint
Publishing to Mr Moore, who would `put that money unencumbered'
into Tourprint
International.  However, he could not explain how that would occur.  It did not
seem to occur to him that the money
might be paid over in repayment of an
inter-corporate debt, even though at another time he alleged that Tourprint
Publishing had
`syphoned off money' from Tourprint International for expenses.

<P>

<b>The 1992 financial statements and the Valuation</b>
<P>

9  	The company retained William Buck &amp; Co, chartered
accountants, as its external accountants on 8 July 1992, to prepare the
financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1992.  Before that time another
external accountant was involved, but there is no
evidence about the identity
or work of that accountant.  There is no evidence that annual financial
statements were completed for
the year ended 30 June 1993.
<P>

10  	William Buck &amp; Co was retained by Mr Moore on behalf of the
company.  Mr Fausto Pastro was the partner at William Buck
&amp; Co with whom
Mr Moore dealt.  Mr Pastro was provided with monthly profit and loss
statements, balance sheets, creditor ledgers
and debtor ledgers generated by
means of the company's computer accounting package, and a computer generated
general ledger for the
period 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992, to enable him to
prepare the 1992 financial statements.  
<P>

11  	In October 1992 Mr Moore instructed Mr Pastro to prepare a
valuation of the company which was to be supplied to Mr Moore's
wife in
connection with family law proceedings between them.  The valuation, dated 9
November 1992 (`the Valuation'), was issued
by William Buck Partners Pty Ltd,
of which Mr Pastro is a director.  It was based on the company's balance sheets
and profit and
loss statements for the years ended 30 June 1986 to 1992, the
company's taxation returns for those years and interim financial statements
for
the period ended 30 September 1992.  The financial statements were all
unaudited, and the interim financial statements were prepared
by the company's
bookkeeper.
<P>

12  	The company's balance sheet as at 30 June 1992, which is annexed
to the Valuation, showed net assets of $29,106.  The Valuation
also annexed
summary profit and loss statements for the financial years from 1986 to 1992,
and for the period July to September 1992.
 The figures showed gross profit
rising from 1990 to 1992, but falling in the September 1992 quarter.  Operating
expenses rose from
1990 to 1992.  The company made a small profit in 1990, a
loss in 1991, a profit in 1992 and a larger loss for the September 1992
quarter.  By the time of the Valuation, the company had a deficiency in working
capital of $16,545.
<P>

13  	The Valuation pointed out that the company's business structure
required it to bear the risk of customers' bad debts, and limited
the company's
goodwill because customers dealt primarily through independent consultants.
Additionally, the company's operating expenses
included high fixed expenses for
rental of premises, equipment and furniture.  
<P>

14  	Noting that the company's financial position had deteriorated in
the quarter to September 1992 and that it had no financial
reserves on which to
rely, the Valuation stated that any value of goodwill in the company was more
than offset by its inability to
make an operating profit, caused by its
substantially fixed and unchangeable operating costs.  The Valuation
continued:
<P>

`Furthermore, recent trading history leads us to conclude that the company
might not be able to continue trading due to a significant
decline in its
revenue base.'
<P>

15  	The opinion was expressed that the net tangible assets as at 30
June 1992 had disappeared as a result of trading losses incurred
after that
date, and the company had significant contingent liabilities due to unexpired
lease commitments not reflected in the calculation
of net tangible assets.  The
Valuation concluded that the company had no value.  
<P>

16  	While the Valuation does not establish that the company was
insolvent in November 1992, it describes a company with serious
operating
problems of a kind which had the clear potential to lead rapidly to insolvency,
if insolvency had not already arrived.
 
<P>

<b>Mr Bott becomes a director</b>
<P>

17  	In September 1992 Mr Moore approached Mr Bott to invite him to
become a director of the company.  Mr Moore told Mr Bott that
he had separated
from his wife, who was the only other director of the company, and that he had
arranged to swap his interest in
the family home for her interest in the
company.  As part of this arrangement, she would resign as a director and
another director
would be needed to replace her.  Under the company law at the
time, at least two directors were needed for a proprietary company.
 
<P>

18  	Mr Moore did not disclose to Mr Bott the contents of the
valuation or the company's poor financial health.  Mr Bott says that
`by all
appearances' the business was thriving.  He says that he told Mr Moore that he
would need to think about the offer and investigate
the financial position of
the company before he made any decision.  Mr Moore has died, and the only
evidence of this conversation
is the evidence given by Mr Bott.  Nevertheless,
I do not believe Mr Bott's evidence on this point, for reasons explained
below.
<P>

19  	In late 1992 there was a meeting attended by Mr Moore, Mr Pastro
and Mr Bott.  Mr Bott says that at the meeting he was advised
by Mr Pastro that
the company was in a sound financial position and that he, Pastro, could see no
reason why Mr Bott should not accept
the invitation to become a director.  Mr
Pastro says that he had been asked by Mr Moore to prepare a budget and cashflow
forecast
for the company, and the meeting was held so that Mr Pastro could
obtain Mr Bott's view as a sales consultant on the forecast of
sales which
would be part of the cashflow forecast.  Mr Pastro denies that he ever made any
representation to Mr Bott about the company's
financial position or that he
gave him any advice about becoming a director, or that Mr Bott asked him any
questions relating to
the financial position of the company or sought any
advice, at that meeting or at any other time.
<P>

20  	Mr Bott accepted the invitation to become a director.  He says
there were to be no immediate benefits but Mr Moore was a friend
in need of
help. 
<P>

21  	On 5 January 1993 Mr Bott was appointed a director of the
company, replacing Mr Moore's wife.  On 28 January 1993 Mr Moore
instructed Mr
Pastro to arrange for the directorship and for his wife's shareholding to be
transferred to Mr Bott in trust for Mr
Moore, effective from 5 January 1993.
He did so.  He says he remembers wondering why anyone would agree to become a
director of the
company given its financial position.  He says that if Mr Bott
had asked him what the financial position of the company was at any
time from
the date of his appointment as a director on 5 January 1993 to the date when
the company ceased trading, he would have
told Mr Bott that in his opinion the
company was probably insolvent.  
<P>

<b>Mr  Bott's financial inquiries</b>
<P>

22  	Mr Bott says that there were never any formal meetings of the
board, but he saw Mr Moore every day.  He says that he made repeated
requests
for access to the company's profit and loss reports and balance sheets, but was
told by Mr Moore and the bookkeeper (who
has not given evidence) that there
were problems with the accounting system which prevented the production of that
information. 
He says that the problems with the accounting system did not lead
him to conclude that no one in the company knew its financial position,
because
he relied on Mr Moore, whose main concern was with debtors and creditors, and
on the appearance that the business was thriving.
 
<P>

23  	Mr Pastro says that he is not aware of any significant problems
experienced by the company in generating monthly profit and
loss statements,
balance sheets, creditor ledgers and debtor ledgers.  He says that those
documents were prepared by the company's
bookkeeper and office staff on a
monthly basis and he looked at them at times and discussed them with Mr Moore.
He says Mr Moore
asked him to investigate a new accounting system in mid-1993
but that was for Mr Moore's new publishing business, which I shall describe.

<P>

24  	Mr Bott says that around the middle of 1993 he `became aware
that there was a problem' with the company.  He discovered that
Mr Moore and
his new partner, a freelance print consultant called Louise Mahoney, had
established a travel publishing company called
Tourprint Publishing Pty Ltd,
and that Mr Moore was by that time focusing most of his efforts on the new
venture.  He overhead Mr
Moore complain about cashflow problems.  He says that
when in June or July 1993 he demanded access to information about the company's
financial position, he was told by Mr Moore that there was short term cashflow
problem.  He says that Mr Moore told him that he expected
to raise a
substantial sum of money from investors in the new Tourprint Publishing
business, and that $250,000 from that money would
be `injected' into Tourprint
International, apparently in order to resolve its cashflow difficulties.  He
says he was shown a document
prepared by Mr Moore and Mr Pastro which valued
the publishing business at $1 million.  He says they assured him that it was
worth
at least that amount and that at least two potential investors were
interested.  Mr Bott says he accepted this explanation.  
<P>

25  	However by September or October 1993 Mr Bott had reached the
view that `it was obvious that the problems were more than cashflow
and that
investors for the publishing company were not going to materialise'.
Nevertheless he decided not to resign as a director
as `it was too late for me
to do anything' and he was told by Mr Moore that `it was basically all over'.
He says Mr Moore told him
that he had paid all of Tourprint Publishing's costs
out of Tourprint International.  Mr Moore apologised to him for leaving him
with a mess.
<P>

26  	Subsequently Mr Sam Francipanny was retained by Mr Moore to
represent him, and possibly also Mr Bott.  Mr Francipanny became
a director of
Tourprint Publishing, which was re-named `Where In the World Publishing'.  Mr
Bott says Mr Francipanny did nothing
to assist him, contrary to his
expectation.  
<P>

<b>The company in voluntary administration and liquidation</b>
<P>

27  	The second plaintiff, Mr McDonald, was appointed as
administrator of the company on 13 December 1993.  He was appointed liquidator
on 3 February 1994.  Most of the company's financial records had been lost
before Mr McDonald took up his position as administrator.
 Mr Bott alleges that
Mr Moore admitted to him that the financial records were destroyed by Mr Moore
on the advice of Mr Pastro,
but Mr Pastro denies this allegation.
<P>

28  	The evidence does not include minutes of the meetings of
creditors which the administrator would have been required to convene
under ss
436E and 439A.  Nor does the evidence include the report which the
administrator would have been required to provide to
creditors under s 438D.
However, the liquidator's `report as to affairs' under s 497(1), dated 10 June
1994 (`the Report'), is in
evidence.
<P>

29  	The Report contains a statement of assets and liabilities of the
company as at 3 February 1994, stating figures at going concern
valuation and
estimated realisable values.  On a going concern basis, the company's total
assets are stated at $254,000, and on an
estimated realisable basis the figure
is $170,519.  The assets comprise cash of $60,228 and plant and equipment of
$6,000 (realisable
at $5,700), the remainder being trade creditors.
Liabilities amounted to $826,642.  Schedule H to the Report is a list of the
company's
unsecured creditors by name, showing the amount claimed by the
creditor and the amount admitted as owing.  There are 86 creditors
listed,
though in some cases the amount claimed is nil, and in each case the amount
admitted as owing is the same as the amount claimed
by the creditor.  The
amounts are not broken down by date of debt.  According to the evidence of Mr
Reidy, the manager assisting
Mr McDonald, Schedule H was prepared from
information supplied by the company's directors and from proofs of debt lodged
with Mr
McDonald by the company's creditors.  
<P>

30  	Annexed to the affidavit of Mr Reidy of 29 September 1997 is a
schedule (annexure H) prepared by Mr McDonald's staff, which
gives a month by
month analysis for the period from July to December 1993 of the company's
debts.  Annexure H shows the amount owing
to creditors at the beginning of July
1993, and the amount of payments allocated against those debts during the
months from July
to December 1993.  According to this information, $822,977 was
owing at the beginning of July 1993, and that amount had been reduced
to
$782,861 by December.  Annexure H also shows the amount of debts incurred in
the months from July to December and the amount of
payments allocated to those
debts, as well as the total debtors' balance in each month and the net
deficiency in each month.  Those
figures, which I accept, show that although
the total amount owed to creditors declined slightly over the six month period,
the total
debtors' balance also declined and consequently the deficiency rose
from $287,775 in July to $564,941 in December.  
<P>

<b>The evidence of Mr Bott and Mr Pastro</b>
<P>

31  	As I have indicated, Mr Bott has given evidence which implies
that he relied on representations by Mr Moore and Mr Pastro,
and attempted to
inform himself about the company's financial affairs, but failed through no
fault of his own.  In large measure,
Mr Bott's evidence is contradicted by the
evidence of Mr Pastro.  In making findings of fact, I must decide which witness
to believe.
 
<P>

32  	Apart from Mr Reidy, the second plaintiff's manager, the only
witnesses to be cross-examined were Mr Bott and Mr Pastro.  Mr
Moore has died.
The signed transcript of his examination before the Registrar is in evidence,
and sheds some limited light on a few
matters, as I shall indicate.
<P>

33  	In cross-examination Mr Bott generally gave direct and
straightforward answers to the questions put to him.  His oral evidence
was
internally consistent and was also consistent with his affidavits, although it
is true that his affidavits, which appeared to
have been drafted without much
or any legal assistance, were expressed in broad and imprecise language.
However, it is obvious that
Mr Bott finds himself in desperate circumstances
and finds it difficult to grasp that the law might impose on him personal
liability
for the company's debts although his conduct was (in his view)
entirely innocent.  His attitude to the proceedings led him to make
allegations
about the bona fides of the liquidator and allegations about conspiracies of
various kinds, which were without any evidentiary
basis.  That same attitude
seems to me to have affected his evidence.  His evidence was given in a spirit
of earnest advocacy.  Understandable
though that approach may have been in his
personal circumstances, it has made me wary about accepting his evidence where
it is contradicted
by other evidence and even where, though not contradicted,
it is uncorroborated.  
<P>

34  	Mr Bott's evidence was contradicted at crucial points by the
evidence of Mr Pastro.  There are four  areas of disagreement:
 first, Mr
Pastro denies that prior to Mr Bott's appointment as a director, he told Mr
Bott that the company was solvent and that
there was no reason why he should
not accept the appointment;  secondly, Mr Pastro says he observed no problems
with the company's
computer system which interfered with the production of
financial records;  thirdly, Mr Pastro denies advising Mr Bott about the
financial position of the company or the publishing business after Mr Bott's
appointment to the board, and denies that he told Mr
Bott that the publishing
business was worth $1 million;  and fourthly, Mr Pastro denies advising Mr
Moore to destroy the company's
records when it became obvious that the company
was insolvent.
<P>

35  	Mr Pastro's oral evidence was clear and internally consistent,
and consistent with his affidavit and other evidence apart from
the evidence of
Mr Bott.  Observing him as a witness, I saw no reason to disbelieve his
evidence.  Mr Bott attacks Mr Pastro's credibility
and several grounds.  First,
he says that Mr Pastro obtained a `free' overseas trip from Mr Moore -
presumably the contentions are
that the enticement of the overseas trip led Mr
Pastro to conceal the truth about the company's financial position from Mr Bott
and
to recommend that corporate records be destroyed, and the acceptance of the
overseas trip was somehow improper in a way which casts
a shadow over Mr
Pastro's evidence.  When asked about the overseas trip, Mr Pastro admitted that
Mr Moore had funded an overseas
trip for him as part of his remuneration for
the services which his firm had provided to Mr Moore, Tourprint International
and Tourprint
Publishing.  He accounted to his partners for the remuneration in
that form.  Since I accept that evidence, I reject the contentions
that it was
improper of Mr Pastro to accept the overseas trip, that the overseas trip was a
reward for improper advice such as the
advice to destroy financial records, and
that the enticement of the trip caused Mr Pastro to mislead Mr Bott.
<P>

36  	Mr Bott also asserts that Mr Pastro had a duty to warn him of
the true financial position of the company, both prior to his
taking the
appointment and subsequently while he was director.  Mr Bott engaged Mr Pastro
to provide a shelf company, but that engagement
cannot have implied any duty to
warn Mr Bott about the financial position of Tourprint International.  Apart
from this, the evidence
indicates that Mr Pastro was engaged to provide
services in three relevant capacities:  first, by Tourprint International to
prepare
unaudited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1992 and some
tax advice about the payment of commission to individuals
rather than to
companies;  secondly, by Mr Moore or Tourprint International, to prepare the
Valuation of Tourprint International
in connection with his divorce from his
wife;  and thirdly, by Mr Moore or possibly Ms Mahoney or Tourprint Publishing,
to assist
in the preparation of the information memorandum used for the purpose
of attracting investors to the publishing business.  
<P>

37  	Tourprint International did not have an auditor.  Mr Pastro
received his instructions principally from Mr Moore, though it
appears that he
also dealt with the company's bookkeeper.  He did not receive instructions from
or report to Mr Bott.  Mr Pastro
was contractually bound to provide specified
services to Tourprint International, and it is likely that the contract of
engagement
by that company obliged Mr Pastro to exercise due care.  He probably
also owed the company a tortious duty of care.  However, it
appears to me that
all relevant reporting duties were adequately discharged by Mr Pastro reporting
to Mr Moore.  It seems to me that
he had no obligation in contract or tort to
ensure that his reports reached Mr Bott as well as Mr Moore, in the
circumstances of
the present case.
<P>

38  	Those circumstances are as follows.  According to Mr Pastro's
evidence, which I accept, he was never requested by any director
(that is, Mr
Moore, his wife and, subsequently, Mr Bott) to provide financial information to
anyone other than Mr Moore.  He dealt
with Mr Moore because Mr Moore was the
person primarily involved in the management of the business.  He told Mr Moore
on various
occasions, including the time of the Valuation, that the company had
significant operating difficulties.  During the second half
of 1993 he told Mr
Moore more than once that the company's liabilities exceeded its assets and it
had significant cashflow difficulties,
and was not making a profit.  Although
he may not have used the word `insolvent', I am satisfied that this advice
implied that in
Mr Pastro's opinion, the company was insolvent for the purposes
of the definition in the Corporations Law.  
<P>

39  	Mr Pastro's evidence on these matters is consistent with Mr
Moore's evidence in his examination before the Registrar under
s 597 of the
Corporations Law, held on 1 July 1994.  The transcript indicates that according
to Mr Moore, Mr Pastro advised him that
the company was `in a bit of a hole'
and had to get in more work, and that if something was not done, `it could be
terminal'.  
<P>

40  	I therefore reject Mr Bott's submission that Mr Pastro had, in
the circumstances, a duty to warn him of the true financial
position of the
company.  The position may have been different if Mr Pastro had known that Mr
Moore was misleading Mr Bott as his
co-director, and excluding him from access
to financial information notwithstanding Mr Bott's requests.  But I find Mr
Pastro was
not aware of any such matters.  It follows from these conclusions
that I reject Mr Bott's attempts to undermine the evidence of Mr
Pastro by
asserting that he failed to discharge a duty to warn Mr Bott of the company's
financial circumstances.  I also reject Mr
Bott's submission that it is
inherently implausible that Mr Pastro would not have given such a warning  to
him.
<P>

41  	Weighing up all of these factors, I have concluded that the
evidence of Mr Pastro is to be preferred to Mr Bott's evidence
wherever their
accounts conflict.  That being so, I make the following findings.  
<P>

42  	First, I find that Mr Bott did not ask Mr Moore for any
financial information, nor Mr Pastro for any advice or information,
when the
three of them met with Mr Moore before Mr Bott was appointed to the board.  It
is plausible, as Mr Pastro says, that their
meeting with Mr Moore was about
sales projections.  It is implausible that Mr Bott regarded financial
information as important at
that time, since his own evidence is that he
thought the business was thriving and that he joined the board without having
received
any financial information at all.  It is likely that some financial
information was available as at September 1992, or at least before
January 1993
- specifically, the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June
1992, which were dated 16 December 1992 and
summarised in an annexure to the
Valuation. 
<P>

43  	Secondly, I find that Mr Bott did not seek balance sheets,
profit and loss statements or creditor ledgers from Mr Moore, Mr
Pastro or the
company's bookkeeper, and did not otherwise seek to inform himself of the
financial health of the company, during the
first six months of 1993.  I accept
that he obtained and used financial information about debtors, since
essentially his job was
to obtain orders for printing work from customers who
thereby became debtors, and it was necessary for him to know whether those
customers owed the company money.  But in my opinion, on the balance of
probabilities, that is as far as his financial knowledge
of the company went,
and he did not during the first six months of 1993 seek to inform himself more
generally of the company's financial
position and state of solvency.  Mr Bott
says that he was denied financial information because, according to Mr Moore
and the bookkeeper,
problems with the company's computer prevented the
information from being produced.  That is inconsistent with the evidence of Mr
Pastro that he experienced no problem with access to financial records through
the company's computer system.  It is also inconsistent
with evidence which Mr
Moore gave in his examination under s 597 before the Registrar, to the effect
that the computer could produce
trial balances, creditor and debtor ledgers and
`all those sorts of things', and that the complaints about the computer were
only
that it could not perform additional functions and that it kept `crashing'
and would be down for a week when it did so.  If Mr Bott
believed, as he
evidently did, that the company depended on the computer for such accounting
records as a general ledger, and debtor
and creditor ledgers, and if he also
believed that the computer was incapable of producing them, he should have
insisted that the
company immediately put itself in the position to keep the
financial records which the Corporations Law requires, but there is no
evidence
that he did so.  The most plausible explanation is that basic financial
information was available from the company's computer,
allowing for occasional
breakdowns, but Mr Bott did not seek to obtain it during the first six months
of 1993.  I note that in his
examination before the Registrar, Mr Bott said
that he asked for financial information `six months before Tourprint folded',
and
asked again in October 1993, and that he believed that the information
which he sought was available from the computer.  This is
inconsistent with his
evidence in these proceedings.  
<P>

44  	I accept Mr Bott's evidence that from the middle of 1993, he
became concerned that there was a financial problem with the company,
and that
then he was persuaded by Mr Moore that the company's cashflow difficulties
would be overcome when investors provided funds
for Tourprint Publishing.  That
evidence is not inconsistent with Mr Pastro's evidence, since Mr Pastro
confirms that he had instructions
from Mr Moore to prepare financial
information for an information memorandum at that time.  But Mr Pastro did not
make any representation
directly to Mr Bott on that subject.  The information
memorandum is not in evidence, but I accept that it contained an optimistic
account of the value of the business of Tourprint Publishing and the prospects
of that company.  It probably stated that Tourprint
Publishing was indebted to
Tourprint International in the sum of $402,000.  It not clear from the evidence
whether the information
memorandum stated that Tourprint International was
shareholder in Tourprint Publishing, nor whether that was ever in fact the
case.
 In my opinion it is unlikely that the information memorandum contained
any information about Tourprint International which would
have provided a basis
for the belief that in the absence of a cash injection (perhaps through
repayment of the loan account in the
event that investors were attracted into
Tourprint Publishing) Tourprint International would be able to pay its debts as
and when
they fell due.  I accept Mr Pastro's evidence that he gave no advice
or made any representations to Mr Bott about the information
memorandum or
about the financial position of Tourprint International at any stage during Mr
Bott's directorship.
<P>

45  	Finally, given my assessments of Mr Bott and Mr Pastro as
witnesses, I see no basis for accepting Mr Bott's serious allegation
that Mr
Pastro advised Mr Moore to destroy the company's records.  Mr Moore sought to
explain the absence of records in his evidence
before the Registrar, on the
basis that documentary records were lost when the company moved from St
Leonards to Neutral Bay early
in December 1993, and he said that the computer
itself was damaged when dropped by the removalist and was discarded to a
rubbish
tip.  Regardless of whether Mr Moore's account is convincing, there was
nothing in it to implicate Mr Pastro.
<P>

<b>The law</b>
<P>

46  	By a summons filed on 13 March 1997, the company in liquidation
and the liquidator now sue Mr Bott for declarations and orders
under Part 5.7B
Division 3 of the Corporations Law with respect to debts incurred by the
company during the period from July to December
1993.  The cause of action is
under s 588M.  Section 588M(1) sets out four ingredients of the cause of
action, of which only two
can be in issue in these proceedings.  The two
ingredients which cannot be contested are that the debts specified in the
summons
are unsecured (s 588M(1)(c)) and that the company is being wound up (s
588M(1)(d)).  The other two ingredients are that Mr Bott has
contravened s 588G
in relation to the incurring of debts by the company (s 588M(1)(a)), and that
creditors have suffered loss or
damage in relation to the debts because of the
company's insolvency (s 588M(1)(b)).  Mr Bott denies that he has contravened s
588G,
asserting that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that any individual
debt was incurred at the relevant time, and relying on the
defences contained
in ss 588H(2) and (4).  He also denies that the plaintiffs have proved that
there are any creditors who have suffered
loss or damage.  
<P>

<b>The liquidator's calculation of the amount claimed in the summons</b>
<P>

47  	Mr McDonald as liquidator seeks to recover $519,320 from Mr
Bott, together with interest.  The schedule to the summons filed
on 13 March
1997 contains an alphabetical list of creditors and adjacent to each, one or
more dates and amounts, the amounts adding
up to that sum.  The earliest date
listed is 1 July 1993 and the latest is 9 December 1993.  The list runs to 13
pages.  Mr Reidy's
evidence is that the schedule to the summons sets out the
outstanding debts of the company which were incurred over the period from
1
July to 9 December 1993.  He says the list was prepared by reference to a
schedule (`the Creditors' Schedule') which is annexure
A to his affidavit of 13
August 1998.  He says that the Creditors' Schedule was prepared by staff of Mr
McDonald on the basis of
information contained in invoices, statements and
correspondence which had been delivered to Mr McDonald. 
<P>

48  	The Creditors' Schedule is a spreadsheet giving an alphabetical
list of creditors, the opening balance (if any) of the amounts
owing to them as
at 1 July 1993, and for each of the months from July to December 1993, a list
of additional debts incurred and amounts
paid, giving a date for each item.

<P>

49  	Naturally there are differences between Schedule H to the Report
and the list in the summons, for two reasons.  First, Schedule
H states only
total amounts claimed and admitted in respect of each creditor, whereas the
schedule to the summons is confined to
the outstanding amount of debts incurred
on or after 1 July 1993, and lists them individually.  Secondly, Schedule H was
prepared
on the basis of information supplied by the directors and proofs of
debt lodged by the creditors, whereas the schedule to the summons,
being based
on the Creditors' Schedule, is sourced in information contained in invoices,
statements and correspondence from creditors.
 Those documents, which are
voluminous, are in evidence.  
<P>

50  	In an effort to clarify the situation, Ms Ward, who is an
employee of Mr McDonald, prepared a schedule dated 5 August 1998
which lists
creditors alphabetically, and for each creditor shows the amount appearing in
Schedule H to the Report, the amount of
any proof of debt, the part of any
proof of debt which relates to the period after June 1993, and the amount
claimed in the schedule
to the summons.
<P>

51  	Mr Bott submits that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that
any individual debt referred to in the schedule to the summons
was incurred at
the time asserted in the schedule.  He says that for this to be proved, on the
balance of probabilities, the Court
must form an actual belief to a reasonable
satisfaction about the relevant facts.  He cites <i>Briginshaw v Briginshaw
</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336</a>, 361-2;  <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298</a>,

have given evidence of the manner in which he investigated and verified each
debt which he
claims from Mr Bott, but he failed to do so.  Mr Reidy's
evidence, he says, is inadequate and vague, and does not explain what the
liquidator has in fact done.  He notes that many of the items which appear in
the schedule to the summons do not appear in Schedule
H to the Report, and
others appear for differing amounts, and claims that the discrepancy is not
adequately explained.  The basis
on which proofs have been accepted is not
explained, and nor is the basis upon which the plaintiff makes a claim in
respect of creditors
who have not lodged a proof of debt.  
<P>

52  	Mr Bott says he has compared the schedule to the summons with
Schedule H and has calculated that only $327,163 of the claims
in the summons
are mentioned in Schedule H (and some of these are for differing amounts).
Further, Mr Bott has calculated that the
summons claims $77,179 for debts
incurred after 1 October 1993, before any allowance is made for discrepancies
between the summons
and Schedule H.  
<P>

53  	I reject Mr Bott's submissions on these matters.  I accept that
the plaintiffs must prove that each individual debt claimed
in the schedule to
the summons was incurred during the relevant period (the relevant period being
the period from 1 July to 9 December
1993, assuming for present purposes that
the company was insolvent throughout that period).  I accept that the Court
must form an
actual belief to a reasonable satisfaction that those debts were
incurred, in order to find for the plaintiffs on the balance of
probabilities.
But in the circumstances of this case I regard the plaintiffs' evidence as
adequate to enable the Court to reach a
conclusion in the plaintiffs' favour.
The discrepancies between the schedule to the summons and Schedule H to the
Report are, in
my opinion, explicable in the manner which I have indicated.
The fact that some of the creditors listed in the schedule to the summons
have
not lodged a proof of debt is inconclusive.  The plaintiffs' evidence is that
the schedule to the summons was prepared by reference
to the Creditors'
Schedule, which is in evidence, and the Creditors' Schedule was prepared on the
basis of information contained
in invoices, statements and correspondence which
are also in evidence, grouped by reference to whether the debts relate to the
period
to 30 June 1993 or from 1 July 1993.  In my opinion this evidence amply
discloses the liquidator's methodology in preparing the schedule
to the
summons.  I reject the submission that the evidence of Mr Reidy was inadequate
and vague, when one takes account of both his
two affidavits and his oral
evidence.  
<P>

54  	It was open to Mr Bott to review the evidence, comprising the
crowded contents of five lever-arch folders, to demonstrate any
error in the
correlation of that documentary evidence with the items in the schedule to the
summons.  He did not do so, even though
he had Ms Ward's helpful schedule which
drew attention to differences between Schedule H, proofs of debt and the
schedule to the
summons.  I infer from Mr Reidy's evidence of the liquidator's
methodology, and from the evidence which comprises the Creditors'
Schedule and
the bundles of documents upon which it is based, and from the absence of any
specific challenge to the accuracy or compilation
of that evidence, that on the
balance of probabilities the debts listed in the schedule to the summons were
incurred on the dates
there stated and remain outstanding to the extent of the
amounts there stated.
<P>

<b>Finding on insolvency</b>
<P>

55  	The meaning of the `solvent' and `insolvent' for the purposes of
s 588G (inter alia) is given by s 95A.  Section 95A(1) says
that a person is
solvent if and only if the person is able to pay all his or her debts as and
when they become due and payable. 
A person who is not solvent is insolvent (s
95A(2)).
<P>

56  	The summons seeks an order that Mr Bott pay to the liquidator
the amount of debts incurred by the company during the period
from 1 July 1993
to 9 December 1993, a few days before the company went into voluntary
administration.  This is on the basis that
either the company was insolvent
throughout that period, or that it became insolvent by incurring the debts
listed in the schedule
to the summons, or those debts and other debts.  
<P>

57  	In my opinion the evidence establishes that the company was
insolvent prior to 1 July 1993 and continued to be insolvent thereafter.
 I
reach this conclusion on the following grounds.  First, the Valuation indicated
that the company had suffered a significant net
loss in the quarter to
September 1992 and had negative working capital.  While the Valuation does not
demonstrate that at its date,
9 November 1992, the company was unable to pay
all its debts as and when they became due and payable, since the financial
statements
upon which it relied showed substantial cash on hand and there was
no analysis of the aging of debtors and creditors, nevertheless
the Valuation
provides a basis for apprehension about the company's solvency.  Secondly, Mr
Pastro's evidence is that he thought
the company was probably insolvent before
Mr Bott took up his directorship.  Thirdly, the analysis in annexure H to Mr
Reidy's affidavit
of 29 September 1997, which was not challenged, is that there
was a net deficiency of creditors over debtors in each month from July
to
December, ranging from $287,775 in July to $564,941 in December, and that the
deficiency according to the opening creditors' balance
for July was nearly
$300,000.  Fourthly, the Report stated that as at 3 February 1994, the
estimated deficiency in the company was
$656,123.  It is implausible that this
deficiency would have arisen entirely over a period shorter than the period
from July to December
1993.  Finally, correspondence between the company and
its creditors is in evidence.  It shows that Mr Moore was in correspondence
with a significant number of creditors from September to November 1993,
apologising for not paying accounts, identifying `liquidity
problems' which (he
said) would be overcome shortly, and offering instalment payments.  There is
similar though less voluminous correspondence
during the period from June 1992
to August 1993.  Taken together, this material shows that the company was
chronically unable to
meet its debts as and when they fell due from at least
September 1993, and implies that the problem arose at an earlier time.  That
this occurred is corroborated by Mr Bott's own evidence that he overheard Mr
Moore speaking of `cashflow problems' in mid-1993.
<P>

58  	This was not a case of a cashflow problem in the sense of
temporary lack of liquidity.  As Jacobs J said in <i>Hymix v Garritty</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2013%20ALR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 13 ALR 321</a> at 328:
<P>

`A temporary lack of liquidity must be distinguished from an endemic shortage
of working capital whereby liquidity can only be restored
by a successful
outcome of business ventures in which the existing working capital has been
deployed...'
<P>

59  	It is not necessary, in my opinion, to rely on the statutory
presumption of insolvency arising under s 588E in order to reach
the conclusion
on the present facts that the company was insolvent throughout the period from
July to December 1993.  However, since
the present proceeding is clearly a
`recovery proceeding' (see ss 588E(1)(e) and 588E(2)) and the company is being
wound up, the
presumption in s 588E(3) is available.  Even if it were not clear
that the company was insolvent throughout the period from July
to December
1993, it would be incontestable that the company was insolvent by December
1993, when the administrator was appointed.
 In the present case the relation
back day is 13 December 1993, the date on which the administrator was
appointed, having regard
to ss 513B and 513C.  Therefore the effect of s
588E(3) is that it must be presumed that the company was insolvent throughout
the
period of twelve months ending on 13 December 1993.  
<P>

<b>Liability for insolvent trading</b>
<P>

60  	The relevant parts of s 588G are as follows:
<P>

`(1)	This section applies if:
<P>

(a)	a person is a director of a company at the time when the company incurs a
debt;  and
<P>

(b)	the company is insolvent at that time, or becomes insolvent by incurring
that debt, or by incurring at the time debts including
that debt;  and
<P>

(c)	at that time, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the company
is insolvent, or would become so insolvent, as the
case may be;  and
<P>

(d)	that time is at or after the commencement of this Part.
<P>

(2)	By failing to prevent the company from incurring the debt, the person
contravenes this section if:
<P>

(a)	the person is aware at that time that there are such grounds for so
suspecting;  or
<P>

(b)	a reasonable person in a like position in a company in the company's
position would be so aware.'
<P>

61  	I have found that the company incurred the debts listed in the
schedule to the summons on the dates so listed.  During the
whole of the period
from 1 July 1993 to 9 December 1993, Mr Bott was director of the company.
Therefore s 588G(1)(a) is satisfied.
 I have also found that the company was
insolvent throughout the period from 1 July 1993 to 9 December 1993.  Therefore
s 588G(1)(b)
is satisfied.  Obviously s 588G(1)(d) is satisfied.  I turn to s
588G(1)(c).
<P>

62  	Case law gives some assistance as to the meaning of the concept
of `reasonable grounds for suspecting':  see <i>Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20266" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 266</a>, 303;  <i>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Friedrich
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%205%20ACSR%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 5 ACSR 115</a>, 123-124.  However, it is not necessary to explore the
reach and limits of that concept given the clear facts of this case. <b> </b>In
my opinion it is beyond contest that throughout the period from 1 July 1993 to
9 December 1993 there were reasonable grounds for
suspecting that the company
was insolvent.  Those grounds arose out of the state of the company's financial
records, which were reviewed
by Mr Pastro, the growing deficiency of creditors
over debtors, and the absence of any significant assets other than trade
debtors
and cash.  Anyone aware of facts disclosed by that information would
have realised that the company was hopelessly insolvent throughout
the relevant
period. 
<P>

63  	As to the ingredients of s 588G(2), I find that Mr Bott's state
of knowledge in mid-1993 was such that he was aware that there
were reasonable
grounds for suspecting that the company was insolvent at that time, and his
awareness of such grounds continued for
the whole period from July to December
1993.  His own evidence is that he was aware that `there was problem' around
the middle of
the year.  He knew that Mr Moore and his friend Ms Mahoney had
established the travel publishing business and that they were concentrating
most of their efforts on that business.  He overheard Mr Moore complaining
about cashflow.  When he `demanded' evidence of the company's
financial
position he was told that there was a short term cashflow problem and that Mr
Moore was looking for an investor for the
publishing company.  The natural
implication was that if investors were not attracted to the publishing company
so that cash could
be injected into Tourprint International, the cashflow
problem would continue.  
<P>

64  	In my opinion, a reasonable person in a like position in a
company in Tourprint International's circumstances would have been
aware
throughout the period from July to December 1993 that there were reasonable
grounds for suspecting insolvency, even if Mr Bott
was not aware.  A reasonable
person would have pressed forcefully for financial information about the
company before taking up an
appointment to the board, and then for regularly
updated financial information so that a proper assessment of the company's
financial
position could regularly be made.  A reasonable person in the
position of director of Tourprint International would not have suspended
his
demands for financial information because of any alleged inadequacies of the
company's computer, and would have explored and
insisted upon resolving any
such problems.  It is not easy to envisage circumstances in which a reasonable
company director could
tolerate a situation in which the company could not
produce basic financial information, such as debtor and creditor ledgers, for
any significant period of time.  In the circumstances of the present case,
either a reasonable person in Mr Bott's shoes would have
obtained financial
information by mid-1993 which would have provided ample grounds to believe that
the company was insolvent or,
if such information was sought and not obtained,
the absence of the information would itself contribute, together with other
circumstances,
to the existence of reasonable grounds for strong suspicion of
insolvency.  
<P>

<b>Defences</b>
<P>

65  	Mr Bott relies on two of the defences to proceedings for
contravention of s 588G, found respectively in ss 588H(2) and (4).
<P>

66  	Section 588H(2) says:
<P>

`It is a defence if it is proved that, at the time when the debt was incurred,
the person had reasonable grounds to expect, and
did expect, that the company
was solvent at that time and would remain solvent even if it incurred that debt
and any other debt that
it incurred at that time.'
<P>

67  	`Expectation', as required by s 588H(2), means a higher degree
of certainty than `mere hope or possibility' or `suspecting':
 <i>3M Australia
Pty Ltd v Kemish</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20ACLC%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 ACLC 371</a>, 378;  <i>Dunn v Shapowloff </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%202%20NSWLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978]
2 NSWLR 235</a>, 249.  The defence requires an actual expectation that the company
was and would continue to be solvent, and that the grounds for
so expecting are
reasonable.  A director cannot rely on a complete ignorance of or neglect of
duty (<i>Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Lewis </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20ACLR%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 ACLR 122</a>, 129) and
cannot hide behind ignorance of the company's affairs which is of their own
making or, if not entirely of their own making,
has been contributed to by
their own failure to make further necessary inquiries (<i>Morley v State Wide
Tobacco Services Ltd </i>(1990) 2 ACSR 405, 431;  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1993/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] VicRp 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%208%20ACSR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 8 ACSR 305).</a>  
<P>

68  	Mr Bott says that he did expect and had reasonable grounds to
expect that the company was solvent, at least up until September-October
1993.
It may be that Mr Bott's actual expectation was that the company would be able
to pay its debts as and when they fell due,
prior to September 1993.  But by
mid-1993, if not before, that expectation was without any reasonable
foundation.  He became aware
of a `problem' in the middle of the year, and
observed Mr Moore concentrating on the new publishing business and overhead him
complaining
about cashflow.  Although he was shown the information memorandum
and told that some investors were interested, it was not reasonable
for him,
without further investigation, to expect that investors would come forward and
that Tourprint Publishing would inject further
capital of $250,000 into
Tourprint International.  And even if that expectation had been reasonable, it
would not be reasonable to
expect that the injection of that further capital
would solve Tourprint International's problem, without proper inquiries as to
the
financial state of affairs in the company.  If proper inquiries had been
made, Mr Bott would have come to realise the serious operational
problems which
had arisen in the company by no later than mid-1993, and probably many months
earlier;  he would have discovered the
amount of the net deficiency of assets
to creditors, which the evidence indicates was already in excess of $250,000 by
the end of
June 1993;  and he would have realised that even with a cash
injection, the company's financial prospects were very bleak because
of its
high fixed costs and declining gross profit.  In those circumstances he cannot
invoke s 588H(2) to hide behind his ignorance.

<P>

69  	Section 588H(4) provides:
<P>

`If the person was director of the company at the time when the debt was
incurred, it is a defence if it is proved that, because
of illness or for some
other good reason, he or she did not take part at that time in the management
of the company.'
<P>

70  	Counsel for Mr Bott submits, with some ingenuity, that Mr Bott
did not take part in the management of the company `for some
other good
reason'.  The `good reason' is said to be that he was excluded from management
by the deceptions of Mr Moore and Mr Pastro.
 
<P>

71  	I have rejected Mr Bott's contention that he was deceived by Mr
Pastro in various ways, but I accept that he was mislead by
Mr Moore.  Mr Moore
was well aware of the company's poor financial health at least as from the date
of the Valuation, and was informed
of the worsening situation by Mr Pastro from
time to time.  Yet he did not disclose any of this information to Mr Bott, and
led Mr
Bott to believe that the company's financial predicament was less
serious than it was, and would be cured once funds were raised
for the
publishing business.
<P>

72  	Mr Bott did not take part in the financial management of the
company, but he had an important role to play in sales and in
debt recovery
from his customers.  In these circumstances I doubt that it is true to say that
he did not take part in the management
of the company at all.  But even if that
can be said, my opinion is that Mr Bott's failure to have a more active role in
management
is not referrable to any reason which is a `good reason' for the
purposes of s 588H(4).
<P>

73  	There are no reported decisions which interpret the words `other
good reason' in the context of the present section.  Case
law under the
previous s 592, which is differently worded, considered circumstances such as
these:
<P>

&#183;	where an alternate director, who acts only when a regular director
cannot do so, is not acting as a director when the debt
is incurred
(<i>Playcorp Pty Ltd v Shaw </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2010%20ACSR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 10 ACSR 212)</a>;  
<P>

&#183;	where a director goes overseas and requests another director to be
appointed in his place (<i>Androvin v Figliomeni </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 1461).</a>
<P>

If the facts of those cases occurred under the present section, they may well
be cases of `other good reason' under s 588H(4). 

<P>

74  	The provision seems to have its source in the <i>Report of the
General Insolvency Inquiry</i> by the Australian Law Reform Commission (Report
45 - `Harmer Committee Report'), which said at paragraph 312 that `it is not
appropriate
for a provision designed to establish a proper standard of conduct
by directors to impose liability on a director who was not in
a position to
influence the management of the financial affairs of the company at the
relevant time'.  Mr Bott says that he was not
in a position to influence the
management of the financial affairs of the company because Mr Moore deceptively
excluded him.  
<P>

75  	In my opinion Mr Bott's submission is contrary to the policy
underlying the subsection as disclosed by the Harmer Committee.
 In paragraph
312 the Harmer Committee expressed the view that a director should not be
excused where, though acting reasonably,
he has not shown the `necessary
commitment to an involvement with the management of a company in financial
difficulties'.  Mr Bott
clearly did not show a proper degree of commitment to
involvement in the financial management of the company, for he was never
involved
in financial management at all.  He ought to have realised that by not
having any such involvement, he was not properly discharging
his
responsibilities as a director.  He ought to have taken steps from the outset,
and at least by mid-1993, to ensure that he had
a proper degree of involvement
as a director in the management of the company.  He ought, in short, to have
confronted Mr Moore and
insisted upon proper involvement in the company's
affairs.  He cannot now treat Mr Moore's deceptive conduct as a good reason for
not taking part in management when he did not assert his rights as a director
from the outset and with vigour.
<P>

76  	At one stage Mr Bott indicated that he wished to rely on s
588H(3), although he did not do so in final submissions.  In my
opinion s
588H(3) is not available on the facts, as I have found them to be in this case.
Mr Pastro was not responsible for providing
Mr Bott with adequate information
about whether the company was solvent.  Nor was Mr Moore, but even if Mr Moore
had accepted some
such responsibility, it would not have been reasonable for Mr
Bott to believe that Mr Moore was fulfilling that responsibility.
<P>

77  	My conclusion is that none of the defences relied upon is
available in the present case, and consequently the contravention
of s 588G is
made out.
<P>

<b>Loss or damage suffered by creditors</b>
<P>

78  	For the purposes of s 588M(1), the persons to whom the debts are
owed are those listed in the schedule to the summons.  Because
of the company's
insolvency, they have not been paid.  They have therefore suffered loss or
damage in relation to their debts because
of the company's insolvency, and
consequently s 588M(1)(b) is satisfied in this case.  
<P>

79  	It follows that all the ingredients of s 588M(1) have been made
out, and consequently Mr McDonald as the company's liquidator
may recover from
Mr Bott as a director, as a debt due to the company, an amount equal to the
amount of the loss or damage of the
creditors, which in the present case is the
amount of their debts (s 588M(2)).  
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

80  	Mr McDonald is entitled to the principal relief claimed in the
summons, namely:
<P>

(1)	a declaration that at the time when the first plaintiff incurred the
unsecured debts to the creditors referred to in the schedule
to the summons
(`the Debts'), the first plaintiff was insolvent;
<P>

(2)	a declaration that at the time the first plaintiff incurred the Debts there
were reasonable grounds suspecting that the first
plaintiff was insolvent;
<P>

(3)	a declaration that the defendant was a director of the first plaintiff at
the time when the first plaintiff incurred the Debts;
<P>

(4)	a declaration that by virtue of the preceding matters the defendant has
contravened s 588G of the Corporations Law;
<P>

(5)	a declaration that the creditors of the first plaintiff set out in the
schedule have suffered loss or damage in relation to
their debts because of the
first plaintiff's insolvency;
<P>

(6)	an order that the defendant pay to the second plaintiff as a debt due to
the first plaintiff the sum of $519,320.
<P>

81  	The summons claims interest pursuant to s 94 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act 1970</a> (NSW).  The award of interest under that section is
discretionary, though the Court will normally exercise its discretion in favour
of a plaintiff who obtains a money judgment.  I can see no reason for not
awarding interest in the present case, and I propose to
do so.  Equally I can
see no reason for not ordering that Mr Bott as defendant pay the costs of the
plaintiffs.  
<P>

82  	I therefore propose to make the declarations and orders set out
in paragraphs (1) to (6) above.  Those declarations and orders
can take effect
in the normal way, when they are entered.  I also propose to order interest
pursuant to s 94 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>, and that the defendant play the
plaintiffs' costs, on the basis that the last two orders will take effect one
week from the date
of handing down these reasons for judgment.  I shall grant
either party liberty to apply to me on any week day on 24 hours notice
to the
other party, for the purpose of making any submissions as to interest or costs,
on the basis that if that liberty is not successfully
exercised within seven
days, the orders concerning interest and costs will take effect
automatically.
<P>

83  	I shall ask counsel for the plaintiffs to prepare short minutes
of orders to reflect these reasons.
<P>
