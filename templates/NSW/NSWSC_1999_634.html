<i>Thursday, 24 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4436/96	MARK LITTLEJOHN   -v-   LOIS LITTLEJOHN   -   ESTATE OF JAMES EDWARD
LITTLEJOHN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.  The proceedings were instituted by summons filed on 16
December 1996.  That summons named four plaintiffs, Mark James Littlejohn,
Deanne Gai Littlejohn, David Michael Littlejohn and Julie Anne Littlejohn.  By
that summons the plaintiffs claim, substantively,
an order that provision be
made for the plaintiffs' maintenance, education and advancement in life
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act </i>1982</a> out of the
estate, and/or the notional estate, of James Edward Littlejohn late of Bangor
in the State of New South Wales.
<P>

2   	The four plaintiffs are the four children of the late James
Edward Littlejohn (to whom I shall refer as "the deceased").  
<P>

3   	The deceased was born on 19 November 1939.  He died aged
fifty-five on 3 June 1995.  He left a will dated 2 July 1992 probate
whereof
was on 11 August 1995 granted to Lois Littlejohn, the executor named in such
will, who is the defendant to the present proceedings.
<P>

4   	By that will the deceased gave to each of his four children
a legacy of $1000 and gave the residue of his estate to his wife,
Lois
Littlejohn.  The assets disclosed in the inventory of property annexed to the
probate consist of unused annual leave of $34,138
and unused long service leave
of $22,774 totalling $56,912.  In addition, the inventory of property discloses
that the deceased was
a joint tenant with his wife, the defendant, of the house
property situate at and known as 10 Whitesands Road, Fingal Bay, which
was the
matrimonial home of the deceased and his wife at the time of his death.  To
that house property is ascribed in the inventory
of property a value of
$220,000.  That house, by survivorship, passes to the defendant.
<P>

5   	The defendant executor has listed the liabilities and
estate debts as totalling $17,504, comprising American Express indebtedness,
$2,672; medical expenses, $12,100; and funeral experiences, $2,732.  In
addition to the deceased and the defendant also had joint
liabilities in
respect of unpaid accounts relating to the Fingal Bay property, totalling
$15,229.  The defendant has notionally apportioned
the total amount of joint
liabilities equally between herself personally and the estate of the deceased.
She has concluded that after
the deduction of the total amount of liabilities
(being estate debts of $17,504 and half of the joint liabilities in respect to
the
Fingal Bay property an amount of $7,614.50), and after the payment of the
four legacies totalling $4,000, there will remain a net
balance in the estate
of $27,794.50, to which net balance the defendant is, under the terms of the
will, entitled.
<P>

6   	It must also be recognised that provision must be made for
the costs of the present proceedings.  Evidence has been placed
before the
Court that the costs of the plaintiffs will total about $20,000, whilst the
costs of the defendant will total between
$20,000 and $22,500.
<P>

7   	I have already recorded that the proceedings were
instituted in the names of the four children of the deceased.  However, at
the
outset of the hearing this morning, Counsel for the plaintiffs informed the
Court that the hearing was now proceeding only as
a claim by Deanne Gai
Littlejohn, the second plaintiff, and that the claims of the other three
plaintiffs were being abandoned.
<P>

8   	I have also referred to the fact that the summons was filed
on 16 December 1996.  That was twelve days after the expiry of
the eighteen
month limitation period from the date of the death of the deceased.  However,
there has been placed before the Court
an affidavit by Eric Richard Leslie
Butler, the solicitor for the plaintiffs, sworn 23 June 1999, which sets forth
the circumstances
in which the summons was not filed within the prescribed
period.
<P>

9   	Subsequently, on 23 July 1997, there was filed an amended
summons, which seeks, in prayer 1, relief identical to that sought
in prayer 1
of the summons, and also seeks, in prayer 2, an order that the time for the
making of this application be extended. 
If I am otherwise satisfied that it is
appropriate that an order for provision should be made in favour of the second
plaintiff (to
whom I shall refer as Deanne), then I consider that the failure
of the plaintiff to institute the proceedings within the prescribed
period has
been sufficiently explained in Mr Butler's affidavit and that, in the exercise
of my discretion, I should extend the time
for the institution of the
proceedings.
<P>

10   	Deanne was born on 19 September 1966.  She is presently
thirty-two years of age.  She resided with the deceased and her mother
and her
brothers and sister.  The deceased and Deanne's mother separated in about 1989,
when Deanne was about twenty-three years
old.  She left school after completing
year nine in 1981 when she was aged fifteen, and left home in about 1984 when
she was aged
eighteen.  She has thereafter always resided in rented
accommodation.  Deanne has never been in employment. That is essentially the
consequence of the fact that she suffers from a condition known as Turner's
Syndrome.  She has never married, nor is she currently
in a de facto
relationship. 
<P>

11   	Deanne's sole income is a disability pension from
Centrelink, which is presently in an amount of $442.60.  She has a bank
account
with the St George Bank into which her pension is paid each fortnight.  By the
end of the fortnight there is usually little
left in that account.
<P>

12   	Deanne currently resides in an establishment known as
Randwick Lodge at Botany Street, Randwick, in accommodation, which,
from
photographs tendered in evidence, is of an extremely basic (not to say,
Spartan) nature.  For that accommodation she pays rent
of $250 a fortnight.
Her other fortnightly expenses are listed in her affidavit of 24 June 1999.
There is a shortfall of $62.40 between
Deanne's average fortnightly expenses
and her fortnightly income from her disability pension.  She has no fund to
allow for an emergency
situation or for the acquisition of new clothing.  She
receives assistance in that regard and also in regard to food, from the
Salvation
Army.  She regularly consults a general medical practitioner, Dr
Bennett, who prescribes for her medication.  Also, every six to
twelve months,
she is seen by a specialist medical practitioner at the instance of
Centrelink.
<P>

13   	Deanne requires dental treatment.  This will be provided
eventually by the United Dental Hospital, but she does not know when.
 It is
possible it will be some years hence.  She has been on a waiting list for the
past three years.
<P>

14   	Deanne has placed before the Court a list of quotations
for various basic items of furnishing and electrical and other appliances
which
she does not possess and which one might expect would be regarded as standard
equipment in any ordinary accommodation.   The
cost of those items totals
something in excess of $8,500.
<P>

15   	I have had the benefit of seeing Deanne in the witness box
and of hearing her oral evidence.  She was asked questions concerning
why she
had moved from the Central Coast area of New South Wales to Randwick where she
has been residing for some years.  Her explanation
in that regard - that she
was not accepted in the community where her mother, one of her brothers and one
of her sisters, reside
- appears to me to be a fully reasonable explanation.
She said she is more accepted in the area where she presently lives and where
she knows a considerable number of people.  She also said, that, because she
has mood swings which are uncontrollable, it would be
difficult for her brother
and sister, if she went to reside with them and their mother.  
<P>

16   	Deanne also expressed a desire - again a very reasonable
aspiration - that she wants to better herself in regard to her accommodation.
Evidence was placed before the Court, both orally and in Deanne's affidavit,
concerning the cost of rental of somewhat higher standard
accommodation in the
Randwick area than she is presently occupying.  
<P>

17   	Deanne, as a daughter of the deceased, is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  As such she has the standing
to bring the present proceedings.  Each of the other named plaintiffs is also
an eligible person within
the same paragraph of that definition.  The
defendant, as the widow of the deceased, is also an eligible person, coming
within paragraph
(a) of that definition.
<P>

18   	In approaching the claim of the plaintiff the Court must
also have regard to any competing claims upon the testamentary bounty
of the
deceased.  Since the other three plaintiffs have now abandoned their claims the
only claim competing with that of Deanne is
the claim of the defendant.
<P>

19   	The defendant married the deceased on 11 April 1992.  They
had, however, been living together since 1989.  Accordingly, it
is appropriate
to regard the relationship between the defendant and the deceased as obtaining
over a period of some six years from
1989 until the unexpected  death of the
deceased in mid-1995.
<P>

20   	Each of the deceased and the defendant had been previously
married, and previously divorced.  The defendant brought into her
marriage with
the deceased various assets.  Those assets included an amount of $85,000 from
the sale of a house property at 15 Goorgool
Road, Bangor; an amount of $7,500,
being the proceeds of sale of her Ford Laser motor vehicle, an amount of
$8,500, being the proceeds
of sale of her caravan; and savings of $40,000.
<P>

21   	Upon the death of the deceased the defendant received by
survivorship the interest of the deceased in the former matrimonial
home at
Fingal Bay.  She also received an interest in a joint account conducted by
herself and the deceased at the St George Bank.
The amount ascribed to that
interest on behalf of the defendant is $1,500, although there appears to be a
degree of doubt as to whether
she actually received the benefit of that amount.
She also received the interest of the deceased in a jointly owned Landcruiser
motor
vehicle, the estimated value of which vehicle was $25,000.
<P>

22   	Apart from those amounts, which the defendant received by
survivorship, and apart from the net balance of the estate, in the
amount which
I have earlier calculated, the defendant also received directly, as the
nominated beneficiary of the deceased under
a superannuation entitlement, an
amount of $34,592.05.  Further, the defendant also received, in her own
capacity as widow of the
deceased and not as a benefit passing from the estate
of the deceased, an award in the Workers Compensation Commission of $65,000.
<P>

23   	The defendant is presently aged sixty and will very
shortly be aged sixty-one.  Upon achieving the age of sixty-one she will
be
entitled to receive the age pension.  She will achieve that age on 30 June
1999, less than a week hence.  At the present time,
however, the defendant is,
and for some time has been, living upon her capital.  She has a minuscule,
income consisting of interest
on savings.  That income is a little over $1000 a
year.  
<P>

24   	It is in the context of that competing claim upon the
testamentary bounty of the deceased that the Court must approach the
claim of
Deanne. It must be recognised that the defendant is the chosen object of the
testamentary beneficence of the deceased. 

<P>

25   	Normally there is no obligation upon a parent to make
provision by way of accommodation for an adult child. But, in the instant
case,
Deanne suffers from a very considerable disability.  That disability is such
that she has never been in remunerative employment,
she is not employed at
present, and, despite some cross-examination in that regard, there does not
appear to be any reasonable likelihood
that she will ever be able to obtain any
form of remunerative employment.  
<P>

26   	It seems to me to be very reasonable that Deanne should
receive out of the estate of her late father some provision which
would enable
her to upgrade her accommodation, to acquire some basic items of household
furnishings and equipment to enable her to
have dental work carried out
privately and not have to wait a period of years until the work can be done at
the Dental Hospital,
and also that she should have some relatively small amount
available to meet contingencies and to constitute a fund to fall back
on and
possibly even to assist in giving her some additional benefits in what is
obviously an extremely modest lifestyle.
<P>

27   	It has been submitted on behalf of Deanne that if she were
to upgrade her accommodation and obtain a rented flat in the Randwick
area that
there would be a shortfall between the amount which she would need for basic
expenses and such increased rent on the one
hand, and her pension from
Centrelink on the other hand in an amount of about $4,500, possibly a little
more, and that it would be
appropriate for the Court to award to her an amount
equivalent to such shortfall over a period of five years.  That would make an
amount of $22,000.  When that figure is added to the needs, which are listed,
of $8,561, and an additional component of $5,000, it
has been submitted on
behalf of the plaintiff that there should be a legacy awarded to Deanne in a
total amount of $35,000.
<P>

28   	I have already referred to the calculation on the part of
the defendant of the amount of residue of the estate which might
be available
to meet such additional provision for Deanne.  The figure of $27,794.50 is
submitted by the defendant to be the actual
net amount of residue after
liabilities and estate debts, joint liabilities in respect of unpaid accounts
relating to the Fingal
Bay residence and the $4,000 of legacies have been
deducted from the total amount of assets of $56,912.  It seems to me, however,
that the medical expenses of $12,100, which are largely reimbursed from the
Workers Compensation award received by the plaintiff,
should not be also
deducted from the assets of the estate.
<P>

29   	Similarly there appears to me to be, at the very least, a
significant degree of unfairness, if not a logical difficulty in
deducting from
the assets of the estate one half of the joint liabilities in respect of the
Fingal Bay house, when the totality of
that house, by survivorship, passes to
the defendant.
<P>

30   	Whatever be the amount remaining in the estate, be it as
submitted by the defendant, the amount of slightly less than $28,000,
or be it,
as appears to me a more accurate and correct calculation, about $52,000, that
amount has been commingled by the defendant
with her own separate assets and
has been notionally distributed by her in her capacity as executor to herself
in her capacity of
beneficiary.  The Court is entitled in such circumstances,
where that has been a distribution, to make an order against the person
who
holds the distributed amounts.
<P>

31   	Since, in my calculation, the amount thus distributed by
the defendant to herself is in excess of the amount of $35,000 sought
on her
behalf by Counsel for Deanne it is not necessary for me to proceed further to a
consideration of whether there has, in this
case, been a prescribed transaction
of the nature contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.
<P>

32   	Were it necessary for me to do so, however, my preliminary
view is that the deceased appears to have entered into a prescribed
transaction
by his failure to sever the joint tenancy in the Fingal Bay residence before
his death, with the consequence that his
interest in that house property would
be available, if such were necessary, to be designated as notional estate of
the deceased.
<P>

33   	I consider that the other assets of the defendant which
she holds at present and the fact that within a week she will be entitled
to
receive the age pension, are such that, on account of her competing claim upon
the bounty of the deceased, the order for provision
which I am satisfied Deanne
has otherwise established in an amount of $35,000 should not be reduced or even
extinguished.  It follows,
therefore, that I consider Deanne is entitled to
receive, in addition to the legacy already given to her by the will of the
deceased,
a further legacy in the amount of $35,000.
<P>

34   	The appropriate order in that regard appears to me to be
that the defendant should pay to Deanne the amount of $35,000.  I
will,
however, hear Counsel, if they desire, concerning the form of that order.
<P>

35   	There remains also the question of costs.  The usual order
in relation to costs where a plaintiff is successful is that the
costs of the
successful plaintiff be paid out of the estate of the testator, and the costs
of the defendant executor are almost invariably
paid out of the estate of the
testator. But I will also hear Counsel concerning the costs orders which they
submit are appropriate
in the circumstances of the instant case.
<P>

36   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the time for the institution of these proceedings be extended
up to and including 23 July 1997.
<P>

2.	I order that, in addition to the benefit given to her by the will of the
late James Edward Littlejohn ("the deceased") the plaintiff,
Deanne Gai
Littlejohn, receive a further legacy in the sum of $35,000.
<P>

3.	I order that the aforesaid sum of $35,000 be paid to the plaintiff, Deanne
Gai Littlejohn, by the defendant, and that such sum
not bear interest if paid
on or before 24 September 1999, and if not so paid to bear interest at Supreme
Court rates.
<P>

4.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff, Deanne Gai
Littlejohn, such costs to be on the party and party basis.
<P>

5.	I order that the claims of Mark James Littlejohn, David Michael Littlejohn,
and Julie Anne Littlejohn, the other plaintiffs,
be dismissed.
<P>

6.	I order that the other plaintiffs pay the costs of the defendant in respect
to the claims of the other plaintiffs, such costs
to be on the party and party
basis.
