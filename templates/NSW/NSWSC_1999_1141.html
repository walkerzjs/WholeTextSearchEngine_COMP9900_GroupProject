<b>6/1999 - MATHEWS v THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	On or about 2 May 1992 the "USS Independence", ("the
vessel"), which was, at the time, probably the largest aircraft carrier
in the
world and which was owned by the defendant, The United States Department of
Defence, for which Mr R.R. Stitt of Queen's Counsel
and Mr G.M. Watson of
Counsel appeared, and a number of other United States Navy vessels, arrived in
Sydney Harbour.  The occasion
for the visit was the celebration of the 50th
Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the vessel moored at Garden
Island.
<P>

2   	On the evening of 2 May 1992 the defendant, or those for
whom it was responsible, arranged a cocktail party on the vessel to
which,
amongst a large number of others, the plaintiff, Ms Fiona Amanda Squire
Mathews, for whom Mr C.C. Branson of Queen's Counsel
and Mr J.T. De Berg of
Counsel appeared, and her then husband, Mr Elbert Lynn Mathews, were invited.
The reasonable inference is
that all guests were invited and, accordingly,
those, including the plaintiff and Mr Mathews, were boarding the vessel at the
defendant's
invitation.  So much was not in issue.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff and Mr Mathews travelled to the dock by car
and proceeded to board by ascending a gangway basically in single
file in a
line of guests.  The gangway ran parallel to the side of the vessel, to the
point where guests could obtain access to her.
 The plaintiff was walking in
front of Mr Mathews.
<P>

4   	There was a platform at the top of the gangway, which, on
the evidence I accept, was approximately several metres long and
slightly
shorter in width.  It was covered with a blue type of carpet and persons
boarding the vessel stepped from the gangway onto
the platform and then turned
left towards the vessel.  The platform was above deck level and to move from it
to the deck it was necessary
to cross the platform and step down from it to the
deck.  The portion of the deck to which people stepped may also have been
covered
with the same type of carpet.
<P>

5   	Although there was some dispute on the evidence, I am
satisfied that there was a line of naval and other dignitaries on the
deck, who
were greeting guests as they arrived.  The plaintiff has suggested, on several
occasions, that this greeting line was on
the platform.  I am satisfied that it
was not.  I am, however, satisfied that sailors from the vessel were on the
platform and on
the deck adjacent to it, and that part of their duties involved
assisting guests from the gangplank onto the platform and, more importantly
for
present purposes, from the platform to the deck.  This involved walking down
either one or, perhaps, two steps. There was no
handrail or handgrip of which
guests could take hold before stepping down from the platform to the deck.  Nor
was there any warning
that the step was there.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff stepped across the platform followed by Mr
Mathews, and her evidence in chief as to what then happened appears
in
paragraphs 22 and 23 of her witness statement of 4 November 1999, Exhibit
A:-
<P>

<b>"22.	Upon arrival at the ship I walked up the gangplank in front of my
husband.  There was a step from the gangplank to a platform.
 I stepped off the
gangplank onto the platform.  I was not assisted by anyone.  The platform was
covered in blue synthetic artificial
grass carpet.  From that platform I had to
step down to the next platform.  I led with my left foot down the step to the
next platform.
 I was not assisted.  As I did this my right shoe heel got
caught in the carpet on the top platform and I fell down.  I fell as I
had
already commenced stepping with my left foot down to the next level when my
right foot unexpectedly got caught.  This caused
me to lose my balance and I
fell on to the lower level falling forward on my knees and landing on my right
side.</b>
<P>

<b>  23.	The steps which I fell down were not fitted with any handrails, and
situated immediately to the side of the steps was a sailor,
however, I was not
provided with any assistance or offer of assistance from this officer."</b>
<P>

7   	In his witness statement of 10 November 1999, Exhibit B, Mr
Mathews described what happened in paragraphs 5, 7 and 8 thus:-
<P>

<b>"5.	At the top of the gangplank there was a platform which was covered in
blue grass matting.  There was an officer on my left on
the platform at the top
of the gangplank.  He was taking each guest's arms as they stepped off the
gangplank onto the platform. 
When Fiona stepped off the gangplank, she was not
assisted by the officer.  I observed him to be distracted.  He was talking to
another
officer.  He did not take Fiona's arm as she stepped off the gangplank
onto the platform.  Fiona took another step forward on the
platform and fell
forward.  I saw her heel had caught in the blue grass matting covering the
platform.  Fiona was near the edge of
the platform.  I lunged forward to try
and stop her falling forward.  The officer on my left noticed me lunging
forward and grabbed
me.  This stopped me catching Fiona.</b>
<P>

<b>  ...</b>
<P>

<b>  7.	Fiona fell forward onto her knees down the step from that platform onto
her right side.  The platform was not very wide until
reached the next level.
There was a line of officers on the deck.  In falling, Fiona fell onto and down
to the next level which was
also covered in blue grass carpet.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	There was no rail along the side of the blue grass carpet.  The
carpeted section was wider than the gangplank.  The steps off
the gangplank and
from one level of the platform to the next were steep.  Fiona fell to her
knees.  She tried to stand up and could
not initially.  I said to her, `What
happened?'  She said, `My heel caught'." </b>
<P>

8   	The basic facts asserted by the plaintiff and Mr Mathews
were not, essentially, in issue.  The defendant accepted that she
was walking
across the platform, which was covered with the blue carpet material; that Mr
Mathews was walking behind her; that the
heel of her right shoe caught in the
carpet as she was stepping forward to descend the step or steps from the
platform to the deck;
that that caused her to fall forward; that sailors on
duty to assist her descending did not do so; and that Mr Mathews was prevented
from further assisting her by the action of a sailor in stopping his forward
movement.  It was not in issue that there were no handrails
or supports
available at this point.  It was submitted by the defendant that reasonable
care did not require any for the purpose
of negotiating one step.  
<P>

9   	The issue is whether, in these circumstances, the defendant
was guilty of negligence.  The principal allegations of negligence
were that
the sailors, who were obviously on duty to assist guests move from the
gangplank to the platform and thence to the deck,
failed to initially assist
the plaintiff, as they did other guests, and, having failed in that way did not
observe the difficulty
she encountered  until it was too late to prevent or
check her fall; whether there should have been a handrail or support in
position;
and whether a warning should have been given.
<P>

10   	The defendant submitted that if, contrary to its primary
submission, it was found to have been negligent, the plaintiff was
guilty of
contributory negligence by allowing her heel to become caught in the carpet.
Although other allegations of contributory
negligence, including the
plaintiff's failure to seek assistance from the sailor on duty, were pleaded,
none were argued in final
submissions.
<P>

11   	The parties accepted that the question of negligence was
to be determined, in circumstances where the plaintiff was a lawful
entrant on
the vessel, by whether the defendant took reasonable care to avoid foreseeable
risk of injury to her: <b>Australian Safety Stores Pty Limited v Zaluzna</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a> and <b>Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern
Territory</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20192%20CLR%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 192 CLR 421.</a>
<P>

<b>Negligence</b>
<P>

12   	I have set out the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr
Mathews in chief on the issue of negligence.  The plaintiff was cross-examined
as to her recollection of events leading up to the accident, having said that
her witness statement was prepared with some care and
accurately set out the
way in which it occurred.  She said it was truthful and complete.  She was
cross-examined, commencing Tp.6,
about paragraph 22 and her recollection of the
events and, in particular, about some evidence she had given previously to the
effect
that the greeting line was on the platform rather than the deck.  In so
far as the plaintiff asserted that it was and that she met
various dignitaries
prior to the fall, I am satisfied that her evidence is not correct, and that
she did not reach the greeting line
before she fell.  This is consistent with
Mr Mathews' evidence, which was not challenged, and with other undisputed
evidence. However,
notwithstanding that view of her evidence, I am satisfied
that she fell in the way she described in paragraph 22 and no real challenge
was made to her evidence in that respect.
<P>

13   	Similarly, the evidence of Mr Mathews was not challenged
as to how the accident occurred.  Mr Mathews said, Tp.43, that there
were
"certainly sailors in parallel lines forming a corridor onto the main deck of
the ship extending beyond" the platform, although
he was not certain whether
the line came "right up to the platform".  His evidence was quite clear that
there was no greeting line
on the platform.
<P>

14   	I have outlined the principal way in which the plaintiff
puts her case on negligence.  Firstly, she asserted that the vessel's
personnel
should have assisted her and other guests from the gangplank to the platform
and from the platform to the deck, and that
this was particularly so as there
was no handrail.  Secondly, she submitted that such persons were in position to
assist and to guard
against the possibility of a guest's falling at this point
but that, at the time she fell, sufficient attention was not being paid
to her
and she was not, at any time, offered assistance.  Thirdly, it was submitted
that in so far as the seaman was distracted,
he was distracted from carrying
out the very function he was supposed to be performing, namely to give
assistance to guests moving
onto and off the platform, and that it was
negligent for him to be distracted.  Fourthly, it was submitted that the vessel
had ample
crew to provide sufficient personnel at this point, so that if one
member was "distracted" another could take over.
<P>

15   	The allegations of negligence have to be viewed against
the background of what was happening on the vessel on this evening.
 Guests,
presumably from all walks of life and of various ages and physical conditions,
had been invited to the cocktail party. 
It must have been clear to those in
charge of the vessel, and indeed so much was acknowledged by the presence of
the vessel's personnel
to assist them, that in some way or other a guest may
encounter difficulties in traversing the platform and stepping down to the
deck.  It was not necessary that those in charge should see the precise way in
which this may happen.  It was sufficient that in
a moving line of people, it
was reasonably foreseeable that a guest may trip, slip, lose his or her step or
in some other way become
unbalanced, perhaps because of the throng of people or
perhaps because of the general layout.  As I have said those in charge
recognised
the problem by placing personnel on duty to assist.  The plaintiff
did not receive assistance because the seaman was "distracted".
<P>

16   	In his statement of 1 November 1999 Lieutenant Commander
D.C. Rose, who was well qualified to give evidence on this matter,
said:-
<P>

<b>"In my experience, it is not usual to have a handrail for a step or steps
that are temporary for the duration of a ship's visit only.
 This was a special
occasion, however, where formality was paramount and it is not inconceivable
that, in such a ship with its almost
limitless resources and storage space, a
special set of steps with handrail would be used for the Admiral's guests.
However, assuming
this was not the case here and Mrs Mathews is correct, the
lack of handrail serves to emphasise the need for care in other ways in
bringing guests aboard."</b>
<P>

17   	Subsequently he said:-
<P>

<b>"Although a sailor or officer is said to have been posted on the top level
to the left side of the end of the gangplank, so as to
help guests negotiate
that initial step down from the gangplank, it appears that guests were left
then to negotiate the step down
to the next level without help or guarding.
The height of this step is unknown.  Assuming it is the same as that shown in
the video,
it is uncertain whether it is more than usual height.  The public
visitors boarding the ship appear to have no difficulty with it.</b>
<P>

<b>Nevertheless, given that the situation was unfamiliar to guests, and given
the possibility that the second step was of a different
height than that down
from the end of the gangway, I would expect a prudent officer responsible for
the safety of guests using the
gangplank and step to have stationed an
additional officer or sailor at the second level, so as to help guests,
especially ladies
attending a cocktail party, in formal wear and possibly with
high-heeled shoes, negotiate that second step down.</b>
<P>

<b>In this case, Mrs Mathews says there was an officer or sailor stationed at
the base of the step on the deck level.  Given that once
on the second or deck
level guests are said to have been required to turn left before stepping down
two more steps to a lower deck
level, that officer or sailor would appear
possibly to have been stationed too far away to be able to assist a guest in
negotiating
that second step or, more critically, to help catch or cushion a
falling guest.</b>
<P>

<b>In the light of the foregoing, assuming the arrangements were as stated, it
is my opinion that an officer or sailor stationed close
to the second step
would have been in a position enabling him more readily to steady Mrs Mathews
to prevent her falling or, failing
that, catch her sufficiently to save her
from falling heavily.  Further, in a general sense, it is my opinion that an
efficient and
responsible officer in charge of arrangements for bringing
civilian guests aboard should be expected to have foreseen the need for
special
care and to have stationed his helpers in such a way that accidents, such as
that suffered by Mrs Mathews, could not occur
or, at worst, would be less
serious than might otherwise have been."</b>
<P>

18   	For a number of reasons he specified, Lieutenant Commander
Rose concluded that it was opinion:-
<P>

<b>".. that the ship's responsible officer should have stationed a person in an
appropriate position close enough to actively assist
guests down that second
step and to make every effort, if they fell, to hold them up or cushion their
fall."</b>
<P>

His evidence was not challenged.
<P>

19   	The defendant relied on a statement of Lieutenant
Commander Richards, which is part of Exhibit 5.  He attended the cocktail
party
with his wife and, upon arriving at the top of the gangway, guests stepped from
it to a raised platform and, as he recalled
it, there were only two small steps
from the raised platform to the deck.  He continued, paragraphs 11 and 12:-
<P>

<b>"11.	I recall that a US Sailor was stationed on either side of the gangway
to assist guests from the gangway onto the raised platform
if such assistance
was required.  I can specifically recall my wife being assisted from the
gangway onto the raised platform.</b>
<P>

<b>  12.	The US Sailors stationed at the top of the gangway also provided
assistance to guests as they stepped from the raised platform
down the two
small steps to the deck of the USS Independence where the cocktail party was
being staged."</b>
<P>

The defendant's evidence thus corroborated the perceived need to have the
vessel's personnel available to assist guests.
<P>

20   	I am satisfied that had this task been performed properly
when the plaintiff fell, she would have received assistance either
before
falling or been restrained whilst falling, such as to have lessened, if not
prevented, her accident.  This was the very purpose
that the personnel were
stationed in that area and they failed to perform their task.
<P>

21   	Mr Stitt submitted that so far as the static condition of
the vessel was concerned none of the associated structures played
any causative
role in the plaintiff's falling and being injured.  There was no evidence that
the carpet was inappropriate for the
use to which it was being put, nor that it
was damaged or warn, and the submission continued that I would not find that
the mere
fact that the heel of the plaintiff's shoe caught was any evidence of
any static defect.  He continued that so far as the dynamics
were concerned I
should find that the plaintiff attended the vessel as part of a semi-public
function; that she gained access via
the gangplank and the platform; that there
was only one step down from the platform to the deck; and that she fell in
stepping from
the platform because she caught the heel of her shoe in the
carpet.  He submitted that parallel lines of sailors were on the deck
and there
were sailors on the platform, and that if this constituted "the dynamics",
there was no obligation or duty on the defendant
to instal a handrail when only
one step was involved, and no one needed to be placed to assist people down one
step.  He said the
fact that the person was so placed was a matter of
"courtesy" and not of duty.
<P>

22   	Mr Stitt submitted further that the seaman, who was
distracted, was only distracted momentarily as he was able to respond
to what
he thought was Mr Mathews' falling, and that it could not be suggested that
such a momentary lapse amounted to negligence.
<P>

23   	Obviously, there was no absolute duty on the defendant to
prevent injury to the plaintiff.  The duty was to take reasonable
care to avoid
foreseeable risk of injury to her.  The stationing of personnel on the platform
and on the deck to give assistance
to persons moving through that area and to
the deck showed that the defendant foresaw there was a risk of injury.  It had
not provided
a handrail to assist guests stepping from the platform to the
deck, but had provided the vessel's personnel to do so.  The distraction,
even
though it may only have been momentary, although there is no evidence that this
is so the evidence being that the distraction
had ended at the time Mr Mathews
commenced to fall, shows, in my opinion, that the personnel were not carrying
out their allotted
tasks in a proper manner, or that there were insufficient of
them to do so.  Their duty was to ensure that help was at hand for guests
thus
boarding the vessel and this was not fulfilled.
<P>

24   	In the circumstances, in my opinion, the defendant was
guilty of negligence.  I have noted that a pleaded allegation of contributory
negligence, which was not pursued, was the plaintiff's failure:-
<P>

<b>".. to make use of the assistance provided by the defendant to persons
boarding the vessel".</b>
<P>

25   	Mr Stitt submitted that if, contrary to his submissions on
negligence, I came to the view that there was negligence, the plaintiff
was
guilty of contributory negligence in that she allowed her heel to be caught in
the carpet and was not picking up her feet.  In
my view the defendant has not
established that this constituted contributory negligence.  Indeed, the fact
that her heel became caught
in the carpet would tend to indicate that there was
some defect in the carpet.  However, no complaint was made, in final
submissions,
by the defendant about the appropriateness of the plaintiff's
footwear and, in these circumstances, I do not consider that the defendant
has
established the only case of contributory negligence upon which it ultimately
relied.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	The Plaintiff's History And Complaints</b>
<P>

26   	The plaintiff was born on 11 August 1950 and, at the date
of the accident, was aged 41 years.  She is now aged 49 years. 
She married Mr
Mathews on 5 August 1978 and lived with him in various parts of the world as he
pursued his career as a banker.  Her
two sons were born on 19 March 1980 and 6
February 1982.
<P>

27   	In November 1983 the plaintiff moved with her family to
New York, as that was where Mr Mathews was posted and, in paragraph
12 of her
witness statement, she said that whilst in New York she felt stressed at being
isolated from friends and family "together
with the moving from country to
country (six residences in three years), quite stressful especially living in a
residential hotel".
<P>

28   	In February 1984 the plaintiff commenced to work for the
Australian Broadcasting Commission in New York and, upon returning
to Australia
in 1984, she resumed part-time casual work for that organisation in Sydney and
commenced trading as Fiona Mathews &amp;
Associates in 1986.  She said, in
paragraph 14, that this was a small public relations company, which was
retained by a number of
clients and, in 1988, there was a merger between it and
Playfair Pty Limited.  There was no evidence of the effect of that on her,
nor
that she received any payment in consequence of it or interest in Playfair Pty
Limited.
<P>

29   	In 1990 she was employed by Memtec Limited, ("Memtec"),
pursuant to a written Agreement dated 1 March 1990, as a public relations
manager for three years from 2 April 1990 to 1 April 1993, and she was required
to devote her full time and attention to her employment.
 She was to receive a
base gross salary of $45,000 per annum and, in addition,  membership of any
life assurance benefit plan and
of employees' stock purchase scheme, and the
benefits of any other scheme or plan available to all employees of Memtec.  She
was
to have the use of a Ford Falcon Sedan and Memtec agreed to reimburse her
for all its reasonable operating expenses.  She was to
receive reimbursement of
her telephone rental on a quarterly basis and a reasonable amount of the cost
of telephone calls, including
those on her mobile telephone, and annual
holidays and long service leave.
<P>

30   	Clause 7(a) provided that Memtec was entitled to terminate
the Agreement at any time prior to the expiration of the employment
period
without cause upon 60 days' written notice. 
<P>

31   	Memtec carried on its business at South Windsor and the
plaintiff lived at Randwick.  Thus it was necessary for her to drive
on most
working days from her home to South Windsor and back.
<P>

32   	On 1 January 1992 the plaintiff entered into a written
variation of that Agreement, whereby it was agreed:-
<P>

<b>"1.	The existing employment agreement period dated 1st March 1990 and
expiring on 1st April 1993 shall continue to operate except
for the following
variations:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	For the remainder of the employment period the employee shall work only
1 day per week for Memtec.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	During this shorter working period, Memtec shall pay to the employee a
base salary at the rate of ten thousand Australian dollars
(A$10,000) per
annum, payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices at Memtec but no
less frequently than in equal monthly
instalments."</b>
<P>

33   	At Tp.27 the plaintiff agreed there was such a variation,
and she continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. When did you cease working for Memtec on a one day per week
basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It was in 1996.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And since that time have you then only been employed on a casual
basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, as a consultant.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Only on a casual basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

34   	There was also tendered an Employment Agreement as part of
Exhibit 5, which was undated and unsigned, but appears to have
been prepared in
August 1993, which provided that during the employment period, which was to
commence on 1 July 1993, the plaintiff
would be paid a salary of $10,400 per
annum.
<P>

35   	The plaintiff described her employment with Memtec, in
paragraph 15 of her witness statement, as being "their global Public
Relations
Executive", the general nature of the work undertaken by Memtec being to purify
city drinking water and sewerage.  She
said that major public relations events
were held in Australia, Europe, the United States and Japan.  She continued, in
paragraph
17,that in 1992 it became apparent that more of Memtec's focus would
be in the United States' markets, and that there was not the
potential that had
been hoped for in Australia.  She said:-
<P>

<b>"My work was scaled down to a part-time basis and I undertook a number of
other projects, independent of Memtec.  I continued to travel
for Memtec to do
public relations events overseas.  In 1995 we did a major event in Wales and in
the United Kingdom."</b>
<P>

The reasonable inference is that these circumstances led to the entry into the
Variation Agreement.  An extraordinary aspect of
this case is that there is no
evidence that the plaintiff earned any money, i.e. there is no evidence of any
remuneration received,
from 1991 other than from Memtec, save in the financial
year ended 30 June 1999, during which the plaintiff received most of her
income
from Memtec's successor.
<P>

36   	In paragraph 18 she said:-
<P>

<b>"For a number of years I was actively involved in social tennis and played
at least once, and sometimes twice a week.  I was also
a keen swimmer.  I was
residing with my family at home in Randwick and travelling to the offices of
Memtec at Windsor on a regular
basis.  In order to travel to Windsor I was
required to drive for a period of up to three hours per day and on occasions I
would
experience thoracic back pain for which I received massage.  The nature
of the back pain which I experienced was not in the same
location or intensity
as that which I now experience."</b>
<P>

37   	After describing the fall, the plaintiff said she was
driven by Mr Mathews to the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick where
x-rays
were taken of her left ankle and right leg and she was advised that she had
suffered a sprained left ankle.  She continued,
paragraph 28, that she left
hospital with crutches and that overnight and the next day there was an intense
pain in her right leg
and lower back.  She consulted her family doctor, Dr
Hameri, on 4 May 1992.  He referred her for an x-ray of her back and CT Scan
to
Dr Sheehy at St Vincent's Hospital, who recommended that she should have a
laminectomy to give relief to her pain.  She chose
to explore less intrusive
procedures first, such as intensive physiotherapy, traction, massage and
swimming, and she said:-
<P>

<b>"I found those few weeks quite shocking because the level of pain was
intense much of the time.  I went to Memtec when I was picked
up by car and
driven out with a colleague.  The chairman of Memtec was supportive and
understanding and tried to accommodate my disability.
 I was determined to get
better and try not to focus on the pain, and set milestones for me to achieve
and to keep my career path."</b>
<P>

It will be remembered, of course, that at this time she was only working one
day per week for Memtec.  She gave no evidence that
she did not receive her
full contractual entitlement from Memtec whilst she was injured.
<P>

38   	The plaintiff agreed that Exhibit 6 set forth her overseas
travel accurately.  On 3 June 1992 she travelled to Brazil, London,
New York,
Paris and London over a period of 24 days for business purposes.  She referred
to this trip in paragraph 29 of her witness
statement, it being to attend the
Earth Summit Conference on behalf of Memtec, and to assist on some research for
Beyond 2000.  She
said that whilst overseas she experienced significant back
and leg pain, although she attended to her duties "as best" she could.
 On one
occasion she had to rest for 24 hours.  She returned to Australia in June 1992
and was referred for treatment under the care
of Dr Hameri. 
<P>

39   	In her witness statement she set out various tests which
were carried out, but she said that the pain in her back, legs and
arm did not
cease and she sought physiotherapy, massage and acupuncture and consulted an
osteopath.  She was on a regime of medication
including Panadeine and Valium.
She continued that on a number of occasions her back pain became quite extreme
whilst attempting
to undertake ordinary daily activities, and that she had been
rendered physically incapable of coping with the pain and been forced
to seek
emergency medical treatment from hospitals, chiropractors and osteopaths. She
gave no details of these treatments. Mr Mathews
assisted her in dealing with
the pain, and although she received some short term relief, it generally
returned.  She said she was
unable to attend to her daily household duties and
was assisted by Mr Mathews, her son, Ben, and a part-time nanny. There is no
evidence
what she paid the part-time nanny. She became extremely frustrated
with the level pain and was "increasingly unable to cope with
the strains which
this was causing in my day-to-day life".  Her relationship with her husband
deteriorated further, there being evidence
that it had not been satisfactory
from at least 1986, and:-
<P>

<b>".. although we have had difficulties prior to this accident, I feel that
these have been significantly exacerbated by the injuries
I had
received."</b>
<P>

In the end, no submission was made that the accident in May 1992 contributed to
the eventual break-down of the marriage.
<P>

40   	She was not able to return to her pre-accident sporting
activities, but, by July 1995, she began to feel that her symptoms
were
improving and "although I was still suffering from back pain I felt that this
was being managed effectively".  This evidence
is at odds with a history she
gave a physiotherapist, Ms Key, in a report to which I will refer.
<P>

41   	From 10 June 1993 she was overseas for one month on
business and, commencing on 3 April 1994, she was in Indonesia on a holiday
for
seven days.  On 1 June 1994 she travelled to London, Paris, New York and
Washington for seven weeks on business and, on 4 June
1995, she travelled to
London, Cardiff, Paris, Toulouse, London and New York for five weeks on
business.  This was a significant
trip, because she said that whilst in New
York she developed substantial pain in her back and, in paragraph 38, she
continued:-
<P>

<b>"This setback provided me with additional stress and I was disillusioned
with the fact that I was again faced with a long period of
rehabilitation
before my symptoms would improve.  I was informed by Josephine Key
Physiotherapist that my back would require ongoing
maintenance."</b>
<P>

42   	On 16 August 1995 Ms Key wrote a report, Exhibit 5 p.79,
in which she stated:-
<P>

<b>"I have treated this lady some years ago for low back pain which radiated
down the front of the right thigh and caused marked muscle
weakness.  She
required extensive treatment at that stage, however she managed to avoid
surgery <u>has been asymptomatic until recently she has been on an overseas
trip</u>.  In June/July of this year she travelled overseas and during this
time complained of low back pain which radiated into her right
thigh and foot.
She also had pins and needles in her foot.</b>
<P>

<b>When I assessed her on 11.7.1995 my opinion was that she again required an
extensive course of treatment to ameliorate her presenting
symptoms.  As part
of this she would need to be prepared to carry out exercises at home to help
her progress."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

It was conceded by Mr Branson that the overseas trip, to which reference was
made, was that of five weeks commencing on 4 June 1995.
<P>

43   	There is no doubt that prior to 2 May 1992 the plaintiff
had suffered some degree of back pain.  Her case is that the fall
exaggerated
and exacerbated that condition.  Ms Key's report is not entirely clear, and the
plaintiff was not asked when she obtained
treatment initially from her.  It is
therefore not clear when she required extensive treatment and for how long she
had been asymptomatic.
 It is strange, if there was a problem resulting from
the accident in respect of which she was treated by Ms Key, that no reference
was made to this in the report, and the plaintiff gave no evidence that she was
treated by Ms Key after the accident and before July
1995, from which the
inference may be that she was treated by Ms Key prior to the accident.
However, in my opinion, when the whole
of the evidence is examined it becomes
plain enough that she was treated by Ms Key after the accident of 2 May 1992.
I shall seek
to explain why.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff stated, in paragraph 39 of her witness
statement, that she noticed that her left ankle appeared to be weak,
and that
it would, on occasions give way and she would fall, and that "throughout this
period" she had pain radiating down through
her buttocks into her right leg.
She separated from Mr Mathews in 1995, although it was not submitted that this
was caused by the
accident.  She said, in paragraph 43, that she resigned from
Memtec in 1997, as she felt she was not able to continue her duties
due to her
pain and disabilities "together with a general downturn in the work available",
and that in August 1997 she was providing
some advice to a Tenterfield Action
Group, and in the course of doing so was required to attend a meeting in the
Timbarra forest.
 Whilst walking in the forest, she felt her left ankle give
way and she fell forward landing heavily on her right wrist and hand.
 She
fractured her right wrist, which required surgery for internal fixation.  She
is dominantly right handed and now has lost sensation
in the middle finger of
her right hand.  She has a significant scar to her right wrist and hand.  She
has never regained full movement
in that wrist and continues to be troubled by
pain, particularly in cold weather.
<P>

45   	Dr Waller reported on 18 May 1998:-
<P>

<b>"She will never regain full function of the right wrist or hand.  She will
always have some restriction of movement of the right wrist.
 She has some
residual deformity of the right wrist as a result of her fracture.  <u>This
will be permanent</u>.  She will always have some weakness on the right forearm
and hand.  She will continue to have some restriction of movement of the
right
wrist."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

46   	The plaintiff complained that since the accident she has
continued to experience pain in her lower back, which has required
treatment at
times, although no evidence was given of the treatment she received or its
frequency or cost.  She also continues to
notice that her left ankle is not as
stable as previously.  She stated that "on an emotional level" she has
experienced difficulties
in not being able to do what she could before the
accident, and that in 1995 and 1997 she suffered exacerbations of her injuries
"including the fracture of my right wrist",  as a consequence of which she has
become depressed.  She continues to take medication
"intermittently" in an
attempt to control the pain.  No evidence was given of the extent of such
medication or its cost.  She continued
that before the accident she suffered
from stress, although she did not feel she was experiencing any symptoms in
early 1992, and
certainly the stress and back difficulties she had prior to her
accident in May 1992 "were nowhere near as severe as those which
I now
experience and continue to suffer since May 1992".  As I have noted this
complaint is not consistent with the complaint she
made to Ms Key in mid-1995.
Nor is it consistent with certain medical evidence.  She continues, she
asserted, to experience pain
in her back and difficulties with her right ankle
and is limited in the amount she is able to travel.  She cannot lift heavy
weights
and has difficulties in undertaking domestic duties, particularly
vacuuming and activities requiring flexion of her spine.  The pain
can become
so severe as to cause her to have headaches and she is troubled by the
deformity of her right wrist both as to its appearance
and functionality.  She
has put on weight because of her inability to exercise daily, and continues to
receive physiotherapy, massage,
chiropractic and other treatment from her
general practitioner. Once again no evidence was given of the specifics of this
treatment.
 She said that she would like to consider receiving some assistance
in dealing with the emotional aspects of her injuries and developing
further
mechanisms by which she is able to cope with the injury and the associated
disabilities.
<P>

47   	In paragraph 62 of her witness statement she said that she
resigned from her position at Memtec in 1997, and that since then
she has been
involved in a variety of projects, a number of which have been performed on a
voluntary basis.  She is not presently
employed on a full time basis, but works
on a part time basis as a free lance adviser to a variety of companies. She
gave little
evidence of her earnings from this part time employment. She has
difficulties in undertaking her day to day employment due to pain
and an
inability to commute and attend certain events, and:-
<P>

<b>"Although I am confident that I will be in a position to continue to work on
a part time basis, I am certainly not able to return
to employment on a full
time basis due to the pain and disability which I suffer.  It had been my
intention to continue working on
a full time basis until age 65."</b>
<P>

48   	She then said, in paragraph 63:-
<P>

<b>"It had been my intention to re-commence full time employment in 2000 once
both my sons had completed their schooling."</b>
<P>

She gave a history to her accountant that she did not intend to return to full
time employment until 2005.  She concluded that she
does not feel her injuries
would allow her to perform all her domestic duties, that she is assisted by her
children on a daily basis
"carrying items, picking up things, lifting and
reaching particularly high things together with other duties for approximately
seven
to eight hours per week", and that she "continues to suffer from pain in
her back, left and right leg, right wrist and radiating
pain".
<P>

49   	Exhibit 6 shows that commencing on 23 June 1996 the
plaintiff travelled to the United Kingdom for six weeks and, commencing
on 7
January 1997, to China for nine days for a holiday.  Commencing on 19 April
1997, she travelled to the United States for sixteen
days and, commencing on 20
June 1997, she travelled to the United States for a further sixteen days to
attend a convention/conference.
 Commencing on 14 December 1997, she travelled
to the United Kingdom and the United States for a one month holiday and,
commencing
on 2 November 1998, to Italy for a seventeen day holiday.  On 4
March 1999 she travelled to the United Kingdom for one month for
a holiday and,
on 21 May 1999, to the United States for fourteen days on business.  All these
travel arrangements involved her travelling
by aeroplane.
<P>

<b>(b) The Plaintiff's Cross-Examination</b>
<P>

50   	In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed that she made no
complaint of any pain to her back when she first went to hospital
on the
evening of 2 May 1992.
<P>

51   	She saw Dr Hameri on 4 May 1992 when she complained that
she fell on the vessel on 2 May, that she had sprained her left ankle,
which
was x-rayed and appeared to Dr Hameri to be "OK", and that she had right thigh
numbness.  Dr Hameri noted that she was to go
overseas in June 1992.
<P>

52   	Although there is no reference in his notes to a complaint
of back pain, which may seem strange, the plaintiff maintained
that she
mentioned that to Dr Hameri and, in his letter of 6 September 1995, Exhibit E
p.80, Dr Hameri stated that on 4 May 1992
the plaintiff complained to him of a
sprained left ankle, lower back pain, and numbness in the right thigh.  He
referred her for
a CT Scan and to Dr Seaton.  It is unlikely he would have
taken either course if there was no complaint of back pain.  The defendant's
submission, however, was that the complaints of pain were essentially
subjective, there being no objective evidence to support them,
and that I
should not accept the plaintiff's evidence about them.
<P>

53   	The defendant tendered all of Dr Hameri's notes, he having
treated her from about 15 January 1986.  These notes show difficulties
with the
marriage relating back to March 1986: see references to entries on 17 March
1986; 6 August 1986; 23 November 1988; and 20
June 1989.
<P>

54   	On 10 February 1992 Dr Hameri noted that the plaintiff was
suffering from lumbar pain and seeing a chiropractor, Mr Bablis.
<P>

55   	The plaintiff was cross-examined closely about the
treatment she was receiving from Mr Bablis, to whom she returned on 4 May
1992,
and she agreed that he had been treating her for a long time for thoracic back
pain.  She said that so far as she remembered
he never treated her for low back
pain and, Tp.20:-
<P>

<b>"Q. What is your recollection? Did he treat you for low back pain prior to 4
May 1992?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Just back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Low back pain?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I don't remember.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You don't remember.  Is that your answer, you don't remember?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, that's my answer."</b>
<P>

56   	She agreed she saw Dr Sheehy on 27 May 1992, and she said
that she told him she had back pain from all the driving she had
been doing
and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Did you not tell Dr Sheehy, on 27 May 1992, that you had low back pain
for years?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I may have, but ...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would that have been the truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I had back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would that have been the truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, look, I had upper back pain ..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Please, would you ..</b>
<P>

<b>OBJECTION</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would it have been the truth that you had told Dr Sheehy that you had low
back pain for years?</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: I allow that question.</b>
<P>

<b>A. No.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. The answer was no, was it not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

57   	At Tp.21 the plaintiff was further cross-examined about
what she told Dr Sheehy.  She said she did not know that she said
to him that
she had low back pain and added:-
<P>

<b>"I had general back pain for years."</b>
<P>

She continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. I am suggesting to you that you told him that you had low back pain for
years.  Now, do you say that you did say that or you didn't
say that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I may have said that.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You may have said that.  If you did say that, would it have been the
truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It would have been the truth in that the whole back was sore from
driving.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. No, please.  I am asking you a specific question about the history that
you gave him of low back pain for years.  Would that have
been the
truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And did you, in truth, have low back pain for years prior to seeing Dr
Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I had back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Did you have back pain for years prior to seeing Dr Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Not acute back pain.  </b>
<P>

<b>Q. We will get to whether it is acute.  But did you have low back pain for
years prior to seeing Dr Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Probably just from driving.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Probably just from driving?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

58   	The plaintiff's evidence on this point was most
unsatisfactory both in its content and to my observation in the way in which
it
was given.  There can be no doubt on that evidence that she was complaining of
"general back pain for years" prior to 2 May 1992,
and that she conceded that
she had low back pain "probably just from driving" for years prior to seeing Dr
Sheehy.  It is also necessary
to note what Dr Michael Morris discerned from Dr
Sheehy's notes to which I shall refer.
<P>

59   	I have not the slightest doubt that the plaintiff suffered
from low back pain prior to the accident on 2 May 1992.  That degree
of
satisfaction is not reduced by Dr Sheehy's report of 28 May 1992 in which he
referred to a history of a recent attack "three weeks
ago of pain affecting the
right anterior thigh with radiation to and just below the knee".  He observed
that the lumbar CT Scan showed
a lateral stenotic process at the L3/4 level and
that the combination of disc and bony overgrowth contributed to the problem.
<P>

60   	The notes of Mr Bablis were tendered by the plaintiff and,
together with a transcription, became Exhibit G.  He appears to
have commenced
to treat her in September 1990 and, at Tpp.22-23:-
<P>

<b>"HIS HONOUR: Q.  Tell me this.  Where was the pain in respect of which you
consulted Mr Bablis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It's generally in the thoracic area and it was in the low back.  It was
only occasionally when I had a long drive to Windsor and
back for a couple of
years, but I didn't go to Mr Branson - sorry, Mr Bablis ..</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Don't worry.  I think that answers the question I asked.</b>
<P>

<b>WITNESS: It was not acute.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: What was not acute the thoracic pain or the ...</b>
<P>

<b>A. The pain was not acute.  It was just to keep me well.  He was simply
someone who manipulated and massaged.</b>
<P>

<b>STITT: Q. He manipulated your lumbar spine on a number of occasions, your
low back spine, on a number of occasions, did he not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, all my back.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. I am asking you about the lumbar?</b>
<P>

<b>A. The back, yes, the lumbar, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. On a number of occasions prior to May 1992?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, only a number of occasions."</b>
<P>

61   	The plaintiff placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Sheehy
and Dr Garrick, who wrote a report on 28 October 1992, Exhibit
E pp.76-77, a
copy of which he sent to Dr Sheehy and Ms Key.  
<P>

62   	Dr Garrick reported that the plaintiff had a substantial
right L4 radiculopathy related to a lateral disc lesion resulting
from a fall
in May 1992.  He said she had a fairly protracted course of conservative
management with only partial resolution of discomfort,
and that some of the
delay in seeking more active treatment may have related to an incorrect report
that the CT Scan stated that
the L3/4 disc appeared normal.  He said that was
quite wrong as there was "a clear lateral disc bulge encroaching on the nerve
root".
<P>

63   	Dr Garrick said that the plaintiff was quite well until
the fall.  He referred to her overseas trip with which she coped "with
some
difficulty and needed acupuncture treatment while away".  He said that the
backache had substantially subsided, but there was
continuing buttock, knee and
anterior thigh pain, and intermittent paraesthesia over the lateral aspect of
the right leg and difficulty
with walking.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"General health has been relatively unremarkable.  She has a long history of
minor thoracic pain from late childhood.  NSAID treatment
for this produced a
duodenal ulcer.  She now tolerates Naprosin suppositories with Tagamet
cover."</b>
<P>

64   	Dr Garrick expressed the view that it was likely that her
fall produced disc rupture "in a previously normal back".  He thought
she was
wasting her time pursuing further conservative management and recommended a
lumbar myelography with post myelogram CT Scans
to outline the nerve root.  He
strongly considered surgical decompression.
<P>

65   	The fact that a copy of his letter was sent to Ms Key
provides some evidence that she had treated her in relation to the problems
she
experienced after the accident.  Probably it was this treatment, which caused
the backache to substantially subside by October
1992.
<P>

66   	The difficulty, and I say this with no disrespect to Dr
Garrick, is that he apparently received a history of a basically symptom
free
back prior to the accident.  He knew there was a long history of minor thoracic
pain, but he does not appear to have been aware
that the plaintiff had been
receiving treatment for back pain for some time prior to the accident.  
<P>

67   	The plaintiff saw Professor Jones on behalf of the
defendant on 11 February 1998.  He recorded that she stated that her back
and
left ankle were normal prior to May 1992 and, after tracing her history, he
referred to the history of accident and injuries.
 He recorded that "over the
last twelve months she has been satisfactory" subject to an exception, which he
stated.  He examined
her and noted a history of injuring her left ankle and
subsequently sustaining back pain with radiation into her right leg.  He was
of
the view, as at the date he examined her, that:-
<P>

<b>".. there is a mild back impairment on physical examination being about 10%
reduction in normal back function and otherwise her symptoms
are subjective.
No evidence of neurological impairment could be found and there was no
suggestion on clinical examination of nerve
root involvement causing muscle
weakness or loss of sensation.  The neurological examination of her lower limbs
was normal, there
was no loss of power and no loss of sensation.  It is my view
that Ms Mathews is independent in personal care and in the activities
of daily
living.  There have been many issues affecting her vocational status.  She is a
highly trained person in the media and in
advertising, and her career speaks
for itself."</b>
<P>

68   	Professor Jones expressed the view that:-
<P>

<b>"... she will ultimately succeed in her chosen career and that this should
be on the basis of full time employment to the extent which
she was performing
prior to the accident, although she would presumably move from activity to
activity as has been her wont through
years past.  I am not in a position at
this time to indicate any direct nexus between an intervertebral disc
impairment and the incident
of May 1992, as I have not been privy to any
sophisticated imaging scans.  Should an opinion be required then I would
request those
data."</b>
<P>

69   	Professor Jones provided another report after receiving
further information.  He said that the plaintiff had emphasised to
him that her
back and left ankle were normal prior to May 1992, but he noted that the
further information showed stress situations
prior to that event and a report
evidencing a CT Scan showing a lateral stenotic process at L3/4.
<P>

70   	He continued:-
<P>

<b>"This would suggest a pre-existing degenerative condition with stenosis and
involvement of perhaps a root canal by bony overgrowth.
 This may be a
substantial contributing factor to her earlier history of referred pain and
probable muscle weakness.  I indicated
my views as to hands on therapies
suggesting that such treatments were neither indicated nor would they improve
her situation and
in fact may be dangerous."</b>
<P>

71   	In cross-examination the plaintiff said that she thought
she remembered telling Professor Jones that her back was normal prior
to May
1992.  It was put to her that that was not accurate and she said:-
<P>

<b>"A. It was not in bad shape, it was just not great.  It wasn't acute.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But it wasn't normal, was it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It is relative."</b>
<P>

72   	She was nextly asked about a history she gave Dr Davis,
whose report appears at p.85 of Exhibit E.  Her history to Dr Davis
included
that she was unaware of any general health problems "and denied any significant
musculo skeletal injuries in the past. 
In particular she denied any symptoms
affecting her back, neck or limbs".  It was put to Mrs Mathews that this
history was not true
and she gave evidence, at Tpp.25-26, in which she sought
to say that she was not suffering from pain but stiffness.
<P>

73   	I have already stated that in my view the evidence has
established that the plaintiff was suffering from pain in her back,
including
her low back, well prior to May 1992 for which she was receiving treatment from
Mr Bablis.  The objective evidence explained
the reason for this.  Her history
to the doctors that she was not suffering from such pain cannot be accepted
and, indeed, her case
was conducted on the basis that the fall of 2 May 1992
constituted an aggravation and exacerbation of the pre-existing back condition.
The difficulty in this case is to try to sort out the extent to which she
suffered pain and problems as a consequence of that aggravation
and
exacerbation over and above that which she was previously suffering.  This
difficulty is caused by the problem in accepting her
subjective complaints of
pain.  That difficulty is added to by the fact that Ms Key, who, I am
satisfied, treated her after the accident,
reported that she was asymptomatic
until her trip overseas in 1995.  As I have noted Dr Garrick was given a
history that the back
pain had substantially subsided by October 1992.
<P>

74   	It is to be noted that Dr Davis expressed the view, p.88
of Exhibit E, that:-
<P>

<b>"Mrs Mathews is quite evidently a highly motivated person who will continue
to work in her chosen profession despite expected and
documented aggravation
with travel and unsustained postures.</b>
<P>

<b>Her domestic responsibilities are resulting in a degree of aggravation and I
believe that she should have paid domestic assistance
of 4 to 6 hours per week
to undertake all of the heavy or forceful work.</b>
<P>

<b>Her injury has now stabilised and her prognosis is for continuing
difficulties."</b>
<P>

75   	The plaintiff also relied upon two reports of Dr Michael
Morris, who saw the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.  Mr Branson
informed
me, without objection, that the plaintiff had re-served Dr Morris' reports on
the defendant.  He saw her firstly on 20 June
1998, and she gave him a history
that she used to get some higher level back pain when she drove, for which she
received some physiotherapy
and chiropractic treatment from Mr Bablis.  Dr
Morris did not see the MRI or CT Scan and set out the history he received.  He
considered
that the plaintiff had a "surprisingly full range of lumbar spinal
movement and makes no evident attempt to embellish her disability;
she stated
that the back is quite good to-day and has been much better since being on
Prednisone".
<P>

76   	In his diagnosis Dr Morris expressed the view that it
would be of significance to ascertain the level and kind of systems
she had
prior to the May 1992 incident, and he strongly recommended that the reports be
obtained from those who had treated her,
including Dr Hameri.  He
continued:-
<P>

<b>"However, unless there is clear evidence of pre-existing sciatica, on the
face of it it seems likely that she became aware of it within
a day or so of
the fall, and it has persisted intermittently since.  The account she gives is
certainly suggestive of nerve root
irritation, which is characteristically
intermittent, and she does have some neurological evidence in the form of a
depressed right
knee jerk."</b>
<P>

77   	He offered certain other opinions as to her condition and,
in relation to her fitness for work, said that she was fit to continue
"her
present work as a public relations consultant and likely to remain so".
<P>

78   	He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"On the evidence so far available, and with the reservations set out above,
it certainly seems at least likely that this lady either
caused or suffered a
significant aggravation of a disc prolapse, leading to right L4 distribution
sciatica as a result of a fall
in 1992.</b>
<P>

<b>It also seems likely that a separate problem arose as a result of the fall
in Tenterfield in 1996 which may however have been due
in part to instability
of her left ankle, which in turn may date from 1992 also.</b>
<P>

<b>The problem with the right wrist is clearly a result of a fall in 1996, but
again may link indirectly to instability of the left ankle,
and I presume the
links there would be a matter for legal rather than medical argument."</b>
<P>

79   	On 21 September 1999 Dr Morris furnished a supplementary
report.  In that report he stated:-
<P>

<b>"Dr Sheehy's report however and handwritten notes are of considerable
importance and significance; on my reading of his handwritten
notes of 27/5/92
it says back and leg pain; LBP for years (presumably low back pain), thoracic
muscle biopsied.  Two years driving
to Windsor each day.  Two week sprains left
ankle."</b>
<P>

These are the notes of Dr Sheehy to which I have referred.
<P>

80   	In relation to the chiropractic notes, Dr Morris thought
they were of "doubtful value".  He said he did not know how definite
a
conclusion could be reached on the strength of them, but he assumed that a
legal argument could be advanced that the fall aggravated
whatever her
situation may have been.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Having looked at the chiropractic notes and the translation by John Kelly,
it is I think a reasonable conclusion that she has had
prior low back pain
despite her denials but I do not know how much further one could take the
matter than that.</b>
<P>

<b>I wonder whether her GP Dr Hameri might have notes as to whether she made
any reference to the claimed fall at the time that she saw
him.</b>
<P>

<b>The situation therefore in response to your additional questions are that I
do not know that any of this makes matters any clearer
than they were
originally and therefore I think the conclusions under the heading of
"Attributability" such as they are, stand unaltered
except that there is
certainly a doubt that has been raised as to the link between claimed
exacerbation of back pains and the fall
on board the ship."</b>
<P>

81   	Dr John Matheson examined the plaintiff on behalf of the
defendant.  He is a consultant neurosurgeon, who examined her in
August 1998.
He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"To put this matter into context she has had what can only be described as a
relatively minor fall with a possible lateral ligament
tear to the ankle,
although that is best judged by orthopaedic surgeons.  There is no reason why
this fall going forwards and on
to her sides should produce a back injury at
all.  Indeed, there is no evidence that she has got a significant injury from
that event.
 What is clear is that she has an hysterical personality disorder
and that this is a somatised story with a whole lot of complaints
that clearly
have no basis in physical reality.  She may or may not have some minor back
pain of longstanding.  I cannot tell that.
 From what I can see there is on
evidence that she has any sciatica and she certainly has no neurological
disability whatsoever and
no back disability to examination.</b>
<P>

<b>It is my view that this is a contrived disorder and that she has no injury
as far as her back is concerned from the incident of 2
May 1992."</b>
<P>

82   	In cross-examination, Tp.46, Dr Matheson expressed the
view that the plaintiff was imagining the disorder and describing symptoms
in
emotional and not physical terms, but he said he was not suggesting that she
had no physical symptoms whatsoever.  He considered
that the various scans
showed that her back was normal and that the discs were normal, but he denied
that the type of fall the plaintiff
suffered was likely to have injured her
back.  He said falls of that nature cause either broken wrists or femurs.
<P>

83   	Dr Douglas Seaton gave two reports: Exhibit E pp.81 and
131.  He first saw the plaintiff on 20 September 1996.  It is interesting
to
note that in recording the history he said:-
<P>

<b>"She did have a large amount of physiotherapy including traction and
manipulation, and she did have financial deprivation because
she was only
employed by her company one day per week instead of full time."</b>
<P>

There are two or three matters of interest in this sentence.  Firstly, the
plaintiff gave no evidence of such treatment.  Secondly,
if she did have such
treatment, which, in my opinion, happened, it would appear she received it from
Ms Key.  Thirdly, the plaintiff
cannot have told Dr Seaton that by the
amendment to her Agreement of 1 January 1992 she was only to work one day per
week.  It is
obvious that the plaintiff failed to advise Dr Seaton of this
change in her employment arrangements with "her company".  Dr Seaton
also noted
that she had recently obtained work as a consultant in China for water
conservation, but that "this does not pay well".
 He received a history that
she would be employed "basically, by the Chinese Government".  There is no
evidence that she performed
any such work or received any payment.
<P>

84   	Dr Seaton referred to the problems with her back and
noted:-
<P>

<b>"She is helped by the fact that she has a gardener to do the lawnmowing and
she did, at one stage, require a housekeeper to help her
with the housework.
She does not require that now, but she does enjoy her swimming, which she does
winter and summer, and it helps
her backache."</b>
<P>

Thus by September 1996 Dr Seaton was reporting on a person, who was able to
manage physical activities, notwithstanding the pain
of which she
complained.
<P>

85   	She complained to Dr Seaton about lower back pain with
spasm in the muscles basically on the right side of her back and down
the right
leg in the form of sciatica and instability in the left ankle.
<P>

86   	Dr Seaton formed the view that "this woman is still a back
cripple and always will be".  He said he would comment further
on that when he
had seen the MRI examination "but it would appear to me that she has more than
one disc injury in her back as a result
of the accident on 5 May 1992".
<P>

87   	He noted instability in the left ankle, and he formed the
view that her expenses were going to be "great in the future, although
she does
not take medication".  He was of the opinion that her outlook was poor and that
she would not be able to work again to her
full potential because of the fact
that she fell in May 1992.  He considered that if she was to continue to
advance in her field
of pollution prevention, she would require domestic
assistance in the home.
<P>

88   	At p.131 Dr Seaton gave a further report in which he dealt
with the accident at Tenterfield.  He said that the plaintiff gave
a history of
having tripped on uneven ground and her left ankle gave way causing her to land
on her right wrist and break it.  Mr
Stitt was critical of this history in the
light of the plaintiff's evidence that the left ankle gave way, although I do
not think
this criticism is justified.  Dr Seaton concluded that "all her
injuries that she has sustained are a direct result of the fall that
occurred
when she was on artificial grass when she tripped on a stair when visiting a
naval craft".  He added that "quite definitely
the injury to the right wrist,
which is a very severe one, is directly related to the injury that occurred on
the naval ship ..".
<P>

89   	The plaintiff's case was supported by the evidence of her
son Benjamin and Shana Bellin, whose witness statements appear at
pp.370 and
372 respectively of Exhibit E.  Neither was required for cross-examination.  I
should also mention that the only doctor
required for cross-examination was Dr
Matheson.
<P>

90   	Her son stated that he recalled his parents returning home
on the night of the accident and several incidents when she appeared
to suffer
substantial pain.  In paragraphs 7 and 8 he said:-
<P>

<b>"7.	Since the accident my mother has been more emotional, more emotionally
unwell and physically unwell.  I have observed her reach
for something and then
shout out in pain.  I have observed her driving the car and complained of pain.
She does not cook as much
now either.  Mum requires a lot more assistance and I
assist her, as do other people.  I have been asked to carry things for her,
bend over and pick up things, carry her suitcase, carry the filtered water
bottles, and reach things in the frig for her.  I have
observed my mother on
the floor screaming in pain in my brother's room with a bag of frozen peas
behind her back.  I also recall
her not being able to attend a school event and
she was shaking and looked in pain.  Recently my mother came to pick up my
brother
from my father's house.  My mother broke down in terrible pain at that
time.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	Mum appears a lot more stressed and anxious as a result of the
accidents.  She doesn't play tennis, she still swims, and has
put on a lot more
weight.  I have observed Mum's ankle give way at a church service and walking
down the sidewalk.  She's very careful
and has grabbed me due to the
instability of her ankle.  My mother is home a lot more than she used to be.  I
am with her three to
four days a week at her home."</b>
<P>

91   	Ms Bellin stated that she has known the plaintiff since
1988.  She observed the plaintiff both before and after the accident,
and has
seen, since May 1992, the plaintiff "in excruciating pain and crying on
occasions".  She said that she noticed the plaintiff
was transformed "from a
young, fit and active person to a person who moves slowly, gained weight and
had different colouring.  She
does not look well".
<P>

92   	She has seen the plaintiff in extreme pain, crying and
appearing to be unable to move.  She concluded:-
<P>

<b>"I have also observed that Fiona is more unhappy since the accident.  When
she is emotional, she does not seem to have the resources
to handle it and
breaks down a lot more than she used to.  I recall on one occasion Fiona
attended the course I held and I noticed
she was in pain.  She was limping.  I
asked her, `What is wrong?'  She said to me `I've fallen on an aircraft carrier
and injured
myself'.  She could barely talk without crying from the pain on
this occasion."</b>
<P>

93   	The plaintiff also makes a claim for a psychiatric injury.
Initially this was not pursued, but towards the end of his submissions
Mr
Branson said that having noticed what was said by Dr Strum, he withdrew the
concession that she did not claim to have a recognisable
and defined
psychiatric injury. 
<P>

94   	Originally the plaintiff was seen by Dr Dent.  It was not
pursuant to anything Dr Dent assessed that led to the change in
the attitude to
the case.  Dr Strum, in his report of 26 August 1999, said:-
<P>

<b>"At the time of interview Mrs Mathews said that she continued to be anxious
but she was optimistic and motivated.  Her main worry
was having another fall
and re-injuring her arm.  Her appetite and sleep were intact although, at
times, pain in her hand would disturb
her sleep.  Her sexual drive had
improved.  She said that her anxiety and depression depended on her physical
state of well-being.
 There were no nightmares, flashes or panic attacks.  She
was mixing well with people."</b>
<P>

95   	Towards the end of his report Dr Strum referred to various
stressors in the plaintiff's life and, at p.9, continued:-
<P>

<b>"Mrs Mathews first developed psychiatric symptoms in 1992 and has
experienced bouts of similar symptoms ever since.  The symptoms
she described
are those of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Depressed Mood
(DSM-IV-309.28).  The symptoms have fluctuated.  There
have been appetite and
sleep disturbances.  At times she over eats and at times she suffers from
anorexia.  Her insomnia and early
morning wakening is caused by anxiety as well
as pain.  There have been suicidal thoughts at times.  Her motivation,
depressed mood
and libido has tended to fluctuate.  Mrs Mathews symptoms are,
at times, severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of Major Depression
(DSM-IV-296.3).  However a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and
Depressed Mood (DSM-IV-309.28) seems preferable because
her symptoms are
related to pain and disability."</b>
<P>

96   	Dr Strum expressed the view that the plaintiff had gone
from being a competent person, working in a high pressure job, to
only being
able to do part-time work, and stated that her illness "is now intermittent".
It does not appear that he was aware that
she had agreed to part time work at
Memtec from 1 January 1992, nor that she did not intend to return to full time
work until either
2000 or 2005.   He thought there would be further episodes
and the prognosis was guarded.  He did not expect a complete recovery
even with
medication, coping strategies and meditation.
<P>

97   	The plaintiff was examined by a psychiatrist, Dr Champion,
on behalf of the defendant.  Dr Champion said that the plaintiff
gave no
history to suggest that her claimed pain and suffering and disability had
produced psychological distress or psychiatric
disorder and there was no
history of her having received treatment in this regard.  He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"From a psychiatric viewpoint therefore, currently there is no indication of
psychiatric disorder.  There is no history of psychiatric
disorder prior to or
following the injury and she has not received treatment for any form of
psychiatric disorder.  Her activities
and range of interests, as well as her
presentation are consistent with the view that Ms Mathews does not suffer with
any psychiatric
disorder."</b>
<P>

98   	Dr Dent's report is helpful in that he seems to identify
that the plaintiff received treatment from Ms Key after the accident.
At p.5 of
his report, Dr Dent said that the plaintiff had suffered no depression since
she had learnt to meditate as a coping mechanism
"and has used this for a very
long time".  As best as I understand the balance of his report he does not
identify any recognisable
psychiatric illness.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

99   	The first conclusion to which I have come is that the
plaintiff is a very poor historian.  She was clearly incorrect in her
evidence
that she met the greeting line prior to her accident.  She did not reveal to a
number of doctors that she had any problem
with her back prior to the incident
of 2 May 1992.  She did not reveal to Dr Seaton that by the time of the
accident she was only
working one day per week.  She did not reveal that after
being treated by Ms Key until mid-1995 she had been asymptomatic.  In addition
to her problems so far as the history is concerned I formed the clear
impression that the plaintiff was seeking to avoid answering
questions in
cross-examination about any back problem prior to the accident of May 1992 in
so far as it related to her low back.
<P>

100   	When all these matters are put together I have great
difficulty in accepting her subjective evidence of pain and, therefore,
in
assessing the extent to which the plaintiff aggravated or exacerbated her
undoubtedly existing back condition as a result of the
fall.  This is made the
harder when it is borne in mind that she was seeing Mr Bablis for treatment to
her back in February 1992.
<P>

101   	I think it is necessary to make the finding, which I am
satisfied should be made, that the plaintiff's evidence was unsatisfactory
in
relation to any problems from which she is suffering with her back and, in so
far as she sought to avoid questions in cross-examination
as to the extent of
her previous problems, I do not consider that she was being truthful.  Further,
there is the evidence of Ms Key
of the lack of symptoms until 1995, and there
is the evidence of numerous trips overseas, which are hardly consistent with a
person
suffering to the extent which the plaintiff maintained.  There is also
the evidence of Dr Garrick that the back pain had substantially
subsided by
October 1992.
<P>

102   	I think I should say a little more about the report from
Ms Key.  It was not raised until late in Mr Stitt's address.  Mr
Branson did
not refer to it until the conclusion of his address, when I invited his
comments on it.  He said it was a report he would
like to withdraw, although he
did not seek leave to do so. There were agreed out-of-pocket expenses to the
date of trial and, in
the submissions made there is a claim for $1,764 for
"Edgecliff Physiotherapy".  Ms Key operated under the name of Edgecliff
Physiotherapy
Sports &amp; Spinal Centre.  When I add that matter to other
matters, such as the plaintiff's reference to her, to Dr Garrick's having
sent
a copy of his report to her, and to the history she gave Dr Dent, I am
satisfied that Ms Key treated the plaintiff after the
incident in May 1992.  I
am also satisfied by Dr Garrick's report that by October 1992 that treatment
had been essentially successful.
 Thereafter, according to Ms Key, the back
remained asymptomatic until mid-1995 after the lengthy trip overseas, it being
conceded
by Mr Branson that the trip commencing on 4 June 1995 was the trip
undertaken before the plaintiff again saw Ms Key.
<P>

103   	It seems to me that the proper inference to draw from the
evidence is that the fall did cause an exacerbation or aggravation
of the
pre-existing spinal problems; that this necessitated extensive treatment from
Ms Key; but that there was a very substantial
recovery from the aggravation or
exacerbation by October 1992. 
<P>

104   	In all the circumstances I am not able to relate the
problems for which she consulted Ms Key in mid-1995 to the aggravation
or
exacerbation of the original injury.  That, in my opinion, was spent.  The
plaintiff has not satisfied me that the problems in
1995 were the consequence
of the accident on 2 May 1992 rather than the pre-existing condition. In the
result, I am of the opinion
that such pain and suffering as should be
attributed to the aggravation and exacerbation should be for a closed period to
October
1992.
<P>

105   	The next matter to which consideration has to be given is
the fracture to the right wrist.  There is no doubt that prior
to the incident
of 2 May 1992 the plaintiff had no problem with her left ankle.  The medical
evidence is that the sprain of that
ankle led to its becoming weaker and liable
to "give", and supports the view that there is a causal relationship between
her weakened
left ankle and her fall in the forest.  I have noted Mr Stitt's
criticism of the history, although in this regard I do not think
that is
justified.  The evidence of a causal connection is also supported by Dr Waller
and Dr Harper.
<P>

106   	In the result the injury to the plaintiff's right wrist,
with the consequences that imposed, are causally related to the
accident.
<P>

<b>Damages For Pain And Suffering</b>
<P>

107   	So far as pain and suffering are concerned, I am of the
view that the appropriate amount to award the plaintiff both in respect
of the
closed period for her back and for her wrist is $40,000.  As the period in
respect of the back is a closed one, and as she
did not injure her wrist until
August 1997, that being the major component of her pain and suffering, I should
attribute one third
to the past or, to round the figure off, $14,000, and two
thirds, namely $26,000, to the future.  Interest on $14,000 at 2 per centum
per
annum for 7.5 years is $2,100, making the total award for general damages
$42,100.
<P>

108   	It is to be noted that the plaintiff's claim for
out-of-pocket expenses has been agreed, on the basis that if I find that
only
her back, neck, ankle "etc" were involved, at $2,290, to which sum, if I find
that her wrist is attributable to the accident,
is to be added the sum of
$6,215.  Therefore the out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $8,505.  The
evidence does not establish the
components of these figures, but figures are
set out in the written submissions, which particularise the past out-of-pocket
expenses
at $8,694.20 "together with any amounts payable to the Health
Insurance Commission".
<P>

109   	The plaintiff has made a claim for future out-of-pocket
expenses of $71,063.31 plus future surgery costs.  The claim proceeds
upon the
basis of 15 sessions of physiotherapy per annum at $50 per session; 18 sessions
of remedial massage at $80 per session;
2 consultations with a general
practitioner per annum of $1,592.70; 2 consultations per annum with a
specialist of $6,887.38; and
various other expenses such as a psychologist for
18 months at $100 per fortnight.  Whilst there is an evidentiary basis for most
of these expenses, they appear to relate to the back for which I do not think
she is entitled to further compensation.   
<P>

110   	It appears that the plaintiff will need further treatment
in respect of her wrist, at least to remove the plate, but in the
absence of
evidence as to the possible cost, it is very difficult to award her any amount.
However, and perhaps I will be criticised
for being speculative, I propose to
allow $1,500 for the procedure as a future out-of-pocket expense.
<P>

111   	So far as past out-of-pocket expenses are concerned the
submission is that the plaintiff has paid $4,778.85 and claims interest
on that
amount at 8 per centum per annum for 7.5 years, which amounts to $2,871.  I am
prepared to allow that amount, although there
is a discrepancy between the
total amount claimed in the submissions and the agreed figure of $8,505.
However, in the overall context
of this verdict, I do not think that is a
matter about which I should be concerned further.  Accordingly, for past and
present out-of-pocket
expenses I allow $8,505, $1,500 and interest of $2,871, a
total of $12,876.
<P>

<b>Past Economic Loss And Future Loss Of Earning Capacity</b>
<P>

112   	In relation to past economic loss and future loss of
earning capacity the plaintiff's case suffers, in my opinion, from deficiencies
of evidence, notwithstanding that she carries the onus of proof.  I have
pointed out that at Memtec the plaintiff was earning, at
the date of the
accident, $10,000 per annum gross and, from about August 1993, $10,400 per
annum gross.  The plaintiff has given
no evidence that she lost work in
consequence of the accident and, if she did, the amount of salary she was not
paid.  Indeed within
a month of the accident she was away for 24 days on a
business trip, and, thereafter, made the business trips to which I have
referred.
 Further, the plaintiff has given little evidence that she was
precluded from undertaking private work as a consequence of the accident.
 In
so far as she has referred to difficulties, she has not identified any work she
did not undertake or any earnings she has lost
because of her alleged back or
wrist problems or, indeed, at all.
<P>

<b>Past Wage Loss</b>
<P>

113   	Normally, in respect of past wage loss there is evidence
of the amount the plaintiff was earning prior to the accident, the
period for
which she was not earning as a consequence of the accident and an assessment,
based on those matters, of the loss suffered
to the date of trial.  In the case
of an employee it is generally not a difficult task.  In the case of a
self-employed person it
can be proved by a comparison of pre and post accident
earnings.  In the present case it is known that the plaintiff had agreed to
work one day per week for Memtec for $10,000 per annum together with some
fringe benefits.  The plaintiff had previously been employed
on a full time
basis on the terms to which I have referred.  The plaintiff said that after her
injury the chairman of Memtec was
supportive and understanding and tried to
accommodate her disability.  She has given no evidence of the period she was
absent from
her employment.  Rather, her evidence is that she travelled
overseas in the course of her employment for 24 days from 3 June 1992.
 Prima
facie, and I say that because there is no evidence to otherwise explain the
matter, that would account for 24 of the 52 days
per annum she was to work for
Memtec.
<P>

114   	She made no further reference to her employment until
paragraph 43 of her statement, in which she stated that in 1997 she
resigned
from Memtec for the reasons to which I have referred.
<P>

115   	She gave no evidence that she agreed to work for only one
day for Memtec so that she could undertake other employment, nor
did she give
any evidence as to any other employment she undertook and, in paragraph 62, she
has stated that since resigning from
Memtec she has been involved in a variety
of projects, a number of which have been performed on a voluntary basis.  She
continued:-
<P>

<b>"At present I am not employed on a full-time basis and work on a part-time
basis as a freelance adviser to a variety of companies.
 I have difficulties in
undertaking my day to day employment due to my pain and my inability to commute
to attending at certain events
as I am unable to judge at what time I will
suffer from pain and disability.  Although I am confident that I will be in a
position
to continue to work on a part-time basis, I am certainly not able to
return to employment on a full-time basis due to the pain and
disability which
I suffer."</b>
<P>

116   	She stated that it had been her intention to work on a
full time basis until she was 65 years of age and to re-commence "full
time
employment in 2000 once both my sons had completed their schooling".  Her
history to her accountant was that she may not have
done so until 2005.
<P>

117   	There is no evidence as to what was involved in the
business trips commencing on 10 June 1993, 1 June 1994, 4 June 1995 and
20 June
1997.  The plaintiff has sought to erect a case for past economic loss and
future loss of earning capacity on the basis of
a report from accountants,
Dolman Bateman &amp; Co Pty Limited. 
<P>

118   	After a general introductory comment the author dealt
with the plaintiff's pre-accident capacity, noting that the plaintiff
had
advised that she worked very long hours as a public relations officer and as
the President of National Greenhouse Action Australia,
and that her commitments
involved a lot of travel, both locally between her home and Windsor and
overseas.  The author then turned
to post-accident capacity and stated that as
a result of her disabilities the plaintiff has reduced her working hours
considerably.
 The report continued:-
<P>

<b>"She is currently trying to establish her own consultancy, specialising in
international and industrial media relations and lobbying
with an emphasis on
environmental policies and issues.  She has advised that she can cope with
intermittent work as she can rest
periodically.  Due to the spasmodic nature of
her health and back pain, she now lacks the confidence to commit and perform on
certain
projects.  She now finds travelling, whether by car or any other mode
of transport, very painful."</b>
<P>

119   	Whilst these may be the complaints the plaintiff made, I
am not satisfied that any pain in her back referable to the accident
continued
after October 1992.  In any event, and more relevantly for present purposes,
the plaintiff gave no evidence of work she
did not undertake.  Nor, at an
evidentiary level, was an attempt made to erect any specific case for past wage
loss on that basis.
<P>

120   	In relation to her ability to drive she said, Tp.29, that
she does drive, and she drives normally unless she is having "an
acute phase":
Tp.30.  She said she has a Volvo motor car which she drives every day without
any difficulty.  This would seem to negate
her history that she finds
travelling by car very painful, and her frequent trips overseas for lengthy
periods would seem to negate
the suggestion that she finds travelling "very
painful".
<P>

121   	The report then goes on to deal with past economic loss
from 2 May 1992 to 31 October 1997, which is calculated at $126,657.
 A
subsequent report to 1 September 1999 updates the figure to $172,133.  It is
stated that the plaintiff's post-accident restrictions,
which have impacted
directly on her income, "allegedly involve" that she finds it difficult to
travel; that she advised that she
feels unreliable and is not always able to
work as a result of her pain and needs to rest periodically; and that she has
lost the
confidence to be able to commit to some projects.
<P>

122   	The method of calculation of past economic loss is by
taking probable earnings, as calculated at pp.8 to 12, of $233,045,
deducting
therefrom actual earnings of $106,388, as calculated at pp.13 to 14 and coming
up with the first loss figure to which I
have referred.
<P>

123   	The schedule of probable earnings commences by taking net
earnings of $655 weekly with Memtec.  However, it is noted that
during the 1992
financial year she reduced her work hours and that she had advised that she
planned to work one to two days per week
for Memtec and two to three days in
similar employment, reverting back to full time employment when her children
were older "possibly
around 2005".  Reference is then made to the fringe
benefits of a motor vehicle, and home and mobile telephones from Memtec.  There
was no evidence of what she expected to earn from her employment other than
with Memtec.
<P>

124   	She commenced working for Memtec on 2 April 1990 and,
from then to 30 June 1990, she received a gross salary of $12,671.54
on which
she paid tax of $4,359.70.  This, according to her income tax return, was her
only income.  In the following financial year,
i.e. the financial year ended 30
June 1991, her income tax return shows gross earnings from Memtec of $46,295.24
on which she paid
income tax of $14,640.52.
<P>

125   	For the financial year ended 30 June 1992, which was the
year in which she reduced the amount of her income by the variation
to her
contract and also suffered the injury, her only income was from Memtec, as
disclosed by the income tax return in evidence.
 Her gross income was
$31,741.48 on which she paid tax of $9,261.
<P>

126   	In the next financial year her only disclosed income was
from Memtec, the gross amount being $10,000 on which she paid $990.34
by way of
tax.  This was the figure she had agreed to receive pursuant to the variation.
In the financial year ended 30 June 1994
her only disclosed income was from
Memtec, the gross amount being $11,379 on which she paid tax of $1,389.90.  
<P>

127   	The next income tax return is for the year ended 30 June
1996 in which year she received a gross amount from Memtec of $11,409.
 She
also received interest of $832, a net capital gain of $1,909 and a small share
dividend, giving a total assessable income of
$14,743 on which she paid tax of
$1,275.19.
<P>

128   	By letter dated 14 October 1997 Memtec provided
information as to the amount paid to the plaintiff for her mobile and home
telephones and, on 3 September 1998, the successor of Memtec set out the
amounts paid to her on a gross and net basis.  The amounts
for 1995 and 1997
were, gross, $12,838.52 and $14,642, and net $11,427 and $13,223.  The car
value for each year, save for 1997,
was shown, and it was stated that an 8%
superannuation contribution, calculated on gross, was made on the plaintiff's
behalf throughout
her employment.
<P>

129   	In my opinion, before the Court could award any further
amount for the plaintiff's past loss of earnings, it would be necessary
for her
to prove what attempts she had made to obtain other work and her inability, in
consequence of the injuries resulting from
the accident, to undertake such
work.  The plaintiff proffered no evidence in support of these matters, which
would allow any calculation
to be made, and there is no evidence of what moneys
she has earned "on a part time basis as a freelance adviser to a variety of
companies",
save for the financial year ended 30 June 1999.  There is no
evidence at all as to her earnings for the financial year ended 30 June
1998.
The accountant's report for the financial year ended 30 June 1999 states that
she earned $24,268 gross, of which $18,000 came
from Memtec's successor, and
$19,638 net.  She gave no evidence that she refused any work for that period
and, as I have said, her
evidence is that she did not intend, at least until
the year 2000, to return to full time employment.
<P>

130   	In these circumstances the plaintiff has completely
failed to satisfy me that she has lost any income.  There is no evidence
that
whilst she was employed by Memtec she lost any of the income for which she had
contracted, in which I include the benefits for
car and telephone.  In these
circumstances, I do not consider that she is entitled to any amount for past
economic loss.  Similarly,
so far as superannuation is concerned there is no
suggestion that the plaintiff was not paid the amount of superannuation to
which
she was entitled or that it was not credited to an account for her
benefit.  The assumption the accountant made in respect of superannuation
seems
to be that she would be entitled to it working on a free-lance or part time
basis.  This assumption has not been established.
<P>

<b>Loss Of Future Earning Capacity</b>
<P>

131   	So far as loss of future earning capacity is concerned
the report stated that there had been a valuation of the current uninjured,
undiminished net weekly earnings on the assumption that the current total loss
of capacity is entirely due to the disabilities suffered
in the accident.  It
continued:-
<P>

<b>"If, however, it is considered by the Court that there is a residual earning
capacity, our calculations would need to be adjusted
to the extent of this
capacity and this is not a matter which we can address in our report."</b>
<P>

It was then noted that the plaintiff had, at the date of the accident, intended
to revert to full time employment in about the year
2005, which would tend to
indicate that she was going to accept far less employment in the intervening
period.  The report stated:-
<P>

<b>"Thus, the current loss which is based on probable earnings of four days
work per week only applies to 31/12/2004.  As from 01/01/2005,
the future loss
should be based on probable earnings of five days work per week."</b>
<P>

132   	The first calculation carried out is for the period 1
November 1997 to 31 December 2004, it being stated that the plaintiff's
current
net weekly loss is $854.  This is said to be based on probable earnings of a
salary of $807 per week, which is an indexed
amount commencing with $721 per
week, as I understand it, for the period 2 May 1992 to 30 June 1992.
Thereafter the figure is indexed
each year to reach the figure of $807 per
week.  In my view, and with great respect to the author of the report, this is
a fanciful
way of seeking to assess the income.  It is fanciful, because there
was no evidence that this is the amount the plaintiff would have
been earning,
or would have continued to earn.  This figure could only be justified, if at
all, if she had not varied her contract
with Memtec, or if she proved what she
could have earned.  The same exercise is then carried through for the balance
of the plaintiff's
assumed working life.
<P>

133   	Before one comes to deal with the vicissitudes, it is
necessary to look at the realities.  The plaintiff has only proved
that she
received certain amounts from Memtec, save to the extent I have noted.  She has
not proved that she received any other amounts,
nor has she proved that she
received any income for the 1998 financial year, nor has she proved what work
opportunities are available
in her field and the amount she might expect to be
remunerated in respect of them.
<P>

134   	The accountant then took the figures to 1 September 1999
for past economic loss and calculated $172,133 and re-calculated
loss of
earning capacity at $379,615.  These figures are also, in my opinion, infected
with the same error as the previously calculated
figures.  Whilst the
plaintiff's written submissions maintained these to be the figures for loss of
future earning capacity Mr Branson,
in his final submissions, submitted that
the plaintiff's loss was $640 per week, but that one should allow $300 net per
week and
apply 25% for vicissitudes on the basis of his concession that the
plaintiff had "a significant pre-existing disability, but one
which had not
been productive of loss of earning capacity".
<P>

135   	I regret that I cannot give effect to these figures for
the plaintiff's loss of earning capacity.  I cannot do so because,
in my
opinion, the plaintiff has simply failed to prove the relevant amounts. She has
failed to prove what amount, uninjured, she
would have earned.
<P>

136   	The preponderance of the evidence, and the evidence which
I accept, is that the plaintiff will be able to obtain employment.
 The
evidence of Professor Jones, Dr Davis and Dr Morris supports this and is in
accordance with the probabilities and Mr Branson's
concession to which I have
just referred.  Indeed, for all I know, the plaintiff is now deriving income
from employment, which is
consistent with her earnings for the last financial
year.  She certainly did not say she was not, and her evidence was that she was
doing certain work on a part time basis.  Her evidence was, further, that she
intended to return to work on a full time basis either,
if one accepts her
witness statement, in 2000, or if one accepts what she apparently told the
accountants, in the year 2005.
<P>

137   	For all these reasons it seems to me that the Court
cannot simply speculate as to an amount the plaintiff may have lost.
 She has
simply failed to prove the amount she has lost.  All I can say for certain is
that she has been earning certain amounts.
However, I cannot take these
amounts, having regard to the circumstances in which she ceased her employment
with Memtec, as the upper
limit of her future earning capacity and, even if I
could, I would still have to know what amount should be deducted from it to
reach
her real loss, i.e. the expenses she would incur in carrying on her own
business.
<P>

138   	The plaintiff, I think, in the circumstances of this
case, is entitled to some amount as a buffer against any future downturn
in her
employment by virtue of her wrist injury and for the period she will be unable
to work when she has the further operation.
 However, in my view, this should
be a small amount, which I assess at $60 per week which, on the 3% Tables for
fifteen years, is
$37,932.  Whilst Mr Branson conceded that the amount for loss
of future earnings had to be reduced by 25 per cent to take account
of the
vicissitudes obtaining in this case, that was not in the context of a "buffer"
amount, to which I propose to apply the usual
rate of 15 per cent.    The
amount I award for loss of future earning capacity is, accordingly, $37,932
reduced by 15 per cent, i.e.
$32,242.20.
<P>

<b>The Griffiths v Kerkemeyer Claim</b>
<P>

139   	The plaintiff claims damages pursuant to the principles
in <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 161.</a>  The first basis upon
which the claim is made is care to the date of the hearing, being for domestic
care of six hours per week from
2 May 1992 to the date of trial at $19 per
hour.  The difficulty I have with this claim is that it assumes that for the
total period
the plaintiff was entitled to that degree of care.  The claim is
made, essentially, in relation to her back injury.  As I have found
I am
satisfied that that, in so far as it was a matter for which the defendant was
responsible, had resolved by October 1992, a period
of approximately 184 days
from which, in my opinion, one would have to deduct the 24 days that the
plaintiff was away on business.
 I would, accordingly, allow 160 days, or 23
weeks, there being some evidence sufficient to satisfy me that during that
period the
plaintiff was in receipt of assistance for which such a claim would
run.
<P>

140   	So far as the wrist is concerned it is very difficult to
come to any real view on this matter because nothing is suggested
as to the
time involved in that particular operation and the recovery from it.  The
evidence of Dr Waller is that the plaintiff underwent
an open reduction and
internal fixation of the fracture of the right radius on 25 August 1997.  She
was reviewed on 4 September 1997
when the plaster and the sutures were removed
and thereafter she underwent physiotherapy.  She was reviewed again on 30
October 1997.
 Since then Dr Waller has not seen her in consultation, but he
understands that her left ankle is still causing some problems.
<P>

141   	Dr Waller said that the plaintiff may require further
treatment to her right wrist in the future, and that at some stage
she will
require removal of the fixation plate and screws.  I have dealt with this.  He
considered that she had lost 30 per cent
permanent loss of efficient use of the
right arm below the elbow.
<P>

142   	It would seem, at most, that the plaintiff required a
further 15 weeks when a <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> type claim could apply,
making a total of 38 weeks.  She has made a claim at the rate of 6 hours per
week which, for 38 weeks, amounts
to 228 hours at $19 per hour, which equals
$4,332.  It did not seem to be in issue that she was entitled to interest on
that amount
at the rate of 3%, although it would not be appropriate to allow
the full 7.5 years.  Doing the best I can I would allow interest
for 4 years,
which would amount to $520.  The total award under this heading is,
accordingly, $4,852.
<P>

143   	The plaintiff has not satisfied me that she is entitled
to any future amount under this heading.  Ms Henry has provided a
detailed
report, which seems to be directed mainly to the problem with her back.
However, she has not established any specific needs,
under this heading, for
damages referable to the wrist.
<P>

<b>Amounts</b>
<P>

144   	In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to recover the
following amounts:-
<P>

(a)	General damages					$  42,100 . 00
<P>

(b)	Out-of-pocket expenses				$  12,876 . 00
<P>

(c)	Loss of future earning capacity			$  34,242 . 20
<P>

(d)	<b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b>				<u>$    4,852 . 00</u>
<P>

								<u>$  94,070 . 20</u>
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

145   	I order:-
<P>

(a)	Judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of
$94,070.20.
<P>

(b)	If the parties wish to address me on costs I shall hear submissions.

<b>6/1999 - MATHEWS v THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	On or about 2 May 1992 the "USS Independence", ("the
vessel"), which was, at the time, probably the largest aircraft carrier
in the
world and which was owned by the defendant, The United States Department of
Defence, for which Mr R.R. Stitt of Queen's Counsel
and Mr G.M. Watson of
Counsel appeared, and a number of other United States Navy vessels, arrived in
Sydney Harbour.  The occasion
for the visit was the celebration of the 50th
Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the vessel moored at Garden
Island.
<P>

2   	On the evening of 2 May 1992 the defendant, or those for
whom it was responsible, arranged a cocktail party on the vessel to
which,
amongst a large number of others, the plaintiff, Ms Fiona Amanda Squire
Mathews, for whom Mr C.C. Branson of Queen's Counsel
and Mr J.T. De Berg of
Counsel appeared, and her then husband, Mr Elbert Lynn Mathews, were invited.
The reasonable inference is
that all guests were invited and, accordingly,
those, including the plaintiff and Mr Mathews, were boarding the vessel at the
defendant's
invitation.  So much was not in issue.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff and Mr Mathews travelled to the dock by car
and proceeded to board by ascending a gangway basically in single
file in a
line of guests.  The gangway ran parallel to the side of the vessel, to the
point where guests could obtain access to her.
 The plaintiff was walking in
front of Mr Mathews.
<P>

4   	There was a platform at the top of the gangway, which, on
the evidence I accept, was approximately several metres long and
slightly
shorter in width.  It was covered with a blue type of carpet and persons
boarding the vessel stepped from the gangway onto
the platform and then turned
left towards the vessel.  The platform was above deck level and to move from it
to the deck it was necessary
to cross the platform and step down from it to the
deck.  The portion of the deck to which people stepped may also have been
covered
with the same type of carpet.
<P>

5   	Although there was some dispute on the evidence, I am
satisfied that there was a line of naval and other dignitaries on the
deck, who
were greeting guests as they arrived.  The plaintiff has suggested, on several
occasions, that this greeting line was on
the platform.  I am satisfied that it
was not.  I am, however, satisfied that sailors from the vessel were on the
platform and on
the deck adjacent to it, and that part of their duties involved
assisting guests from the gangplank onto the platform and, more importantly
for
present purposes, from the platform to the deck.  This involved walking down
either one or, perhaps, two steps. There was no
handrail or handgrip of which
guests could take hold before stepping down from the platform to the deck.  Nor
was there any warning
that the step was there.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff stepped across the platform followed by Mr
Mathews, and her evidence in chief as to what then happened appears
in
paragraphs 22 and 23 of her witness statement of 4 November 1999, Exhibit
A:-
<P>

<b>"22.	Upon arrival at the ship I walked up the gangplank in front of my
husband.  There was a step from the gangplank to a platform.
 I stepped off the
gangplank onto the platform.  I was not assisted by anyone.  The platform was
covered in blue synthetic artificial
grass carpet.  From that platform I had to
step down to the next platform.  I led with my left foot down the step to the
next platform.
 I was not assisted.  As I did this my right shoe heel got
caught in the carpet on the top platform and I fell down.  I fell as I
had
already commenced stepping with my left foot down to the next level when my
right foot unexpectedly got caught.  This caused
me to lose my balance and I
fell on to the lower level falling forward on my knees and landing on my right
side.</b>
<P>

<b>  23.	The steps which I fell down were not fitted with any handrails, and
situated immediately to the side of the steps was a sailor,
however, I was not
provided with any assistance or offer of assistance from this officer."</b>
<P>

7   	In his witness statement of 10 November 1999, Exhibit B, Mr
Mathews described what happened in paragraphs 5, 7 and 8 thus:-
<P>

<b>"5.	At the top of the gangplank there was a platform which was covered in
blue grass matting.  There was an officer on my left on
the platform at the top
of the gangplank.  He was taking each guest's arms as they stepped off the
gangplank onto the platform. 
When Fiona stepped off the gangplank, she was not
assisted by the officer.  I observed him to be distracted.  He was talking to
another
officer.  He did not take Fiona's arm as she stepped off the gangplank
onto the platform.  Fiona took another step forward on the
platform and fell
forward.  I saw her heel had caught in the blue grass matting covering the
platform.  Fiona was near the edge of
the platform.  I lunged forward to try
and stop her falling forward.  The officer on my left noticed me lunging
forward and grabbed
me.  This stopped me catching Fiona.</b>
<P>

<b>  ...</b>
<P>

<b>  7.	Fiona fell forward onto her knees down the step from that platform onto
her right side.  The platform was not very wide until
reached the next level.
There was a line of officers on the deck.  In falling, Fiona fell onto and down
to the next level which was
also covered in blue grass carpet.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	There was no rail along the side of the blue grass carpet.  The
carpeted section was wider than the gangplank.  The steps off
the gangplank and
from one level of the platform to the next were steep.  Fiona fell to her
knees.  She tried to stand up and could
not initially.  I said to her, `What
happened?'  She said, `My heel caught'." </b>
<P>

8   	The basic facts asserted by the plaintiff and Mr Mathews
were not, essentially, in issue.  The defendant accepted that she
was walking
across the platform, which was covered with the blue carpet material; that Mr
Mathews was walking behind her; that the
heel of her right shoe caught in the
carpet as she was stepping forward to descend the step or steps from the
platform to the deck;
that that caused her to fall forward; that sailors on
duty to assist her descending did not do so; and that Mr Mathews was prevented
from further assisting her by the action of a sailor in stopping his forward
movement.  It was not in issue that there were no handrails
or supports
available at this point.  It was submitted by the defendant that reasonable
care did not require any for the purpose
of negotiating one step.  
<P>

9   	The issue is whether, in these circumstances, the defendant
was guilty of negligence.  The principal allegations of negligence
were that
the sailors, who were obviously on duty to assist guests move from the
gangplank to the platform and thence to the deck,
failed to initially assist
the plaintiff, as they did other guests, and, having failed in that way did not
observe the difficulty
she encountered  until it was too late to prevent or
check her fall; whether there should have been a handrail or support in
position;
and whether a warning should have been given.
<P>

10   	The defendant submitted that if, contrary to its primary
submission, it was found to have been negligent, the plaintiff was
guilty of
contributory negligence by allowing her heel to become caught in the carpet.
Although other allegations of contributory
negligence, including the
plaintiff's failure to seek assistance from the sailor on duty, were pleaded,
none were argued in final
submissions.
<P>

11   	The parties accepted that the question of negligence was
to be determined, in circumstances where the plaintiff was a lawful
entrant on
the vessel, by whether the defendant took reasonable care to avoid foreseeable
risk of injury to her: <b>Australian Safety Stores Pty Limited v Zaluzna</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a> and <b>Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern
Territory</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20192%20CLR%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 192 CLR 421.</a>
<P>

<b>Negligence</b>
<P>

12   	I have set out the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr
Mathews in chief on the issue of negligence.  The plaintiff was cross-examined
as to her recollection of events leading up to the accident, having said that
her witness statement was prepared with some care and
accurately set out the
way in which it occurred.  She said it was truthful and complete.  She was
cross-examined, commencing Tp.6,
about paragraph 22 and her recollection of the
events and, in particular, about some evidence she had given previously to the
effect
that the greeting line was on the platform rather than the deck.  In so
far as the plaintiff asserted that it was and that she met
various dignitaries
prior to the fall, I am satisfied that her evidence is not correct, and that
she did not reach the greeting line
before she fell.  This is consistent with
Mr Mathews' evidence, which was not challenged, and with other undisputed
evidence. However,
notwithstanding that view of her evidence, I am satisfied
that she fell in the way she described in paragraph 22 and no real challenge
was made to her evidence in that respect.
<P>

13   	Similarly, the evidence of Mr Mathews was not challenged
as to how the accident occurred.  Mr Mathews said, Tp.43, that there
were
"certainly sailors in parallel lines forming a corridor onto the main deck of
the ship extending beyond" the platform, although
he was not certain whether
the line came "right up to the platform".  His evidence was quite clear that
there was no greeting line
on the platform.
<P>

14   	I have outlined the principal way in which the plaintiff
puts her case on negligence.  Firstly, she asserted that the vessel's
personnel
should have assisted her and other guests from the gangplank to the platform
and from the platform to the deck, and that
this was particularly so as there
was no handrail.  Secondly, she submitted that such persons were in position to
assist and to guard
against the possibility of a guest's falling at this point
but that, at the time she fell, sufficient attention was not being paid
to her
and she was not, at any time, offered assistance.  Thirdly, it was submitted
that in so far as the seaman was distracted,
he was distracted from carrying
out the very function he was supposed to be performing, namely to give
assistance to guests moving
onto and off the platform, and that it was
negligent for him to be distracted.  Fourthly, it was submitted that the vessel
had ample
crew to provide sufficient personnel at this point, so that if one
member was "distracted" another could take over.
<P>

15   	The allegations of negligence have to be viewed against
the background of what was happening on the vessel on this evening.
 Guests,
presumably from all walks of life and of various ages and physical conditions,
had been invited to the cocktail party. 
It must have been clear to those in
charge of the vessel, and indeed so much was acknowledged by the presence of
the vessel's personnel
to assist them, that in some way or other a guest may
encounter difficulties in traversing the platform and stepping down to the
deck.  It was not necessary that those in charge should see the precise way in
which this may happen.  It was sufficient that in
a moving line of people, it
was reasonably foreseeable that a guest may trip, slip, lose his or her step or
in some other way become
unbalanced, perhaps because of the throng of people or
perhaps because of the general layout.  As I have said those in charge
recognised
the problem by placing personnel on duty to assist.  The plaintiff
did not receive assistance because the seaman was "distracted".
<P>

16   	In his statement of 1 November 1999 Lieutenant Commander
D.C. Rose, who was well qualified to give evidence on this matter,
said:-
<P>

<b>"In my experience, it is not usual to have a handrail for a step or steps
that are temporary for the duration of a ship's visit only.
 This was a special
occasion, however, where formality was paramount and it is not inconceivable
that, in such a ship with its almost
limitless resources and storage space, a
special set of steps with handrail would be used for the Admiral's guests.
However, assuming
this was not the case here and Mrs Mathews is correct, the
lack of handrail serves to emphasise the need for care in other ways in
bringing guests aboard."</b>
<P>

17   	Subsequently he said:-
<P>

<b>"Although a sailor or officer is said to have been posted on the top level
to the left side of the end of the gangplank, so as to
help guests negotiate
that initial step down from the gangplank, it appears that guests were left
then to negotiate the step down
to the next level without help or guarding.
The height of this step is unknown.  Assuming it is the same as that shown in
the video,
it is uncertain whether it is more than usual height.  The public
visitors boarding the ship appear to have no difficulty with it.</b>
<P>

<b>Nevertheless, given that the situation was unfamiliar to guests, and given
the possibility that the second step was of a different
height than that down
from the end of the gangway, I would expect a prudent officer responsible for
the safety of guests using the
gangplank and step to have stationed an
additional officer or sailor at the second level, so as to help guests,
especially ladies
attending a cocktail party, in formal wear and possibly with
high-heeled shoes, negotiate that second step down.</b>
<P>

<b>In this case, Mrs Mathews says there was an officer or sailor stationed at
the base of the step on the deck level.  Given that once
on the second or deck
level guests are said to have been required to turn left before stepping down
two more steps to a lower deck
level, that officer or sailor would appear
possibly to have been stationed too far away to be able to assist a guest in
negotiating
that second step or, more critically, to help catch or cushion a
falling guest.</b>
<P>

<b>In the light of the foregoing, assuming the arrangements were as stated, it
is my opinion that an officer or sailor stationed close
to the second step
would have been in a position enabling him more readily to steady Mrs Mathews
to prevent her falling or, failing
that, catch her sufficiently to save her
from falling heavily.  Further, in a general sense, it is my opinion that an
efficient and
responsible officer in charge of arrangements for bringing
civilian guests aboard should be expected to have foreseen the need for
special
care and to have stationed his helpers in such a way that accidents, such as
that suffered by Mrs Mathews, could not occur
or, at worst, would be less
serious than might otherwise have been."</b>
<P>

18   	For a number of reasons he specified, Lieutenant Commander
Rose concluded that it was opinion:-
<P>

<b>".. that the ship's responsible officer should have stationed a person in an
appropriate position close enough to actively assist
guests down that second
step and to make every effort, if they fell, to hold them up or cushion their
fall."</b>
<P>

His evidence was not challenged.
<P>

19   	The defendant relied on a statement of Lieutenant
Commander Richards, which is part of Exhibit 5.  He attended the cocktail
party
with his wife and, upon arriving at the top of the gangway, guests stepped from
it to a raised platform and, as he recalled
it, there were only two small steps
from the raised platform to the deck.  He continued, paragraphs 11 and 12:-
<P>

<b>"11.	I recall that a US Sailor was stationed on either side of the gangway
to assist guests from the gangway onto the raised platform
if such assistance
was required.  I can specifically recall my wife being assisted from the
gangway onto the raised platform.</b>
<P>

<b>  12.	The US Sailors stationed at the top of the gangway also provided
assistance to guests as they stepped from the raised platform
down the two
small steps to the deck of the USS Independence where the cocktail party was
being staged."</b>
<P>

The defendant's evidence thus corroborated the perceived need to have the
vessel's personnel available to assist guests.
<P>

20   	I am satisfied that had this task been performed properly
when the plaintiff fell, she would have received assistance either
before
falling or been restrained whilst falling, such as to have lessened, if not
prevented, her accident.  This was the very purpose
that the personnel were
stationed in that area and they failed to perform their task.
<P>

21   	Mr Stitt submitted that so far as the static condition of
the vessel was concerned none of the associated structures played
any causative
role in the plaintiff's falling and being injured.  There was no evidence that
the carpet was inappropriate for the
use to which it was being put, nor that it
was damaged or warn, and the submission continued that I would not find that
the mere
fact that the heel of the plaintiff's shoe caught was any evidence of
any static defect.  He continued that so far as the dynamics
were concerned I
should find that the plaintiff attended the vessel as part of a semi-public
function; that she gained access via
the gangplank and the platform; that there
was only one step down from the platform to the deck; and that she fell in
stepping from
the platform because she caught the heel of her shoe in the
carpet.  He submitted that parallel lines of sailors were on the deck
and there
were sailors on the platform, and that if this constituted "the dynamics",
there was no obligation or duty on the defendant
to instal a handrail when only
one step was involved, and no one needed to be placed to assist people down one
step.  He said the
fact that the person was so placed was a matter of
"courtesy" and not of duty.
<P>

22   	Mr Stitt submitted further that the seaman, who was
distracted, was only distracted momentarily as he was able to respond
to what
he thought was Mr Mathews' falling, and that it could not be suggested that
such a momentary lapse amounted to negligence.
<P>

23   	Obviously, there was no absolute duty on the defendant to
prevent injury to the plaintiff.  The duty was to take reasonable
care to avoid
foreseeable risk of injury to her.  The stationing of personnel on the platform
and on the deck to give assistance
to persons moving through that area and to
the deck showed that the defendant foresaw there was a risk of injury.  It had
not provided
a handrail to assist guests stepping from the platform to the
deck, but had provided the vessel's personnel to do so.  The distraction,
even
though it may only have been momentary, although there is no evidence that this
is so the evidence being that the distraction
had ended at the time Mr Mathews
commenced to fall, shows, in my opinion, that the personnel were not carrying
out their allotted
tasks in a proper manner, or that there were insufficient of
them to do so.  Their duty was to ensure that help was at hand for guests
thus
boarding the vessel and this was not fulfilled.
<P>

24   	In the circumstances, in my opinion, the defendant was
guilty of negligence.  I have noted that a pleaded allegation of contributory
negligence, which was not pursued, was the plaintiff's failure:-
<P>

<b>".. to make use of the assistance provided by the defendant to persons
boarding the vessel".</b>
<P>

25   	Mr Stitt submitted that if, contrary to his submissions on
negligence, I came to the view that there was negligence, the plaintiff
was
guilty of contributory negligence in that she allowed her heel to be caught in
the carpet and was not picking up her feet.  In
my view the defendant has not
established that this constituted contributory negligence.  Indeed, the fact
that her heel became caught
in the carpet would tend to indicate that there was
some defect in the carpet.  However, no complaint was made, in final
submissions,
by the defendant about the appropriateness of the plaintiff's
footwear and, in these circumstances, I do not consider that the defendant
has
established the only case of contributory negligence upon which it ultimately
relied.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	The Plaintiff's History And Complaints</b>
<P>

26   	The plaintiff was born on 11 August 1950 and, at the date
of the accident, was aged 41 years.  She is now aged 49 years. 
She married Mr
Mathews on 5 August 1978 and lived with him in various parts of the world as he
pursued his career as a banker.  Her
two sons were born on 19 March 1980 and 6
February 1982.
<P>

27   	In November 1983 the plaintiff moved with her family to
New York, as that was where Mr Mathews was posted and, in paragraph
12 of her
witness statement, she said that whilst in New York she felt stressed at being
isolated from friends and family "together
with the moving from country to
country (six residences in three years), quite stressful especially living in a
residential hotel".
<P>

28   	In February 1984 the plaintiff commenced to work for the
Australian Broadcasting Commission in New York and, upon returning
to Australia
in 1984, she resumed part-time casual work for that organisation in Sydney and
commenced trading as Fiona Mathews &amp;
Associates in 1986.  She said, in
paragraph 14, that this was a small public relations company, which was
retained by a number of
clients and, in 1988, there was a merger between it and
Playfair Pty Limited.  There was no evidence of the effect of that on her,
nor
that she received any payment in consequence of it or interest in Playfair Pty
Limited.
<P>

29   	In 1990 she was employed by Memtec Limited, ("Memtec"),
pursuant to a written Agreement dated 1 March 1990, as a public relations
manager for three years from 2 April 1990 to 1 April 1993, and she was required
to devote her full time and attention to her employment.
 She was to receive a
base gross salary of $45,000 per annum and, in addition,  membership of any
life assurance benefit plan and
of employees' stock purchase scheme, and the
benefits of any other scheme or plan available to all employees of Memtec.  She
was
to have the use of a Ford Falcon Sedan and Memtec agreed to reimburse her
for all its reasonable operating expenses.  She was to
receive reimbursement of
her telephone rental on a quarterly basis and a reasonable amount of the cost
of telephone calls, including
those on her mobile telephone, and annual
holidays and long service leave.
<P>

30   	Clause 7(a) provided that Memtec was entitled to terminate
the Agreement at any time prior to the expiration of the employment
period
without cause upon 60 days' written notice. 
<P>

31   	Memtec carried on its business at South Windsor and the
plaintiff lived at Randwick.  Thus it was necessary for her to drive
on most
working days from her home to South Windsor and back.
<P>

32   	On 1 January 1992 the plaintiff entered into a written
variation of that Agreement, whereby it was agreed:-
<P>

<b>"1.	The existing employment agreement period dated 1st March 1990 and
expiring on 1st April 1993 shall continue to operate except
for the following
variations:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	For the remainder of the employment period the employee shall work only
1 day per week for Memtec.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	During this shorter working period, Memtec shall pay to the employee a
base salary at the rate of ten thousand Australian dollars
(A$10,000) per
annum, payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices at Memtec but no
less frequently than in equal monthly
instalments."</b>
<P>

33   	At Tp.27 the plaintiff agreed there was such a variation,
and she continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. When did you cease working for Memtec on a one day per week
basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It was in 1996.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And since that time have you then only been employed on a casual
basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, as a consultant.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Only on a casual basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

34   	There was also tendered an Employment Agreement as part of
Exhibit 5, which was undated and unsigned, but appears to have
been prepared in
August 1993, which provided that during the employment period, which was to
commence on 1 July 1993, the plaintiff
would be paid a salary of $10,400 per
annum.
<P>

35   	The plaintiff described her employment with Memtec, in
paragraph 15 of her witness statement, as being "their global Public
Relations
Executive", the general nature of the work undertaken by Memtec being to purify
city drinking water and sewerage.  She
said that major public relations events
were held in Australia, Europe, the United States and Japan.  She continued, in
paragraph
17,that in 1992 it became apparent that more of Memtec's focus would
be in the United States' markets, and that there was not the
potential that had
been hoped for in Australia.  She said:-
<P>

<b>"My work was scaled down to a part-time basis and I undertook a number of
other projects, independent of Memtec.  I continued to travel
for Memtec to do
public relations events overseas.  In 1995 we did a major event in Wales and in
the United Kingdom."</b>
<P>

The reasonable inference is that these circumstances led to the entry into the
Variation Agreement.  An extraordinary aspect of
this case is that there is no
evidence that the plaintiff earned any money, i.e. there is no evidence of any
remuneration received,
from 1991 other than from Memtec, save in the financial
year ended 30 June 1999, during which the plaintiff received most of her
income
from Memtec's successor.
<P>

36   	In paragraph 18 she said:-
<P>

<b>"For a number of years I was actively involved in social tennis and played
at least once, and sometimes twice a week.  I was also
a keen swimmer.  I was
residing with my family at home in Randwick and travelling to the offices of
Memtec at Windsor on a regular
basis.  In order to travel to Windsor I was
required to drive for a period of up to three hours per day and on occasions I
would
experience thoracic back pain for which I received massage.  The nature
of the back pain which I experienced was not in the same
location or intensity
as that which I now experience."</b>
<P>

37   	After describing the fall, the plaintiff said she was
driven by Mr Mathews to the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick where
x-rays
were taken of her left ankle and right leg and she was advised that she had
suffered a sprained left ankle.  She continued,
paragraph 28, that she left
hospital with crutches and that overnight and the next day there was an intense
pain in her right leg
and lower back.  She consulted her family doctor, Dr
Hameri, on 4 May 1992.  He referred her for an x-ray of her back and CT Scan
to
Dr Sheehy at St Vincent's Hospital, who recommended that she should have a
laminectomy to give relief to her pain.  She chose
to explore less intrusive
procedures first, such as intensive physiotherapy, traction, massage and
swimming, and she said:-
<P>

<b>"I found those few weeks quite shocking because the level of pain was
intense much of the time.  I went to Memtec when I was picked
up by car and
driven out with a colleague.  The chairman of Memtec was supportive and
understanding and tried to accommodate my disability.
 I was determined to get
better and try not to focus on the pain, and set milestones for me to achieve
and to keep my career path."</b>
<P>

It will be remembered, of course, that at this time she was only working one
day per week for Memtec.  She gave no evidence that
she did not receive her
full contractual entitlement from Memtec whilst she was injured.
<P>

38   	The plaintiff agreed that Exhibit 6 set forth her overseas
travel accurately.  On 3 June 1992 she travelled to Brazil, London,
New York,
Paris and London over a period of 24 days for business purposes.  She referred
to this trip in paragraph 29 of her witness
statement, it being to attend the
Earth Summit Conference on behalf of Memtec, and to assist on some research for
Beyond 2000.  She
said that whilst overseas she experienced significant back
and leg pain, although she attended to her duties "as best" she could.
 On one
occasion she had to rest for 24 hours.  She returned to Australia in June 1992
and was referred for treatment under the care
of Dr Hameri. 
<P>

39   	In her witness statement she set out various tests which
were carried out, but she said that the pain in her back, legs and
arm did not
cease and she sought physiotherapy, massage and acupuncture and consulted an
osteopath.  She was on a regime of medication
including Panadeine and Valium.
She continued that on a number of occasions her back pain became quite extreme
whilst attempting
to undertake ordinary daily activities, and that she had been
rendered physically incapable of coping with the pain and been forced
to seek
emergency medical treatment from hospitals, chiropractors and osteopaths. She
gave no details of these treatments. Mr Mathews
assisted her in dealing with
the pain, and although she received some short term relief, it generally
returned.  She said she was
unable to attend to her daily household duties and
was assisted by Mr Mathews, her son, Ben, and a part-time nanny. There is no
evidence
what she paid the part-time nanny. She became extremely frustrated
with the level pain and was "increasingly unable to cope with
the strains which
this was causing in my day-to-day life".  Her relationship with her husband
deteriorated further, there being evidence
that it had not been satisfactory
from at least 1986, and:-
<P>

<b>".. although we have had difficulties prior to this accident, I feel that
these have been significantly exacerbated by the injuries
I had
received."</b>
<P>

In the end, no submission was made that the accident in May 1992 contributed to
the eventual break-down of the marriage.
<P>

40   	She was not able to return to her pre-accident sporting
activities, but, by July 1995, she began to feel that her symptoms
were
improving and "although I was still suffering from back pain I felt that this
was being managed effectively".  This evidence
is at odds with a history she
gave a physiotherapist, Ms Key, in a report to which I will refer.
<P>

41   	From 10 June 1993 she was overseas for one month on
business and, commencing on 3 April 1994, she was in Indonesia on a holiday
for
seven days.  On 1 June 1994 she travelled to London, Paris, New York and
Washington for seven weeks on business and, on 4 June
1995, she travelled to
London, Cardiff, Paris, Toulouse, London and New York for five weeks on
business.  This was a significant
trip, because she said that whilst in New
York she developed substantial pain in her back and, in paragraph 38, she
continued:-
<P>

<b>"This setback provided me with additional stress and I was disillusioned
with the fact that I was again faced with a long period of
rehabilitation
before my symptoms would improve.  I was informed by Josephine Key
Physiotherapist that my back would require ongoing
maintenance."</b>
<P>

42   	On 16 August 1995 Ms Key wrote a report, Exhibit 5 p.79,
in which she stated:-
<P>

<b>"I have treated this lady some years ago for low back pain which radiated
down the front of the right thigh and caused marked muscle
weakness.  She
required extensive treatment at that stage, however she managed to avoid
surgery <u>has been asymptomatic until recently she has been on an overseas
trip</u>.  In June/July of this year she travelled overseas and during this
time complained of low back pain which radiated into her right
thigh and foot.
She also had pins and needles in her foot.</b>
<P>

<b>When I assessed her on 11.7.1995 my opinion was that she again required an
extensive course of treatment to ameliorate her presenting
symptoms.  As part
of this she would need to be prepared to carry out exercises at home to help
her progress."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

It was conceded by Mr Branson that the overseas trip, to which reference was
made, was that of five weeks commencing on 4 June 1995.
<P>

43   	There is no doubt that prior to 2 May 1992 the plaintiff
had suffered some degree of back pain.  Her case is that the fall
exaggerated
and exacerbated that condition.  Ms Key's report is not entirely clear, and the
plaintiff was not asked when she obtained
treatment initially from her.  It is
therefore not clear when she required extensive treatment and for how long she
had been asymptomatic.
 It is strange, if there was a problem resulting from
the accident in respect of which she was treated by Ms Key, that no reference
was made to this in the report, and the plaintiff gave no evidence that she was
treated by Ms Key after the accident and before July
1995, from which the
inference may be that she was treated by Ms Key prior to the accident.
However, in my opinion, when the whole
of the evidence is examined it becomes
plain enough that she was treated by Ms Key after the accident of 2 May 1992.
I shall seek
to explain why.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff stated, in paragraph 39 of her witness
statement, that she noticed that her left ankle appeared to be weak,
and that
it would, on occasions give way and she would fall, and that "throughout this
period" she had pain radiating down through
her buttocks into her right leg.
She separated from Mr Mathews in 1995, although it was not submitted that this
was caused by the
accident.  She said, in paragraph 43, that she resigned from
Memtec in 1997, as she felt she was not able to continue her duties
due to her
pain and disabilities "together with a general downturn in the work available",
and that in August 1997 she was providing
some advice to a Tenterfield Action
Group, and in the course of doing so was required to attend a meeting in the
Timbarra forest.
 Whilst walking in the forest, she felt her left ankle give
way and she fell forward landing heavily on her right wrist and hand.
 She
fractured her right wrist, which required surgery for internal fixation.  She
is dominantly right handed and now has lost sensation
in the middle finger of
her right hand.  She has a significant scar to her right wrist and hand.  She
has never regained full movement
in that wrist and continues to be troubled by
pain, particularly in cold weather.
<P>

45   	Dr Waller reported on 18 May 1998:-
<P>

<b>"She will never regain full function of the right wrist or hand.  She will
always have some restriction of movement of the right wrist.
 She has some
residual deformity of the right wrist as a result of her fracture.  <u>This
will be permanent</u>.  She will always have some weakness on the right forearm
and hand.  She will continue to have some restriction of movement of the
right
wrist."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

46   	The plaintiff complained that since the accident she has
continued to experience pain in her lower back, which has required
treatment at
times, although no evidence was given of the treatment she received or its
frequency or cost.  She also continues to
notice that her left ankle is not as
stable as previously.  She stated that "on an emotional level" she has
experienced difficulties
in not being able to do what she could before the
accident, and that in 1995 and 1997 she suffered exacerbations of her injuries
"including the fracture of my right wrist",  as a consequence of which she has
become depressed.  She continues to take medication
"intermittently" in an
attempt to control the pain.  No evidence was given of the extent of such
medication or its cost.  She continued
that before the accident she suffered
from stress, although she did not feel she was experiencing any symptoms in
early 1992, and
certainly the stress and back difficulties she had prior to her
accident in May 1992 "were nowhere near as severe as those which
I now
experience and continue to suffer since May 1992".  As I have noted this
complaint is not consistent with the complaint she
made to Ms Key in mid-1995.
Nor is it consistent with certain medical evidence.  She continues, she
asserted, to experience pain
in her back and difficulties with her right ankle
and is limited in the amount she is able to travel.  She cannot lift heavy
weights
and has difficulties in undertaking domestic duties, particularly
vacuuming and activities requiring flexion of her spine.  The pain
can become
so severe as to cause her to have headaches and she is troubled by the
deformity of her right wrist both as to its appearance
and functionality.  She
has put on weight because of her inability to exercise daily, and continues to
receive physiotherapy, massage,
chiropractic and other treatment from her
general practitioner. Once again no evidence was given of the specifics of this
treatment.
 She said that she would like to consider receiving some assistance
in dealing with the emotional aspects of her injuries and developing
further
mechanisms by which she is able to cope with the injury and the associated
disabilities.
<P>

47   	In paragraph 62 of her witness statement she said that she
resigned from her position at Memtec in 1997, and that since then
she has been
involved in a variety of projects, a number of which have been performed on a
voluntary basis.  She is not presently
employed on a full time basis, but works
on a part time basis as a free lance adviser to a variety of companies. She
gave little
evidence of her earnings from this part time employment. She has
difficulties in undertaking her day to day employment due to pain
and an
inability to commute and attend certain events, and:-
<P>

<b>"Although I am confident that I will be in a position to continue to work on
a part time basis, I am certainly not able to return
to employment on a full
time basis due to the pain and disability which I suffer.  It had been my
intention to continue working on
a full time basis until age 65."</b>
<P>

48   	She then said, in paragraph 63:-
<P>

<b>"It had been my intention to re-commence full time employment in 2000 once
both my sons had completed their schooling."</b>
<P>

She gave a history to her accountant that she did not intend to return to full
time employment until 2005.  She concluded that she
does not feel her injuries
would allow her to perform all her domestic duties, that she is assisted by her
children on a daily basis
"carrying items, picking up things, lifting and
reaching particularly high things together with other duties for approximately
seven
to eight hours per week", and that she "continues to suffer from pain in
her back, left and right leg, right wrist and radiating
pain".
<P>

49   	Exhibit 6 shows that commencing on 23 June 1996 the
plaintiff travelled to the United Kingdom for six weeks and, commencing
on 7
January 1997, to China for nine days for a holiday.  Commencing on 19 April
1997, she travelled to the United States for sixteen
days and, commencing on 20
June 1997, she travelled to the United States for a further sixteen days to
attend a convention/conference.
 Commencing on 14 December 1997, she travelled
to the United Kingdom and the United States for a one month holiday and,
commencing
on 2 November 1998, to Italy for a seventeen day holiday.  On 4
March 1999 she travelled to the United Kingdom for one month for
a holiday and,
on 21 May 1999, to the United States for fourteen days on business.  All these
travel arrangements involved her travelling
by aeroplane.
<P>

<b>(b) The Plaintiff's Cross-Examination</b>
<P>

50   	In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed that she made no
complaint of any pain to her back when she first went to hospital
on the
evening of 2 May 1992.
<P>

51   	She saw Dr Hameri on 4 May 1992 when she complained that
she fell on the vessel on 2 May, that she had sprained her left ankle,
which
was x-rayed and appeared to Dr Hameri to be "OK", and that she had right thigh
numbness.  Dr Hameri noted that she was to go
overseas in June 1992.
<P>

52   	Although there is no reference in his notes to a complaint
of back pain, which may seem strange, the plaintiff maintained
that she
mentioned that to Dr Hameri and, in his letter of 6 September 1995, Exhibit E
p.80, Dr Hameri stated that on 4 May 1992
the plaintiff complained to him of a
sprained left ankle, lower back pain, and numbness in the right thigh.  He
referred her for
a CT Scan and to Dr Seaton.  It is unlikely he would have
taken either course if there was no complaint of back pain.  The defendant's
submission, however, was that the complaints of pain were essentially
subjective, there being no objective evidence to support them,
and that I
should not accept the plaintiff's evidence about them.
<P>

53   	The defendant tendered all of Dr Hameri's notes, he having
treated her from about 15 January 1986.  These notes show difficulties
with the
marriage relating back to March 1986: see references to entries on 17 March
1986; 6 August 1986; 23 November 1988; and 20
June 1989.
<P>

54   	On 10 February 1992 Dr Hameri noted that the plaintiff was
suffering from lumbar pain and seeing a chiropractor, Mr Bablis.
<P>

55   	The plaintiff was cross-examined closely about the
treatment she was receiving from Mr Bablis, to whom she returned on 4 May
1992,
and she agreed that he had been treating her for a long time for thoracic back
pain.  She said that so far as she remembered
he never treated her for low back
pain and, Tp.20:-
<P>

<b>"Q. What is your recollection? Did he treat you for low back pain prior to 4
May 1992?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Just back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Low back pain?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I don't remember.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You don't remember.  Is that your answer, you don't remember?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, that's my answer."</b>
<P>

56   	She agreed she saw Dr Sheehy on 27 May 1992, and she said
that she told him she had back pain from all the driving she had
been doing
and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Did you not tell Dr Sheehy, on 27 May 1992, that you had low back pain
for years?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I may have, but ...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would that have been the truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I had back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would that have been the truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, look, I had upper back pain ..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Please, would you ..</b>
<P>

<b>OBJECTION</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would it have been the truth that you had told Dr Sheehy that you had low
back pain for years?</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: I allow that question.</b>
<P>

<b>A. No.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. The answer was no, was it not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

57   	At Tp.21 the plaintiff was further cross-examined about
what she told Dr Sheehy.  She said she did not know that she said
to him that
she had low back pain and added:-
<P>

<b>"I had general back pain for years."</b>
<P>

She continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. I am suggesting to you that you told him that you had low back pain for
years.  Now, do you say that you did say that or you didn't
say that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I may have said that.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You may have said that.  If you did say that, would it have been the
truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It would have been the truth in that the whole back was sore from
driving.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. No, please.  I am asking you a specific question about the history that
you gave him of low back pain for years.  Would that have
been the
truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And did you, in truth, have low back pain for years prior to seeing Dr
Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I had back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Did you have back pain for years prior to seeing Dr Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Not acute back pain.  </b>
<P>

<b>Q. We will get to whether it is acute.  But did you have low back pain for
years prior to seeing Dr Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Probably just from driving.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Probably just from driving?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

58   	The plaintiff's evidence on this point was most
unsatisfactory both in its content and to my observation in the way in which
it
was given.  There can be no doubt on that evidence that she was complaining of
"general back pain for years" prior to 2 May 1992,
and that she conceded that
she had low back pain "probably just from driving" for years prior to seeing Dr
Sheehy.  It is also necessary
to note what Dr Michael Morris discerned from Dr
Sheehy's notes to which I shall refer.
<P>

59   	I have not the slightest doubt that the plaintiff suffered
from low back pain prior to the accident on 2 May 1992.  That degree
of
satisfaction is not reduced by Dr Sheehy's report of 28 May 1992 in which he
referred to a history of a recent attack "three weeks
ago of pain affecting the
right anterior thigh with radiation to and just below the knee".  He observed
that the lumbar CT Scan showed
a lateral stenotic process at the L3/4 level and
that the combination of disc and bony overgrowth contributed to the problem.
<P>

60   	The notes of Mr Bablis were tendered by the plaintiff and,
together with a transcription, became Exhibit G.  He appears to
have commenced
to treat her in September 1990 and, at Tpp.22-23:-
<P>

<b>"HIS HONOUR: Q.  Tell me this.  Where was the pain in respect of which you
consulted Mr Bablis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It's generally in the thoracic area and it was in the low back.  It was
only occasionally when I had a long drive to Windsor and
back for a couple of
years, but I didn't go to Mr Branson - sorry, Mr Bablis ..</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Don't worry.  I think that answers the question I asked.</b>
<P>

<b>WITNESS: It was not acute.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: What was not acute the thoracic pain or the ...</b>
<P>

<b>A. The pain was not acute.  It was just to keep me well.  He was simply
someone who manipulated and massaged.</b>
<P>

<b>STITT: Q. He manipulated your lumbar spine on a number of occasions, your
low back spine, on a number of occasions, did he not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, all my back.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. I am asking you about the lumbar?</b>
<P>

<b>A. The back, yes, the lumbar, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. On a number of occasions prior to May 1992?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, only a number of occasions."</b>
<P>

61   	The plaintiff placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Sheehy
and Dr Garrick, who wrote a report on 28 October 1992, Exhibit
E pp.76-77, a
copy of which he sent to Dr Sheehy and Ms Key.  
<P>

62   	Dr Garrick reported that the plaintiff had a substantial
right L4 radiculopathy related to a lateral disc lesion resulting
from a fall
in May 1992.  He said she had a fairly protracted course of conservative
management with only partial resolution of discomfort,
and that some of the
delay in seeking more active treatment may have related to an incorrect report
that the CT Scan stated that
the L3/4 disc appeared normal.  He said that was
quite wrong as there was "a clear lateral disc bulge encroaching on the nerve
root".
<P>

63   	Dr Garrick said that the plaintiff was quite well until
the fall.  He referred to her overseas trip with which she coped "with
some
difficulty and needed acupuncture treatment while away".  He said that the
backache had substantially subsided, but there was
continuing buttock, knee and
anterior thigh pain, and intermittent paraesthesia over the lateral aspect of
the right leg and difficulty
with walking.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"General health has been relatively unremarkable.  She has a long history of
minor thoracic pain from late childhood.  NSAID treatment
for this produced a
duodenal ulcer.  She now tolerates Naprosin suppositories with Tagamet
cover."</b>
<P>

64   	Dr Garrick expressed the view that it was likely that her
fall produced disc rupture "in a previously normal back".  He thought
she was
wasting her time pursuing further conservative management and recommended a
lumbar myelography with post myelogram CT Scans
to outline the nerve root.  He
strongly considered surgical decompression.
<P>

65   	The fact that a copy of his letter was sent to Ms Key
provides some evidence that she had treated her in relation to the problems
she
experienced after the accident.  Probably it was this treatment, which caused
the backache to substantially subside by October
1992.
<P>

66   	The difficulty, and I say this with no disrespect to Dr
Garrick, is that he apparently received a history of a basically symptom
free
back prior to the accident.  He knew there was a long history of minor thoracic
pain, but he does not appear to have been aware
that the plaintiff had been
receiving treatment for back pain for some time prior to the accident.  
<P>

67   	The plaintiff saw Professor Jones on behalf of the
defendant on 11 February 1998.  He recorded that she stated that her back
and
left ankle were normal prior to May 1992 and, after tracing her history, he
referred to the history of accident and injuries.
 He recorded that "over the
last twelve months she has been satisfactory" subject to an exception, which he
stated.  He examined
her and noted a history of injuring her left ankle and
subsequently sustaining back pain with radiation into her right leg.  He was
of
the view, as at the date he examined her, that:-
<P>

<b>".. there is a mild back impairment on physical examination being about 10%
reduction in normal back function and otherwise her symptoms
are subjective.
No evidence of neurological impairment could be found and there was no
suggestion on clinical examination of nerve
root involvement causing muscle
weakness or loss of sensation.  The neurological examination of her lower limbs
was normal, there
was no loss of power and no loss of sensation.  It is my view
that Ms Mathews is independent in personal care and in the activities
of daily
living.  There have been many issues affecting her vocational status.  She is a
highly trained person in the media and in
advertising, and her career speaks
for itself."</b>
<P>

68   	Professor Jones expressed the view that:-
<P>

<b>"... she will ultimately succeed in her chosen career and that this should
be on the basis of full time employment to the extent which
she was performing
prior to the accident, although she would presumably move from activity to
activity as has been her wont through
years past.  I am not in a position at
this time to indicate any direct nexus between an intervertebral disc
impairment and the incident
of May 1992, as I have not been privy to any
sophisticated imaging scans.  Should an opinion be required then I would
request those
data."</b>
<P>

69   	Professor Jones provided another report after receiving
further information.  He said that the plaintiff had emphasised to
him that her
back and left ankle were normal prior to May 1992, but he noted that the
further information showed stress situations
prior to that event and a report
evidencing a CT Scan showing a lateral stenotic process at L3/4.
<P>

70   	He continued:-
<P>

<b>"This would suggest a pre-existing degenerative condition with stenosis and
involvement of perhaps a root canal by bony overgrowth.
 This may be a
substantial contributing factor to her earlier history of referred pain and
probable muscle weakness.  I indicated
my views as to hands on therapies
suggesting that such treatments were neither indicated nor would they improve
her situation and
in fact may be dangerous."</b>
<P>

71   	In cross-examination the plaintiff said that she thought
she remembered telling Professor Jones that her back was normal prior
to May
1992.  It was put to her that that was not accurate and she said:-
<P>

<b>"A. It was not in bad shape, it was just not great.  It wasn't acute.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But it wasn't normal, was it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It is relative."</b>
<P>

72   	She was nextly asked about a history she gave Dr Davis,
whose report appears at p.85 of Exhibit E.  Her history to Dr Davis
included
that she was unaware of any general health problems "and denied any significant
musculo skeletal injuries in the past. 
In particular she denied any symptoms
affecting her back, neck or limbs".  It was put to Mrs Mathews that this
history was not true
and she gave evidence, at Tpp.25-26, in which she sought
to say that she was not suffering from pain but stiffness.
<P>

73   	I have already stated that in my view the evidence has
established that the plaintiff was suffering from pain in her back,
including
her low back, well prior to May 1992 for which she was receiving treatment from
Mr Bablis.  The objective evidence explained
the reason for this.  Her history
to the doctors that she was not suffering from such pain cannot be accepted
and, indeed, her case
was conducted on the basis that the fall of 2 May 1992
constituted an aggravation and exacerbation of the pre-existing back condition.
The difficulty in this case is to try to sort out the extent to which she
suffered pain and problems as a consequence of that aggravation
and
exacerbation over and above that which she was previously suffering.  This
difficulty is caused by the problem in accepting her
subjective complaints of
pain.  That difficulty is added to by the fact that Ms Key, who, I am
satisfied, treated her after the accident,
reported that she was asymptomatic
until her trip overseas in 1995.  As I have noted Dr Garrick was given a
history that the back
pain had substantially subsided by October 1992.
<P>

74   	It is to be noted that Dr Davis expressed the view, p.88
of Exhibit E, that:-
<P>

<b>"Mrs Mathews is quite evidently a highly motivated person who will continue
to work in her chosen profession despite expected and
documented aggravation
with travel and unsustained postures.</b>
<P>

<b>Her domestic responsibilities are resulting in a degree of aggravation and I
believe that she should have paid domestic assistance
of 4 to 6 hours per week
to undertake all of the heavy or forceful work.</b>
<P>

<b>Her injury has now stabilised and her prognosis is for continuing
difficulties."</b>
<P>

75   	The plaintiff also relied upon two reports of Dr Michael
Morris, who saw the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.  Mr Branson
informed
me, without objection, that the plaintiff had re-served Dr Morris' reports on
the defendant.  He saw her firstly on 20 June
1998, and she gave him a history
that she used to get some higher level back pain when she drove, for which she
received some physiotherapy
and chiropractic treatment from Mr Bablis.  Dr
Morris did not see the MRI or CT Scan and set out the history he received.  He
considered
that the plaintiff had a "surprisingly full range of lumbar spinal
movement and makes no evident attempt to embellish her disability;
she stated
that the back is quite good to-day and has been much better since being on
Prednisone".
<P>

76   	In his diagnosis Dr Morris expressed the view that it
would be of significance to ascertain the level and kind of systems
she had
prior to the May 1992 incident, and he strongly recommended that the reports be
obtained from those who had treated her,
including Dr Hameri.  He
continued:-
<P>

<b>"However, unless there is clear evidence of pre-existing sciatica, on the
face of it it seems likely that she became aware of it within
a day or so of
the fall, and it has persisted intermittently since.  The account she gives is
certainly suggestive of nerve root
irritation, which is characteristically
intermittent, and she does have some neurological evidence in the form of a
depressed right
knee jerk."</b>
<P>

77   	He offered certain other opinions as to her condition and,
in relation to her fitness for work, said that she was fit to continue
"her
present work as a public relations consultant and likely to remain so".
<P>

78   	He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"On the evidence so far available, and with the reservations set out above,
it certainly seems at least likely that this lady either
caused or suffered a
significant aggravation of a disc prolapse, leading to right L4 distribution
sciatica as a result of a fall
in 1992.</b>
<P>

<b>It also seems likely that a separate problem arose as a result of the fall
in Tenterfield in 1996 which may however have been due
in part to instability
of her left ankle, which in turn may date from 1992 also.</b>
<P>

<b>The problem with the right wrist is clearly a result of a fall in 1996, but
again may link indirectly to instability of the left ankle,
and I presume the
links there would be a matter for legal rather than medical argument."</b>
<P>

79   	On 21 September 1999 Dr Morris furnished a supplementary
report.  In that report he stated:-
<P>

<b>"Dr Sheehy's report however and handwritten notes are of considerable
importance and significance; on my reading of his handwritten
notes of 27/5/92
it says back and leg pain; LBP for years (presumably low back pain), thoracic
muscle biopsied.  Two years driving
to Windsor each day.  Two week sprains left
ankle."</b>
<P>

These are the notes of Dr Sheehy to which I have referred.
<P>

80   	In relation to the chiropractic notes, Dr Morris thought
they were of "doubtful value".  He said he did not know how definite
a
conclusion could be reached on the strength of them, but he assumed that a
legal argument could be advanced that the fall aggravated
whatever her
situation may have been.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Having looked at the chiropractic notes and the translation by John Kelly,
it is I think a reasonable conclusion that she has had
prior low back pain
despite her denials but I do not know how much further one could take the
matter than that.</b>
<P>

<b>I wonder whether her GP Dr Hameri might have notes as to whether she made
any reference to the claimed fall at the time that she saw
him.</b>
<P>

<b>The situation therefore in response to your additional questions are that I
do not know that any of this makes matters any clearer
than they were
originally and therefore I think the conclusions under the heading of
"Attributability" such as they are, stand unaltered
except that there is
certainly a doubt that has been raised as to the link between claimed
exacerbation of back pains and the fall
on board the ship."</b>
<P>

81   	Dr John Matheson examined the plaintiff on behalf of the
defendant.  He is a consultant neurosurgeon, who examined her in
August 1998.
He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"To put this matter into context she has had what can only be described as a
relatively minor fall with a possible lateral ligament
tear to the ankle,
although that is best judged by orthopaedic surgeons.  There is no reason why
this fall going forwards and on
to her sides should produce a back injury at
all.  Indeed, there is no evidence that she has got a significant injury from
that event.
 What is clear is that she has an hysterical personality disorder
and that this is a somatised story with a whole lot of complaints
that clearly
have no basis in physical reality.  She may or may not have some minor back
pain of longstanding.  I cannot tell that.
 From what I can see there is on
evidence that she has any sciatica and she certainly has no neurological
disability whatsoever and
no back disability to examination.</b>
<P>

<b>It is my view that this is a contrived disorder and that she has no injury
as far as her back is concerned from the incident of 2
May 1992."</b>
<P>

82   	In cross-examination, Tp.46, Dr Matheson expressed the
view that the plaintiff was imagining the disorder and describing symptoms
in
emotional and not physical terms, but he said he was not suggesting that she
had no physical symptoms whatsoever.  He considered
that the various scans
showed that her back was normal and that the discs were normal, but he denied
that the type of fall the plaintiff
suffered was likely to have injured her
back.  He said falls of that nature cause either broken wrists or femurs.
<P>

83   	Dr Douglas Seaton gave two reports: Exhibit E pp.81 and
131.  He first saw the plaintiff on 20 September 1996.  It is interesting
to
note that in recording the history he said:-
<P>

<b>"She did have a large amount of physiotherapy including traction and
manipulation, and she did have financial deprivation because
she was only
employed by her company one day per week instead of full time."</b>
<P>

There are two or three matters of interest in this sentence.  Firstly, the
plaintiff gave no evidence of such treatment.  Secondly,
if she did have such
treatment, which, in my opinion, happened, it would appear she received it from
Ms Key.  Thirdly, the plaintiff
cannot have told Dr Seaton that by the
amendment to her Agreement of 1 January 1992 she was only to work one day per
week.  It is
obvious that the plaintiff failed to advise Dr Seaton of this
change in her employment arrangements with "her company".  Dr Seaton
also noted
that she had recently obtained work as a consultant in China for water
conservation, but that "this does not pay well".
 He received a history that
she would be employed "basically, by the Chinese Government".  There is no
evidence that she performed
any such work or received any payment.
<P>

84   	Dr Seaton referred to the problems with her back and
noted:-
<P>

<b>"She is helped by the fact that she has a gardener to do the lawnmowing and
she did, at one stage, require a housekeeper to help her
with the housework.
She does not require that now, but she does enjoy her swimming, which she does
winter and summer, and it helps
her backache."</b>
<P>

Thus by September 1996 Dr Seaton was reporting on a person, who was able to
manage physical activities, notwithstanding the pain
of which she
complained.
<P>

85   	She complained to Dr Seaton about lower back pain with
spasm in the muscles basically on the right side of her back and down
the right
leg in the form of sciatica and instability in the left ankle.
<P>

86   	Dr Seaton formed the view that "this woman is still a back
cripple and always will be".  He said he would comment further
on that when he
had seen the MRI examination "but it would appear to me that she has more than
one disc injury in her back as a result
of the accident on 5 May 1992".
<P>

87   	He noted instability in the left ankle, and he formed the
view that her expenses were going to be "great in the future, although
she does
not take medication".  He was of the opinion that her outlook was poor and that
she would not be able to work again to her
full potential because of the fact
that she fell in May 1992.  He considered that if she was to continue to
advance in her field
of pollution prevention, she would require domestic
assistance in the home.
<P>

88   	At p.131 Dr Seaton gave a further report in which he dealt
with the accident at Tenterfield.  He said that the plaintiff gave
a history of
having tripped on uneven ground and her left ankle gave way causing her to land
on her right wrist and break it.  Mr
Stitt was critical of this history in the
light of the plaintiff's evidence that the left ankle gave way, although I do
not think
this criticism is justified.  Dr Seaton concluded that "all her
injuries that she has sustained are a direct result of the fall that
occurred
when she was on artificial grass when she tripped on a stair when visiting a
naval craft".  He added that "quite definitely
the injury to the right wrist,
which is a very severe one, is directly related to the injury that occurred on
the naval ship ..".
<P>

89   	The plaintiff's case was supported by the evidence of her
son Benjamin and Shana Bellin, whose witness statements appear at
pp.370 and
372 respectively of Exhibit E.  Neither was required for cross-examination.  I
should also mention that the only doctor
required for cross-examination was Dr
Matheson.
<P>

90   	Her son stated that he recalled his parents returning home
on the night of the accident and several incidents when she appeared
to suffer
substantial pain.  In paragraphs 7 and 8 he said:-
<P>

<b>"7.	Since the accident my mother has been more emotional, more emotionally
unwell and physically unwell.  I have observed her reach
for something and then
shout out in pain.  I have observed her driving the car and complained of pain.
She does not cook as much
now either.  Mum requires a lot more assistance and I
assist her, as do other people.  I have been asked to carry things for her,
bend over and pick up things, carry her suitcase, carry the filtered water
bottles, and reach things in the frig for her.  I have
observed my mother on
the floor screaming in pain in my brother's room with a bag of frozen peas
behind her back.  I also recall
her not being able to attend a school event and
she was shaking and looked in pain.  Recently my mother came to pick up my
brother
from my father's house.  My mother broke down in terrible pain at that
time.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	Mum appears a lot more stressed and anxious as a result of the
accidents.  She doesn't play tennis, she still swims, and has
put on a lot more
weight.  I have observed Mum's ankle give way at a church service and walking
down the sidewalk.  She's very careful
and has grabbed me due to the
instability of her ankle.  My mother is home a lot more than she used to be.  I
am with her three to
four days a week at her home."</b>
<P>

91   	Ms Bellin stated that she has known the plaintiff since
1988.  She observed the plaintiff both before and after the accident,
and has
seen, since May 1992, the plaintiff "in excruciating pain and crying on
occasions".  She said that she noticed the plaintiff
was transformed "from a
young, fit and active person to a person who moves slowly, gained weight and
had different colouring.  She
does not look well".
<P>

92   	She has seen the plaintiff in extreme pain, crying and
appearing to be unable to move.  She concluded:-
<P>

<b>"I have also observed that Fiona is more unhappy since the accident.  When
she is emotional, she does not seem to have the resources
to handle it and
breaks down a lot more than she used to.  I recall on one occasion Fiona
attended the course I held and I noticed
she was in pain.  She was limping.  I
asked her, `What is wrong?'  She said to me `I've fallen on an aircraft carrier
and injured
myself'.  She could barely talk without crying from the pain on
this occasion."</b>
<P>

93   	The plaintiff also makes a claim for a psychiatric injury.
Initially this was not pursued, but towards the end of his submissions
Mr
Branson said that having noticed what was said by Dr Strum, he withdrew the
concession that she did not claim to have a recognisable
and defined
psychiatric injury. 
<P>

94   	Originally the plaintiff was seen by Dr Dent.  It was not
pursuant to anything Dr Dent assessed that led to the change in
the attitude to
the case.  Dr Strum, in his report of 26 August 1999, said:-
<P>

<b>"At the time of interview Mrs Mathews said that she continued to be anxious
but she was optimistic and motivated.  Her main worry
was having another fall
and re-injuring her arm.  Her appetite and sleep were intact although, at
times, pain in her hand would disturb
her sleep.  Her sexual drive had
improved.  She said that her anxiety and depression depended on her physical
state of well-being.
 There were no nightmares, flashes or panic attacks.  She
was mixing well with people."</b>
<P>

95   	Towards the end of his report Dr Strum referred to various
stressors in the plaintiff's life and, at p.9, continued:-
<P>

<b>"Mrs Mathews first developed psychiatric symptoms in 1992 and has
experienced bouts of similar symptoms ever since.  The symptoms
she described
are those of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Depressed Mood
(DSM-IV-309.28).  The symptoms have fluctuated.  There
have been appetite and
sleep disturbances.  At times she over eats and at times she suffers from
anorexia.  Her insomnia and early
morning wakening is caused by anxiety as well
as pain.  There have been suicidal thoughts at times.  Her motivation,
depressed mood
and libido has tended to fluctuate.  Mrs Mathews symptoms are,
at times, severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of Major Depression
(DSM-IV-296.3).  However a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and
Depressed Mood (DSM-IV-309.28) seems preferable because
her symptoms are
related to pain and disability."</b>
<P>

96   	Dr Strum expressed the view that the plaintiff had gone
from being a competent person, working in a high pressure job, to
only being
able to do part-time work, and stated that her illness "is now intermittent".
It does not appear that he was aware that
she had agreed to part time work at
Memtec from 1 January 1992, nor that she did not intend to return to full time
work until either
2000 or 2005.   He thought there would be further episodes
and the prognosis was guarded.  He did not expect a complete recovery
even with
medication, coping strategies and meditation.
<P>

97   	The plaintiff was examined by a psychiatrist, Dr Champion,
on behalf of the defendant.  Dr Champion said that the plaintiff
gave no
history to suggest that her claimed pain and suffering and disability had
produced psychological distress or psychiatric
disorder and there was no
history of her having received treatment in this regard.  He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"From a psychiatric viewpoint therefore, currently there is no indication of
psychiatric disorder.  There is no history of psychiatric
disorder prior to or
following the injury and she has not received treatment for any form of
psychiatric disorder.  Her activities
and range of interests, as well as her
presentation are consistent with the view that Ms Mathews does not suffer with
any psychiatric
disorder."</b>
<P>

98   	Dr Dent's report is helpful in that he seems to identify
that the plaintiff received treatment from Ms Key after the accident.
At p.5 of
his report, Dr Dent said that the plaintiff had suffered no depression since
she had learnt to meditate as a coping mechanism
"and has used this for a very
long time".  As best as I understand the balance of his report he does not
identify any recognisable
psychiatric illness.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

99   	The first conclusion to which I have come is that the
plaintiff is a very poor historian.  She was clearly incorrect in her
evidence
that she met the greeting line prior to her accident.  She did not reveal to a
number of doctors that she had any problem
with her back prior to the incident
of 2 May 1992.  She did not reveal to Dr Seaton that by the time of the
accident she was only
working one day per week.  She did not reveal that after
being treated by Ms Key until mid-1995 she had been asymptomatic.  In addition
to her problems so far as the history is concerned I formed the clear
impression that the plaintiff was seeking to avoid answering
questions in
cross-examination about any back problem prior to the accident of May 1992 in
so far as it related to her low back.
<P>

100   	When all these matters are put together I have great
difficulty in accepting her subjective evidence of pain and, therefore,
in
assessing the extent to which the plaintiff aggravated or exacerbated her
undoubtedly existing back condition as a result of the
fall.  This is made the
harder when it is borne in mind that she was seeing Mr Bablis for treatment to
her back in February 1992.
<P>

101   	I think it is necessary to make the finding, which I am
satisfied should be made, that the plaintiff's evidence was unsatisfactory
in
relation to any problems from which she is suffering with her back and, in so
far as she sought to avoid questions in cross-examination
as to the extent of
her previous problems, I do not consider that she was being truthful.  Further,
there is the evidence of Ms Key
of the lack of symptoms until 1995, and there
is the evidence of numerous trips overseas, which are hardly consistent with a
person
suffering to the extent which the plaintiff maintained.  There is also
the evidence of Dr Garrick that the back pain had substantially
subsided by
October 1992.
<P>

102   	I think I should say a little more about the report from
Ms Key.  It was not raised until late in Mr Stitt's address.  Mr
Branson did
not refer to it until the conclusion of his address, when I invited his
comments on it.  He said it was a report he would
like to withdraw, although he
did not seek leave to do so. There were agreed out-of-pocket expenses to the
date of trial and, in
the submissions made there is a claim for $1,764 for
"Edgecliff Physiotherapy".  Ms Key operated under the name of Edgecliff
Physiotherapy
Sports &amp; Spinal Centre.  When I add that matter to other
matters, such as the plaintiff's reference to her, to Dr Garrick's having
sent
a copy of his report to her, and to the history she gave Dr Dent, I am
satisfied that Ms Key treated the plaintiff after the
incident in May 1992.  I
am also satisfied by Dr Garrick's report that by October 1992 that treatment
had been essentially successful.
 Thereafter, according to Ms Key, the back
remained asymptomatic until mid-1995 after the lengthy trip overseas, it being
conceded
by Mr Branson that the trip commencing on 4 June 1995 was the trip
undertaken before the plaintiff again saw Ms Key.
<P>

103   	It seems to me that the proper inference to draw from the
evidence is that the fall did cause an exacerbation or aggravation
of the
pre-existing spinal problems; that this necessitated extensive treatment from
Ms Key; but that there was a very substantial
recovery from the aggravation or
exacerbation by October 1992. 
<P>

104   	In all the circumstances I am not able to relate the
problems for which she consulted Ms Key in mid-1995 to the aggravation
or
exacerbation of the original injury.  That, in my opinion, was spent.  The
plaintiff has not satisfied me that the problems in
1995 were the consequence
of the accident on 2 May 1992 rather than the pre-existing condition. In the
result, I am of the opinion
that such pain and suffering as should be
attributed to the aggravation and exacerbation should be for a closed period to
October
1992.
<P>

105   	The next matter to which consideration has to be given is
the fracture to the right wrist.  There is no doubt that prior
to the incident
of 2 May 1992 the plaintiff had no problem with her left ankle.  The medical
evidence is that the sprain of that
ankle led to its becoming weaker and liable
to "give", and supports the view that there is a causal relationship between
her weakened
left ankle and her fall in the forest.  I have noted Mr Stitt's
criticism of the history, although in this regard I do not think
that is
justified.  The evidence of a causal connection is also supported by Dr Waller
and Dr Harper.
<P>

106   	In the result the injury to the plaintiff's right wrist,
with the consequences that imposed, are causally related to the
accident.
<P>

<b>Damages For Pain And Suffering</b>
<P>

107   	So far as pain and suffering are concerned, I am of the
view that the appropriate amount to award the plaintiff both in respect
of the
closed period for her back and for her wrist is $40,000.  As the period in
respect of the back is a closed one, and as she
did not injure her wrist until
August 1997, that being the major component of her pain and suffering, I should
attribute one third
to the past or, to round the figure off, $14,000, and two
thirds, namely $26,000, to the future.  Interest on $14,000 at 2 per centum
per
annum for 7.5 years is $2,100, making the total award for general damages
$42,100.
<P>

108   	It is to be noted that the plaintiff's claim for
out-of-pocket expenses has been agreed, on the basis that if I find that
only
her back, neck, ankle "etc" were involved, at $2,290, to which sum, if I find
that her wrist is attributable to the accident,
is to be added the sum of
$6,215.  Therefore the out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $8,505.  The
evidence does not establish the
components of these figures, but figures are
set out in the written submissions, which particularise the past out-of-pocket
expenses
at $8,694.20 "together with any amounts payable to the Health
Insurance Commission".
<P>

109   	The plaintiff has made a claim for future out-of-pocket
expenses of $71,063.31 plus future surgery costs.  The claim proceeds
upon the
basis of 15 sessions of physiotherapy per annum at $50 per session; 18 sessions
of remedial massage at $80 per session;
2 consultations with a general
practitioner per annum of $1,592.70; 2 consultations per annum with a
specialist of $6,887.38; and
various other expenses such as a psychologist for
18 months at $100 per fortnight.  Whilst there is an evidentiary basis for most
of these expenses, they appear to relate to the back for which I do not think
she is entitled to further compensation.   
<P>

110   	It appears that the plaintiff will need further treatment
in respect of her wrist, at least to remove the plate, but in the
absence of
evidence as to the possible cost, it is very difficult to award her any amount.
However, and perhaps I will be criticised
for being speculative, I propose to
allow $1,500 for the procedure as a future out-of-pocket expense.
<P>

111   	So far as past out-of-pocket expenses are concerned the
submission is that the plaintiff has paid $4,778.85 and claims interest
on that
amount at 8 per centum per annum for 7.5 years, which amounts to $2,871.  I am
prepared to allow that amount, although there
is a discrepancy between the
total amount claimed in the submissions and the agreed figure of $8,505.
However, in the overall context
of this verdict, I do not think that is a
matter about which I should be concerned further.  Accordingly, for past and
present out-of-pocket
expenses I allow $8,505, $1,500 and interest of $2,871, a
total of $12,876.
<P>

<b>Past Economic Loss And Future Loss Of Earning Capacity</b>
<P>

112   	In relation to past economic loss and future loss of
earning capacity the plaintiff's case suffers, in my opinion, from deficiencies
of evidence, notwithstanding that she carries the onus of proof.  I have
pointed out that at Memtec the plaintiff was earning, at
the date of the
accident, $10,000 per annum gross and, from about August 1993, $10,400 per
annum gross.  The plaintiff has given
no evidence that she lost work in
consequence of the accident and, if she did, the amount of salary she was not
paid.  Indeed within
a month of the accident she was away for 24 days on a
business trip, and, thereafter, made the business trips to which I have
referred.
 Further, the plaintiff has given little evidence that she was
precluded from undertaking private work as a consequence of the accident.
 In
so far as she has referred to difficulties, she has not identified any work she
did not undertake or any earnings she has lost
because of her alleged back or
wrist problems or, indeed, at all.
<P>

<b>Past Wage Loss</b>
<P>

113   	Normally, in respect of past wage loss there is evidence
of the amount the plaintiff was earning prior to the accident, the
period for
which she was not earning as a consequence of the accident and an assessment,
based on those matters, of the loss suffered
to the date of trial.  In the case
of an employee it is generally not a difficult task.  In the case of a
self-employed person it
can be proved by a comparison of pre and post accident
earnings.  In the present case it is known that the plaintiff had agreed to
work one day per week for Memtec for $10,000 per annum together with some
fringe benefits.  The plaintiff had previously been employed
on a full time
basis on the terms to which I have referred.  The plaintiff said that after her
injury the chairman of Memtec was
supportive and understanding and tried to
accommodate her disability.  She has given no evidence of the period she was
absent from
her employment.  Rather, her evidence is that she travelled
overseas in the course of her employment for 24 days from 3 June 1992.
 Prima
facie, and I say that because there is no evidence to otherwise explain the
matter, that would account for 24 of the 52 days
per annum she was to work for
Memtec.
<P>

114   	She made no further reference to her employment until
paragraph 43 of her statement, in which she stated that in 1997 she
resigned
from Memtec for the reasons to which I have referred.
<P>

115   	She gave no evidence that she agreed to work for only one
day for Memtec so that she could undertake other employment, nor
did she give
any evidence as to any other employment she undertook and, in paragraph 62, she
has stated that since resigning from
Memtec she has been involved in a variety
of projects, a number of which have been performed on a voluntary basis.  She
continued:-
<P>

<b>"At present I am not employed on a full-time basis and work on a part-time
basis as a freelance adviser to a variety of companies.
 I have difficulties in
undertaking my day to day employment due to my pain and my inability to commute
to attending at certain events
as I am unable to judge at what time I will
suffer from pain and disability.  Although I am confident that I will be in a
position
to continue to work on a part-time basis, I am certainly not able to
return to employment on a full-time basis due to the pain and
disability which
I suffer."</b>
<P>

116   	She stated that it had been her intention to work on a
full time basis until she was 65 years of age and to re-commence "full
time
employment in 2000 once both my sons had completed their schooling".  Her
history to her accountant was that she may not have
done so until 2005.
<P>

117   	There is no evidence as to what was involved in the
business trips commencing on 10 June 1993, 1 June 1994, 4 June 1995 and
20 June
1997.  The plaintiff has sought to erect a case for past economic loss and
future loss of earning capacity on the basis of
a report from accountants,
Dolman Bateman &amp; Co Pty Limited. 
<P>

118   	After a general introductory comment the author dealt
with the plaintiff's pre-accident capacity, noting that the plaintiff
had
advised that she worked very long hours as a public relations officer and as
the President of National Greenhouse Action Australia,
and that her commitments
involved a lot of travel, both locally between her home and Windsor and
overseas.  The author then turned
to post-accident capacity and stated that as
a result of her disabilities the plaintiff has reduced her working hours
considerably.
 The report continued:-
<P>

<b>"She is currently trying to establish her own consultancy, specialising in
international and industrial media relations and lobbying
with an emphasis on
environmental policies and issues.  She has advised that she can cope with
intermittent work as she can rest
periodically.  Due to the spasmodic nature of
her health and back pain, she now lacks the confidence to commit and perform on
certain
projects.  She now finds travelling, whether by car or any other mode
of transport, very painful."</b>
<P>

119   	Whilst these may be the complaints the plaintiff made, I
am not satisfied that any pain in her back referable to the accident
continued
after October 1992.  In any event, and more relevantly for present purposes,
the plaintiff gave no evidence of work she
did not undertake.  Nor, at an
evidentiary level, was an attempt made to erect any specific case for past wage
loss on that basis.
<P>

120   	In relation to her ability to drive she said, Tp.29, that
she does drive, and she drives normally unless she is having "an
acute phase":
Tp.30.  She said she has a Volvo motor car which she drives every day without
any difficulty.  This would seem to negate
her history that she finds
travelling by car very painful, and her frequent trips overseas for lengthy
periods would seem to negate
the suggestion that she finds travelling "very
painful".
<P>

121   	The report then goes on to deal with past economic loss
from 2 May 1992 to 31 October 1997, which is calculated at $126,657.
 A
subsequent report to 1 September 1999 updates the figure to $172,133.  It is
stated that the plaintiff's post-accident restrictions,
which have impacted
directly on her income, "allegedly involve" that she finds it difficult to
travel; that she advised that she
feels unreliable and is not always able to
work as a result of her pain and needs to rest periodically; and that she has
lost the
confidence to be able to commit to some projects.
<P>

122   	The method of calculation of past economic loss is by
taking probable earnings, as calculated at pp.8 to 12, of $233,045,
deducting
therefrom actual earnings of $106,388, as calculated at pp.13 to 14 and coming
up with the first loss figure to which I
have referred.
<P>

123   	The schedule of probable earnings commences by taking net
earnings of $655 weekly with Memtec.  However, it is noted that
during the 1992
financial year she reduced her work hours and that she had advised that she
planned to work one to two days per week
for Memtec and two to three days in
similar employment, reverting back to full time employment when her children
were older "possibly
around 2005".  Reference is then made to the fringe
benefits of a motor vehicle, and home and mobile telephones from Memtec.  There
was no evidence of what she expected to earn from her employment other than
with Memtec.
<P>

124   	She commenced working for Memtec on 2 April 1990 and,
from then to 30 June 1990, she received a gross salary of $12,671.54
on which
she paid tax of $4,359.70.  This, according to her income tax return, was her
only income.  In the following financial year,
i.e. the financial year ended 30
June 1991, her income tax return shows gross earnings from Memtec of $46,295.24
on which she paid
income tax of $14,640.52.
<P>

125   	For the financial year ended 30 June 1992, which was the
year in which she reduced the amount of her income by the variation
to her
contract and also suffered the injury, her only income was from Memtec, as
disclosed by the income tax return in evidence.
 Her gross income was
$31,741.48 on which she paid tax of $9,261.
<P>

126   	In the next financial year her only disclosed income was
from Memtec, the gross amount being $10,000 on which she paid $990.34
by way of
tax.  This was the figure she had agreed to receive pursuant to the variation.
In the financial year ended 30 June 1994
her only disclosed income was from
Memtec, the gross amount being $11,379 on which she paid tax of $1,389.90.  
<P>

127   	The next income tax return is for the year ended 30 June
1996 in which year she received a gross amount from Memtec of $11,409.
 She
also received interest of $832, a net capital gain of $1,909 and a small share
dividend, giving a total assessable income of
$14,743 on which she paid tax of
$1,275.19.
<P>

128   	By letter dated 14 October 1997 Memtec provided
information as to the amount paid to the plaintiff for her mobile and home
telephones and, on 3 September 1998, the successor of Memtec set out the
amounts paid to her on a gross and net basis.  The amounts
for 1995 and 1997
were, gross, $12,838.52 and $14,642, and net $11,427 and $13,223.  The car
value for each year, save for 1997,
was shown, and it was stated that an 8%
superannuation contribution, calculated on gross, was made on the plaintiff's
behalf throughout
her employment.
<P>

129   	In my opinion, before the Court could award any further
amount for the plaintiff's past loss of earnings, it would be necessary
for her
to prove what attempts she had made to obtain other work and her inability, in
consequence of the injuries resulting from
the accident, to undertake such
work.  The plaintiff proffered no evidence in support of these matters, which
would allow any calculation
to be made, and there is no evidence of what moneys
she has earned "on a part time basis as a freelance adviser to a variety of
companies",
save for the financial year ended 30 June 1999.  There is no
evidence at all as to her earnings for the financial year ended 30 June
1998.
The accountant's report for the financial year ended 30 June 1999 states that
she earned $24,268 gross, of which $18,000 came
from Memtec's successor, and
$19,638 net.  She gave no evidence that she refused any work for that period
and, as I have said, her
evidence is that she did not intend, at least until
the year 2000, to return to full time employment.
<P>

130   	In these circumstances the plaintiff has completely
failed to satisfy me that she has lost any income.  There is no evidence
that
whilst she was employed by Memtec she lost any of the income for which she had
contracted, in which I include the benefits for
car and telephone.  In these
circumstances, I do not consider that she is entitled to any amount for past
economic loss.  Similarly,
so far as superannuation is concerned there is no
suggestion that the plaintiff was not paid the amount of superannuation to
which
she was entitled or that it was not credited to an account for her
benefit.  The assumption the accountant made in respect of superannuation
seems
to be that she would be entitled to it working on a free-lance or part time
basis.  This assumption has not been established.
<P>

<b>Loss Of Future Earning Capacity</b>
<P>

131   	So far as loss of future earning capacity is concerned
the report stated that there had been a valuation of the current uninjured,
undiminished net weekly earnings on the assumption that the current total loss
of capacity is entirely due to the disabilities suffered
in the accident.  It
continued:-
<P>

<b>"If, however, it is considered by the Court that there is a residual earning
capacity, our calculations would need to be adjusted
to the extent of this
capacity and this is not a matter which we can address in our report."</b>
<P>

It was then noted that the plaintiff had, at the date of the accident, intended
to revert to full time employment in about the year
2005, which would tend to
indicate that she was going to accept far less employment in the intervening
period.  The report stated:-
<P>

<b>"Thus, the current loss which is based on probable earnings of four days
work per week only applies to 31/12/2004.  As from 01/01/2005,
the future loss
should be based on probable earnings of five days work per week."</b>
<P>

132   	The first calculation carried out is for the period 1
November 1997 to 31 December 2004, it being stated that the plaintiff's
current
net weekly loss is $854.  This is said to be based on probable earnings of a
salary of $807 per week, which is an indexed
amount commencing with $721 per
week, as I understand it, for the period 2 May 1992 to 30 June 1992.
Thereafter the figure is indexed
each year to reach the figure of $807 per
week.  In my view, and with great respect to the author of the report, this is
a fanciful
way of seeking to assess the income.  It is fanciful, because there
was no evidence that this is the amount the plaintiff would have
been earning,
or would have continued to earn.  This figure could only be justified, if at
all, if she had not varied her contract
with Memtec, or if she proved what she
could have earned.  The same exercise is then carried through for the balance
of the plaintiff's
assumed working life.
<P>

133   	Before one comes to deal with the vicissitudes, it is
necessary to look at the realities.  The plaintiff has only proved
that she
received certain amounts from Memtec, save to the extent I have noted.  She has
not proved that she received any other amounts,
nor has she proved that she
received any income for the 1998 financial year, nor has she proved what work
opportunities are available
in her field and the amount she might expect to be
remunerated in respect of them.
<P>

134   	The accountant then took the figures to 1 September 1999
for past economic loss and calculated $172,133 and re-calculated
loss of
earning capacity at $379,615.  These figures are also, in my opinion, infected
with the same error as the previously calculated
figures.  Whilst the
plaintiff's written submissions maintained these to be the figures for loss of
future earning capacity Mr Branson,
in his final submissions, submitted that
the plaintiff's loss was $640 per week, but that one should allow $300 net per
week and
apply 25% for vicissitudes on the basis of his concession that the
plaintiff had "a significant pre-existing disability, but one
which had not
been productive of loss of earning capacity".
<P>

135   	I regret that I cannot give effect to these figures for
the plaintiff's loss of earning capacity.  I cannot do so because,
in my
opinion, the plaintiff has simply failed to prove the relevant amounts. She has
failed to prove what amount, uninjured, she
would have earned.
<P>

136   	The preponderance of the evidence, and the evidence which
I accept, is that the plaintiff will be able to obtain employment.
 The
evidence of Professor Jones, Dr Davis and Dr Morris supports this and is in
accordance with the probabilities and Mr Branson's
concession to which I have
just referred.  Indeed, for all I know, the plaintiff is now deriving income
from employment, which is
consistent with her earnings for the last financial
year.  She certainly did not say she was not, and her evidence was that she was
doing certain work on a part time basis.  Her evidence was, further, that she
intended to return to work on a full time basis either,
if one accepts her
witness statement, in 2000, or if one accepts what she apparently told the
accountants, in the year 2005.
<P>

137   	For all these reasons it seems to me that the Court
cannot simply speculate as to an amount the plaintiff may have lost.
 She has
simply failed to prove the amount she has lost.  All I can say for certain is
that she has been earning certain amounts.
However, I cannot take these
amounts, having regard to the circumstances in which she ceased her employment
with Memtec, as the upper
limit of her future earning capacity and, even if I
could, I would still have to know what amount should be deducted from it to
reach
her real loss, i.e. the expenses she would incur in carrying on her own
business.
<P>

138   	The plaintiff, I think, in the circumstances of this
case, is entitled to some amount as a buffer against any future downturn
in her
employment by virtue of her wrist injury and for the period she will be unable
to work when she has the further operation.
 However, in my view, this should
be a small amount, which I assess at $60 per week which, on the 3% Tables for
fifteen years, is
$37,932.  Whilst Mr Branson conceded that the amount for loss
of future earnings had to be reduced by 25 per cent to take account
of the
vicissitudes obtaining in this case, that was not in the context of a "buffer"
amount, to which I propose to apply the usual
rate of 15 per cent.    The
amount I award for loss of future earning capacity is, accordingly, $37,932
reduced by 15 per cent, i.e.
$32,242.20.
<P>

<b>The Griffiths v Kerkemeyer Claim</b>
<P>

139   	The plaintiff claims damages pursuant to the principles
in <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 161.</a>  The first basis upon
which the claim is made is care to the date of the hearing, being for domestic
care of six hours per week from
2 May 1992 to the date of trial at $19 per
hour.  The difficulty I have with this claim is that it assumes that for the
total period
the plaintiff was entitled to that degree of care.  The claim is
made, essentially, in relation to her back injury.  As I have found
I am
satisfied that that, in so far as it was a matter for which the defendant was
responsible, had resolved by October 1992, a period
of approximately 184 days
from which, in my opinion, one would have to deduct the 24 days that the
plaintiff was away on business.
 I would, accordingly, allow 160 days, or 23
weeks, there being some evidence sufficient to satisfy me that during that
period the
plaintiff was in receipt of assistance for which such a claim would
run.
<P>

140   	So far as the wrist is concerned it is very difficult to
come to any real view on this matter because nothing is suggested
as to the
time involved in that particular operation and the recovery from it.  The
evidence of Dr Waller is that the plaintiff underwent
an open reduction and
internal fixation of the fracture of the right radius on 25 August 1997.  She
was reviewed on 4 September 1997
when the plaster and the sutures were removed
and thereafter she underwent physiotherapy.  She was reviewed again on 30
October 1997.
 Since then Dr Waller has not seen her in consultation, but he
understands that her left ankle is still causing some problems.
<P>

141   	Dr Waller said that the plaintiff may require further
treatment to her right wrist in the future, and that at some stage
she will
require removal of the fixation plate and screws.  I have dealt with this.  He
considered that she had lost 30 per cent
permanent loss of efficient use of the
right arm below the elbow.
<P>

142   	It would seem, at most, that the plaintiff required a
further 15 weeks when a <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> type claim could apply,
making a total of 38 weeks.  She has made a claim at the rate of 6 hours per
week which, for 38 weeks, amounts
to 228 hours at $19 per hour, which equals
$4,332.  It did not seem to be in issue that she was entitled to interest on
that amount
at the rate of 3%, although it would not be appropriate to allow
the full 7.5 years.  Doing the best I can I would allow interest
for 4 years,
which would amount to $520.  The total award under this heading is,
accordingly, $4,852.
<P>

143   	The plaintiff has not satisfied me that she is entitled
to any future amount under this heading.  Ms Henry has provided a
detailed
report, which seems to be directed mainly to the problem with her back.
However, she has not established any specific needs,
under this heading, for
damages referable to the wrist.
<P>

<b>Amounts</b>
<P>

144   	In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to recover the
following amounts:-
<P>

(a)	General damages					$  42,100 . 00
<P>

(b)	Out-of-pocket expenses				$  12,876 . 00
<P>

(c)	Loss of future earning capacity			$  34,242 . 20
<P>

(d)	<b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b>				<u>$    4,852 . 00</u>
<P>

								<u>$  94,070 . 20</u>
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

145   	I order:-
<P>

(a)	Judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of
$94,070.20.
<P>

(b)	If the parties wish to address me on costs I shall hear submissions.

<b>6/1999 - MATHEWS v THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	On or about 2 May 1992 the "USS Independence", ("the
vessel"), which was, at the time, probably the largest aircraft carrier
in the
world and which was owned by the defendant, The United States Department of
Defence, for which Mr R.R. Stitt of Queen's Counsel
and Mr G.M. Watson of
Counsel appeared, and a number of other United States Navy vessels, arrived in
Sydney Harbour.  The occasion
for the visit was the celebration of the 50th
Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the vessel moored at Garden
Island.
<P>

2   	On the evening of 2 May 1992 the defendant, or those for
whom it was responsible, arranged a cocktail party on the vessel to
which,
amongst a large number of others, the plaintiff, Ms Fiona Amanda Squire
Mathews, for whom Mr C.C. Branson of Queen's Counsel
and Mr J.T. De Berg of
Counsel appeared, and her then husband, Mr Elbert Lynn Mathews, were invited.
The reasonable inference is
that all guests were invited and, accordingly,
those, including the plaintiff and Mr Mathews, were boarding the vessel at the
defendant's
invitation.  So much was not in issue.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff and Mr Mathews travelled to the dock by car
and proceeded to board by ascending a gangway basically in single
file in a
line of guests.  The gangway ran parallel to the side of the vessel, to the
point where guests could obtain access to her.
 The plaintiff was walking in
front of Mr Mathews.
<P>

4   	There was a platform at the top of the gangway, which, on
the evidence I accept, was approximately several metres long and
slightly
shorter in width.  It was covered with a blue type of carpet and persons
boarding the vessel stepped from the gangway onto
the platform and then turned
left towards the vessel.  The platform was above deck level and to move from it
to the deck it was necessary
to cross the platform and step down from it to the
deck.  The portion of the deck to which people stepped may also have been
covered
with the same type of carpet.
<P>

5   	Although there was some dispute on the evidence, I am
satisfied that there was a line of naval and other dignitaries on the
deck, who
were greeting guests as they arrived.  The plaintiff has suggested, on several
occasions, that this greeting line was on
the platform.  I am satisfied that it
was not.  I am, however, satisfied that sailors from the vessel were on the
platform and on
the deck adjacent to it, and that part of their duties involved
assisting guests from the gangplank onto the platform and, more importantly
for
present purposes, from the platform to the deck.  This involved walking down
either one or, perhaps, two steps. There was no
handrail or handgrip of which
guests could take hold before stepping down from the platform to the deck.  Nor
was there any warning
that the step was there.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff stepped across the platform followed by Mr
Mathews, and her evidence in chief as to what then happened appears
in
paragraphs 22 and 23 of her witness statement of 4 November 1999, Exhibit
A:-
<P>

<b>"22.	Upon arrival at the ship I walked up the gangplank in front of my
husband.  There was a step from the gangplank to a platform.
 I stepped off the
gangplank onto the platform.  I was not assisted by anyone.  The platform was
covered in blue synthetic artificial
grass carpet.  From that platform I had to
step down to the next platform.  I led with my left foot down the step to the
next platform.
 I was not assisted.  As I did this my right shoe heel got
caught in the carpet on the top platform and I fell down.  I fell as I
had
already commenced stepping with my left foot down to the next level when my
right foot unexpectedly got caught.  This caused
me to lose my balance and I
fell on to the lower level falling forward on my knees and landing on my right
side.</b>
<P>

<b>  23.	The steps which I fell down were not fitted with any handrails, and
situated immediately to the side of the steps was a sailor,
however, I was not
provided with any assistance or offer of assistance from this officer."</b>
<P>

7   	In his witness statement of 10 November 1999, Exhibit B, Mr
Mathews described what happened in paragraphs 5, 7 and 8 thus:-
<P>

<b>"5.	At the top of the gangplank there was a platform which was covered in
blue grass matting.  There was an officer on my left on
the platform at the top
of the gangplank.  He was taking each guest's arms as they stepped off the
gangplank onto the platform. 
When Fiona stepped off the gangplank, she was not
assisted by the officer.  I observed him to be distracted.  He was talking to
another
officer.  He did not take Fiona's arm as she stepped off the gangplank
onto the platform.  Fiona took another step forward on the
platform and fell
forward.  I saw her heel had caught in the blue grass matting covering the
platform.  Fiona was near the edge of
the platform.  I lunged forward to try
and stop her falling forward.  The officer on my left noticed me lunging
forward and grabbed
me.  This stopped me catching Fiona.</b>
<P>

<b>  ...</b>
<P>

<b>  7.	Fiona fell forward onto her knees down the step from that platform onto
her right side.  The platform was not very wide until
reached the next level.
There was a line of officers on the deck.  In falling, Fiona fell onto and down
to the next level which was
also covered in blue grass carpet.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	There was no rail along the side of the blue grass carpet.  The
carpeted section was wider than the gangplank.  The steps off
the gangplank and
from one level of the platform to the next were steep.  Fiona fell to her
knees.  She tried to stand up and could
not initially.  I said to her, `What
happened?'  She said, `My heel caught'." </b>
<P>

8   	The basic facts asserted by the plaintiff and Mr Mathews
were not, essentially, in issue.  The defendant accepted that she
was walking
across the platform, which was covered with the blue carpet material; that Mr
Mathews was walking behind her; that the
heel of her right shoe caught in the
carpet as she was stepping forward to descend the step or steps from the
platform to the deck;
that that caused her to fall forward; that sailors on
duty to assist her descending did not do so; and that Mr Mathews was prevented
from further assisting her by the action of a sailor in stopping his forward
movement.  It was not in issue that there were no handrails
or supports
available at this point.  It was submitted by the defendant that reasonable
care did not require any for the purpose
of negotiating one step.  
<P>

9   	The issue is whether, in these circumstances, the defendant
was guilty of negligence.  The principal allegations of negligence
were that
the sailors, who were obviously on duty to assist guests move from the
gangplank to the platform and thence to the deck,
failed to initially assist
the plaintiff, as they did other guests, and, having failed in that way did not
observe the difficulty
she encountered  until it was too late to prevent or
check her fall; whether there should have been a handrail or support in
position;
and whether a warning should have been given.
<P>

10   	The defendant submitted that if, contrary to its primary
submission, it was found to have been negligent, the plaintiff was
guilty of
contributory negligence by allowing her heel to become caught in the carpet.
Although other allegations of contributory
negligence, including the
plaintiff's failure to seek assistance from the sailor on duty, were pleaded,
none were argued in final
submissions.
<P>

11   	The parties accepted that the question of negligence was
to be determined, in circumstances where the plaintiff was a lawful
entrant on
the vessel, by whether the defendant took reasonable care to avoid foreseeable
risk of injury to her: <b>Australian Safety Stores Pty Limited v Zaluzna</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a> and <b>Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern
Territory</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20192%20CLR%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 192 CLR 421.</a>
<P>

<b>Negligence</b>
<P>

12   	I have set out the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr
Mathews in chief on the issue of negligence.  The plaintiff was cross-examined
as to her recollection of events leading up to the accident, having said that
her witness statement was prepared with some care and
accurately set out the
way in which it occurred.  She said it was truthful and complete.  She was
cross-examined, commencing Tp.6,
about paragraph 22 and her recollection of the
events and, in particular, about some evidence she had given previously to the
effect
that the greeting line was on the platform rather than the deck.  In so
far as the plaintiff asserted that it was and that she met
various dignitaries
prior to the fall, I am satisfied that her evidence is not correct, and that
she did not reach the greeting line
before she fell.  This is consistent with
Mr Mathews' evidence, which was not challenged, and with other undisputed
evidence. However,
notwithstanding that view of her evidence, I am satisfied
that she fell in the way she described in paragraph 22 and no real challenge
was made to her evidence in that respect.
<P>

13   	Similarly, the evidence of Mr Mathews was not challenged
as to how the accident occurred.  Mr Mathews said, Tp.43, that there
were
"certainly sailors in parallel lines forming a corridor onto the main deck of
the ship extending beyond" the platform, although
he was not certain whether
the line came "right up to the platform".  His evidence was quite clear that
there was no greeting line
on the platform.
<P>

14   	I have outlined the principal way in which the plaintiff
puts her case on negligence.  Firstly, she asserted that the vessel's
personnel
should have assisted her and other guests from the gangplank to the platform
and from the platform to the deck, and that
this was particularly so as there
was no handrail.  Secondly, she submitted that such persons were in position to
assist and to guard
against the possibility of a guest's falling at this point
but that, at the time she fell, sufficient attention was not being paid
to her
and she was not, at any time, offered assistance.  Thirdly, it was submitted
that in so far as the seaman was distracted,
he was distracted from carrying
out the very function he was supposed to be performing, namely to give
assistance to guests moving
onto and off the platform, and that it was
negligent for him to be distracted.  Fourthly, it was submitted that the vessel
had ample
crew to provide sufficient personnel at this point, so that if one
member was "distracted" another could take over.
<P>

15   	The allegations of negligence have to be viewed against
the background of what was happening on the vessel on this evening.
 Guests,
presumably from all walks of life and of various ages and physical conditions,
had been invited to the cocktail party. 
It must have been clear to those in
charge of the vessel, and indeed so much was acknowledged by the presence of
the vessel's personnel
to assist them, that in some way or other a guest may
encounter difficulties in traversing the platform and stepping down to the
deck.  It was not necessary that those in charge should see the precise way in
which this may happen.  It was sufficient that in
a moving line of people, it
was reasonably foreseeable that a guest may trip, slip, lose his or her step or
in some other way become
unbalanced, perhaps because of the throng of people or
perhaps because of the general layout.  As I have said those in charge
recognised
the problem by placing personnel on duty to assist.  The plaintiff
did not receive assistance because the seaman was "distracted".
<P>

16   	In his statement of 1 November 1999 Lieutenant Commander
D.C. Rose, who was well qualified to give evidence on this matter,
said:-
<P>

<b>"In my experience, it is not usual to have a handrail for a step or steps
that are temporary for the duration of a ship's visit only.
 This was a special
occasion, however, where formality was paramount and it is not inconceivable
that, in such a ship with its almost
limitless resources and storage space, a
special set of steps with handrail would be used for the Admiral's guests.
However, assuming
this was not the case here and Mrs Mathews is correct, the
lack of handrail serves to emphasise the need for care in other ways in
bringing guests aboard."</b>
<P>

17   	Subsequently he said:-
<P>

<b>"Although a sailor or officer is said to have been posted on the top level
to the left side of the end of the gangplank, so as to
help guests negotiate
that initial step down from the gangplank, it appears that guests were left
then to negotiate the step down
to the next level without help or guarding.
The height of this step is unknown.  Assuming it is the same as that shown in
the video,
it is uncertain whether it is more than usual height.  The public
visitors boarding the ship appear to have no difficulty with it.</b>
<P>

<b>Nevertheless, given that the situation was unfamiliar to guests, and given
the possibility that the second step was of a different
height than that down
from the end of the gangway, I would expect a prudent officer responsible for
the safety of guests using the
gangplank and step to have stationed an
additional officer or sailor at the second level, so as to help guests,
especially ladies
attending a cocktail party, in formal wear and possibly with
high-heeled shoes, negotiate that second step down.</b>
<P>

<b>In this case, Mrs Mathews says there was an officer or sailor stationed at
the base of the step on the deck level.  Given that once
on the second or deck
level guests are said to have been required to turn left before stepping down
two more steps to a lower deck
level, that officer or sailor would appear
possibly to have been stationed too far away to be able to assist a guest in
negotiating
that second step or, more critically, to help catch or cushion a
falling guest.</b>
<P>

<b>In the light of the foregoing, assuming the arrangements were as stated, it
is my opinion that an officer or sailor stationed close
to the second step
would have been in a position enabling him more readily to steady Mrs Mathews
to prevent her falling or, failing
that, catch her sufficiently to save her
from falling heavily.  Further, in a general sense, it is my opinion that an
efficient and
responsible officer in charge of arrangements for bringing
civilian guests aboard should be expected to have foreseen the need for
special
care and to have stationed his helpers in such a way that accidents, such as
that suffered by Mrs Mathews, could not occur
or, at worst, would be less
serious than might otherwise have been."</b>
<P>

18   	For a number of reasons he specified, Lieutenant Commander
Rose concluded that it was opinion:-
<P>

<b>".. that the ship's responsible officer should have stationed a person in an
appropriate position close enough to actively assist
guests down that second
step and to make every effort, if they fell, to hold them up or cushion their
fall."</b>
<P>

His evidence was not challenged.
<P>

19   	The defendant relied on a statement of Lieutenant
Commander Richards, which is part of Exhibit 5.  He attended the cocktail
party
with his wife and, upon arriving at the top of the gangway, guests stepped from
it to a raised platform and, as he recalled
it, there were only two small steps
from the raised platform to the deck.  He continued, paragraphs 11 and 12:-
<P>

<b>"11.	I recall that a US Sailor was stationed on either side of the gangway
to assist guests from the gangway onto the raised platform
if such assistance
was required.  I can specifically recall my wife being assisted from the
gangway onto the raised platform.</b>
<P>

<b>  12.	The US Sailors stationed at the top of the gangway also provided
assistance to guests as they stepped from the raised platform
down the two
small steps to the deck of the USS Independence where the cocktail party was
being staged."</b>
<P>

The defendant's evidence thus corroborated the perceived need to have the
vessel's personnel available to assist guests.
<P>

20   	I am satisfied that had this task been performed properly
when the plaintiff fell, she would have received assistance either
before
falling or been restrained whilst falling, such as to have lessened, if not
prevented, her accident.  This was the very purpose
that the personnel were
stationed in that area and they failed to perform their task.
<P>

21   	Mr Stitt submitted that so far as the static condition of
the vessel was concerned none of the associated structures played
any causative
role in the plaintiff's falling and being injured.  There was no evidence that
the carpet was inappropriate for the
use to which it was being put, nor that it
was damaged or warn, and the submission continued that I would not find that
the mere
fact that the heel of the plaintiff's shoe caught was any evidence of
any static defect.  He continued that so far as the dynamics
were concerned I
should find that the plaintiff attended the vessel as part of a semi-public
function; that she gained access via
the gangplank and the platform; that there
was only one step down from the platform to the deck; and that she fell in
stepping from
the platform because she caught the heel of her shoe in the
carpet.  He submitted that parallel lines of sailors were on the deck
and there
were sailors on the platform, and that if this constituted "the dynamics",
there was no obligation or duty on the defendant
to instal a handrail when only
one step was involved, and no one needed to be placed to assist people down one
step.  He said the
fact that the person was so placed was a matter of
"courtesy" and not of duty.
<P>

22   	Mr Stitt submitted further that the seaman, who was
distracted, was only distracted momentarily as he was able to respond
to what
he thought was Mr Mathews' falling, and that it could not be suggested that
such a momentary lapse amounted to negligence.
<P>

23   	Obviously, there was no absolute duty on the defendant to
prevent injury to the plaintiff.  The duty was to take reasonable
care to avoid
foreseeable risk of injury to her.  The stationing of personnel on the platform
and on the deck to give assistance
to persons moving through that area and to
the deck showed that the defendant foresaw there was a risk of injury.  It had
not provided
a handrail to assist guests stepping from the platform to the
deck, but had provided the vessel's personnel to do so.  The distraction,
even
though it may only have been momentary, although there is no evidence that this
is so the evidence being that the distraction
had ended at the time Mr Mathews
commenced to fall, shows, in my opinion, that the personnel were not carrying
out their allotted
tasks in a proper manner, or that there were insufficient of
them to do so.  Their duty was to ensure that help was at hand for guests
thus
boarding the vessel and this was not fulfilled.
<P>

24   	In the circumstances, in my opinion, the defendant was
guilty of negligence.  I have noted that a pleaded allegation of contributory
negligence, which was not pursued, was the plaintiff's failure:-
<P>

<b>".. to make use of the assistance provided by the defendant to persons
boarding the vessel".</b>
<P>

25   	Mr Stitt submitted that if, contrary to his submissions on
negligence, I came to the view that there was negligence, the plaintiff
was
guilty of contributory negligence in that she allowed her heel to be caught in
the carpet and was not picking up her feet.  In
my view the defendant has not
established that this constituted contributory negligence.  Indeed, the fact
that her heel became caught
in the carpet would tend to indicate that there was
some defect in the carpet.  However, no complaint was made, in final
submissions,
by the defendant about the appropriateness of the plaintiff's
footwear and, in these circumstances, I do not consider that the defendant
has
established the only case of contributory negligence upon which it ultimately
relied.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	The Plaintiff's History And Complaints</b>
<P>

26   	The plaintiff was born on 11 August 1950 and, at the date
of the accident, was aged 41 years.  She is now aged 49 years. 
She married Mr
Mathews on 5 August 1978 and lived with him in various parts of the world as he
pursued his career as a banker.  Her
two sons were born on 19 March 1980 and 6
February 1982.
<P>

27   	In November 1983 the plaintiff moved with her family to
New York, as that was where Mr Mathews was posted and, in paragraph
12 of her
witness statement, she said that whilst in New York she felt stressed at being
isolated from friends and family "together
with the moving from country to
country (six residences in three years), quite stressful especially living in a
residential hotel".
<P>

28   	In February 1984 the plaintiff commenced to work for the
Australian Broadcasting Commission in New York and, upon returning
to Australia
in 1984, she resumed part-time casual work for that organisation in Sydney and
commenced trading as Fiona Mathews &amp;
Associates in 1986.  She said, in
paragraph 14, that this was a small public relations company, which was
retained by a number of
clients and, in 1988, there was a merger between it and
Playfair Pty Limited.  There was no evidence of the effect of that on her,
nor
that she received any payment in consequence of it or interest in Playfair Pty
Limited.
<P>

29   	In 1990 she was employed by Memtec Limited, ("Memtec"),
pursuant to a written Agreement dated 1 March 1990, as a public relations
manager for three years from 2 April 1990 to 1 April 1993, and she was required
to devote her full time and attention to her employment.
 She was to receive a
base gross salary of $45,000 per annum and, in addition,  membership of any
life assurance benefit plan and
of employees' stock purchase scheme, and the
benefits of any other scheme or plan available to all employees of Memtec.  She
was
to have the use of a Ford Falcon Sedan and Memtec agreed to reimburse her
for all its reasonable operating expenses.  She was to
receive reimbursement of
her telephone rental on a quarterly basis and a reasonable amount of the cost
of telephone calls, including
those on her mobile telephone, and annual
holidays and long service leave.
<P>

30   	Clause 7(a) provided that Memtec was entitled to terminate
the Agreement at any time prior to the expiration of the employment
period
without cause upon 60 days' written notice. 
<P>

31   	Memtec carried on its business at South Windsor and the
plaintiff lived at Randwick.  Thus it was necessary for her to drive
on most
working days from her home to South Windsor and back.
<P>

32   	On 1 January 1992 the plaintiff entered into a written
variation of that Agreement, whereby it was agreed:-
<P>

<b>"1.	The existing employment agreement period dated 1st March 1990 and
expiring on 1st April 1993 shall continue to operate except
for the following
variations:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	For the remainder of the employment period the employee shall work only
1 day per week for Memtec.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	During this shorter working period, Memtec shall pay to the employee a
base salary at the rate of ten thousand Australian dollars
(A$10,000) per
annum, payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices at Memtec but no
less frequently than in equal monthly
instalments."</b>
<P>

33   	At Tp.27 the plaintiff agreed there was such a variation,
and she continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. When did you cease working for Memtec on a one day per week
basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It was in 1996.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And since that time have you then only been employed on a casual
basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, as a consultant.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Only on a casual basis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

34   	There was also tendered an Employment Agreement as part of
Exhibit 5, which was undated and unsigned, but appears to have
been prepared in
August 1993, which provided that during the employment period, which was to
commence on 1 July 1993, the plaintiff
would be paid a salary of $10,400 per
annum.
<P>

35   	The plaintiff described her employment with Memtec, in
paragraph 15 of her witness statement, as being "their global Public
Relations
Executive", the general nature of the work undertaken by Memtec being to purify
city drinking water and sewerage.  She
said that major public relations events
were held in Australia, Europe, the United States and Japan.  She continued, in
paragraph
17,that in 1992 it became apparent that more of Memtec's focus would
be in the United States' markets, and that there was not the
potential that had
been hoped for in Australia.  She said:-
<P>

<b>"My work was scaled down to a part-time basis and I undertook a number of
other projects, independent of Memtec.  I continued to travel
for Memtec to do
public relations events overseas.  In 1995 we did a major event in Wales and in
the United Kingdom."</b>
<P>

The reasonable inference is that these circumstances led to the entry into the
Variation Agreement.  An extraordinary aspect of
this case is that there is no
evidence that the plaintiff earned any money, i.e. there is no evidence of any
remuneration received,
from 1991 other than from Memtec, save in the financial
year ended 30 June 1999, during which the plaintiff received most of her
income
from Memtec's successor.
<P>

36   	In paragraph 18 she said:-
<P>

<b>"For a number of years I was actively involved in social tennis and played
at least once, and sometimes twice a week.  I was also
a keen swimmer.  I was
residing with my family at home in Randwick and travelling to the offices of
Memtec at Windsor on a regular
basis.  In order to travel to Windsor I was
required to drive for a period of up to three hours per day and on occasions I
would
experience thoracic back pain for which I received massage.  The nature
of the back pain which I experienced was not in the same
location or intensity
as that which I now experience."</b>
<P>

37   	After describing the fall, the plaintiff said she was
driven by Mr Mathews to the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick where
x-rays
were taken of her left ankle and right leg and she was advised that she had
suffered a sprained left ankle.  She continued,
paragraph 28, that she left
hospital with crutches and that overnight and the next day there was an intense
pain in her right leg
and lower back.  She consulted her family doctor, Dr
Hameri, on 4 May 1992.  He referred her for an x-ray of her back and CT Scan
to
Dr Sheehy at St Vincent's Hospital, who recommended that she should have a
laminectomy to give relief to her pain.  She chose
to explore less intrusive
procedures first, such as intensive physiotherapy, traction, massage and
swimming, and she said:-
<P>

<b>"I found those few weeks quite shocking because the level of pain was
intense much of the time.  I went to Memtec when I was picked
up by car and
driven out with a colleague.  The chairman of Memtec was supportive and
understanding and tried to accommodate my disability.
 I was determined to get
better and try not to focus on the pain, and set milestones for me to achieve
and to keep my career path."</b>
<P>

It will be remembered, of course, that at this time she was only working one
day per week for Memtec.  She gave no evidence that
she did not receive her
full contractual entitlement from Memtec whilst she was injured.
<P>

38   	The plaintiff agreed that Exhibit 6 set forth her overseas
travel accurately.  On 3 June 1992 she travelled to Brazil, London,
New York,
Paris and London over a period of 24 days for business purposes.  She referred
to this trip in paragraph 29 of her witness
statement, it being to attend the
Earth Summit Conference on behalf of Memtec, and to assist on some research for
Beyond 2000.  She
said that whilst overseas she experienced significant back
and leg pain, although she attended to her duties "as best" she could.
 On one
occasion she had to rest for 24 hours.  She returned to Australia in June 1992
and was referred for treatment under the care
of Dr Hameri. 
<P>

39   	In her witness statement she set out various tests which
were carried out, but she said that the pain in her back, legs and
arm did not
cease and she sought physiotherapy, massage and acupuncture and consulted an
osteopath.  She was on a regime of medication
including Panadeine and Valium.
She continued that on a number of occasions her back pain became quite extreme
whilst attempting
to undertake ordinary daily activities, and that she had been
rendered physically incapable of coping with the pain and been forced
to seek
emergency medical treatment from hospitals, chiropractors and osteopaths. She
gave no details of these treatments. Mr Mathews
assisted her in dealing with
the pain, and although she received some short term relief, it generally
returned.  She said she was
unable to attend to her daily household duties and
was assisted by Mr Mathews, her son, Ben, and a part-time nanny. There is no
evidence
what she paid the part-time nanny. She became extremely frustrated
with the level pain and was "increasingly unable to cope with
the strains which
this was causing in my day-to-day life".  Her relationship with her husband
deteriorated further, there being evidence
that it had not been satisfactory
from at least 1986, and:-
<P>

<b>".. although we have had difficulties prior to this accident, I feel that
these have been significantly exacerbated by the injuries
I had
received."</b>
<P>

In the end, no submission was made that the accident in May 1992 contributed to
the eventual break-down of the marriage.
<P>

40   	She was not able to return to her pre-accident sporting
activities, but, by July 1995, she began to feel that her symptoms
were
improving and "although I was still suffering from back pain I felt that this
was being managed effectively".  This evidence
is at odds with a history she
gave a physiotherapist, Ms Key, in a report to which I will refer.
<P>

41   	From 10 June 1993 she was overseas for one month on
business and, commencing on 3 April 1994, she was in Indonesia on a holiday
for
seven days.  On 1 June 1994 she travelled to London, Paris, New York and
Washington for seven weeks on business and, on 4 June
1995, she travelled to
London, Cardiff, Paris, Toulouse, London and New York for five weeks on
business.  This was a significant
trip, because she said that whilst in New
York she developed substantial pain in her back and, in paragraph 38, she
continued:-
<P>

<b>"This setback provided me with additional stress and I was disillusioned
with the fact that I was again faced with a long period of
rehabilitation
before my symptoms would improve.  I was informed by Josephine Key
Physiotherapist that my back would require ongoing
maintenance."</b>
<P>

42   	On 16 August 1995 Ms Key wrote a report, Exhibit 5 p.79,
in which she stated:-
<P>

<b>"I have treated this lady some years ago for low back pain which radiated
down the front of the right thigh and caused marked muscle
weakness.  She
required extensive treatment at that stage, however she managed to avoid
surgery <u>has been asymptomatic until recently she has been on an overseas
trip</u>.  In June/July of this year she travelled overseas and during this
time complained of low back pain which radiated into her right
thigh and foot.
She also had pins and needles in her foot.</b>
<P>

<b>When I assessed her on 11.7.1995 my opinion was that she again required an
extensive course of treatment to ameliorate her presenting
symptoms.  As part
of this she would need to be prepared to carry out exercises at home to help
her progress."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

It was conceded by Mr Branson that the overseas trip, to which reference was
made, was that of five weeks commencing on 4 June 1995.
<P>

43   	There is no doubt that prior to 2 May 1992 the plaintiff
had suffered some degree of back pain.  Her case is that the fall
exaggerated
and exacerbated that condition.  Ms Key's report is not entirely clear, and the
plaintiff was not asked when she obtained
treatment initially from her.  It is
therefore not clear when she required extensive treatment and for how long she
had been asymptomatic.
 It is strange, if there was a problem resulting from
the accident in respect of which she was treated by Ms Key, that no reference
was made to this in the report, and the plaintiff gave no evidence that she was
treated by Ms Key after the accident and before July
1995, from which the
inference may be that she was treated by Ms Key prior to the accident.
However, in my opinion, when the whole
of the evidence is examined it becomes
plain enough that she was treated by Ms Key after the accident of 2 May 1992.
I shall seek
to explain why.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff stated, in paragraph 39 of her witness
statement, that she noticed that her left ankle appeared to be weak,
and that
it would, on occasions give way and she would fall, and that "throughout this
period" she had pain radiating down through
her buttocks into her right leg.
She separated from Mr Mathews in 1995, although it was not submitted that this
was caused by the
accident.  She said, in paragraph 43, that she resigned from
Memtec in 1997, as she felt she was not able to continue her duties
due to her
pain and disabilities "together with a general downturn in the work available",
and that in August 1997 she was providing
some advice to a Tenterfield Action
Group, and in the course of doing so was required to attend a meeting in the
Timbarra forest.
 Whilst walking in the forest, she felt her left ankle give
way and she fell forward landing heavily on her right wrist and hand.
 She
fractured her right wrist, which required surgery for internal fixation.  She
is dominantly right handed and now has lost sensation
in the middle finger of
her right hand.  She has a significant scar to her right wrist and hand.  She
has never regained full movement
in that wrist and continues to be troubled by
pain, particularly in cold weather.
<P>

45   	Dr Waller reported on 18 May 1998:-
<P>

<b>"She will never regain full function of the right wrist or hand.  She will
always have some restriction of movement of the right wrist.
 She has some
residual deformity of the right wrist as a result of her fracture.  <u>This
will be permanent</u>.  She will always have some weakness on the right forearm
and hand.  She will continue to have some restriction of movement of the
right
wrist."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

46   	The plaintiff complained that since the accident she has
continued to experience pain in her lower back, which has required
treatment at
times, although no evidence was given of the treatment she received or its
frequency or cost.  She also continues to
notice that her left ankle is not as
stable as previously.  She stated that "on an emotional level" she has
experienced difficulties
in not being able to do what she could before the
accident, and that in 1995 and 1997 she suffered exacerbations of her injuries
"including the fracture of my right wrist",  as a consequence of which she has
become depressed.  She continues to take medication
"intermittently" in an
attempt to control the pain.  No evidence was given of the extent of such
medication or its cost.  She continued
that before the accident she suffered
from stress, although she did not feel she was experiencing any symptoms in
early 1992, and
certainly the stress and back difficulties she had prior to her
accident in May 1992 "were nowhere near as severe as those which
I now
experience and continue to suffer since May 1992".  As I have noted this
complaint is not consistent with the complaint she
made to Ms Key in mid-1995.
Nor is it consistent with certain medical evidence.  She continues, she
asserted, to experience pain
in her back and difficulties with her right ankle
and is limited in the amount she is able to travel.  She cannot lift heavy
weights
and has difficulties in undertaking domestic duties, particularly
vacuuming and activities requiring flexion of her spine.  The pain
can become
so severe as to cause her to have headaches and she is troubled by the
deformity of her right wrist both as to its appearance
and functionality.  She
has put on weight because of her inability to exercise daily, and continues to
receive physiotherapy, massage,
chiropractic and other treatment from her
general practitioner. Once again no evidence was given of the specifics of this
treatment.
 She said that she would like to consider receiving some assistance
in dealing with the emotional aspects of her injuries and developing
further
mechanisms by which she is able to cope with the injury and the associated
disabilities.
<P>

47   	In paragraph 62 of her witness statement she said that she
resigned from her position at Memtec in 1997, and that since then
she has been
involved in a variety of projects, a number of which have been performed on a
voluntary basis.  She is not presently
employed on a full time basis, but works
on a part time basis as a free lance adviser to a variety of companies. She
gave little
evidence of her earnings from this part time employment. She has
difficulties in undertaking her day to day employment due to pain
and an
inability to commute and attend certain events, and:-
<P>

<b>"Although I am confident that I will be in a position to continue to work on
a part time basis, I am certainly not able to return
to employment on a full
time basis due to the pain and disability which I suffer.  It had been my
intention to continue working on
a full time basis until age 65."</b>
<P>

48   	She then said, in paragraph 63:-
<P>

<b>"It had been my intention to re-commence full time employment in 2000 once
both my sons had completed their schooling."</b>
<P>

She gave a history to her accountant that she did not intend to return to full
time employment until 2005.  She concluded that she
does not feel her injuries
would allow her to perform all her domestic duties, that she is assisted by her
children on a daily basis
"carrying items, picking up things, lifting and
reaching particularly high things together with other duties for approximately
seven
to eight hours per week", and that she "continues to suffer from pain in
her back, left and right leg, right wrist and radiating
pain".
<P>

49   	Exhibit 6 shows that commencing on 23 June 1996 the
plaintiff travelled to the United Kingdom for six weeks and, commencing
on 7
January 1997, to China for nine days for a holiday.  Commencing on 19 April
1997, she travelled to the United States for sixteen
days and, commencing on 20
June 1997, she travelled to the United States for a further sixteen days to
attend a convention/conference.
 Commencing on 14 December 1997, she travelled
to the United Kingdom and the United States for a one month holiday and,
commencing
on 2 November 1998, to Italy for a seventeen day holiday.  On 4
March 1999 she travelled to the United Kingdom for one month for
a holiday and,
on 21 May 1999, to the United States for fourteen days on business.  All these
travel arrangements involved her travelling
by aeroplane.
<P>

<b>(b) The Plaintiff's Cross-Examination</b>
<P>

50   	In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed that she made no
complaint of any pain to her back when she first went to hospital
on the
evening of 2 May 1992.
<P>

51   	She saw Dr Hameri on 4 May 1992 when she complained that
she fell on the vessel on 2 May, that she had sprained her left ankle,
which
was x-rayed and appeared to Dr Hameri to be "OK", and that she had right thigh
numbness.  Dr Hameri noted that she was to go
overseas in June 1992.
<P>

52   	Although there is no reference in his notes to a complaint
of back pain, which may seem strange, the plaintiff maintained
that she
mentioned that to Dr Hameri and, in his letter of 6 September 1995, Exhibit E
p.80, Dr Hameri stated that on 4 May 1992
the plaintiff complained to him of a
sprained left ankle, lower back pain, and numbness in the right thigh.  He
referred her for
a CT Scan and to Dr Seaton.  It is unlikely he would have
taken either course if there was no complaint of back pain.  The defendant's
submission, however, was that the complaints of pain were essentially
subjective, there being no objective evidence to support them,
and that I
should not accept the plaintiff's evidence about them.
<P>

53   	The defendant tendered all of Dr Hameri's notes, he having
treated her from about 15 January 1986.  These notes show difficulties
with the
marriage relating back to March 1986: see references to entries on 17 March
1986; 6 August 1986; 23 November 1988; and 20
June 1989.
<P>

54   	On 10 February 1992 Dr Hameri noted that the plaintiff was
suffering from lumbar pain and seeing a chiropractor, Mr Bablis.
<P>

55   	The plaintiff was cross-examined closely about the
treatment she was receiving from Mr Bablis, to whom she returned on 4 May
1992,
and she agreed that he had been treating her for a long time for thoracic back
pain.  She said that so far as she remembered
he never treated her for low back
pain and, Tp.20:-
<P>

<b>"Q. What is your recollection? Did he treat you for low back pain prior to 4
May 1992?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Just back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Low back pain?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I don't remember.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You don't remember.  Is that your answer, you don't remember?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, that's my answer."</b>
<P>

56   	She agreed she saw Dr Sheehy on 27 May 1992, and she said
that she told him she had back pain from all the driving she had
been doing
and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Did you not tell Dr Sheehy, on 27 May 1992, that you had low back pain
for years?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I may have, but ...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would that have been the truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I had back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would that have been the truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, look, I had upper back pain ..</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Please, would you ..</b>
<P>

<b>OBJECTION</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Would it have been the truth that you had told Dr Sheehy that you had low
back pain for years?</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: I allow that question.</b>
<P>

<b>A. No.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. The answer was no, was it not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

57   	At Tp.21 the plaintiff was further cross-examined about
what she told Dr Sheehy.  She said she did not know that she said
to him that
she had low back pain and added:-
<P>

<b>"I had general back pain for years."</b>
<P>

She continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. I am suggesting to you that you told him that you had low back pain for
years.  Now, do you say that you did say that or you didn't
say that?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I may have said that.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. You may have said that.  If you did say that, would it have been the
truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It would have been the truth in that the whole back was sore from
driving.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. No, please.  I am asking you a specific question about the history that
you gave him of low back pain for years.  Would that have
been the
truth?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. And did you, in truth, have low back pain for years prior to seeing Dr
Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. I had back pain.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Did you have back pain for years prior to seeing Dr Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Not acute back pain.  </b>
<P>

<b>Q. We will get to whether it is acute.  But did you have low back pain for
years prior to seeing Dr Sheehy?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Probably just from driving.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Probably just from driving?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes."</b>
<P>

58   	The plaintiff's evidence on this point was most
unsatisfactory both in its content and to my observation in the way in which
it
was given.  There can be no doubt on that evidence that she was complaining of
"general back pain for years" prior to 2 May 1992,
and that she conceded that
she had low back pain "probably just from driving" for years prior to seeing Dr
Sheehy.  It is also necessary
to note what Dr Michael Morris discerned from Dr
Sheehy's notes to which I shall refer.
<P>

59   	I have not the slightest doubt that the plaintiff suffered
from low back pain prior to the accident on 2 May 1992.  That degree
of
satisfaction is not reduced by Dr Sheehy's report of 28 May 1992 in which he
referred to a history of a recent attack "three weeks
ago of pain affecting the
right anterior thigh with radiation to and just below the knee".  He observed
that the lumbar CT Scan showed
a lateral stenotic process at the L3/4 level and
that the combination of disc and bony overgrowth contributed to the problem.
<P>

60   	The notes of Mr Bablis were tendered by the plaintiff and,
together with a transcription, became Exhibit G.  He appears to
have commenced
to treat her in September 1990 and, at Tpp.22-23:-
<P>

<b>"HIS HONOUR: Q.  Tell me this.  Where was the pain in respect of which you
consulted Mr Bablis?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It's generally in the thoracic area and it was in the low back.  It was
only occasionally when I had a long drive to Windsor and
back for a couple of
years, but I didn't go to Mr Branson - sorry, Mr Bablis ..</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: Don't worry.  I think that answers the question I asked.</b>
<P>

<b>WITNESS: It was not acute.</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: What was not acute the thoracic pain or the ...</b>
<P>

<b>A. The pain was not acute.  It was just to keep me well.  He was simply
someone who manipulated and massaged.</b>
<P>

<b>STITT: Q. He manipulated your lumbar spine on a number of occasions, your
low back spine, on a number of occasions, did he not?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, all my back.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. I am asking you about the lumbar?</b>
<P>

<b>A. The back, yes, the lumbar, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. On a number of occasions prior to May 1992?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes, only a number of occasions."</b>
<P>

61   	The plaintiff placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Sheehy
and Dr Garrick, who wrote a report on 28 October 1992, Exhibit
E pp.76-77, a
copy of which he sent to Dr Sheehy and Ms Key.  
<P>

62   	Dr Garrick reported that the plaintiff had a substantial
right L4 radiculopathy related to a lateral disc lesion resulting
from a fall
in May 1992.  He said she had a fairly protracted course of conservative
management with only partial resolution of discomfort,
and that some of the
delay in seeking more active treatment may have related to an incorrect report
that the CT Scan stated that
the L3/4 disc appeared normal.  He said that was
quite wrong as there was "a clear lateral disc bulge encroaching on the nerve
root".
<P>

63   	Dr Garrick said that the plaintiff was quite well until
the fall.  He referred to her overseas trip with which she coped "with
some
difficulty and needed acupuncture treatment while away".  He said that the
backache had substantially subsided, but there was
continuing buttock, knee and
anterior thigh pain, and intermittent paraesthesia over the lateral aspect of
the right leg and difficulty
with walking.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"General health has been relatively unremarkable.  She has a long history of
minor thoracic pain from late childhood.  NSAID treatment
for this produced a
duodenal ulcer.  She now tolerates Naprosin suppositories with Tagamet
cover."</b>
<P>

64   	Dr Garrick expressed the view that it was likely that her
fall produced disc rupture "in a previously normal back".  He thought
she was
wasting her time pursuing further conservative management and recommended a
lumbar myelography with post myelogram CT Scans
to outline the nerve root.  He
strongly considered surgical decompression.
<P>

65   	The fact that a copy of his letter was sent to Ms Key
provides some evidence that she had treated her in relation to the problems
she
experienced after the accident.  Probably it was this treatment, which caused
the backache to substantially subside by October
1992.
<P>

66   	The difficulty, and I say this with no disrespect to Dr
Garrick, is that he apparently received a history of a basically symptom
free
back prior to the accident.  He knew there was a long history of minor thoracic
pain, but he does not appear to have been aware
that the plaintiff had been
receiving treatment for back pain for some time prior to the accident.  
<P>

67   	The plaintiff saw Professor Jones on behalf of the
defendant on 11 February 1998.  He recorded that she stated that her back
and
left ankle were normal prior to May 1992 and, after tracing her history, he
referred to the history of accident and injuries.
 He recorded that "over the
last twelve months she has been satisfactory" subject to an exception, which he
stated.  He examined
her and noted a history of injuring her left ankle and
subsequently sustaining back pain with radiation into her right leg.  He was
of
the view, as at the date he examined her, that:-
<P>

<b>".. there is a mild back impairment on physical examination being about 10%
reduction in normal back function and otherwise her symptoms
are subjective.
No evidence of neurological impairment could be found and there was no
suggestion on clinical examination of nerve
root involvement causing muscle
weakness or loss of sensation.  The neurological examination of her lower limbs
was normal, there
was no loss of power and no loss of sensation.  It is my view
that Ms Mathews is independent in personal care and in the activities
of daily
living.  There have been many issues affecting her vocational status.  She is a
highly trained person in the media and in
advertising, and her career speaks
for itself."</b>
<P>

68   	Professor Jones expressed the view that:-
<P>

<b>"... she will ultimately succeed in her chosen career and that this should
be on the basis of full time employment to the extent which
she was performing
prior to the accident, although she would presumably move from activity to
activity as has been her wont through
years past.  I am not in a position at
this time to indicate any direct nexus between an intervertebral disc
impairment and the incident
of May 1992, as I have not been privy to any
sophisticated imaging scans.  Should an opinion be required then I would
request those
data."</b>
<P>

69   	Professor Jones provided another report after receiving
further information.  He said that the plaintiff had emphasised to
him that her
back and left ankle were normal prior to May 1992, but he noted that the
further information showed stress situations
prior to that event and a report
evidencing a CT Scan showing a lateral stenotic process at L3/4.
<P>

70   	He continued:-
<P>

<b>"This would suggest a pre-existing degenerative condition with stenosis and
involvement of perhaps a root canal by bony overgrowth.
 This may be a
substantial contributing factor to her earlier history of referred pain and
probable muscle weakness.  I indicated
my views as to hands on therapies
suggesting that such treatments were neither indicated nor would they improve
her situation and
in fact may be dangerous."</b>
<P>

71   	In cross-examination the plaintiff said that she thought
she remembered telling Professor Jones that her back was normal prior
to May
1992.  It was put to her that that was not accurate and she said:-
<P>

<b>"A. It was not in bad shape, it was just not great.  It wasn't acute.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But it wasn't normal, was it?</b>
<P>

<b>A. It is relative."</b>
<P>

72   	She was nextly asked about a history she gave Dr Davis,
whose report appears at p.85 of Exhibit E.  Her history to Dr Davis
included
that she was unaware of any general health problems "and denied any significant
musculo skeletal injuries in the past. 
In particular she denied any symptoms
affecting her back, neck or limbs".  It was put to Mrs Mathews that this
history was not true
and she gave evidence, at Tpp.25-26, in which she sought
to say that she was not suffering from pain but stiffness.
<P>

73   	I have already stated that in my view the evidence has
established that the plaintiff was suffering from pain in her back,
including
her low back, well prior to May 1992 for which she was receiving treatment from
Mr Bablis.  The objective evidence explained
the reason for this.  Her history
to the doctors that she was not suffering from such pain cannot be accepted
and, indeed, her case
was conducted on the basis that the fall of 2 May 1992
constituted an aggravation and exacerbation of the pre-existing back condition.
The difficulty in this case is to try to sort out the extent to which she
suffered pain and problems as a consequence of that aggravation
and
exacerbation over and above that which she was previously suffering.  This
difficulty is caused by the problem in accepting her
subjective complaints of
pain.  That difficulty is added to by the fact that Ms Key, who, I am
satisfied, treated her after the accident,
reported that she was asymptomatic
until her trip overseas in 1995.  As I have noted Dr Garrick was given a
history that the back
pain had substantially subsided by October 1992.
<P>

74   	It is to be noted that Dr Davis expressed the view, p.88
of Exhibit E, that:-
<P>

<b>"Mrs Mathews is quite evidently a highly motivated person who will continue
to work in her chosen profession despite expected and
documented aggravation
with travel and unsustained postures.</b>
<P>

<b>Her domestic responsibilities are resulting in a degree of aggravation and I
believe that she should have paid domestic assistance
of 4 to 6 hours per week
to undertake all of the heavy or forceful work.</b>
<P>

<b>Her injury has now stabilised and her prognosis is for continuing
difficulties."</b>
<P>

75   	The plaintiff also relied upon two reports of Dr Michael
Morris, who saw the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant.  Mr Branson
informed
me, without objection, that the plaintiff had re-served Dr Morris' reports on
the defendant.  He saw her firstly on 20 June
1998, and she gave him a history
that she used to get some higher level back pain when she drove, for which she
received some physiotherapy
and chiropractic treatment from Mr Bablis.  Dr
Morris did not see the MRI or CT Scan and set out the history he received.  He
considered
that the plaintiff had a "surprisingly full range of lumbar spinal
movement and makes no evident attempt to embellish her disability;
she stated
that the back is quite good to-day and has been much better since being on
Prednisone".
<P>

76   	In his diagnosis Dr Morris expressed the view that it
would be of significance to ascertain the level and kind of systems
she had
prior to the May 1992 incident, and he strongly recommended that the reports be
obtained from those who had treated her,
including Dr Hameri.  He
continued:-
<P>

<b>"However, unless there is clear evidence of pre-existing sciatica, on the
face of it it seems likely that she became aware of it within
a day or so of
the fall, and it has persisted intermittently since.  The account she gives is
certainly suggestive of nerve root
irritation, which is characteristically
intermittent, and she does have some neurological evidence in the form of a
depressed right
knee jerk."</b>
<P>

77   	He offered certain other opinions as to her condition and,
in relation to her fitness for work, said that she was fit to continue
"her
present work as a public relations consultant and likely to remain so".
<P>

78   	He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"On the evidence so far available, and with the reservations set out above,
it certainly seems at least likely that this lady either
caused or suffered a
significant aggravation of a disc prolapse, leading to right L4 distribution
sciatica as a result of a fall
in 1992.</b>
<P>

<b>It also seems likely that a separate problem arose as a result of the fall
in Tenterfield in 1996 which may however have been due
in part to instability
of her left ankle, which in turn may date from 1992 also.</b>
<P>

<b>The problem with the right wrist is clearly a result of a fall in 1996, but
again may link indirectly to instability of the left ankle,
and I presume the
links there would be a matter for legal rather than medical argument."</b>
<P>

79   	On 21 September 1999 Dr Morris furnished a supplementary
report.  In that report he stated:-
<P>

<b>"Dr Sheehy's report however and handwritten notes are of considerable
importance and significance; on my reading of his handwritten
notes of 27/5/92
it says back and leg pain; LBP for years (presumably low back pain), thoracic
muscle biopsied.  Two years driving
to Windsor each day.  Two week sprains left
ankle."</b>
<P>

These are the notes of Dr Sheehy to which I have referred.
<P>

80   	In relation to the chiropractic notes, Dr Morris thought
they were of "doubtful value".  He said he did not know how definite
a
conclusion could be reached on the strength of them, but he assumed that a
legal argument could be advanced that the fall aggravated
whatever her
situation may have been.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Having looked at the chiropractic notes and the translation by John Kelly,
it is I think a reasonable conclusion that she has had
prior low back pain
despite her denials but I do not know how much further one could take the
matter than that.</b>
<P>

<b>I wonder whether her GP Dr Hameri might have notes as to whether she made
any reference to the claimed fall at the time that she saw
him.</b>
<P>

<b>The situation therefore in response to your additional questions are that I
do not know that any of this makes matters any clearer
than they were
originally and therefore I think the conclusions under the heading of
"Attributability" such as they are, stand unaltered
except that there is
certainly a doubt that has been raised as to the link between claimed
exacerbation of back pains and the fall
on board the ship."</b>
<P>

81   	Dr John Matheson examined the plaintiff on behalf of the
defendant.  He is a consultant neurosurgeon, who examined her in
August 1998.
He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"To put this matter into context she has had what can only be described as a
relatively minor fall with a possible lateral ligament
tear to the ankle,
although that is best judged by orthopaedic surgeons.  There is no reason why
this fall going forwards and on
to her sides should produce a back injury at
all.  Indeed, there is no evidence that she has got a significant injury from
that event.
 What is clear is that she has an hysterical personality disorder
and that this is a somatised story with a whole lot of complaints
that clearly
have no basis in physical reality.  She may or may not have some minor back
pain of longstanding.  I cannot tell that.
 From what I can see there is on
evidence that she has any sciatica and she certainly has no neurological
disability whatsoever and
no back disability to examination.</b>
<P>

<b>It is my view that this is a contrived disorder and that she has no injury
as far as her back is concerned from the incident of 2
May 1992."</b>
<P>

82   	In cross-examination, Tp.46, Dr Matheson expressed the
view that the plaintiff was imagining the disorder and describing symptoms
in
emotional and not physical terms, but he said he was not suggesting that she
had no physical symptoms whatsoever.  He considered
that the various scans
showed that her back was normal and that the discs were normal, but he denied
that the type of fall the plaintiff
suffered was likely to have injured her
back.  He said falls of that nature cause either broken wrists or femurs.
<P>

83   	Dr Douglas Seaton gave two reports: Exhibit E pp.81 and
131.  He first saw the plaintiff on 20 September 1996.  It is interesting
to
note that in recording the history he said:-
<P>

<b>"She did have a large amount of physiotherapy including traction and
manipulation, and she did have financial deprivation because
she was only
employed by her company one day per week instead of full time."</b>
<P>

There are two or three matters of interest in this sentence.  Firstly, the
plaintiff gave no evidence of such treatment.  Secondly,
if she did have such
treatment, which, in my opinion, happened, it would appear she received it from
Ms Key.  Thirdly, the plaintiff
cannot have told Dr Seaton that by the
amendment to her Agreement of 1 January 1992 she was only to work one day per
week.  It is
obvious that the plaintiff failed to advise Dr Seaton of this
change in her employment arrangements with "her company".  Dr Seaton
also noted
that she had recently obtained work as a consultant in China for water
conservation, but that "this does not pay well".
 He received a history that
she would be employed "basically, by the Chinese Government".  There is no
evidence that she performed
any such work or received any payment.
<P>

84   	Dr Seaton referred to the problems with her back and
noted:-
<P>

<b>"She is helped by the fact that she has a gardener to do the lawnmowing and
she did, at one stage, require a housekeeper to help her
with the housework.
She does not require that now, but she does enjoy her swimming, which she does
winter and summer, and it helps
her backache."</b>
<P>

Thus by September 1996 Dr Seaton was reporting on a person, who was able to
manage physical activities, notwithstanding the pain
of which she
complained.
<P>

85   	She complained to Dr Seaton about lower back pain with
spasm in the muscles basically on the right side of her back and down
the right
leg in the form of sciatica and instability in the left ankle.
<P>

86   	Dr Seaton formed the view that "this woman is still a back
cripple and always will be".  He said he would comment further
on that when he
had seen the MRI examination "but it would appear to me that she has more than
one disc injury in her back as a result
of the accident on 5 May 1992".
<P>

87   	He noted instability in the left ankle, and he formed the
view that her expenses were going to be "great in the future, although
she does
not take medication".  He was of the opinion that her outlook was poor and that
she would not be able to work again to her
full potential because of the fact
that she fell in May 1992.  He considered that if she was to continue to
advance in her field
of pollution prevention, she would require domestic
assistance in the home.
<P>

88   	At p.131 Dr Seaton gave a further report in which he dealt
with the accident at Tenterfield.  He said that the plaintiff gave
a history of
having tripped on uneven ground and her left ankle gave way causing her to land
on her right wrist and break it.  Mr
Stitt was critical of this history in the
light of the plaintiff's evidence that the left ankle gave way, although I do
not think
this criticism is justified.  Dr Seaton concluded that "all her
injuries that she has sustained are a direct result of the fall that
occurred
when she was on artificial grass when she tripped on a stair when visiting a
naval craft".  He added that "quite definitely
the injury to the right wrist,
which is a very severe one, is directly related to the injury that occurred on
the naval ship ..".
<P>

89   	The plaintiff's case was supported by the evidence of her
son Benjamin and Shana Bellin, whose witness statements appear at
pp.370 and
372 respectively of Exhibit E.  Neither was required for cross-examination.  I
should also mention that the only doctor
required for cross-examination was Dr
Matheson.
<P>

90   	Her son stated that he recalled his parents returning home
on the night of the accident and several incidents when she appeared
to suffer
substantial pain.  In paragraphs 7 and 8 he said:-
<P>

<b>"7.	Since the accident my mother has been more emotional, more emotionally
unwell and physically unwell.  I have observed her reach
for something and then
shout out in pain.  I have observed her driving the car and complained of pain.
She does not cook as much
now either.  Mum requires a lot more assistance and I
assist her, as do other people.  I have been asked to carry things for her,
bend over and pick up things, carry her suitcase, carry the filtered water
bottles, and reach things in the frig for her.  I have
observed my mother on
the floor screaming in pain in my brother's room with a bag of frozen peas
behind her back.  I also recall
her not being able to attend a school event and
she was shaking and looked in pain.  Recently my mother came to pick up my
brother
from my father's house.  My mother broke down in terrible pain at that
time.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	Mum appears a lot more stressed and anxious as a result of the
accidents.  She doesn't play tennis, she still swims, and has
put on a lot more
weight.  I have observed Mum's ankle give way at a church service and walking
down the sidewalk.  She's very careful
and has grabbed me due to the
instability of her ankle.  My mother is home a lot more than she used to be.  I
am with her three to
four days a week at her home."</b>
<P>

91   	Ms Bellin stated that she has known the plaintiff since
1988.  She observed the plaintiff both before and after the accident,
and has
seen, since May 1992, the plaintiff "in excruciating pain and crying on
occasions".  She said that she noticed the plaintiff
was transformed "from a
young, fit and active person to a person who moves slowly, gained weight and
had different colouring.  She
does not look well".
<P>

92   	She has seen the plaintiff in extreme pain, crying and
appearing to be unable to move.  She concluded:-
<P>

<b>"I have also observed that Fiona is more unhappy since the accident.  When
she is emotional, she does not seem to have the resources
to handle it and
breaks down a lot more than she used to.  I recall on one occasion Fiona
attended the course I held and I noticed
she was in pain.  She was limping.  I
asked her, `What is wrong?'  She said to me `I've fallen on an aircraft carrier
and injured
myself'.  She could barely talk without crying from the pain on
this occasion."</b>
<P>

93   	The plaintiff also makes a claim for a psychiatric injury.
Initially this was not pursued, but towards the end of his submissions
Mr
Branson said that having noticed what was said by Dr Strum, he withdrew the
concession that she did not claim to have a recognisable
and defined
psychiatric injury. 
<P>

94   	Originally the plaintiff was seen by Dr Dent.  It was not
pursuant to anything Dr Dent assessed that led to the change in
the attitude to
the case.  Dr Strum, in his report of 26 August 1999, said:-
<P>

<b>"At the time of interview Mrs Mathews said that she continued to be anxious
but she was optimistic and motivated.  Her main worry
was having another fall
and re-injuring her arm.  Her appetite and sleep were intact although, at
times, pain in her hand would disturb
her sleep.  Her sexual drive had
improved.  She said that her anxiety and depression depended on her physical
state of well-being.
 There were no nightmares, flashes or panic attacks.  She
was mixing well with people."</b>
<P>

95   	Towards the end of his report Dr Strum referred to various
stressors in the plaintiff's life and, at p.9, continued:-
<P>

<b>"Mrs Mathews first developed psychiatric symptoms in 1992 and has
experienced bouts of similar symptoms ever since.  The symptoms
she described
are those of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Depressed Mood
(DSM-IV-309.28).  The symptoms have fluctuated.  There
have been appetite and
sleep disturbances.  At times she over eats and at times she suffers from
anorexia.  Her insomnia and early
morning wakening is caused by anxiety as well
as pain.  There have been suicidal thoughts at times.  Her motivation,
depressed mood
and libido has tended to fluctuate.  Mrs Mathews symptoms are,
at times, severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of Major Depression
(DSM-IV-296.3).  However a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and
Depressed Mood (DSM-IV-309.28) seems preferable because
her symptoms are
related to pain and disability."</b>
<P>

96   	Dr Strum expressed the view that the plaintiff had gone
from being a competent person, working in a high pressure job, to
only being
able to do part-time work, and stated that her illness "is now intermittent".
It does not appear that he was aware that
she had agreed to part time work at
Memtec from 1 January 1992, nor that she did not intend to return to full time
work until either
2000 or 2005.   He thought there would be further episodes
and the prognosis was guarded.  He did not expect a complete recovery
even with
medication, coping strategies and meditation.
<P>

97   	The plaintiff was examined by a psychiatrist, Dr Champion,
on behalf of the defendant.  Dr Champion said that the plaintiff
gave no
history to suggest that her claimed pain and suffering and disability had
produced psychological distress or psychiatric
disorder and there was no
history of her having received treatment in this regard.  He concluded:-
<P>

<b>"From a psychiatric viewpoint therefore, currently there is no indication of
psychiatric disorder.  There is no history of psychiatric
disorder prior to or
following the injury and she has not received treatment for any form of
psychiatric disorder.  Her activities
and range of interests, as well as her
presentation are consistent with the view that Ms Mathews does not suffer with
any psychiatric
disorder."</b>
<P>

98   	Dr Dent's report is helpful in that he seems to identify
that the plaintiff received treatment from Ms Key after the accident.
At p.5 of
his report, Dr Dent said that the plaintiff had suffered no depression since
she had learnt to meditate as a coping mechanism
"and has used this for a very
long time".  As best as I understand the balance of his report he does not
identify any recognisable
psychiatric illness.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

99   	The first conclusion to which I have come is that the
plaintiff is a very poor historian.  She was clearly incorrect in her
evidence
that she met the greeting line prior to her accident.  She did not reveal to a
number of doctors that she had any problem
with her back prior to the incident
of 2 May 1992.  She did not reveal to Dr Seaton that by the time of the
accident she was only
working one day per week.  She did not reveal that after
being treated by Ms Key until mid-1995 she had been asymptomatic.  In addition
to her problems so far as the history is concerned I formed the clear
impression that the plaintiff was seeking to avoid answering
questions in
cross-examination about any back problem prior to the accident of May 1992 in
so far as it related to her low back.
<P>

100   	When all these matters are put together I have great
difficulty in accepting her subjective evidence of pain and, therefore,
in
assessing the extent to which the plaintiff aggravated or exacerbated her
undoubtedly existing back condition as a result of the
fall.  This is made the
harder when it is borne in mind that she was seeing Mr Bablis for treatment to
her back in February 1992.
<P>

101   	I think it is necessary to make the finding, which I am
satisfied should be made, that the plaintiff's evidence was unsatisfactory
in
relation to any problems from which she is suffering with her back and, in so
far as she sought to avoid questions in cross-examination
as to the extent of
her previous problems, I do not consider that she was being truthful.  Further,
there is the evidence of Ms Key
of the lack of symptoms until 1995, and there
is the evidence of numerous trips overseas, which are hardly consistent with a
person
suffering to the extent which the plaintiff maintained.  There is also
the evidence of Dr Garrick that the back pain had substantially
subsided by
October 1992.
<P>

102   	I think I should say a little more about the report from
Ms Key.  It was not raised until late in Mr Stitt's address.  Mr
Branson did
not refer to it until the conclusion of his address, when I invited his
comments on it.  He said it was a report he would
like to withdraw, although he
did not seek leave to do so. There were agreed out-of-pocket expenses to the
date of trial and, in
the submissions made there is a claim for $1,764 for
"Edgecliff Physiotherapy".  Ms Key operated under the name of Edgecliff
Physiotherapy
Sports &amp; Spinal Centre.  When I add that matter to other
matters, such as the plaintiff's reference to her, to Dr Garrick's having
sent
a copy of his report to her, and to the history she gave Dr Dent, I am
satisfied that Ms Key treated the plaintiff after the
incident in May 1992.  I
am also satisfied by Dr Garrick's report that by October 1992 that treatment
had been essentially successful.
 Thereafter, according to Ms Key, the back
remained asymptomatic until mid-1995 after the lengthy trip overseas, it being
conceded
by Mr Branson that the trip commencing on 4 June 1995 was the trip
undertaken before the plaintiff again saw Ms Key.
<P>

103   	It seems to me that the proper inference to draw from the
evidence is that the fall did cause an exacerbation or aggravation
of the
pre-existing spinal problems; that this necessitated extensive treatment from
Ms Key; but that there was a very substantial
recovery from the aggravation or
exacerbation by October 1992. 
<P>

104   	In all the circumstances I am not able to relate the
problems for which she consulted Ms Key in mid-1995 to the aggravation
or
exacerbation of the original injury.  That, in my opinion, was spent.  The
plaintiff has not satisfied me that the problems in
1995 were the consequence
of the accident on 2 May 1992 rather than the pre-existing condition. In the
result, I am of the opinion
that such pain and suffering as should be
attributed to the aggravation and exacerbation should be for a closed period to
October
1992.
<P>

105   	The next matter to which consideration has to be given is
the fracture to the right wrist.  There is no doubt that prior
to the incident
of 2 May 1992 the plaintiff had no problem with her left ankle.  The medical
evidence is that the sprain of that
ankle led to its becoming weaker and liable
to "give", and supports the view that there is a causal relationship between
her weakened
left ankle and her fall in the forest.  I have noted Mr Stitt's
criticism of the history, although in this regard I do not think
that is
justified.  The evidence of a causal connection is also supported by Dr Waller
and Dr Harper.
<P>

106   	In the result the injury to the plaintiff's right wrist,
with the consequences that imposed, are causally related to the
accident.
<P>

<b>Damages For Pain And Suffering</b>
<P>

107   	So far as pain and suffering are concerned, I am of the
view that the appropriate amount to award the plaintiff both in respect
of the
closed period for her back and for her wrist is $40,000.  As the period in
respect of the back is a closed one, and as she
did not injure her wrist until
August 1997, that being the major component of her pain and suffering, I should
attribute one third
to the past or, to round the figure off, $14,000, and two
thirds, namely $26,000, to the future.  Interest on $14,000 at 2 per centum
per
annum for 7.5 years is $2,100, making the total award for general damages
$42,100.
<P>

108   	It is to be noted that the plaintiff's claim for
out-of-pocket expenses has been agreed, on the basis that if I find that
only
her back, neck, ankle "etc" were involved, at $2,290, to which sum, if I find
that her wrist is attributable to the accident,
is to be added the sum of
$6,215.  Therefore the out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $8,505.  The
evidence does not establish the
components of these figures, but figures are
set out in the written submissions, which particularise the past out-of-pocket
expenses
at $8,694.20 "together with any amounts payable to the Health
Insurance Commission".
<P>

109   	The plaintiff has made a claim for future out-of-pocket
expenses of $71,063.31 plus future surgery costs.  The claim proceeds
upon the
basis of 15 sessions of physiotherapy per annum at $50 per session; 18 sessions
of remedial massage at $80 per session;
2 consultations with a general
practitioner per annum of $1,592.70; 2 consultations per annum with a
specialist of $6,887.38; and
various other expenses such as a psychologist for
18 months at $100 per fortnight.  Whilst there is an evidentiary basis for most
of these expenses, they appear to relate to the back for which I do not think
she is entitled to further compensation.   
<P>

110   	It appears that the plaintiff will need further treatment
in respect of her wrist, at least to remove the plate, but in the
absence of
evidence as to the possible cost, it is very difficult to award her any amount.
However, and perhaps I will be criticised
for being speculative, I propose to
allow $1,500 for the procedure as a future out-of-pocket expense.
<P>

111   	So far as past out-of-pocket expenses are concerned the
submission is that the plaintiff has paid $4,778.85 and claims interest
on that
amount at 8 per centum per annum for 7.5 years, which amounts to $2,871.  I am
prepared to allow that amount, although there
is a discrepancy between the
total amount claimed in the submissions and the agreed figure of $8,505.
However, in the overall context
of this verdict, I do not think that is a
matter about which I should be concerned further.  Accordingly, for past and
present out-of-pocket
expenses I allow $8,505, $1,500 and interest of $2,871, a
total of $12,876.
<P>

<b>Past Economic Loss And Future Loss Of Earning Capacity</b>
<P>

112   	In relation to past economic loss and future loss of
earning capacity the plaintiff's case suffers, in my opinion, from deficiencies
of evidence, notwithstanding that she carries the onus of proof.  I have
pointed out that at Memtec the plaintiff was earning, at
the date of the
accident, $10,000 per annum gross and, from about August 1993, $10,400 per
annum gross.  The plaintiff has given
no evidence that she lost work in
consequence of the accident and, if she did, the amount of salary she was not
paid.  Indeed within
a month of the accident she was away for 24 days on a
business trip, and, thereafter, made the business trips to which I have
referred.
 Further, the plaintiff has given little evidence that she was
precluded from undertaking private work as a consequence of the accident.
 In
so far as she has referred to difficulties, she has not identified any work she
did not undertake or any earnings she has lost
because of her alleged back or
wrist problems or, indeed, at all.
<P>

<b>Past Wage Loss</b>
<P>

113   	Normally, in respect of past wage loss there is evidence
of the amount the plaintiff was earning prior to the accident, the
period for
which she was not earning as a consequence of the accident and an assessment,
based on those matters, of the loss suffered
to the date of trial.  In the case
of an employee it is generally not a difficult task.  In the case of a
self-employed person it
can be proved by a comparison of pre and post accident
earnings.  In the present case it is known that the plaintiff had agreed to
work one day per week for Memtec for $10,000 per annum together with some
fringe benefits.  The plaintiff had previously been employed
on a full time
basis on the terms to which I have referred.  The plaintiff said that after her
injury the chairman of Memtec was
supportive and understanding and tried to
accommodate her disability.  She has given no evidence of the period she was
absent from
her employment.  Rather, her evidence is that she travelled
overseas in the course of her employment for 24 days from 3 June 1992.
 Prima
facie, and I say that because there is no evidence to otherwise explain the
matter, that would account for 24 of the 52 days
per annum she was to work for
Memtec.
<P>

114   	She made no further reference to her employment until
paragraph 43 of her statement, in which she stated that in 1997 she
resigned
from Memtec for the reasons to which I have referred.
<P>

115   	She gave no evidence that she agreed to work for only one
day for Memtec so that she could undertake other employment, nor
did she give
any evidence as to any other employment she undertook and, in paragraph 62, she
has stated that since resigning from
Memtec she has been involved in a variety
of projects, a number of which have been performed on a voluntary basis.  She
continued:-
<P>

<b>"At present I am not employed on a full-time basis and work on a part-time
basis as a freelance adviser to a variety of companies.
 I have difficulties in
undertaking my day to day employment due to my pain and my inability to commute
to attending at certain events
as I am unable to judge at what time I will
suffer from pain and disability.  Although I am confident that I will be in a
position
to continue to work on a part-time basis, I am certainly not able to
return to employment on a full-time basis due to the pain and
disability which
I suffer."</b>
<P>

116   	She stated that it had been her intention to work on a
full time basis until she was 65 years of age and to re-commence "full
time
employment in 2000 once both my sons had completed their schooling".  Her
history to her accountant was that she may not have
done so until 2005.
<P>

117   	There is no evidence as to what was involved in the
business trips commencing on 10 June 1993, 1 June 1994, 4 June 1995 and
20 June
1997.  The plaintiff has sought to erect a case for past economic loss and
future loss of earning capacity on the basis of
a report from accountants,
Dolman Bateman &amp; Co Pty Limited. 
<P>

118   	After a general introductory comment the author dealt
with the plaintiff's pre-accident capacity, noting that the plaintiff
had
advised that she worked very long hours as a public relations officer and as
the President of National Greenhouse Action Australia,
and that her commitments
involved a lot of travel, both locally between her home and Windsor and
overseas.  The author then turned
to post-accident capacity and stated that as
a result of her disabilities the plaintiff has reduced her working hours
considerably.
 The report continued:-
<P>

<b>"She is currently trying to establish her own consultancy, specialising in
international and industrial media relations and lobbying
with an emphasis on
environmental policies and issues.  She has advised that she can cope with
intermittent work as she can rest
periodically.  Due to the spasmodic nature of
her health and back pain, she now lacks the confidence to commit and perform on
certain
projects.  She now finds travelling, whether by car or any other mode
of transport, very painful."</b>
<P>

119   	Whilst these may be the complaints the plaintiff made, I
am not satisfied that any pain in her back referable to the accident
continued
after October 1992.  In any event, and more relevantly for present purposes,
the plaintiff gave no evidence of work she
did not undertake.  Nor, at an
evidentiary level, was an attempt made to erect any specific case for past wage
loss on that basis.
<P>

120   	In relation to her ability to drive she said, Tp.29, that
she does drive, and she drives normally unless she is having "an
acute phase":
Tp.30.  She said she has a Volvo motor car which she drives every day without
any difficulty.  This would seem to negate
her history that she finds
travelling by car very painful, and her frequent trips overseas for lengthy
periods would seem to negate
the suggestion that she finds travelling "very
painful".
<P>

121   	The report then goes on to deal with past economic loss
from 2 May 1992 to 31 October 1997, which is calculated at $126,657.
 A
subsequent report to 1 September 1999 updates the figure to $172,133.  It is
stated that the plaintiff's post-accident restrictions,
which have impacted
directly on her income, "allegedly involve" that she finds it difficult to
travel; that she advised that she
feels unreliable and is not always able to
work as a result of her pain and needs to rest periodically; and that she has
lost the
confidence to be able to commit to some projects.
<P>

122   	The method of calculation of past economic loss is by
taking probable earnings, as calculated at pp.8 to 12, of $233,045,
deducting
therefrom actual earnings of $106,388, as calculated at pp.13 to 14 and coming
up with the first loss figure to which I
have referred.
<P>

123   	The schedule of probable earnings commences by taking net
earnings of $655 weekly with Memtec.  However, it is noted that
during the 1992
financial year she reduced her work hours and that she had advised that she
planned to work one to two days per week
for Memtec and two to three days in
similar employment, reverting back to full time employment when her children
were older "possibly
around 2005".  Reference is then made to the fringe
benefits of a motor vehicle, and home and mobile telephones from Memtec.  There
was no evidence of what she expected to earn from her employment other than
with Memtec.
<P>

124   	She commenced working for Memtec on 2 April 1990 and,
from then to 30 June 1990, she received a gross salary of $12,671.54
on which
she paid tax of $4,359.70.  This, according to her income tax return, was her
only income.  In the following financial year,
i.e. the financial year ended 30
June 1991, her income tax return shows gross earnings from Memtec of $46,295.24
on which she paid
income tax of $14,640.52.
<P>

125   	For the financial year ended 30 June 1992, which was the
year in which she reduced the amount of her income by the variation
to her
contract and also suffered the injury, her only income was from Memtec, as
disclosed by the income tax return in evidence.
 Her gross income was
$31,741.48 on which she paid tax of $9,261.
<P>

126   	In the next financial year her only disclosed income was
from Memtec, the gross amount being $10,000 on which she paid $990.34
by way of
tax.  This was the figure she had agreed to receive pursuant to the variation.
In the financial year ended 30 June 1994
her only disclosed income was from
Memtec, the gross amount being $11,379 on which she paid tax of $1,389.90.  
<P>

127   	The next income tax return is for the year ended 30 June
1996 in which year she received a gross amount from Memtec of $11,409.
 She
also received interest of $832, a net capital gain of $1,909 and a small share
dividend, giving a total assessable income of
$14,743 on which she paid tax of
$1,275.19.
<P>

128   	By letter dated 14 October 1997 Memtec provided
information as to the amount paid to the plaintiff for her mobile and home
telephones and, on 3 September 1998, the successor of Memtec set out the
amounts paid to her on a gross and net basis.  The amounts
for 1995 and 1997
were, gross, $12,838.52 and $14,642, and net $11,427 and $13,223.  The car
value for each year, save for 1997,
was shown, and it was stated that an 8%
superannuation contribution, calculated on gross, was made on the plaintiff's
behalf throughout
her employment.
<P>

129   	In my opinion, before the Court could award any further
amount for the plaintiff's past loss of earnings, it would be necessary
for her
to prove what attempts she had made to obtain other work and her inability, in
consequence of the injuries resulting from
the accident, to undertake such
work.  The plaintiff proffered no evidence in support of these matters, which
would allow any calculation
to be made, and there is no evidence of what moneys
she has earned "on a part time basis as a freelance adviser to a variety of
companies",
save for the financial year ended 30 June 1999.  There is no
evidence at all as to her earnings for the financial year ended 30 June
1998.
The accountant's report for the financial year ended 30 June 1999 states that
she earned $24,268 gross, of which $18,000 came
from Memtec's successor, and
$19,638 net.  She gave no evidence that she refused any work for that period
and, as I have said, her
evidence is that she did not intend, at least until
the year 2000, to return to full time employment.
<P>

130   	In these circumstances the plaintiff has completely
failed to satisfy me that she has lost any income.  There is no evidence
that
whilst she was employed by Memtec she lost any of the income for which she had
contracted, in which I include the benefits for
car and telephone.  In these
circumstances, I do not consider that she is entitled to any amount for past
economic loss.  Similarly,
so far as superannuation is concerned there is no
suggestion that the plaintiff was not paid the amount of superannuation to
which
she was entitled or that it was not credited to an account for her
benefit.  The assumption the accountant made in respect of superannuation
seems
to be that she would be entitled to it working on a free-lance or part time
basis.  This assumption has not been established.
<P>

<b>Loss Of Future Earning Capacity</b>
<P>

131   	So far as loss of future earning capacity is concerned
the report stated that there had been a valuation of the current uninjured,
undiminished net weekly earnings on the assumption that the current total loss
of capacity is entirely due to the disabilities suffered
in the accident.  It
continued:-
<P>

<b>"If, however, it is considered by the Court that there is a residual earning
capacity, our calculations would need to be adjusted
to the extent of this
capacity and this is not a matter which we can address in our report."</b>
<P>

It was then noted that the plaintiff had, at the date of the accident, intended
to revert to full time employment in about the year
2005, which would tend to
indicate that she was going to accept far less employment in the intervening
period.  The report stated:-
<P>

<b>"Thus, the current loss which is based on probable earnings of four days
work per week only applies to 31/12/2004.  As from 01/01/2005,
the future loss
should be based on probable earnings of five days work per week."</b>
<P>

132   	The first calculation carried out is for the period 1
November 1997 to 31 December 2004, it being stated that the plaintiff's
current
net weekly loss is $854.  This is said to be based on probable earnings of a
salary of $807 per week, which is an indexed
amount commencing with $721 per
week, as I understand it, for the period 2 May 1992 to 30 June 1992.
Thereafter the figure is indexed
each year to reach the figure of $807 per
week.  In my view, and with great respect to the author of the report, this is
a fanciful
way of seeking to assess the income.  It is fanciful, because there
was no evidence that this is the amount the plaintiff would have
been earning,
or would have continued to earn.  This figure could only be justified, if at
all, if she had not varied her contract
with Memtec, or if she proved what she
could have earned.  The same exercise is then carried through for the balance
of the plaintiff's
assumed working life.
<P>

133   	Before one comes to deal with the vicissitudes, it is
necessary to look at the realities.  The plaintiff has only proved
that she
received certain amounts from Memtec, save to the extent I have noted.  She has
not proved that she received any other amounts,
nor has she proved that she
received any income for the 1998 financial year, nor has she proved what work
opportunities are available
in her field and the amount she might expect to be
remunerated in respect of them.
<P>

134   	The accountant then took the figures to 1 September 1999
for past economic loss and calculated $172,133 and re-calculated
loss of
earning capacity at $379,615.  These figures are also, in my opinion, infected
with the same error as the previously calculated
figures.  Whilst the
plaintiff's written submissions maintained these to be the figures for loss of
future earning capacity Mr Branson,
in his final submissions, submitted that
the plaintiff's loss was $640 per week, but that one should allow $300 net per
week and
apply 25% for vicissitudes on the basis of his concession that the
plaintiff had "a significant pre-existing disability, but one
which had not
been productive of loss of earning capacity".
<P>

135   	I regret that I cannot give effect to these figures for
the plaintiff's loss of earning capacity.  I cannot do so because,
in my
opinion, the plaintiff has simply failed to prove the relevant amounts. She has
failed to prove what amount, uninjured, she
would have earned.
<P>

136   	The preponderance of the evidence, and the evidence which
I accept, is that the plaintiff will be able to obtain employment.
 The
evidence of Professor Jones, Dr Davis and Dr Morris supports this and is in
accordance with the probabilities and Mr Branson's
concession to which I have
just referred.  Indeed, for all I know, the plaintiff is now deriving income
from employment, which is
consistent with her earnings for the last financial
year.  She certainly did not say she was not, and her evidence was that she was
doing certain work on a part time basis.  Her evidence was, further, that she
intended to return to work on a full time basis either,
if one accepts her
witness statement, in 2000, or if one accepts what she apparently told the
accountants, in the year 2005.
<P>

137   	For all these reasons it seems to me that the Court
cannot simply speculate as to an amount the plaintiff may have lost.
 She has
simply failed to prove the amount she has lost.  All I can say for certain is
that she has been earning certain amounts.
However, I cannot take these
amounts, having regard to the circumstances in which she ceased her employment
with Memtec, as the upper
limit of her future earning capacity and, even if I
could, I would still have to know what amount should be deducted from it to
reach
her real loss, i.e. the expenses she would incur in carrying on her own
business.
<P>

138   	The plaintiff, I think, in the circumstances of this
case, is entitled to some amount as a buffer against any future downturn
in her
employment by virtue of her wrist injury and for the period she will be unable
to work when she has the further operation.
 However, in my view, this should
be a small amount, which I assess at $60 per week which, on the 3% Tables for
fifteen years, is
$37,932.  Whilst Mr Branson conceded that the amount for loss
of future earnings had to be reduced by 25 per cent to take account
of the
vicissitudes obtaining in this case, that was not in the context of a "buffer"
amount, to which I propose to apply the usual
rate of 15 per cent.    The
amount I award for loss of future earning capacity is, accordingly, $37,932
reduced by 15 per cent, i.e.
$32,242.20.
<P>

<b>The Griffiths v Kerkemeyer Claim</b>
<P>

139   	The plaintiff claims damages pursuant to the principles
in <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 161.</a>  The first basis upon
which the claim is made is care to the date of the hearing, being for domestic
care of six hours per week from
2 May 1992 to the date of trial at $19 per
hour.  The difficulty I have with this claim is that it assumes that for the
total period
the plaintiff was entitled to that degree of care.  The claim is
made, essentially, in relation to her back injury.  As I have found
I am
satisfied that that, in so far as it was a matter for which the defendant was
responsible, had resolved by October 1992, a period
of approximately 184 days
from which, in my opinion, one would have to deduct the 24 days that the
plaintiff was away on business.
 I would, accordingly, allow 160 days, or 23
weeks, there being some evidence sufficient to satisfy me that during that
period the
plaintiff was in receipt of assistance for which such a claim would
run.
<P>

140   	So far as the wrist is concerned it is very difficult to
come to any real view on this matter because nothing is suggested
as to the
time involved in that particular operation and the recovery from it.  The
evidence of Dr Waller is that the plaintiff underwent
an open reduction and
internal fixation of the fracture of the right radius on 25 August 1997.  She
was reviewed on 4 September 1997
when the plaster and the sutures were removed
and thereafter she underwent physiotherapy.  She was reviewed again on 30
October 1997.
 Since then Dr Waller has not seen her in consultation, but he
understands that her left ankle is still causing some problems.
<P>

141   	Dr Waller said that the plaintiff may require further
treatment to her right wrist in the future, and that at some stage
she will
require removal of the fixation plate and screws.  I have dealt with this.  He
considered that she had lost 30 per cent
permanent loss of efficient use of the
right arm below the elbow.
<P>

142   	It would seem, at most, that the plaintiff required a
further 15 weeks when a <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> type claim could apply,
making a total of 38 weeks.  She has made a claim at the rate of 6 hours per
week which, for 38 weeks, amounts
to 228 hours at $19 per hour, which equals
$4,332.  It did not seem to be in issue that she was entitled to interest on
that amount
at the rate of 3%, although it would not be appropriate to allow
the full 7.5 years.  Doing the best I can I would allow interest
for 4 years,
which would amount to $520.  The total award under this heading is,
accordingly, $4,852.
<P>

143   	The plaintiff has not satisfied me that she is entitled
to any future amount under this heading.  Ms Henry has provided a
detailed
report, which seems to be directed mainly to the problem with her back.
However, she has not established any specific needs,
under this heading, for
damages referable to the wrist.
<P>

<b>Amounts</b>
<P>

144   	In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to recover the
following amounts:-
<P>

(a)	General damages					$  42,100 . 00
<P>

(b)	Out-of-pocket expenses				$  12,876 . 00
<P>

(c)	Loss of future earning capacity			$  34,242 . 20
<P>

(d)	<b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b>				<u>$    4,852 . 00</u>
<P>

								<u>$  94,070 . 20</u>
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

145   	I order:-
<P>

(a)	Judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of
$94,070.20.
<P>

(b)	If the parties wish to address me on costs I shall hear submissions.
