<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>

<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>TUESDAY, 11 MAY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>16133/90   -   COLIN ALLAN WILLIAM ALCHIN  v</b>
<P>

<b>			PETER DEN HOUTING &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Dismiss statement of claim)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 12 March 1996 the first defendant
seeks that the statement of claim be struck out for want of prosecution
and by
notice of motion filed 2 April 1996 the second defendant seeks the same order.
The first defendant relied on the affidavits
of William John Hawson sworn 12
March 1996.  The second defendant relied on the affidavit of his solicitor
Sarah Marie Henry sworn
28 March 1996 and Rowena Mary Greenland sworn 19
February 1999.  The plaintiff relied on three affidavits of Colin Lawrence Day
sworn
25 June 1996, 22 September 1998 and 23 April 1999 and the affidavit of
Janice Margaret Dawson sworn 23 April 1999.
<P>

2	The defendants' motions came before the court on various occasions in May,
June and July 1996.  On 2 July 1996 they were stood
over 
<P>

generally.  On 30 April 1996 the plaintiff's current solicitor came onto the
record.  These motions were relisted on 24 September
1998 when the following
orders were made:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was to serve further medical reports on or before 17 December
1998.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff was to file a notice of motion seeking to file an amended
statement of claim on or before 5 February 1999.
<P>

(3)	The motion was stood over to 19 February 1999.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff was to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

3	On 19 February 1999 the matter was adjourned for hearing on 28 April 1999.
At this hearing the plaintiff's counsel sought leave
to file a notice of motion
seeking to file an amended statement of claim, despite being ordered to do so
by 5 February 1999.  The
defendants opposed the filing of the notice of motion.
They were not ready to argue whether an amendment to the statement of claim
should be permitted.  Although I was inclined to allow the filing of the notice
of motion, I reserved this issue because if the proceedings
are dismissed by
virtue of the motions already on foot the determination of the additional
motion is futile.  If the proceedings
are not struck out, it was agreed that if
I granted leave to file the notice of motion, the defendants should be given an
opportunity
to file affidavit evidence and the motion should be listed for
hearing at a future date.
<P>

4	I turn briefly to the history of this matter.  By statement of claim filed 29
October 1990 the plaintiff alleges that on 11 July
1985 he was involved in a
motor vehicle accident.  He was admitted to Griffith Base hospital (the second
defendant) suffering from
orthopaedic and head injuries.  On 16 July 1985 the
plaintiff underwent a left ankle operation performed by the first defendant at
Griffith Base hospital.  The plaintiff alleges that he suffered gross
disablement of the left lower limb as a result of the negligence
of the
defendants.  
<P>

5	The particulars of negligence contained in the statement of claim are that
the first defendant allegedly failed to properly diagnose
and carry out
reasonably competent surgery on the plaintiff's fractured left ankle;  failed
to properly supervise and monitor the
plaintiff during the post operative
period and failed to seek competent assistance and advice when the plaintiff's
condition deteriorated
post operatively.  The second defendant allegedly failed
to properly control and supervise the first defendant in the course of his
treatment of the plaintiff;  failed to properly supervise the first defendant
in his post operative care of the plaintiff and failed
to ensure that the
plaintiff received proper and reasonable medical care after the operation.  The
first defendant filed a defence
on 14 April 1993 and the second defendant filed
a defence on 27 December 1990.  Both the first and second defendants requested
answers
to particulars in 1990 and 1991.  The plaintiff's solicitor answered
the second defendant's request in about June 1992 to the second
defendant
(although the second defendant maintains that some questions remain unanswered)
and the first defendant's request for particulars
on 22 September 1992.
<P>

6	
<P>

On 7 December 1990 the plaintiff personally uplifted 13 x-ray films taken at
the hospital between 1985 and 1986 (the earlier x-rays).
 The plaintiff signed
the hospital radiology department release register.  These x-rays now cannot be
located.  
<P>

7	Meanwhile, without the claim being fully particularised and without the
benefit of the plaintiff's expert reports on liability,
the first defendant
obtained a medical report from Dr Sturrock dated 13 December 1990.  Dr Sturrock
in that report commented that
although the plaintiff brought a large number of
x-rays to the examination, there were no recent x-rays.  Dr Sturrock sighted
the
original x-ray taken on 11 July 1985.  He concluded that the plaintiff's
major disability is due to the compound fracture dislocation
of his left ankle
and there would have been "very little difference no matter who looked after
him".  Dr Sturrock wrote further reports
of 23 April 1992 and 3 March 1994.  In
the last report, the doctor had examined the plaintiff and was shown x-rays
dated 18 November
1993 by the plaintiff.  Once again Dr Sturrock said:
<P>

	<b>"In my opinion the condition of the lower part of his left leg was doomed
following the accident in that there is no adequate treatment
that would have
prevented the serious disability which he now has.  The fact that the fracture
of the ulna has not united is not
attributable to any failure in the method
used, that is internal fixation.  The ulna is notorious in not uniting and he
now required
a bone graft for his ulna at some state in the future.  Amputation
is the treatment that the patient now wishes to have and I agree
that this is
necessary."</b>
<P>

8	Dr Hughes examined the plaintiff and wrote a report for the first defendant
on 18 March 1994.  Dr Hughes noted that he saw only
one x-ray dated 18 November
1993.  Dr Hughes stated:
<P>

	<b>"...At this stage I can only make some preliminary comments, as I really
need to see this man's original x-rays and x-rays taken before
and after the
alleged fall in the hospital during treatment.  At this stage my main
observation is that in view of the severe nature
of this man's initial
injuries, I consider the appropriate course of action would have been for him
to be stabilised at Griffith
Hospital, and transferred to (for example) Wagga,
which I understand is approximately 160 km away.  He could have been
transferred
quite safely there in a few hours without any serious risk, after
his general condition was stabilised.  There he could have been
operated on by
an experienced orthopaedic surgeon.  I note that Dr Den Houting is not a
trained orthopaedic surgeon, and I think
it is unwise for somebody who is not a
trained orthopaedic surgeon to treat such severe orthopaedic injuries.
However, this is not
to say that Dr Houting (sic), having made a decision to
treat this man, was negligent in the way he treated him.  Infection is an
unfortunate complication of a compound fracture, and no matter how careful the
treatment is, infection can sometimes occur.  This
does not imply that any
negligence has been involved in the treatment.  In this particular case, this
man would have ended up with
severe residual disability of his left lower limb
whatever treatment was carried out.  I am unable to say at this state, without
seeing the x-rays, why he has developed a mal-union of the fracture of the left
femur..."</b>
<P>

9	The plaintiff has served a report dated 28 April 1992 of Dr Nicholls, an
orthopaedic surgeon who had treated him once.  Dr Nicholls
reported that he did
not have details of the operative procedures undertaken.  It appears that he
viewed x-rays but he did not specify
which ones they were.  It is his view that
the major ongoing problem was the result of an infection in the plaintiff's
injured left
ankle joint resulting in joint surface 
<P>

destruction and the need for subsequent surgery to the ankle.  Dr Nicholls
commented that the operative or post-operative infection
following internal
fixation or other operative treatment to fractures is an uncommon though
recognised complication of such surgery.
<P>

10	Dr Pike has written a report dated 13 May 1992 but he viewed only recent
x-rays.  Dr Robinson who wrote a report dated 5 February
1991 appears to have
been a treating orthopeadic surgeon.  His report does not refer to any x-rays
and is largely unhelpful.
<P>

11	On 13 August 1996 Dr Roebuck orthopaedic surgeon, provided the plaintiff's
solicitor with a written report.  He commented that:
<P>

	<b>"X-rays of the left ankle that are available show non reduction of a
fracture of the talus associated with a fracture through the
body of the talus
and gradual collapse of the body from avascular necrosis and absorption.  The
final films shows the lower end of
the tibia articulating with the osscalsus
and residual neck and head of the talus riding anteriorly."</b>
<P>

12	Dr Roebuck also commented that a necessary x-ray view was not taken after
the last attempt at reduction which was 27 July 1985.
 He went on to say that
it seemed possible that because this x-ray was not taken it was thought that
all was well and this was a
mistake.
<P>

13	As previously stated the earlier x-rays cannot now be found.  On 14 May 1996
the plaintiff's solicitor asked the plaintiff the
results of his search for
x-rays and the plaintiff informed him that a search was to be conducted at his
sister's house at Narrandera,
although he recalled having personally delivered
the x-rays to Dr Sturrock on the occasion he attended an examination on behalf
of
the first defendant.  On 9 May 1996 the plaintiff told Ms Dawson, a clerk in
the employ of his solicitor, that he remembered giving
Dr Sturrock the earlier
x-rays and being sent downstairs for fresh x-rays.  On 30 June 1996 the
plaintiff repeated to his solicitor
that he took the x-rays to an appointment
with Dr Sturrock in Sydney.  At the conclusion of the examination the plaintiff
recalled
being directed to a radiologist  who was located at the time in the
same building as Dr Sturrock's rooms.  The solicitor has made
enquiries of
Sydney X-rays and the x-rays are not there.  On 9 May 1996 Ms Dawson made
enquiries of Dr Hughes' secretary who practices
in the same building as Dr
Sturrock.  Dr Sturrock has retired and she knew of no way of contacting him.
Ms Dawson checked with Wagga
Base hospital x-ray department, Dr Vander Ryt's
secretary and Dr Alan Nicholls and Narrandera district hospital without
success.
<P>

14	In 1990 Dr Sturrock viewed the 13 x-rays taken between 1985 and 1986
(earlier x-rays) and provided a report favourable to the
defendant as it is his
opinion that the fact that the fractures of the ulna had not united is not
attributable to the internal fixation
method used.  Dr Sturrock does not
mention whether the defendants' treatment in relation to an infection was
proper and this subsequently
has become an issue.  Dr Hughes did not see the
earlier x-rays.  He commented on the infection but is unable to comment in
relation
to the malunion of the left femur without seeing these earlier x-rays.
Dr Pike reviewed only recent x-rays.
<P>

15	Although Dr Roebuck does not stipulate which x-rays he viewed, his report
seems to indicate that he saw some of the x-rays taken
prior to 27 July 1985.
If this is so, it would seem that the plaintiff had the 13 x-rays 
<P>

in his possession in 1996 ie., well after he took them to Dr Sturrock.  In
light of this inconsistency, the evidence of the plaintiff
explaining whether
or not the earlier x-rays were provided to Dr Roebuck was vital.  It has not
been given.  The plaintiff has not
sworn an affidavit.  
<P>

16	I turn to the law.  The defendants submitted that the plaintiff has breached
the Supreme Court Rules namely Part 16 rules 1 and
4 in failing to provide
particulars; Part 36 r 13A(3) in failing to provide experts reports and Part 33
r 6(2) and (3) in failing
to comply with court orders made on 24 September 1998
and in failing to serve proper Part 33 particulars.  
<P>

17	The power of the courts to dismiss an action for default or want of
prosecution should be exercised only where the plaintiff's
default has been
intentional and contumelious or where there has been inordinate and inexcusable
delay on his or his lawyer's part
giving rise to a substantial risk that a fair
trial would not be possible due to serious prejudice to the defendants:
<b><u>Birkett v James</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2All ER 801</a>;  AC 297 at 318.  In each
case, a balance must be struck between the plaintiff and the defendant and the
court must decide whether
or not, in all the circumstances, justice requires
that the proceedings should be dismissed:  <b><u>Witten v Lombard Australia
Ltd</u></b> (1968) 88 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 405 at 411;  <b><u>Southern Cross
Exploration NL v Fire &amp; All Risks Insurance Co Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20NSWLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4 NSWLR
491</a>;  <b><u>McKenna v McKenna</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1984/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] VicRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20VR%20665" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] VR 665.</a>
<P>

18	In <b><u>Stollznow v Calvert</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 749</a> Moffitt P held that
the discretion to dismiss proceedings for want of prosecution is to be
exercised for each case upon its own facts
by deciding whether, on striking a
balance between the plaintiff and the defendant, justice demands that the
action should be dismissed.
 The judgment makes it clear that the discretion is
not confined and that authority does not and cannot establish the weight to be
given to particular classes of facts or circumstances.  
<P>

19	Applications of this kind recurringly return attention to particular kinds
of considerations, namely that the conduct of a plaintiff
himself and his
contribution to delay is considered separately from conduct, contribution and
defaults of his solicitor, but it is
not the law that a litigant has no
involvement in his solicitor's shortcomings or that they are not relevant.  It
is not the responsibility
of a litigant to ensure that his opponent is
adequately represented or to point out steps which his opponent's
representatives ought
to take to advance the claim against him.  In relation to
delay, the longer it continues the more difficult becomes the determination
of
factual issues because dim memories and unavailable witnesses render the
elucidation of the truth more difficult to ascertain.
 Prejudice both actual
and presumed should be considered.
<P>

20	In <b><u>Clarke v Sippe &amp; Ors</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported, 6 May 1998)
Sully J, in relation to an appeal from a decision that proceedings be struck
out for want of prosecution
stated:
<P>

	<b>"I think that it would be entirely wrong in principle to permit the present
plaintiff to have the benefit of a pleading which fails
even to attempt that
proper particularisation of which the relevant Rules speak.</b>
<P>

<b>	I would myself be inclined to take such a view in any event, for the reason
that, in my own view, the time has come for the Court
to insist, albeit within
those limits </b>
<P>

<b>that prudence and fairness might suggest to be appropriate in individual
cases, upon the general proposition that the Rules mean what
they say, and
therefore ought in general to be enforced firmly and according to their
tenor.</b>
<P>

<b>	The propriety and the efficacy of such an approach are strengthened, so far
as I am concerned and in the present particular case,
by the considerations of
time to which I have already referred.  There is something badly wrong with the
course of curial proceedings
that permits such a claim as the plaintiff now
asserts to limp along for twelve or thirteen years, not only without then
achieving
a final result, but without so much as achieving finality in the
pleadings, and in the proper and efficient crystallisation of issues
for
trial."</b>
<P>

21	I turn to the exercise of discretion to grant the relief sought in the
motion.   The plaintiff's counsel stated that all the
reports with the
exception of a possible one have been served.  This indicates that the
plaintiff has still not complied with the
timetable set by the court on the
last occasion.  It is also true that the plaintiff did not comply with court
orders in respect
of the filing of the notice of motion and Part 33
particulars.  When a timetable was set on the last occasion before the court,
the
fact that the plaintiff resided in Townsville was taken into account.
Neither the plaintiff nor his solicitor has not offered any
explanation as to
why these orders were not complied with.  The Part 33 particulars which were
filed on 8 April 1999, two months
after the due date and are incomplete.  In
relation to the claim of economic loss pleaded in the Part 33 particulars,
there are no
details of the amount he has earned when he has been employed by
several employers.  He is relying on comparable employees' wage
records of
truck drivers yet none have been supplied.  
<P>

He makes a claim for domestic and personal care.  No reports have been served
as to the type of care needed and the number of hours
per week required.  As
the plaintiff may be facing amputation of his left foot, these claims may be
substantial.  There may still
be some particulars outstanding at least so far
as the second defendant is concerned.
<P>

22	According to the defendants, the effect of the combined breaches is that
over 13 years after events occurred and over 8 years
since the proceedings have
been commenced the defendants are not aware of the case they have to meet.  As
far as the plaintiff is
concerned he has particularised his claim and served
all but one of his reports.  I do not accept that the defendants do not know
the case they have to meet but I do accept that after 13 years the memories of
the doctors and hospital staff and the plaintiff will
have dimmed.  I accept
that there is presumptive prejudice which has been caused by the plaintiff's
failure to prosecute these proceedings
with due dispatch.
<P>

23	The defendants also submitted that they were irredeemably prejudiced and
cannot now obtain a fair trial because the x-rays which
formed the crucial
determination to operate are not available having been taken from the second
defendant by the plaintiff.  Without
those early x-rays the defendants
submitted that there is no proof of what was done, how it was done whether the
x-rays themselves
were taken and what else they should have done.  There is no
indication as to the seriousness of the plaintiff's ankle condition
upon his
arrival at the hospital and then following surgery.   
<P>

24	The defendant also submitted that the particulars provided of negligence are
"of the usual form" and so general as to be useless.
 I give little weight to
this submission with respect, the particulars that were requested were general
so it could have been anticipated
that general answers would be given.
<P>

25	It is a drastic step to deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity of having a
trial on its merits particularly where the plaintiff
may be facing amputation
of his left foot.  The defendants have not provided evidence to show that they
cannot locate Dr Sturrock.
 It appears that Dr Sturrock and maybe Dr Roebuck
have seen the earlier x-rays.  These x-rays can no longer be located having
been
released into the plaintiff's possession.  The blame for the loss of the
x-rays rest with the plaintiff.  It is my view that the
x-rays are of crucial
importance for the defendants to properly prepare their case and the reports of
Dr Sturrock do not overcome
the difficulties occasioned by the loss of the
earlier x-rays.  There is now no radiological evidence, no proof of what was
done
during the operation and the condition of firstly the left ankle after the
motor vehicle accident and upon arrival at hospital and
secondly after the
operation.  This leads me to the conclusion that the defendants will be unable
to have a fair trial and that they
have suffered significant prejudice.
Additionally the plaintiff has failed to comply with a court imposed timetable
and has provided
no adequate explanation to the court for this default.
<P>

26	I have reluctantly come to the view that justice is best served if the
proceedings are dismissed.  Costs should follow the event.
 The plaintiff is to
pay the defendants' costs of the motions and the proceedings.  As the
proceedings have been dismissed, I need
make no orders in relation to the
plaintiff's notice of motion seeking to amend the statement of claim.
<P>

27	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The proceedings are dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of the motion and of the
proceedings.
