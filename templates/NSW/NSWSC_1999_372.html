MASTER MALPASS
<P>

March 1999
<P>

<u>10692/98   -   Firth v Westbury</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff is a solicitor.  His firm acted for the defendant in two
District Court proceedings.  Claims for damages were made
in respect of two
motor vehicle accidents.
<P>

2	The plaintiff presented the defendant with a proposed costs agreement for
each of the proceedings.  There was a lengthy conversation
had concerning the
proposed agreements.  It appears that the proposed agreements were not
acceptable to the defendant.  She prepared
her own agreement.  It is set forth
in a letter dated 11 March 1995.  It contained provision for costs on the
following basis:-
<P>

"Your firm pays all future disbursements.  If the verdict is against me, then I
do not pay anything; if the verdict is for me, then
from whatever the Court
awards me:
<P>

Firstly, you pay me $717.50 for disbursements I have paid thus far for these 2
cases (for police reports, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">36</a> Certificates, medical report
fees, Police accident report fees, District Court filing fees, Process Service
fees etc)
<P>

Secondly, you reimburse your firm for disbursements paid on my behalf (this is
not to include office type expenses such as photocopying,
postage, stationery,
phone calls, misc)
<P>

Thirdly, you pay your firm for acting on my behalf, an amount less than or
equal to half the balance of whatever the Court awards
less the two
disbursement items above (this amount you are paid for your services includes
the office type expenses noted above)
<P>

You pay me the balance.  ie whatever the Court awards less the three items
above (this is at least half the balance of whatever
the Court awards less the
2 disbursements items above)."
<P>

3	The plaintiff advised that he was prepared to proceed on the basis of the fee
agreement set out in the letter.
<P>

4	I should digress to say at this stage that it was argued by the plaintiff
that this agreement should, to put it broadly, be seen
as an amendment of the
proposed agreements.  I do not accept that submission.
<P>

5	The two District Court proceedings were settled.  In one of the proceedings,
the plaintiff obtained judgment in the sum of $35,000
(inclusive of costs).  In
the other proceedings, there was judgment for the defendant and no order was
made as to costs.
<P>

6	Prior to the settlement, an authority to settle was given by the plaintiff.
It contained, inter alia, the following:-
<P>

"15.	In that document the defendant  in her own hand has written:
<P>

	`As per our fee agreement $717.50 is paid to me.  You then reimburse
yourselves for your disbursements on my behalf.  Julia has
said that this is
$880.  Another $190 is paid for outstanding medical expenses.  The balance of
$35,000 rounded is $16,600 which
you may charge for acting on my behalf as
maximum as agreement.  Comcare, being as yet an unknown figure, can be taken
out of my
amount.' "
<P>

7	A Memorandum Of Fees And Disbursements was prepared in respect of each of the
proceedings.  Both were dated 30 August 1995.  In
each of the proceedings, the
amount charged was $8,053.75.  The payment of each account was effected by the
transfer of moneys from
trust to general account.
<P>

8	The defendant (who was the plaintiff in those proceedings) applied for an
assessment of costs under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act, 1987</a></i> (the
<i>Act</i>).  There was a reference to a Costs Assessor (Mr Hattersley).
Thereafter, submissions were made to Mr Hattersley.  The plaintiff
submitted,
inter alia, that reliance was placed on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208c.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208C</a> of the <i>Act</i> and that
the Costs Assessor should decline to assess the bill of costs.
<P>

9	By letter dated 18 March 1997, Mr Hattersley informed the plaintiff, inter
alia, as follows:-
<P>

"I take the view that the agreement made by you with Ms Westbury is void and is
of no effect (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s188.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 188</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>).
<P>

In these circumstances it seems to me that there is no costs agreement in
existence between you and your client and there has been
a failure by you to
comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s175.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 175</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s178.html" class="autolink_findacts">178</a> of the Act.
<P>

The applicant is entitled to an assessment of your costs and disbursements in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208A</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208b.html" class="autolink_findacts">208B</a> of the Act and I therefore require that
you furnish to me two detailed bills of costs relating to the legal services
provided by
you to Ms Westbury for which you charged her the fees paid to you
in the amounts specified in your two lump sum memoranda of fees
dated 30 August
1995."
<P>

10	The correspondence reveals that the plaintiff contemplated the bringing of
an appeal against the decision made by the Costs Assessor.
 However, no appeal
was then brought and the assessment proceeded.  The plaintiff made the decision
to prepare detailed bills of
costs as required by the Costs Assessor (this was
done "under protest and without prejudice to our right to appeal" - see letter
dated 24 April 1997).  The detailed bills were then furnished to Mr Hattersley.
These purported to be prepared in accordance with
the District Court scale.
The defendant raised objections and the plaintiff responded to those
objections.  A determination was made
by the Costs Assessor.
<P>

11	A Certificate As To Determination Of Costs was issued on 23 February 1998.
The Certificate allowed the costs in the sum of $9,309.50.
 The Certificate was
forwarded under cover of a letter dated 23 February 1998.  The letter contains
material relevant to the reaching
of this determination.
<P>

12	On 17 March 1998, the plaintiff filed a Summons.  It purports, inter alia,
to be an appeal from the Certificate issued on 23
February 1998.  The Summons
contains "Grounds of Appeal".  These grounds, inter alia, seek to challenge the
decision made as to the
costs agreement prepared by the defendant.  It asserts
error as a matter of law.
<P>

13	The appeal was heard on 25 March 1999.  At the conclusion of the hearing,
judgment was reserved.  Later that day, a facsimile
from counsel for the
plaintiff was transmitted to the Court (the original facsimile).  The facsimile
made reference to inter alia
certain decided cases.  It provoked a flurry of
further facsimiles.  On 26 March 1999, there were two facsimiles from the
solicitor
for the defendant (inter alia;  the opportunity to make further short
submissions was sought).  On the same day, there was a facsimile
from the
defendant herself and it requested that contact be made with her (not her
solicitor) when judgment was to be delivered.
 This facsimile sought to canvass
matters other than those raised by the references contained in the facsimile
from counsel for the
plaintiff.  Also on that same day a further facsimile was
received from counsel for the plaintiff.  It enclosed a photocopy of a
page
from the Law Society Journal.
<P>

14	It was in these circumstances, that steps were taken by the Court to have
the matter relisted.  It was set down for further hearing
on Thursday 22 April
1999.  Notice of this hearing date was given to counsel for the plaintiff, the
solicitor for the defendant and
the defendant herself.  On that day, the
parties were given the opportunity to make submissions on matters arising out
of the references
mentioned in the original facsimile (being the facsimile from
counsel for the plaintiff transmitted on 25 March 1999).
<P>

15	Following the completion of those submissions, counsel for the plaintiff
made an application for leave to reopen and adduce further
evidence.  The
initial application contemplated the adducing of oral evidence from the
solicitor for the defendant (Mr Geikie). 
As this course may have involved an
adjournment of the proceedings and the defendant employing other legal
representation it was
subsequently sought to tender documentation only (which
appears to have concerned the matter of Mr Geikie's retainer).
<P>

16	The granting of such leave is discretionary.  I was not satisfied that the
plaintiff had demonstrated an entitlement to leave
(inter alia on the grounds
that I was not satisfied that the proposed evidence was admissible in the
appellate proceedings). 
<P>

17	I now return to the subject matter of the appeal itself.  The <i>Act</i>
contains two appellate provisions.  Section 208L of the <i>Act</i> provides an
avenue of appeal where there is dissatisfaction with a decision of a costs
assessor as to a matter of law arising in
the proceedings to determine the
application for assessment.  Section 208M enables the seeking of leave to
appeal against the determination
of the application made by the Costs Assessor.
The plaintiff does not seek relief under section 208M.
<P>

18	The case for the plaintiff is that the Costs Assessor should have declined
to assess the costs because there was a costs agreement
that satisfied the
requirements specified in section 208C.  It is common ground that the approach
taken by the Costs Assessor involved
a rejection of the plaintiff's
contention.
<P>

19	I do not accept the plaintiff's submission to the effect that a decision in
the relevant sense was not made on this matter until
the issue of the
Certificate of Determination.  It seems to me that the terms "decision" and
"determination" are not intended to
be synonymous.  There are significant
differences in the terminology used in the two appellate provisions.  In the
case of section
208L, the appeal lies in respect of a decision (not "against
the determination of the application") arising in the proceedings to
determine
the application.  It has in contemplation a "decision" made at any stage during
those proceedings.  The questions thrown
up by these matters were not fully
argued and can be put aside for another day.  For present purposes, it suffices
to say that the
resolution of an issue raised pursuant to section 208C may
constitute a decision of a costs assessor as a matter of law arising in
the
proceedings to determine the application for assessment.  In this case, I
consider that he made a decision in the relevant sense.
<P>

20	I consider that the time for the bringing of an appeal against that decision
ran from the date of its making.  I have had regard
to the material referred to
in the original facsimile and the further submissions made in respect of it.  I
do not consider that
the material assists in the resolution of the questions
raised in this case.  The material mentions inter alia two cases which came
before Ireland J on 31 July 1996 (involving <u>Boris Ganke and Peter Andrew
Somerset &amp; Co)</u>.  The parties have not been able to locate a copy of the
judgment delivered in respect of those cases.  The Court has merely been
shown
a copy of an article written by Susan Pattison in the Law Society Journal.  The
article contains some discussion concerning
those cases.
<P>

21	It seems to me that these proceedings are doomed to failure.  The appeal is
not competent.  It is brought well out of time. 
The decision which the Summons
seeks to challenge was made in March 1997.  The appeal which the plaintiff now
seeks to maintain was
not brought until 17 March 1998.  Instead of bringing an
appeal within the prescribed time, the plaintiff proceeded with the
determination
of the application by way of the assessment process required by
the Costs Assessor in his letter dated 18 March 1997 (in the present
circumstances, I do not regard the protest and attempt to reserve rights of
appeal as being of moment).  The Costs Assessor proceeded
with the assessment
bearing in mind the provisions of sections 208A and 208B.  He assessed the
bills prepared by the plaintiff having
regard to the submissions made to him
(including the defendant's objections and the plaintiff's response to those
objections).  In
this case, it is not necessary to dwell on the consequences of
the plaintiff's participation in the assessment process.
<P>

22	For completeness, it may be of assistance if a few further observations are
made.  The mere identification of error may not bring
about an entitlement to
relief.  There needs to be utility in the exercise.  It was open to the Costs
Assessor to reject the submission
founded on section 208C (without having
regard to the provisions of section 188).  The agreement prepared by the
defendant does not
satisfy, inter alia, the requirements of (1)(b).  If this
agreement does offend the prohibition contained in section 188, the
inconsistency
extends only to a part of it.  In respect of this part, the
plaintiff merely says that it was for the benefit of the defendant and
placed a
cap or maximum on the amount of costs payable by her.  If this is the case,
from the plaintiff's point of view, the validity
of this part of the agreement
is probably immaterial.  It does not otherwise provide for, inter alia, the
professional fees payable
by the defendant.  The professional fees in fact
rendered by the plaintiff in August 1995 do not appear to be calculated having
regard
to any specified rate and the total of the fees and disbursements
approached the maximum.
<P>

23	To the extent that there was a challenge to the sufficiency of the
disclosure of the reasoning process between the decision to
reject the
plaintiff's contention, I am not satisfied that the challenge can be
maintained.
<P>

24	For completeness, perhaps I should make reference to what was said in
paragraphs 16 and 19 of Madden v NSW IMC  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/196.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 196</a> and in the earlier
judgment delivered in <u>Bacha v Pettersen</u> (3 December 1998).
<P>

25	The plaintiff may well feel that events have unfolded somewhat unfairly.  It
is a state of affairs that may merit some sympathy.
 However, he does appear to
have unwittingly been the maker of at least some of the problems.
<P>

26	The onus showing an entitlement to relief rests with the plaintiff.  In my
view, that onus has not been discharged.  
<P>

27	The Summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
Summons.
<P>
