<b>JUDGMENT NO. 11</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1	On 9 April 1999 I ruled that evidence which the Crown wished to adduce as to
the identity of Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar in certain
covertly recorded
conversations was admissible, subject to arguments yet to be put on a basis not
argued to date.
<P>

2	The conversations were recorded via listening device and telephone intercept
and occurred at 8/42 Newman Street, Merrylands. 
The speakers recorded
allegedly include, so far as is relevant, the accused, Mr Sleiman and Ms
Cassar.  Ms Cassar, through her counsel,
conceded that the voices included his
client as alleged by the Crown.  Mr Sleiman did not concede that the voices in
the recorded
conversations were his or Ms Cassar's.
<P>

3	The evidence sought to be led by the Crown in proof against Mr Sleiman that
the conversations did include Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar
is oral evidence by Det
Sgt McNab (which I heard on the voir dire), evidence by a Mr Rizk (whose
statement was tendered on the voir
dire) and other evidence which for the
purpose of the ruling it was conceded the Crown would be in a position to
call.
<P>

4	I will deal first with the evidence tending to establish Mr Sleiman's
voice.
<P>

5	The evidence of Det Sgt McNab, as given on the voir dire, was that between 3
December 1997 and 11 December 1997 he listened to
recorded conversations which
included some hours of a male voice.  He then met Mr Sleiman in person on 11
December 1997 when a search
warrant was executed.  A video of that search,
carried out in Mr Sleiman's presence, was tendered on the voir dire.  Mr
Sleiman spoke
on that occasion.  Det Sgt McNab said Mr Sleiman's voice, as
heard on 11 December 1997, was the same as the male voice he had heard
in the
recorded conversations.  Det Sgt McNab said he then listened to conversations
recorded after 11 December 1997.  On 8 June
1998, Det Sgt McNab again attended
on the execution of a search warrant at the flat.  Mr Sleiman spoke again on
that occasion.  Again,
a video record was made.  Det Sgt McNab said additional
conversation with Mr Sleiman occurred off camera.  Det Sgt McNab said Mr
Sleiman's voice on that occasion was the same as in the recorded
conversations.
<P>

6	The statement by Mr Rizk, tendered on the voir dire, was to the effect that
he knew Mr Sleiman before these events.  He said a
taped conversation
purporting to be a record of a telephone conversation between him and Mr
Sleiman, being one of the recorded conversations
which the Crown wished to put
into evidence, was a conversation with Mr Sleiman.
<P>

7	The facts as to which it was conceded the Crown was in a position to adduce
evidence were as follows:
<P>

&#183;	That various persons, including Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar, came and went
from the home unit block or building, as distinct
from Unit 8 in particular.
<P>

&#183;	That conversations occurred in the flat where persons used and
identified the other by the names of Emad and Leanne (being
the first names of
Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar).
<P>

&#183;	That a conversation occurred on 4 December 1997 between a male person
and Merrylands police officers unrelated to this matter
where the male person
was spoken to about other criminal conduct. (The Crown conceded that this was
of no value without further evidence.)
<P>

&#183;	That the flat was leased in the name of Mr Sleiman's sister.
<P>

8	The concession concerning Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar going in and out of the
building is supplemented by the Crown being able to
prove that the times of
entry into and/or exit from the particular flat (as indicated by the opening
and closing of the flat door)
and/or the times of commencement and/or
termination of conversations in the flat are conformable with the times of
entry into and/or
exit from the flat building by Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar (Tr
220).  (I have taken what was stated in court in the disjunctive sense
in which
I have paraphrased it.)  The Crown Prosecutor said he understood that was not
in issue (Tr 220).  There was no dissent by
counsel for the accused.  I should
take this as common ground.
<P>

9	In<i> Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%207%20NSWLR%20444" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 7 NSWLR 444</a>, the accused was charged with murder and
other offences committed on the same occasion.  A witness heard voices, one of
which implicated
the speaker in the offences charged.  Nine months later, the
accused conducted his own defence in court.  The witness listened to
him in
court cross-examining another witness.  She gave evidence that within five
minutes or so she recognised the accused's voice
as that of the assailant she
had heard at the time of the crime nine months earlier.  She said the voice she
remembered at the time
of the crime was a rough Australian voice, gruff at
times, loud at times but at times going to a higher pitch, a bit whiny, a wingy
sort of voice and the manner was rude, pushy and very domineering.  The
evidence was left to the jury.
<P>

10	The accused was convicted and appealed.  Lee J (whom Street CJ and Maxwell J
agreed) said that the trial judge was right to leave
the evidence to the jury.
The appeal was allowed because of misdirection not presently relevant.  In the
course of his judgment Lee
J (at 450) quoted the following passage from the
summing up:
<P>

"Basically then for identification to be reliable of a voice with which one is
not previously familiar, the law requires that the
voice unlike the appearance
of a person - must be found to have very distinctive characteristics, very
distinctive characteristics,
firstly because of the intrinsic qualities of the
voice and secondly because of the circumstances in which it was used so that
the
totality of the qualities of the voice, both in intrinsic qualities and
those brought out by its use in those circumstances, make
it readily
recognisable to a witness who is not previously familiar with that voice."
<P>

11	It is apparent from what follows in Lee J's judgment that he regarded that
as a correct statement of legal principle.
<P>

12	The requirement of distinctive characteristics did not apply where the
witness was familiar with the voice prior to the event.
<P>

13	The facts of <i>Brownlowe </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%207%20NSWLR%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 7 NSWLR 461</a> (decided eight months after
<i>Smith</i>) were similar.  Two witnesses heard the voice of one of the
offenders at an armed robbery.  At the trial the witnesses heard the
voice of
the accused.  In this case though, they were not so sure about the
identification as in <i>Smith</i>.  They described the voice of the accused
relevant at the crime as softly and calmly spoken and as having an Australian
accent. 
One witness said the voice of the accused was similar and the other
that she was fairly certain it was the same voice because it
was so similar.
The accused was convicted and appealed.
<P>

14	On appeal Hunt J (with whom Finlay and Brownie JJ agreed) referred to a
lengthy judgment given by the trial judge, O'Brien J,
in<i> Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20NSWLR%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1
NSWLR 462</a> concerning the admissibility of voice identification evidence.  Hunt
J summarised part of that judgment as follows:
<P>

"Mainly basing his decision upon the American authorities, O'Brien CJ of
Criminal Division concluded (at 477) that a witness giving
evidence identifying
the accused by his voice must either have recognised that voice at the time of
the crime because of his previous
familiarity with it or, where he had no such
previous familiarity, have recognised that voice at some subsequent occasion
because
it was very distinctive when he first heard it at the time of the
crime.  When dealing with the facts of that particular case, his
Honour twice
referred (at 482, 485) to the need for the evidence of a witness on this issue
to be that the distinctive features of
a voice first heard at the time of the
crime were such that the jury could accept that an indelible mental impression
had been left
in the witness's mind, thus permitting the conclusion safely to
be drawn that the two voices were the same."
<P>

15	Hunt J went on to say that O'Brien J's judgment was approved on appeal in<i>
Smith</i>.  I have not noticed where that occurred, but the judgment is to same
effect as the summing-up which<i> was</i> approved on appeal.  The alternative
requirements of previous familiarity and distinctive character were adopted in
<i>Brownlowe</i>.  Because there was no previous familiarity, the test was
distinctive character.  The case failed the test and the conviction was
quashed.
<P>

16	The same approach in point of principle was taken in <i>Brotherton
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%2095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 95.</a>  The conviction for a sexual assault, was quashed
because of a misdirection not presently relevant.  The issue as to whether
there
should be a new trial gave rise to the question  as to whether there was
admissible evidence of identification.
<P>

17	The complainant had spoken to the accused for about ten minutes two days
before the assault and the assailant had spoken at the
time of the assault.
She described the voice as a really low, husky voice.
<P>

18	Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Wood and Sharpe JJ agreed) referred to <i>Smith</i>
and <i>Brownlowe</i>.  He restated the alternatives (at 106), introducing - I
think for the first time - the word "very" into the first alternative ("where
the witness is very familiar with the voice before hearing it at the crime").
His Honour went on to say (at 106):
<P>

"But it is clear that the particularly distinctive characteristics of the
voices were required in both cases in order to enable
it to be recognised by
the witness for the first time <i>subsequently</i> to the crime.  Such
characteristics are not said to have been required in order to enable a voice
which was already familiar to the
witness to be recognised <i>at</i> the crime.
In the second situation, the recognition occurs at the time of the crime; it
does not occur as a result of the circumstances
in which recognition for the
first time usually occurs subsequently.  Where someone is already familiar with
the voice <i>before </i>the crime, the recognition does not depend upon any
particularly distinctive characteristics of the voice; it occurs as a result of
that familiarity.  A good test is to ask a person to describe the distinctive
characteristics of his or her spouse's voice.  Such
a description is unlikely
to be forthcoming with any precision, but the voice will nevertheless always be
recognisable by that person.
 Accordingly, I reject the argument that, in a
case where a witness recognises the already familiar voice of the accused <i>at
</i>the time of the crime, his or her evidence is inadmissible unless it is
shown that the voice was sufficiently distinctive as to make
its
characteristics memorable."
<P>

19	There was other evidence in <i>Brotherton</i> tending to prove the identity
of the offender, including a tattoo noticed by the complainant.  His Honour
went on (at 106):
<P>

"The issue which arose as to the admissibility of the complainant's evidence in
the present case depended upon the extent of her
familiarity with the
appellant's voice.  The complainant had spoken to the appellant only the once
before the assault upon her, two
days earlier and then only for ten minutes.
She had not spoken to him when she saw him again earlier on the day when the
offences
were committed.  Yet she said that the man who had sexually assaulted
her had the <i>same</i> voice as that which she had heard earlier, and that the
voice was one of the factors which had led her to recognise him at the time.
It was the appellant whom she named when she woke the foreman shortly after the
offences and made a complaint.
<P>

If that had been all, I would have considerable doubt whether the complainant's
familiarity with the appellant's voice would have
been sufficient for the voice
identification by way of recognition to go to the jury."
<P>

20	The use of other evidence to support evidence of voice identification is to
be noted.  The same approach was taken in <i>Heuston</i> (CCA NSW, 20 June
1995, unreported) (per Hunt CJ at CL, McInerney and Smart JJ).
<P>

21	The authorities to which I have referred appear to limit the familiarity
test to familiarity prior to the occasion in question
and the distinctive
quality test to recognition subsequent to the occasion in question.  I do not
see why this should be so.  A voice
with distinctive qualities may be heard,
remembered and then recognised on a later occasion.  That point does not,
however, arise
in the present case.
<P>

22	It should also be noticed that, despite the scant evidence of prior
familiarity, Hunt J in <i>Brotherton</i> left open whether the evidence of
voice identification would have been sufficient to go to the jury on its own.
He doubted that it
would have been, but he did not say it would not.
<P>

23	An approach contrary to the <i>Smith</i> line of authority, adopted in
Victoria and Tasmania, is that the degree of familiarity and the
distinctiveness of quality do not
go to the admissibility of the evidence but
only to the weight a jury might give to it.  (the references are given in
<i>Bulejcik </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20135%20ALR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 135 ALR 517</a>, 530).  Under that approach, those
considerations would, of course, remain relevant to the question as to whether
the evidence should
be excluded on discretionary grounds.
<P>

24	<i>Bulejcik</i> concerned the capacity of a jury to make a comparison
between the accused's voice in a recorded conversation and as heard in court.
I read the judgment of Brennan CJ in <i>Bulejcik </i> as supporting the
alternative approach.  On the other hand, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, cited<i>
Smith</i>, <i>Brownlowe</i> and <i>Brotherton</i> with apparent approval (at
530).  (I would mention that they also stated the familiarity test as
applicable to prior experience of
the accused's voice and the distinctive
quality test as applicable to subsequent experience of the voice.)  McHugh and
Gummow JJ
said it was arguable that <i>Smith </i>was wrongly decided and
appeared to favour the Victorian approach, but they found it unnecessary to
decide that question. 
<P>

25	There was no majority view in <i>Bulejcik</i> upholding or over-ruling<i>
Smith</i>.  Furthermore, the views on <i>Smith</i> in <i>Bulejcik</i> were all
obiter, except possibly that of Brennan J.
<P>

26	No authority as to any threshold test other than I have mentioned was cited
in argument before me.  The <i>Smith</i> line of authority is binding on me, if
applicable.
<P>

27	The applicability of the<i> Smith</i> line of authority to the present case
is not entirely clear but clear enough.  This is not a case of identifying the
accused as the
person present at the crime by identification of his voice.
This is a case of identifying the speaker in recorded conversations heard
by
the witness as the accused, who subsequently speaks to the witness person to
person.  Det Sgt McNab asserts a familiarity with
a voice by listening to
recorded conversations and says that, on meeting Mr Sleiman subsequently, he
recognised Mr Sleiman's voice
as that voice.  The difference is apparent.  But
there is no distinction in principles.  Indeed, it was common ground in the
submissions
by the Crown Prosecutor (Tr 228) and by counsel for Mr Sleiman (Tr
243) that there was a threshold test for the admissibility of
voice
identification evidence and that the test in this case - by whatever route -
was familiarity.  In my view, the <i>Smith</i> line of authority should be
applied, and familiarity is the test.
<P>

28	As to familiarity, I take the<i> Smith</i> line of authority to refer to the
kind of familiarity that would enable a person to recognise the voice on a
later occasion without
necessarily being able to specify distinctive
characteristics in the voice.
<P>

29	Counsel for Mr Sleiman submitted, first, that prior exposure to the voice in
the recorded conversations was not sufficient to
satisfy the test of
familiarity, and that exposure at the meetings when search warrants were
executed was inadequate to enable the
witness to make an identification based
on prior exposure to the voice.
<P>

30	I disagree.  Det Sgt McNab's exposure to Mr Sleiman's voice was substantial
in relation to each of the following:  exposure to
recorded conversations prior
to 11 December 1997, in person on 11 December 1997, to recorded conversations
after 11 December 1997,
and in person on 8 January 1998.  Exposure prior to 11
December 1997 was sufficient to make the witness familiar with Mr Sleiman's
voice.  Subsequent exposure reinforced that familiarity.
<P>

31	Having regard to the extent of exposure prior to and on 11 December 1997, a
jury, properly instructed and appropriately warned,
could reasonably find that
the degree of familiarity acquired prior to 11 December 1997 and the extent of
exposure on 11 December
1997 were sufficient to enable the witness to recognise
Mr Sleiman's voice, when he met him in person on 11 December 1997, as the
voice
in the recorded conversations prior to 11 December 1997.
<P>

32	Having regard to the extent of exposure on those occasions and in subsequent
recorded conversations and to the extent of exposure
on 8 January 1998, a jury,
properly instructed and appropriately warned, could reasonably find that the
witness' familiarity with
Mr Sleiman's voice was sufficient to enable him to
recognise Mr Sleiman's voice on 8 January 1998 as the voice in the recorded
conversations
before and after 11 December 1997 as Mr Sleiman's voice.
<P>

33	If I am wrong in regarding the threshold as satisfied for Det Sgt McNab's
evidence alone, the threshold is satisfied when one
has regard to the
additional matters to which I have referred and which contribute to the
identification of Mr Sleiman as the speaker
in the recorded conversations.
<P>

34	As to identification of Ms Cassar, the Crown begins with recorded
conversations between Ms Cassar and members of her family,
being her sister and
her mother.  The mother and sister say the recorded conversations with them are
what they purport to be.  The
Crown then submits that the jury could find that
the balance of the proffered conversations include Ms Cassar as the Crown
alleges,
by comparison of the balance of the recorded conversations with those
authenticated by the mother and sister.
<P>

35	<i>Bulejcik</i> justifies this approach.  In my view, the established
conversations (with the sister and mother) and the other recorded conversations
are sufficient to enable a jury, properly instructed and appropriately warned,
to find that all of the proffered conversations allegedly
involving Ms Cassar
do include her as is alleged.  If that is wrong, the appropriate threshold is
satisfied when one has regard to
the other corroborative matters to which I
have referred.
<P>

36	As a separate argument, counsel for Mr Sleiman submitted that evidence of
voice identification evidence should not be admitted
without or otherwise than
by expert testimony.  Such expert testimony is admissible:  <i>Gilmore</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20935" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2 NSWLR 935</a>; but that does not mean it is required  No direct authority
was cited in favour of such a requirement.  Reference was made to authority
relating to handwriting, but that was distinguished in<i> Bulejcik</i>, where
Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 533) that expert evidence was unnecessary in the
case of voice comparison.  I do not see why
it should be necessary in a case of
voice recognition such as the present case.  That there exists a body of
scientific expertise
on the topic does not logically result in lay opinion
being inadmissible.  I am not persuaded that the evidence is inadmissible on
this ground.
<P>

37	Counsel for Mr Sleiman also referred me compendiously to what appears in
Uniform Evidence Law, S Odgers (3rd ed) pages 322-334.
 The matters referred to
there appear to relate to whether identification evidence should be excluded
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 137</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></i>.  I think that may
remain to be argued as a topic.  I have, therefore, deferred consideration of
the passage I have mentioned.
<P>

38	Accordingly, with the qualification mentioned at the commencement of this
judgment, evidence of recorded conversations and of
the identification of the
voices of Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar should be allowed.  The evidence is as
follows:
<P>

(a)	The tapes of recorded conversations, transcripts of which are Exhibit A on
the voir dire.
<P>

(b)	The transcripts, Exhibit A on the voir dire.
<P>

(c)	The statements, Exhibit B on the voir dire.
<P>

(d)	The log, Exhibit D on the voir dire.
<P>

(e)	The videos of the execution of search warrants on 11 December 1997 and 8
January 1998, Exhibit C and F on the voir dire.
<P>

(f)	Evidence of opening and / or closing of the flat door and / or commencement
and /or termination of conversations in the flat
in conformity with entries and
/ exits by Mr Sleiman and Miss Cassar to or from the flat building.
<P>

(g)	Evidence of Miss Cassar's mother and of her sister authenticating some of
the recorded conversations involving Miss Cassar.
