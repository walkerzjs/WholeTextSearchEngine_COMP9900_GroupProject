<b>JUDGMENT (Preliminary ruling in relation to claim for public interest
immunity by New South Wales Police Service in respect of subpoena
issued by
defendant)</b>
<P>

1	On 26 February 1999 the defendant served a subpoena on the New South Wales
Police Service for the production of the following:
 "<i>All records (that is,
reports, documents, memoranda, records of interview, transcripts of interview,
file notes, computer print-outs,
audio tapes and video tapes) of the meeting
which took place on or about 29 January 1999 between the New South Wales Police
Service
and john Robert Marsden and/or his legal advisers"</i>.
<P>

2	In support of the claim an affidavit of Lola Ann Scott sworn 3 March 1999 was
read by the applicant, the Commissioner of Police
(under subpoena).  Ms Scott
is the Assistant Deputy Commissioner of Police, she annexes the defendant's
subpoena and deposes to having
exhibited to her and placed in a confidential
envelope exhibit LAS 1 constituted by four audio tapes recording an interview
between
Detective Superintendent Michael Woodhouse of the New South Wales
Police Service and John Marsden on 29 January 1999 and a transcript
of those
four tapes.  She claims public interest immunity against production of that
material.  She was informed by Detective Woodhouse
and believed that the
plaintiff participated in the interview with him on the basis that the record
of that interview would be kept
confidential.
<P>

3	Ms Scott goes on to say "<i>it is in the public interest for people who are
being investigated by Police to cooperate with Police and to be interviewed so
that
the allegations may be put to them for a response.  If those under
investigation are also party to civil proceedings and are aware
that any
material evidencing any interview in which they may participate will be subject
to production under subpoena, they may decline
to participate in such
interviews.  This would hamper the proper conduct of investigations prosecution
of offences by Police and
other law enforcement agencies and thus be contrary
to the public interest.  Further, it is contrary to the public interest to
disclose
information in respect of which Police have made an undertaking of
confidentiality.  It would undermine many different aspects of
their works if
Police could not maintain those undertakings if the material to which they
relate was liable to production on subpoena".</i>
<P>

4	The claim for public interest immunity is advanced as a "<i>class</i>" claim:
<b><i>The Commonwealth v Northern Land Council</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d1993%29%20176%20CLR%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-1993) 176 CLR 604</a>
at 616.  
<P>

5	It is a class of claim for public interest immunity founded upon
"<i>effective policing</i>" which is recognised generally as a basis for such a
claim for immunity:  see <b><i>D v NSPCC</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) AC 171</a> at 232F, per
Lord Simon of Glaisdale;  this is not restricted to the mere fact of the
confidentiality referred to in the affidavit.
 Confidentiality alone is not
sufficient to found such a claim:  <b><i>Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines
Limited v Customs &amp; Excise Commissioners (No. 2)</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20AC%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) AC 405</a> at
433-434;  <b><i>D v NPSCC </i></b>at 218A per Diplock LJ.
<P>

6	The claim, in effect, is that effective policing requires the Court to uphold
Police undertakings of confidentiality in the circumstances
referred to in the
evidence.  As a matter of recognised policy Police undertakings must be kept if
effective policing is to be maintained.
 It is conceded by Mr Singleton that
there is no authority precisely on point but the general propositions adverted
to in such cases
as <b><i>D v NSPCC</i></b> make it clear that the categories
of public interest immunity are not closed and this is conceded by the
defendant.
<P>

7	In <b><i>D v NSPCC</i></b> Lord Diplock at 218B said:
<P>

	<i>"The private promise of confidentiality must yield to the general public
interest that in the administration of justice truth will
out, unless by reason
of the character of the information or the relationship of the recipient of the
information to the informant
a more important public interest is served by
protecting the information or the identity of the informant from disclosure in
a Court
of law".</i>
<P>

8	Mr Singleton did not advance the claim as one that normally applies to an
informant as is generally understood in the criminal
law, but rather in respect
of a person who gives information to the police in circumstances of continuing
investigation and the requirement
that the information be protected.  The
identity of the informant is not in issue, he is Mr Marsden.
<P>

9	The procedure was adopted to determine whether or not a claim is available as
articulated in the evidence.  Mr Wheelhouse for
the defendant objected to this
course, seeing it as one that precludes the balancing exercise that may be
required, or if it applies,
precluding the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 30</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a>.  </i>I accepted the submissions of Mr Singleton for the Police that that
exercise would be embarked upon after the question as to whether
the claim for
immunity falls within a recognised and principled class of claim and if it
does, then consideration would be given
to any balancing matters that would or
could bring it about that notwithstanding the successful claim for immunity, an
order for
disclosure or production should be made.
<P>

10	I am conscious of and acknowledge the correctness of the proposition
contained in the statement of Mahoney JA in <b><i>Goldberg &amp; Anor v
Ng</i></b> (1994) 33 NSWLR 639:
<P>

	<i>"In my opinion, a claim to public interest immunity is one which should be
upheld only for reason which, after careful scrutiny, are
judged to be
compelling.  What is in question where a claim for public interest immunity is
raised is the role of the courts in a
modern democratic society.  In any
society, disputes arise:  they may arise between individuals or may involve the
State.  It is
necessary that there be a recognised and publicly accepted method
of resolving such disputes.  If disputes are not to be determined
by judicial
procedure, they will be determined not according to what is just but for reason
of power, influence or the like".</i>
<P>

11	I am not persuaded by any suggestion that a ruling in favour of the class of
claim made for the Police Service would have some
form of <i>"floodgates</i>"
effect in protecting every Record of Interview the Police take in the course of
any investigation.  Effective policing requires
that Police undertakings be
kept to permit the flow of cooperation from people including suspected people
in the discrete environment
of a Police investigation but one concurrent with a
civil action.
<P>

12	I am of the view that the applicant has established clearly a claim for
public interest immunity in the sense of a class of claim
on the basis of the
material in Ms Scott's affidavit and rule accordingly.
<P>

13	The course to be taken hereafter by the defendant will be a matter for
it.
