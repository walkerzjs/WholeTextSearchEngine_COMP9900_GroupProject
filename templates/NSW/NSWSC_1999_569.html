RUSHCUTTERS BAY
MARITIME RESERVE TRUST and the MINISTER FOR LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION  (NO.
3546/1998)</cite></b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

2	<u>The Proceedings</u>:  By statement of claim filed 4 November 1998 the
plaintiffs claimed in substance that one or other of them was entitled to a
lease
of certain land at Rushcutters Bay located at the northern end of a
larger area of land which, until 1979, was Commonwealth land
and used for naval
purposes.  
<P>

3	This entitlement to a lease was alleged to have arisen from an agreement
entered into on or about 27 April 1979 between the Commonwealth
of Australia,
in which the subject land was then vested, and the State of New South Wales,
whereby the Commonwealth, for the consideration
set out therein, agreed to
transfer the subject land, and certain other lands, to the State of New South
Wales.  The relevant term
relied upon in the agreement was in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"(iv)  The State Government further undertakes that following determination of
the lease to the Commonwealth Government it will
reserve the whole of the land
for public recreation under the provisions of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act
and will grant to the
R.A.N. Sailing Association a lease of the property
presently occupied by that Association."
<P>

4	It  is alleged in the statement of claim that in breach of this term of the
agreement, the defendants had not, and still refused,
to grant to either of the
defendants a lease as contemplated by the said term of the agreement.
<P>

5	It is further alleged in the statement of claim that one or other of the
defendants had from time to time represented to one or
other of the plaintiffs,
that a lease would be granted in accordance with the said term of the
agreement, and that the grant of such
a lease on reasonable term was imminent.
It is alleged that induced by such representations, and on the faith of such
representations,
the plaintiffs acted to their detriment, including paying
rent, expending money and doing work, done by members of the plaintiffs,
on
maintenance and improvements of the boatshed and appurtenances erected on the
said land, and by failing to find alternative premises
elsewhere.  
<P>

6	It is alleged that the defendants are, accordingly, estopped and precluded
from denying that one or other of them is liable to
grant a lease over the
boatshed area to one or other of the plaintiffs on reasonable terms.  
<P>

7	It is also alleged in the statement of claim that one or other of the
defendants represented to one or other of the plaintiffs
that, "over and above
the lease of the boatshed area", the plaintiffs would be granted occupation of
a reasonable and separate area
upon the land for car-parking purposes.  It is
alleged that induced by such representations, and on the faith of such
representations
the plaintiffs have acted to their detriment in the manner
referred to above.  It is alleged that by reason of these representations
also,
the defendants are accordingly estopped and precluded from denying that one or
other of them is liable to grant occupation
of "a reasonable area upon the
land, separate from the boatshed area" to one or other of the plaintiffs for
car-parking purposes.
<P>

8	In the alternative, it is alleged that on or about 18 October 1994, in
consideration of their mutual promises, the first defendant
agreed to grant and
the Royal Australian Naval Sailing Association agreed to take, upon terms and
conditions then agreed upon, a
lease, licence and/or right of way over the
subject land, and that in breach of such agreement the first defendant has
refused to
grant such lease, licence and/or right of way to the Royal
Australian Naval Sailing Association.
<P>

9	It is alleged in the alternative that, on or about 1 May 1991, in
consideration of their mutual promises, the first defendant
agreed to grant,
and the first plaintiff agreed to take upon the terms and conditions then
agreed upon a lease over the boatshed
area and that in breach of such agreement
the first defendant has refused to grant such lease to the first plaintiff.
<P>

10	It is further alleged in the alternative that, since 1 July 1990 or shortly
thereafter, and until September 1998, one or other
or both of the plaintiffs
have, with the consent of the first defendant, used certain areas for
car-parking purposes.  It is alleged
that during this period of time the first
defendant on the one hand, and one or other of the plaintiffs on the other
hand, have conducted
their affairs and the relationship between them on the
assumption that the area to be leased to one or other of the plaintiffs would
include the area used for car-parking purposes, or that the first defendant
would grant a lease, licence or right of way over such
areas to one or other of
the plaintiffs for car-parking purposes, or the first defendant would otherwise
grant to one or other of
the plaintiffs the right to use such areas for
car-parking purposes and/or for access to a car-parking area.  It is further
alleged
that the defendants are accordingly estopped and precluded from denying
the said assumption.
<P>

11	In their defence the defendants deny the principal allegations contained in
the statement of claim, and claimed that neither
of the plaintiffs was entitled
to any of the orders sought in the statement of claim.
<P>

12	Further, and in the alternative, the defendants allege that on 1 September
1997 the Minister for Lands adopted a plan of management
in relation to, inter
alia, the subject land, pursuant to section 114 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act
1989</a> (NSW) </i></b>("the plan of management"), which plan of management
precluded car-parking on the land, by virtue of which performance of various
of
the agreements alleged by the plaintiffs was rendered legally impossible, with
the result that neither of the plaintiffs was entitled
to any of the relief
sought.  
<P>

13	In their written "Outline of Plaintiffs' Submissions" the plaintiffs
submitted that they were entitled to a lease upon four legal
bases, namely:-
<P>

	"(a)  Upon the 1979 Agreement, which was plainly made by the parties to it for
the benefit of one or other of the Plaintiffs (Statement
of Claim, para.
8-12.).
<P>

	(b)  Upon estoppel by representation (Statement of Claim, paras. 13-15 and
16-18).
<P>

	(c   Upon an agreement made in January 1995 (rather than October 1994 as
pleaded) (Statement of Claim, paras. 19-20) or in May
1991 (Statement of Claim,
para. 21-22).
<P>

	(d)  Upon conventional estoppel (Statement of Claim, para. 23-26)."
<P>

14	In relation to the reliance by the Defendants upon the making of the plan of
management, the Outline of Plaintiffs' Submissions
submitted as follows:-
<P>

	"The short answer to that defence is that the provisions of `a plan of
management' made a time when the second defendant well knew
of the rights of
Plaintiffs, cannot operate to defeat those rights.  Otherwise, the Defendants
would be entitled to rely on self-created
`impossibility' to avoid their plain
obligations."
<P>

15	<u>The Facts</u>:  
<P>

16	The subject land, upon part of which is erected a boatshed, and which the
plaintiffs claim to have been in the occupation of
one or other of the
plaintiffs for some time, is Crown land within the meaning of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown
Lands Act 1989</a> (NSW),</i></b> and the second defendant is the Minister of the
Crown responsible for that land.
<P>

17	Prior to 27 April 1979 the subject land was vested in the Commonwealth of
Australia and, on or about that date, the Commonwealth
of Australia and the
State of New South Wales entered into an agreement for the transfer of certain
land including the subject land
by the Commonwealth of Australia to the State
of New South Wales.  The agreement was contained in an exchange of letters,
being a
letter dated 27 April 1979 from the then Premier of New South Wales to
the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and attachments
thereto, and a
letter dated 30 April 1979 from the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to
the then Prime Minister of New South
Wales and attachments thereto (being the
same attachments as were attached to the letter dated 27 April 1979).
<P>

18	The said letters were in the following terms:-
<P>

	"27 April 1979
<P>

	Dear Mr. Fraser,
<P>

	I refer to the agreements in principle reached in Sydney on 15th  December,
1978 between my colleague, the Hon. W.F. Crabtree,
M.P., the New South Wales
Minister for Lands, and the Hon. J.E. McLeay, M.P., Minister for Administrative
Services, concerning the
exchange of certain Commonwealth and State lands in
New South Wales.  These agreements were subsequently confirmed by our two
Governments.
<P>

	It was proposed that the arrangements agreed upon should be embodied in
Letters of Intent between our Governments.  These would
include all the
essential elements of the matters negotiated, including the proposed pooling
arrangements, to obviate delay in effecting
the transfers of the lands
concerned.  I concur in this proposal, and accordingly confirm on behalf of the
State that the understandings
set out in the attachments to this letter
(Attachments 1 to 13) are to apply, as relevant, to the land exchanges covered
by the proposed
pooling arrangement.
<P>

	It is my understanding that you are sending a letter similar to this to
confirm these arrangements.  I agree that the exchange
of these letters
authorises the transfer of titles of the areas referred to above.
<P>

	The land exchanges are of considerable importance to the people of this State
and it is a matter of great satisfaction to my Government
that these agreements
have been reached and that the way is now clear for the land exchanges to be
effected quickly.  I would like
to express appreciation for the co-operation
received from your colleague, the Hon. JE McLeay, MP, during the
negotiations.
<P>

	Yours sincerely,
<P>

<center>	(sgd.) Neville Wran
<P>

	Premier."

<P>

	       30 April 1979
<P>

	
<P>

	My dear Premier,
<P>

	I refer to the agreements in principle reached in Sydney on 15th December,
1978 between my colleague, the Hon. JE McLeay, MP, Minister
for Administrative
Services and the Hon. WF Crabtree, MLA, the New South Wales Minister for Lands,
concerning the exchange of certain
Commonwealth and State lands in New South
Wales.  These agreements were subsequently confirmed by the two Ministers.
<P>

	It was proposed that the agreed arrangements should be embodied in Letters of
Intent between our Governments.  These would include
all the essential elements
of the matters negotiated, including the proposed financial pooling
arrangements to obviate delay in effecting
the transfers of the lands
concerned.  I concur with this proposal, and accordingly confirm on behalf of
the Commonwealth that the
understandings set out in the attachments to this
letter (Attachments 1 to 13) are to apply, as relevant, to the land exchanges
covered
by the proposed pooling arrangement.
<P>

	It is my understanding that you are sending a letter similar to this to
confirm these arrangements.  I agree that the exchange
of these letters
authorises the transfer of titles of the areas referred to above.
<P>

	The proposed land exchanges have been the subject of negotiations between
successive Commonwealth and State Governments and it
is a matter of
considerable satisfaction to my Government that an equitable and amicable
conclusion to these negotiations has now
been achieved.  I should like in
particular to express appreciation for the co-operation received from Mr.
Crabtree during the negotiations.
<P>

	Yours sincerely,
<P>

<P>

19	Attachment 9 to each of the said letters provided, inter alia, as
follows:-
<P>

	"(iii)  The State Government undertakes to lease the land to the Commonwealth
following transfer at a peppercorn rental ...
<P>

	(iv)  The State Government further undertakes that following termination of
the lease to the Commonwealth Government it will reserve
the whole of the land
for public recreation under the provisions of the <i>Crown Lands Consolidation
Act</i> and will grant to the R.A.N. Sailing Association a lease of the area
presently occupied by that Association."
<P>

20	As at 27 April 1979 (and presumably also as at 30 April 1979), the first
plaintiff was not incorporated, but was a branch of
the Royal Australian Naval
Sailing Association ("RANSA") which is, and has at all material times been, an
unincorporated voluntary
association.
<P>

21	As at 27 April 1979 the boatshed then on the land was occupied by the second
plaintiff, and the plaintiffs claim that, as at
that date, one or other of them
had the use of certain other land for car-parking purposes.
<P>

22	By notification published in the New South Wales Government Gazette on 16
January 1987, pursuant to section 28 of the <b><i>Crown Lands Consolidation Act
1913 (NSW), </i></b>the then New South Wales Minister for Lands declared that
the land was reserved from sale for certain public purposes, namely, public
recreation and maritime purposes.
<P>

23	By notification published in the New South Wales Government Gazette on 26
June 1987, pursuant to section 37O of the <b><i>Crown Lands Consolidation Act
1913 (NSW)</i></b>, the then Minister for Lands appointed certain persons to be
trustees of the land for a term of five years and declared such trustees
and
their successors in office to be a corporation having assigned to it the name
"Rushcutters Bay Maritime Reserve Trust".
<P>

24	By transfer registered No. R830805 dated 24 April 1980 the land was
transferred by the Commonwealth of Australia to Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II
in right of the State of New South Wales, as Crown lands within the meaning of
the <b><i>Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 (NSW)</i></b>.
<P>

25	On 2 September 1981 the land was leased back to the Commonwealth of
Australia by the State of New South Wales and, on or about
11 August 1987, the
lease was formally relinquished by the Commonwealth of Australia.
<P>

26	Since that relinquishment no lease has been granted to either of the
plaintiffs in respect of the land and the plaintiffs claim
that this is in
breach of the agreement contained in clause (iv) as set out above to Attachment
9 to the letters of 27 April 1979
and 30 April 1979 set out above.  
<P>

27	By their defence the defendants say:-
<P>

	"That at all material times since the Trust (the first defendant) came into
existence it has been prepared to enter into a lease
with RANSA of the boatshed
area (as that term is defined in the Statement of Claim) on reasonable
terms."
<P>

28	The defendants, however, submit, in substance, that "reasonable terms" are a
matter for agreement between the parties, and that
if the parties are unable to
agree, there is no enforceable agreement which can be enforced by the Court.
In other words, the submission
in this connection is to the effect that an
agreement to agree on reasonable terms is an agreement to agree, which is no
agreement
at all.  
<P>

29	Following the exchange of correspondence in April 1979 referred to above,
there was considerable further correspondence over
a period of almost twenty
years relating to the proposed grant of a lease to the second plaintiff,
including negotiations as to the
terms to be included in any such lease, until
the letter dated 22 July 1998 from the solicitors for the plaintiffs to the
solicitors
for the defendants in which it was stated that the plaintiffs
proposed to commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court.  The proceedings
were
commenced on 13 August 1998 when a summons was filed.  Prior to that date the
parties had been negotiating for the grant of
a lease by the first defendant to
the second plaintiff but no agreement had been reached in relation to its
terms.  It is both impractical
and unnecessary to set out the whole, or,
indeed, any substantial part of the voluminous correspondence which, as stated
above, was
written over a period of almost 20 years.
<P>

30	<u>Submissions of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

31	<u>The First Submission of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

32	The first of the four legal bases upon which the plaintiffs base their claim
to be entitled to a lease was set out in the written
Outline of Plaintiffs'
Submissions referred to above in the following terms:-
<P>

	"(a)  Upon the 1979 Agreement, which was plainly made by the parties to it for
the benefit of one or other of the Plaintiffs (Statement
of Claim, paras.
8-12)."
<P>

33	In further elaboration of this submission the plaintiffs' Outline contained
the following paragraph:-
<P>

	"2.2  As to the 1979 Agreement, the Plaintiffs' case is as follows:-
<P>

	(a)  The terms of the Agreement are plain and unambiguous ... On its face it
was made, inter alia, for the benefit of the RAN Sailing
Association.  From the
moment that the Agreement was concluded, alternatively from the moment that the
land was transferred by the
Commonwealth to the State pursuant to the 1979
Agreement in April 1980 ... the State held the right of RANSA to have a lease
over
the relevant part of the land upon trust for RANSA absolutely.  Although
RANSA was a `third party' to the 1979 Agreement, equity
will intervene so as to
enable it to obtain an order for specific performance of the obligation of the
Defendants to grant a lease
to RANSA 
<P>

	(b)  The relevant principles are found generally in ... (reference was made
here to various texts and authorities).
<P>

	(c    The Court is entitled to take into account the circumstances surrounding
the making of the Agreement, including statements
made by the parties at the
time and subsequently, to determine whether such a trust arose ... such
statements include those found
at AB074, AB075, AB077."
<P>

34	Document 074 is a Minute dated 6 December 1985 to the First Assistant
Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Defence in
Canberra from the Chief
Property Officer for New South Wales of the Department of Local Government and
Administrative Services. 
That Minute contains, inter alia, the following
paragraph:-
<P>

	"Generally we have proposed that Option 3 should be supported, particularly in
view of the Command Sailing Centre requirements,
and have suggested that any
additional value for the change of the `intended' use of the site to a mixed
use of public recreation
and unreserved Crown Land should be offset by a long
term lease/tenancies for the Command Sailing Centre and RAN Sailing Association
in the proposed National Sailing Centre (former Administration Building) at
nominal rentals with free use of the associated sailing
and parking facilities,
including the Sayonara Slipway on a priority basis.  
<P>

	Further advice will be forwarded as soon as the Minister's views on the
State's proposal have been received."
<P>

35	Option 3 is referred to in a letter dated 27 November 1985 from the Minister
for Public Works, Ports and Roads of New South Wales
to the solicitors for the
plaintiff in the following paragraph:-
<P>

	"In keeping with the Government's intention to make available to the general
public as much foreshore area of the Harbour as possible,
the Board supports
the proposal by the Crown Lands Office as contained in its Option 3.  This
Option allows for restoration of the
foreshore land to recreation use yet at
the same time, allows for use by specific groups of boat users and general
public access
to the waterways."
<P>

36	Document 075 is a letter dated 9 December 1986 from the Minister for
Agriculture, Lands and Forests, New South Wales, to the
Principal Private
Secretary, Office of the Minister for Local Government and Administrative
Services, Sydney, and contains, inter
alia, the following paragraphs:-
<P>

	"The transfer was conditional upon the land being reserved for public
recreation, and provision for the RAN Sailing Association
to retain its use of
part of the land ...
<P>

	The Navy has indicated that it is interested in leasing one building so as to
enable its Naval Sailing Centre to continue at this
location and RANSA also
wish to stay there ...
<P>

	This is a happy coincidence as the income from any lease negotiated would
assist the trust to fund the restoration and renovation
necessary to other
buildings, and maintain them thereafter."
<P>

37	Document 077 is a submission to the Minister for Local Government and
Administrative Services from the Acting Secretary of the
Department dated 10
December 1986 which was apparently approved by the Minister and contained,
inter alia, the following paragraphs:-
<P>

	"However, further to your recent inspection of the site, the following
strategy was accordingly discussed and now forwarded for
your consideration.
<P>

	*  The site be reserved for `public recreation and maritime purposes' ...
<P>

	*  A private trust be appointed to manage the reserve.
<P>

	*  The trust be incorporated under the assigned name of the `Rushcutters Bay
Maritime Reserve Trust'.
<P>

	*  The trust be required to prepare a plan of management for the reserve
having regard to its anticipated use by the Royal Australian
Navy, the Royal
Australian Navy Sailing Association and a Unit of the Naval Reserve Cadets.
<P>

	*  Occupation of the various buildings (to be retained) within the reserve be
ratified by lease agreements between the trust and
the respective lessees."
<P>

38	Paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Statement of Claim are in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"11.  In the premises, the promises made by the State Government and set out
in paragraph 9 above were made for the intended benefit
of the Squadron or
RANSA and one or other of them is entitled to bring these proceedings to
enforce them. [Paragraph 9 of the Statement
of Claim sets out the matter quoted
in paragraph 19 of this judgment.]
<P>

	12.  Pursuant to the said agreement the land was leased to the Commonwealth of
Australia and such lease was terminated on or about
13 August 1987 but in
breach of clause (iv) set out in paragraph 9 above, the Defendants have not,
and still refuse to, grant to
either the Squadron or RANSA a lease of the
boatshed area of the kind contemplated by the said agreement or at all."
<P>

39	The passages relied upon by the plaintiffs in the various authorities cited
on their behalf include following:-
<P>

	"Then there is the trust of the contractual promise on which the appellant
places particular reliance as a palliative of the difficulties
generated by the
common law principles.  Despite the insistence ...on the need for a clear
expression of intention to create a trust
and the warning that such an
intention cannot necessarily be inferred from general words, there are a number
of authorities which
justify the difficulty expressed by Fullagar J in
understanding the reluctance of the court sometimes to infer trusts ... in
(certain
authorities) the courts readily inferred the existence of a trust from
the circumstance that the contract was made for the benefit
of a third party
... critics of the common law rules have pointed to the uncertainty surrounding
the circumstances in which the courts
will recognise a trust in contracts for
the benefit of third parties as a reason for rejecting the trust concept as a
sufficient
answer to the difficulties caused by those rules ...
<P>

	This apparent uncertainty should be resolved by stating that the courts will
recognise the existence of a trust when it appears
from the language of the
parties, construed in its context, including the matrix of circumstances, that
the parties so intended.
 We are speaking of express trusts, the existence of
which depends on intention.  In divining intention from the language which the
parties have employed, the courts may look to the nature of the transaction and
the circumstances, including commercial necessity,
in order to infer or impute
intention. ...
<P>

	But, even if adherence to this approach produces greater consistency of
outcome, there are still the cases where the third party
has no remedy because
there is no sufficient intention to create a trust" ...: <u>per</u> Mason CJ
and Wilson J in <i>Trident General Insurance Co. Ltd. v McNiece Bros Pty. Ltd.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20165%20CLR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988)</i> 165 CLR 107</a> at 120-121.
<P>

	...the requisite intention to create a trust of a contractual promise to
benefit a third party can, however, be formed and carried
into effect (either
by the contract itself or some other act) by a promisee who would be bemused by
the information that the chose
in action constituted by the benefit of a
contractual promise is property and uncomprehending of the distinction between
law and
equity ... In the context of such a contractual promise, the requisite
intention should be inferred if it clearly appears that it
was the intention of
the promisee that the third party should himself be entitled to insist upon
performance of the promise and receipt
of the benefit and if trust is, in the
circumstances, the appropriate legal mechanism for giving effect to that
intention.  <i>A fortiori, </i>equity's requirement of an intention to create a
trust will be at least, prima facie, satisfied if the terms of the contract
expressly
or impliedly manifest that intention as the joint intention of both
promisor and promisee ...
<P>

	The question whether a particular contract itself creates a trust of the
benefit of one or more of the promises which it contains
is primarily a
question of the construction of the terms of the contract.  Those terms must,
however, be construed in context and
a trust of a contractual promise will
obviously be more readily discerned in the terms of some classes of contract
than it will in
others": <u>per</u> Deane J, <cite>ibid</cite>, at 147-148.
<P>

	"... That the common law rule was a rule which could operate unjustly in some
circumstances may be conceded, but equity could and
did intervene in many cases
by treating the promisee as a trustee of a promise made for the benefit of a
third party, and allowing
the third party to enforce the promise, making the
promisee - trustee, if necessary, a defendant in an action against the promisor
... It is difficult to understand the reluctance which courts have sometimes
shown to infer a trust in such cases" <u>per</u> Fullagar J in <i>Wilson v
Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Co.

<P>

	"The case for recognising a contract for the benefit of a third party is
simple and straightforward.  The autonomy of the will
of the party should be
respected.  The law of contract should give effect to the reasonable
expectations of contracting parties.
 Principle certainly requires that a
burden should not be imposed on a third party without his consent.  But there
is no doctrinal,
logical or policy reason why the law should deny effectiveness
to a contract for the benefit of a third party where that is the expressed
intention of the parties.  Moreover, often the parties and particularly third
parties, organise their affairs on the faith of the
contract.  They rely on the
contract.  It is therefore unjust to deny effectiveness to such a contract.  I
will not struggle further
with the point since nobody seriously asserts the
contrary" <u>per</u> Steyn L.J. in <i>Darlington Borough Council v Wiltshier

<P>

40	Counsel also referred to Meagher and Gummow, <i>Jacob's Law of Trusts in
Australia</i> (6ed. - 1997) at paras. 221-225 and Seddon and Ellinghaus,
<i>Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract </i>(7 Aust. ed. - 1997) at paras.
7.43-7.49. 
<P>

41	In my opinion, the submission made on behalf of the plaintiffs that "From
the moment that the Agreement was concluded, alternatively
from the moment that
the land was transferred by the Commonwealth to the State pursuant to the 1979
Agreement in April 1980 ... <u>the State held the right of RANSA to have a</u>
<u>lease over the relevant part of the land upon trust for RANSA
absolutely</u>" must be rejected. 
<P>

42	In this connection it should be observed, firstly, in my opinion, that the
words of clause (iv) record an undertaking by the
State Government that it will
grant a lease, the precise words being "The State Government further
<u>undertakes</u> that ... it will ... grant a lease".  In my opinion, these
words, according to their plain, ordinary meaning must be construed in
their
context as involving only "an undertaking" by the State Government to the
Commonwealth Government and cannot be construed as
"an undertaking" by the
State Government to RANSA, or as it is described in clause (iv) "RANSA Sailing
Association".
<P>

43	Secondly, in my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that those acting on
behalf of the State Government would have intended that
the State Government
should be regarded, in effect, as giving such an undertaking directly to RANSA.
The letters dated 27 April 1979
and 30 April 1979 referred to above passed
between the then Premier of the State of New South Wales and the then Prime
Minister of
the Commonwealth and it cannot, in my opinion, be inferred that
those acting on behalf of those entities had, in the circumstances,
any
intention that the State Government in that exchange of that correspondence
would be giving any undertaking to RANSA or any intention
that RANSA should
itself be able to enforce that undertaking against the State Government.
<P>

44	These textual and contextual considerations also militate, in my opinion,
against any view that it should be inferred that both
Governments intended to
create a trust of the right of RANSA to have a lease, to the intent that RANSA
would be able to enforce such
rights as it might have if the Commonwealth
Government failed to take proceedings to enforce the State Government
undertaking to
it to grant a lease to RANSA.  
<P>

45	If, as in my opinion is the case, clause (iv) is not to be construed as
recording, in effect, an undertaking by the State Government
to RANSA, it is,
in my opinion, even more certain that the clause cannot be construed so as to
give rise to such a trust.  Nor, in
my opinion, do the references to which
attention has been drawn by the plaintiffs by way of example in the
correspondence suggest
any contrary view.  Those references and many others,
indicate no more than that it was genuinely intended by relevant governments
that a lease would be granted, but they certainly, in my opinion, are not
evidence of any intention on the part of the relevant parties
to create a trust
in favour of RANSA of a right to obtain a lease.
<P>

46	In my opinion, in the context of the relevant circumstances, the parties to
the exchange of land agreements did not intend to
create a trust in favour of
the plaintiffs not least, inter alia, because in my opinion, they would not
have intended that the plaintiffs
or either of them could sue to enforce, in
effect, the agreement between them, and more especially because there had been
no agreement
or specification of the more detailed terms of any such lease in
circumstances in which, in my opinion, parties of the nature of
the parties to
the exchange of lands agreement would require to be negotiated before final
agreement on those terms was reached.
 Nor, of course, was there any commercial
or other necessity in the context of the relevant circumstances for the
position to be
otherwise.  In this respect the present situation is, in my
opinion, very different from the circumstances in the <i>Trident</i> case.  As
Deane J said, <i>supra</i>, "a trust of a contractual promise will obviously be
more readily discerned in the terms of some classes of contract than it will
in
others" (at 148).
<P>

47	In any event, even if it were to be held that such a trust as is alleged by
the plaintiffs did, prima facie, come into existence,
any such trust would, in
my opinion, as submitted, in effect, by the defendants, be void for
uncertainty, having regard to the failure
of clause (iv) to specify what the
terms of the contemplated lease between the State Government and RANSA would
be.  Indeed, again
as submitted, in substance, by the defendants, this
consideration makes it plain, in my opinion, that clause (iv), at least insofar
as it deals with the grant of a lease from the State Government to RANSA, is
void for uncertainty and therefore, unenforceable. 
This is so, in my opinion,
even if clause (iv) could be construed as if it contained a provision to the
effect that the contemplated
lease would be granted on "reasonable" terms
since, in my opinion, there is nothing in clause (iv) to suggest that the
parties to
that clause, namely, the State Government and the Commonwealth
Government, had in mind any standard by reference to which the reasonableness
of suggested terms of the lease could be measured.  
<P>

48	Any lease that might have been granted by the State Government to RANSA of
what would otherwise have been public land accessible
to the whole public
would, of course, be expected to be of some complexity, as later negotiations
confirm, and this, in my opinion,
coupled with the absence of any intention on
the part of the parties to prescribe a standard by reference to which
reasonableness
might be measured, also adds support to the conclusion that the
clause is void for uncertainty and unenforceable.  I add that I recognise,
of
course, that in other circumstances, a provision in the contract which requires
the Court to make a judgment as to the reasonableness
of some provisions in a
contract, may, depending upon the circumstances, be enforceable but, in my
opinion, this is not such a case.
 I would also add that in the present
circumstances the provisions of sections 84 and 85 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act 1919</a></i></b> <b><i>(NSW) </i></b>which imply certain terms into any lease
are of no avail to the plaintiffs since the operation of those sections
requires the prior
existence of a lease into which the terms are to be
implied.
<P>

49	<u>The Second Submission of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

50	The next submission on behalf of the plaintiff was to the effect that one or
other of the plaintiffs was entitled to a lease
upon the basis of:-
<P>

	"(b)  Estoppel by representation (Statement of Claim, paras. 13-15 and
16-18)."
<P>

51	Paragraphs 13-15 of the Statement of Claim  are in the following terms
(omitting the particulars of paragraphs 13 and 14):-
<P>

	"13.  Further, or in the alternative, one or other of the Defendants has, from
time to time, represented to one or other of the
Squadron or RANSA that:-
<P>

	13.1  The Agreement referred to in paragraph 8 above would be complied
with;
<P>

	13.2  The grant of a lease on reasonable terms over the boatshed area was
imminent ...
<P>

	14.  Induced by such representations and on the faith of such representations
the Squadron and RANSA acted to their detriment ...
<P>

	15.  The Defendants are accordingly estopped and precluded from denying that
one or other of them is liable to grant a lease over
the boatshed area to one
or other of the Plaintiffs on reasonable terms."
<P>

52	Paragraphs 16-18 of the Statement of Claim (omitting the particulars
contained in paragraphs 16 and 17) are in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"16.  Further, or in the alternative, one or other of the Defendants
represented to one or other of the Squadron or RANSA that,
over and above the
lease of the boatshed area, the Squadron or RANSA would be granted occupation
of a reasonable and separate area
upon the land for car-parking purposes ...
<P>

	18.  The Defendants are accordingly estopped and precluded from denying that
one or other of them is liable to grant occupation
of a reasonable area upon
the land, separate from the boatshed area, to one or other of the Squadron or
RANSA for car-parking purposes."
<P>

53	Further elaboration of this submission is set out in the Outline of
Plaintiffs' Submissions" as follows:-
<P>

	"2.3.  As to the claim founded upon estoppel by representation, the
Plaintiffs' put their case as follows:-
<P>

	(a)  The evidence shows an unbroken continuum of representations since 1979 by
both Defendants and by their predecessors, by whose
representations the
Defendants are bound, that a lease would be given to one or other of the
Plaintiffs ...
<P>

	(b) <u> While the representations differ as to the terms upon which such a
lease will be granted</u>, they are unequivocal upon the critical point,
namely, that a lease will be granted.  Put at their lowest these
representations can
only be understood as meaning that the Plaintiffs would be
granted a lease in accordance with the 1979 Agreement.  (underlining
supplied).
<P>

	(c    Upon the faith of these representations, the plaintiffs have acted to
their detriment ...
<P>

	(d)  By reason of these representations, accompanied by reliance by the
Plaintiffs to their detriment, the Defendants are estopped
from denying that
they are bound to grant one or other of the Plaintiffs a lease.  That
conclusion necessarily flows from an application
of the principles explained in
<i>Waltons Stores</i> <i>(Interstate) Ltd. v Maher</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988) 164 CLR 387</a>
...".
<P>

54	Some of the particulars of the representations relied upon by the plaintiffs
relate to correspondence passing between representatives
of State and
Commonwealth Government Departments which are not shown to have come to the
attention of the plaintiffs or either of
them.  Other such particulars relate
to correspondence with one or other of the plaintiffs from one or other of the
defendants which
cannot, in my opinion, on their true construction, be
construed as unequivocal representations that a lease "would be given" <u>upon
any particular terms</u> to one or other of the plaintiffs.  Thus, one of the
letters relied upon by the plaintiffs is the letter dated 10 March 1989 from
the Secretary of the Rushcutters Bay Maritime Reserve Trust to RANSA which is
in the following terms:-
<P>

	"Your solicitors have formally requested the Trust's agreement to permanent
occupation of its present location by RANSA.
<P>

	At a meeting on 8 March 1989 the Trust agreed to recommend to the Minister
that a long term lease of the existing premises be granted
to RANSA as a matter
of urgency.
<P>

	There are, of course, some details to be discussed and the Trust has appointed
a sub-committee to meet with RANSA and resolve any
issues, including a formula
for the determination of rent.  They will be in touch with you shortly."
<P>

55	By way of example, in my opinion, the representation, if any, contained in
this letter to the effect that a lease "would be given
to one or other of the
plaintiffs", is subject to qualifications and therefore is not unequivocal in
relation to "details to be discussed
and ... (resolution) of any issues,
including a formula for the determination of rent".  In my opinion, that letter
cannot therefore
be regarded as an unequivocal representation that a lease
"would be given to one or other of the plaintiffs"<u> on any particular
terms</u>.
<P>

56	The same is true of a further letter particularised by the plaintiffs,
namely, the letter of 23 May 1989 from the Secretary of
the Rushcutters Bay
Maritime Reserve Trust to RANSA which contains the following passages:-  
<P>

	"As has been verbally indicated by both the Chairman of the Trust and myself
to you and your solicitors it is not possible to finalise
the Lease details
until the presently unresolved matter of the joint occupation of the Boatshed
by RANSA and the Naval Command Sailing
Centre is decided ...When you have
resolved this with the Navy, we will be able to <u>enter into final</u>
<u>negotiations</u> with RANSA."  (underlining supplied).
<P>

57	Once again, the reference to entering into "final negotiations" makes it
plain that this letter cannot be construed as an unequivocal
representation to
the effect that a lease on particular terms certainly "would be given" to one
or other of the plaintiffs.
<P>

58	Another letter particularised by the plaintiffs is the letter dated 2
January 1990 from the Minister for Natural Resources to
the solicitors for the
plaintiffs which contains the following paragraph:-
<P>

	"As you are aware, transfer of the former Naval depot, HMS Rushcutter, was
partly conditional upon RANSA being granted a lease
of the area it occupied.
In this regard, it is the intention of the Department of Lands for RANSA and
the Reserve Trust to negotiate
an appropriate lease which will ultimately
require my approval."
<P>

59	Once again, reference is made to the necessity to "negotiate" which makes it
impossible, in my opinion, to regard the letter
as constituting either alone or
in conjunction with other letters, an unequivocal representation that a lease
certainly "would be
granted" to one or other of the plaintiffs on any
particular terms.
<P>

60	Another letter relevantly of the same nature, particularised by the
plaintiffs, is the letter of 23 April 1991 from the Trust
to RANSA which
contains the following sentences:-
<P>

	"It makes a resolution of the terms of the lease urgent so as to enable you to
make the necessary alternative arrangements.  It
would therefore seem
appropriate to reopen discussions at the earliest opportunity."
<P>

61	Further, from time to time in the correspondence reference is made to the
submission of a draft lease from the Trust to RANSA
for approval, for example,
in the letter of 5 June 1991 from a representative of the Trust to RANSA.
Eventually, by letter dated
11 July 1991 from a representative of the Trust to
RANSA a draft lease is submitted for approval which is said to have been sent
"subject to the approval of the Trustees and the Minister for Lands".  The
draft lease enclosed contained 32 clauses.
<P>

62	On 22 November 1991 a further draft lease was forwarded from a
representative of the Trust to RANSA with a covering note in the
following
terms:-
<P>

	"Draft lease as discussed.  It follows the Specimen Lease prescribed by the
Department for these things - with the exceptions of
clauses 30 and 31.  The
question of <u>car-parking</u> perhaps we could discuss when you have had a
chance to look at the draft."
<P>

63	A further letter particularised by the plaintiffs is the letter dated 8
January 1993 from the Secretary of the Trust to RANSA
which contains the
following paragraphs:-
<P>

	"I can assure you that every effort is being made to complete formal
documentation of the lease acceptable to both parties for
rationalisation on
the appointment of a new Maritime Trust by the Minister for Conservation and
Land Management."
<P>

64	A letter dated 16 February 1993 from the Minister for Conservation and Land
Management and Minister for Energy of the State of
New South Wales to the
solicitors for RANSA contains the following passages:-
<P>

	"A new Trust for the Reserve has been appointed and <u>negotiations</u> may
now be resumed with the Trust to finalise the terms of the lease ...
<P>

	When a draft lease is submitted by the Trust for my consideration, action will
be taken to expedite the process."  <u> (</u>underlining supplied).
<P>

65	The letter dated 16 August 1993 from the Trust to RANSA included the
following paragraph:-
<P>

	"The Maritime Trust is currently proceeding to complete a revised plan of
management for the site and the completion of formal
leasing arrangements with
the various occupants of the Reserve area forms part of the Trust's overall
considerations in the matter."
<P>

66	By letter dated 18 October 1994 from a representative of the Trust to the
solicitors for RANSA a further draft lease was submitted
containing 33 clauses.
Clause 33 was in the following terms:-
<P>

	"33.  Notwithstanding any to the contrary herein contained or implied the
lessee at its own expense within 24 months from the date
hereof shall carry out
the repairs and renovations listed in the document of even date herewith at an
estimated cost of $200,000,
which such amount includes the cost of painting and
other work hereinbefore referred to."
<P>

67	A further letter dated 8 January 1993 from the Trust to Mr. Price contained
the following paragraphs:-
<P>

	"I would suggest that in the absence of a formally constituted Trust, there
are no real avenues open to complete a lease with the
Association at this
stage.  However, it would be appropriate for a draft to be drawn up which
incorporates those issues detailed
in the Trust's letter to Commodore Fisher of
19th May 1992, - copy enclosed.
<P>

	I assume that any legal work would be undertaken by Blake, Dawson, Waldron and
if this is the case, could you contact the Company
with a view to it preparing
a draft lease as early as practicable."
<P>

68	There followed further negotiations between the parties relating to the
terms of the lease and by letter dated 31 August 1995
the Minister for Land and
Water Conservation to RANSA the Minister advised that:-
<P>

	"The finalisation of the Association's lease has been held up pending the
finalisation of a Plan of Management for the Reserve
... These issues will need
to be resolved before the question of the Association's lease can be
finalised."
<P>

69	As has been stated above the parties never agreed to the terms of the
proposed lease and eventually the present proceedings were
commenced on 13
August 1997.
<P>

70	The relevant principles in relation to representations relied upon by the
plaintiffs in the present proceedings are as set out
in the decision of the
High Court in <b><i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd. v Maher</i></b>,
<i>supra.</i>
<P>

71	The passages upon which counsel for the plaintiffs relied in this decision
included the following:-
<P>

	"One may therefore discern in the cases a common thread which links them
together, namely, the principle that equity will come
to the relief of a
plaintiff who has acted to his detriment on the basis of a basic assumption in
relation to which the other party
to the transaction has `played such a part in
the adoption of the assumption that it would be unfair or unjust if he were
left free
to ignore it' ... Equity comes to the relief of such a plaintiff on
the footing that it would be unconscionable conduct on the part
of the other
party to ignore the assumption ...
<P>

	The foregoing review of the doctrine of promissory estoppel indicates that the
doctrine extends to the enforcement of voluntary
promises on the footing that a
departure from the basic assumptions underlying the transaction between the
parties must be unconscionable.
 As failure to fulfil a promise does not of
itself amount to unconscionable conduct, mere reliance on an executory promise
to do
something, resulting in the promisee changing his position or suffering
detriment, does not bring promissory estoppel into play.
 Something more would
be required.  <cite>Humphreys</cite><u> </u><cite>Estate</cite> suggests that
this may be found, if at all, in the creation or encouragement by the party
estopped in the other party of an assumption
that a contract will come into
existence or a promise will be performed and that the other party relied on
that assumption to his
detriment to the knowledge of the first party.<i>
</i><cite>Humphreys</cite><u> </u><cite>Estate</cite><u> </u>referred in terms
to an assumption that the plaintiff would not exercise an existing legal right
or liberty, the right or liberty
to withdraw from the negotiations, but as a
matter of substance such an assumption is indistinguishable from an assumption
that a
binding contract would eventuate.  On the other hand the United States
experience suggests ... that the principle is to be expressed
in terms of a
reasonable expectation on the part of the promisor that his promise will induce
action or forbearance by the promisee,
the promise inducing such inaction or
forbearance in circumstances where injustice arising from unconscionable
conduct can only be
avoided by holding the promisor to his promise": <u>per</u>
Mason CJ and Wilson J at 404-407.
<P>

	"Parties who are negotiating a contract may proceed in the expectation that
the terms will be agreed and a contract made, but so
long as both parties
recognise that either party is at liberty to withdraw from the negotiations at
any time before the contract
is made, it cannot be unconscionable for one party
to do so.  Of course, the freedom to withdraw may be fettered or extinguished
by agreement but, in the absence of agreement, either party ordinarily retains
his freedom to withdraw.  It is only if a party induces
the other party to
believe that he, the former party, is already bound and his freedom to withdraw
has gone that it could be unconscionable
for him subsequently to assert that he
is legally free to withdraw.
<P>

	It is essential to the existence of an equity created by estoppel that the
party who induces the adoption of the assumption or
expectation knows or
intends that the party who adopts it will act or abstain from acting in
reliance on the assumption or expectation
... When the adoption of an
assumption or expectation is induced by the making of a promise, the knowledge
or intention that the
assumption or expectation will be acted upon may be
easily inferred ...
<P>

	The unconscionable conduct which it is the object of equity to prevent is the
failure of a party, who has induced the adoption
of the assumption or
expectation and who knew or intended that it would be relied on, to fulfil the
assumption or expectation or
otherwise to avoid the detriment which that
failure would occasion.  The object of the equity is not to compel the party
bound to
fulfil the assumption or expectation; it is to avoid the detriment
which, if the assumption or expectation goes unfulfilled, will
be suffered by
the party who has been induced to act or to abstain from acting ...
<P>

	In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a
plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that
a particular legal
relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected
that a particular legal relationship
would exist between them, and in the
latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected
legal relationship;
(2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that
assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting
in
reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended
him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction
will occasion detriment if
the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled and (6) the defendant has failed
to act to avoid that detriment
whether by fulfilling the assumption or
expectation or otherwise": <u>per</u> Brennan J at 423-429.
<P>

72	In this connection it is critical to identify the particular assumption (or
expectation) which the other party is said to have
induced, created or
encouraged.  In the present case it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs,
in effect, that the assumption
induced was an assumption on the part of either
or both of the plaintiffs that the State Government would grant a lease to one
or
other of the plaintiffs.  The difficulty, however, which, in my opinion, the
plaintiffs face, is that an assumption expressed simply
in terms that a lease
would be granted, says nothing about the terms upon which it was said to be
assumed that such a lease would
be granted.  There have, of course, been
various submissions made on behalf of the plaintiffs to the effect that, in
some way, the
terms of the lease were to be implied, but elsewhere in this
judgment I have rejected those submissions.  Accordingly, in my opinion,
in the
absence, as I have found, of any common assumption as to the terms upon which
any lease would be granted, the submissions
of the plaintiff in this connection
must be rejected.  
<P>

73	In accordance with the above stated principles, I am of the opinion that it
cannot be said that the defendants made unequivocal
representations to the
plaintiffs to the effect that a lease "would be given" to one or other of the
plaintiffs on any particular
terms.  In my opinion, it was always made
abundantly clear in the correspondence that the granting of any lease to any
plaintiffs
or either of them would be subject to negotiation and agreement
between the parties.  In those circumstances, the defendants are
not, in my
opinion, estopped from denying that they were or are bound to grant to the
plaintiffs, or either of them, a lease on any
particular terms.  
<P>

74	It follows, in my opinion, that the submissions of the plaintiffs as to
estoppel by representation must be rejected.  The same
is true, in my opinion,
as to the alleged representations of the defendants relied upon by the
plaintiffs in relation to the granting
to one or other of the plaintiffs of
"occupation of a reasonable and separate area upon the land for car-parking
purposes."  (see
later).
<P>

75	<u>The Third Submission of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

76	The third submission on behalf of the plaintiffs was to the effect that they
were entitled to a lease upon the basis of:-
<P>

	"(c     An agreement made in January 1995 (rather than October 1994 as
pleaded)(Statement of Claim, paras. 19-20) or in May 1991
(Statement of Claim,
paras. 21-22)."
<P>

77	Paragraphs 19-20 of the Statement of Claim, omitting particulars, are in the
following terms:-
<P>

	"19.  In the alternative, on or about 18 October 1994, in consideration of
their mutual promises, the First Defendant agreed to
grant and RANSA agreed to
take upon, terms and conditions then agreed upon, a lease, and/or right of way
over the whole of the land
described in the Schedule described in the Summons
...
<P>

	20.  In breach of such agreement, the First Defendant refused to grant such a
lease, licence or right of way to RANSA."
<P>

78	Paragraphs 21-22 to the Statement of Claim, omitting particulars, are in the
following terms:-
<P>

	"21.  In the alternative, on or about 1 May 1991, in consideration of their
mutual promises, the First Defendant agreed to grant,
and the Squadron agreed
to take, upon the terms and conditions then agreed upon, a lease over the
Boatshed area ...
<P>

	22.  In breach of such agreement, the First Defendant has refused to grant
such a lease to the Squadron."
<P>

79	In further elaboration of this submission the Outline of Plaintiffs'
Submissions contained the following paragraph:-
<P>

	"2.4.  As to the contract claims the Plaintiffs say as follows:-
<P>

	(a)  The evidence shows that either in January 1995 or in May 1991, there was
a binding agreement between the parties for the granting
of a lease.  The
former was constituted by the documents identified in the particulars under
para. 19 of the Statement of Claim:
see AB364-440.
<P>

	(b)  The latter was constituted by the conversation and documents identified
in the particulars under para. 21 of the Statement
of Claim: see AB185-195".
<P>

80	In my opinion, however, the material relied upon by the plaintiffs in
support of this submission does not establish the coming
into existence of an
agreement for lease binding the relevant parties since it is plain, in my
opinion, from the correspondence,
that any such agreement was always subject to
the execution of a formal document.  As such, in my opinion, the situation fell
within
the third class of contracts referred to in <b><i>Masters v Cameron
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 353</a>, namely, that class of contracts in which the parties
do not intend to be bound unless and until they execute a formal contract.
<P>

81	The relevant passages in <b><i>Masters v Cameron</i></b> (at 360) are as
follows:-
<P>

	"Where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a
contractual nature and also agree that the matter of
their negotiation shall be
dealt with by a formal contract, the case may belong to any of three classes.
It may be one in which the
parties have reached finality in arranging all the
terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance of
those terms, but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form
which will be fuller or more precise but not different
in effect.  Or,
secondly, it may be a case in which the parties have completely agreed upon all
the terms of their bargain and intend
no departure from or addition to that
which their agreed terms express or imply, but nevertheless have made
performance of one or
more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a
formal document.  Or, thirdly, the case may be one in which the intention of
the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they
execute a formal contract.
<P>

	In each of the first two cases there is a binding contract; in the first case
a contract binding the parties at once to perform
the agreed terms whether the
contemplated formal document comes into existence or not, and to join (if they
have so agreed) in settling
and executing the formal document; and in the
second case a contract binding the parties to join in bringing the formal
contract
into existence and then to carry it into execution ...
<P>

	Cases of the third class are fundamentally different.  They are cases in which
the terms of agreement are not intended to have,
and therefore do not have, any
binding effect of their own ...The parties may have so provided either because
they have dealt only
with major matters and contemplate that others will or may
be regulated by provisions to be introduced into the formal document ...
or
simply because they wish to reserve to themselves a right to withdraw at any
time until the formal document is signed ...
<P>

	The question depends upon the intention disclosed by the language the parties
have employed, and no special form of words is essential
to be used in order
that there shall be no contract binding upon the parties before the execution
of their agreement in its ultimate
shape."
<P>

82	Reference was also made to, inter alia, the following passage in the
judgment of Gleeson CJ in <i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth
Commonwealth Games Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2018%20NSWLR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) </i>18 NSWLR 540</a> at 548:-
<P>

	"The question in a case such as the present is expressed in terms of the
intention of the parties to make a concluded bargain:
see, e.g., <i>Masters v
Cameron </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 353</a> at 360.  That is not the same as, although in a
given case it may be closely related to, the question whether the parties have
reached
agreement upon such terms as are, in the circumstances, legally
necessary to constitute a contract.  To say that parties to negotiations
have
agreed upon sufficient matters to produce the consequence that, perhaps by
reference to implied terms or by resort to considerations
of reasonableness, a
court will treat their consensus as sufficiently comprehensive to be legally
binding, is not the same thing
as to say that a court will decide that they
intended to make a concluded bargain.  Nevertheless, in the ordinary case, as a
matter
of fact and commonsense, other things being equal, the more numerous and
significant the areas in respect of which the parties have
failed to reach
agreement, the slower a court will be to conclude that they had the requisite
contractual intention.
<P>

	Reference has earlier been made to `intention'.  Cases which typically give
rise to problems of the kind presently under consideration
are cases in which
there is no doubt that the parties had a common intention that at some stage,
and by some means, they would enter
into contractual relations.  They have
entered into negotiations for that specific purpose.  The problem which arises
is that they
have exchanged communications which, on the one hand, use the
language of agreement but, on the other hand, disclose an expectation
that at
some future time a document embodying the terms of their contractual
arrangement will be brought into existence.  Where,
as in the present case, the
communications which the parties have exchanged are in writing, the question of
their `intention' is,
prima facie, to be resolved objectively, and as a matter
of construction of the relevant documents."

<P>

84	<u>Alleged Agreement of May 1991</u>
<P>

85	In the course of the hearing it was indicated that the plaintiffs did not
press their submissions in respect of this allegation.
 I propose,
nevertheless, to deal with those submissions on their merits because, in my
opinion, the analysis of those submissions
sheds historical light on the
dealings between the parties which is relevant to other submissions.  
<P>

86	In relation to the alleged agreement between the First Defendant and the
First Plaintiff to grant a lease over the boatshed area
upon terms and
conditions then agreed upon said to have come into existence on or about 1 May
1991, the plaintiffs originally relied
principally upon the notes of a
discussion between the Commodore of RANSA with a representative of the Trust
held on 1 May 1991,
in respect of which notes of discussion were made by the
representative of the Trust, Mr. David Price.  
<P>

87	In my opinion, however, it is plain that the matters discussed at the
meeting of the 1 May 1991 between the Commodore of RANSA
and Mr. Price on
behalf of the Trust were not intended to be the whole of the terms of the
proposed lease.  They certainly appear
to have dealt with the principal
matters, including the term of the lease and the rental, but it is plain, in my
opinion, that the
parties realised and intended that other matters would have
to be covered in the lease as well.  In this connection I note that the
letter
of 17 May 1991 from the representative of the Trust to the Commodore, Sydney
Squadron RANSA, states:-
<P>

	"I attach a copy of notes of our discussion which I have submitted to the
members of the Trust who have unanimously approved the
same <u>in
principle</u>.  I suggest that these may <u>form</u> <u>the basis of the Lease
arrangements</u> between RANSA and the Trust and if you agree, you might let us
have your views in order that we can arrange for <u>the preparation of the
Lease</u>.  Any Lease of course would have to be subject to the consent of the
Minister but in the circumstances we would not anticipate this
to be a
problem."  (underlining supplied).
<P>

88	This passage indicates, in my opinion, that, at least the Trust, was
envisaging a more formal document containing terms additional
to those
discussed at the meeting of 1 May 1991.
<P>

89	This view is also supported by the fact that in the Sydney Squadron's letter
dated 22 May 1991 to the Trust it is stated that
"I am pleased to advise you
that at a Sydney Squadron Committee meeting held at the Boatshed on 17 May
1991, it has agreed to <u>principles</u> contained in the proposal."  The
letter also contained the following passages:-
<P>

	          "(a)  Would you please prepare a draft lease for our perusal.
<P>

	(b)  May we assume that all previous agreements are replaced with this
agreement and commencement date of this new agreement is
17 May 1991.
<P>

	(c)  The new rental agreement commences 1 June 1991, and rental for the first
period of five years shall be payable monthly in
advance at a rate of
one-twelfth of $5,000 (five thousand dollars) or $416.67...
<P>

	(e)  It is noted that it is intended to reduce the rental level once the site
development is completed.
<P>

	(f)  It is recommended that additional car-parking requirements are addressed
by discussing the liquor licensing requirements of
the Woollahra Municipal
Council and the Waverley Licensing Court.  I believe a further 20-25 would put
us in the ball park.
<P>

	(g)  Public Liability Insurance is already in operation."
<P>

90	Significantly, the last paragraph of this letter was in the following terms,
in my view indicating that there had not been complete
and final agreement
coupled with an intention immediately to be bound by the terms referred to:-
<P>

	"Whilst it is appreciated the effort and patience to achieve the result so
far, may we work towards execution of the lease before
conclusion of my tenure
i.e. 31st July."
<P>

91	The letter dated 5 June 1991 to the Commodore from David Price on behalf of
the Trust responds to the various matters raised
in the letter of 22 May 1991
indicating again that final agreement had not been reached in relation to at
least some of the matters
referred to.
<P>

92	This view is further reinforced by the fact that the draft lease forwarded
with the letter of 11 July 1991 from the Trust to
the Commodore contained
provisions relating to many more subject matters than those discussed at the
meeting of 1 May 1991 and referred
to in the following correspondence.
<P>

93	The final letter particularised by the plaintiffs in this connection, being
the letter of 22 October 1991 from RANSA to the Trust
relates to the obtaining
of a liquor licence, inter alia, and states, inter alia, as follows:-
<P>

	"Two obstacles stand in our path.  The first is the speedy resolution of a
lease with the Trust.  I believe that there is overall
agreement regarding the
rent to be paid and the conditions which will apply to our continuing tenancy
of the Boatshed.  Unfortunately,
Mr. David Price has been away overseas, but as
soon as he returns, I hope to resolve the details of the lease and I am sure
you will
ensure that the final lease is expedited through its latest stages.
We are relying on function licences at the present, but these
have been
approved, only until the end of the year."
<P>

94	In my opinion, this makes it abundantly clear that, even at this stage the
parties had not reached final and concluded agreement
on all the terms of their
proposed bargain.  Moreover, on 22 November 1991 it appears that a draft lease
was sent by facsimile to
RANSA from Mr. David Price representing the Trust
through a firm of solicitors which facsimile was in the following terms as also
set out above:-
<P>

	"Draft Lease as discussed.  It follows the Specimen Lease prescribed by the
Department for these things with the exception of clauses
30 and 31.  The
question of <u>car parking</u> perhaps we could discuss when you have had a
chance to look at the draft."
<P>

95	It is plain, in my opinion, that even as at this date, namely, 22 November
1991, the parties had not reached final and concluded
agreement on all the
terms of the proposed lease and, accordingly, the original submission on behalf
of the plaintiffs to the effect
that on or about 1 May 1991, in consideration
of the mutual promises, the First Defendant agreed to grant, and the Squadron
agreed
to take, upon the terms and conditions then agreed upon, a lease over
the boatshed area, as set out in paragraph 21 in the Statement
of Claim and
there particularised as well as being referred to in paragraph 2.4(b) of the
Plaintiff's Outline, would have had to
be rejected.
<P>

96	<u>Alleged Agreement of January 1995</u>
<P>

97	The material relied upon on behalf of the plaintiffs to support the
submission that a binding contract came into existence in
January 1995,
commenced with the letter dated 18 October 1984 from the solicitors for the
Trust to the solicitors for RANSA forwarding
a draft lease of some complexity
(as well as a costs agreement between solicitor and client and a memo of the
Trust's solicitors'
costs and disbursements), which makes it plain that the
parties still contemplated and intended that a formal document should be
executed.  Thereafter there followed correspondence between the solicitors for
the parties concerning the terms contained in the
draft lease as so submitted
(some of which have been referred to above) and by letter dated 5 January 1995
from the solicitors for
the Trust to the solicitors for RANSA various
amendments to the draft lease were submitted for consideration in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"Following our conference we suggest the following amendments to the Lease
submitted to you for your consideration (the amendments
and indeed the Lease
are subject to approval by the Trust and in due course the Minister ...)".
<P>

98	There followed various suggested amendments.
<P>

99	By letter dated 25 January 1995 from the solicitors for RANSA to the
solicitors for the Trust it was stated as follows:-
<P>

	"We refer to the writer's telephone message left for Mr. Price yesterday and
confirm that we have been instructed by RANSA to agree
to the amendments to the
lease set out in your letter of 5 instant.
<P>

	Accordingly, we shall be obliged to receive the lease for execution at your
earliest opportunity....".
<P>

100	In this connection it should be remembered, however, that the amendments in
respect of which it was being stated that they had
been agreed to by RANSA were
amendments which were "subject to approval by the Trust and in due course the
Minister".  The letter
of 25 January 1995 also plainly contemplates the
execution of a formal document.
<P>

101	The last letter relied upon in this connection by the plaintiffs, as
particularised, is the letter dated 21 February 1995 from
the Secretary of the
Trust to the Department of Conversation and Land Management containing the
following passages:-
<P>

	"Following extensive negotiation the Trust has completed a draft lease with
the Royal Australian Naval Sailing Association for
that Organisation's
occupation of portion of the Reserve ...the Department should be aware that the
draft lease has been approved
by the Trust with one member, Mr. M. Junner,
dissenting on the grounds that the area subject to the lease and licence, in
his opinion,
is greater than that used by the Association at the time of the
land transfer.
<P>

	It would be appreciated if arrangements could now be made for the draft lease
to be submitted for the Minister's consideration."
<P>

102	It is to be observed that it does not appear that this letter came to the
attention of the solicitors for the plaintiffs, nor
that they were informed
otherwise of the Trust approval of the draft lease (presumably with the
amendments discussed) which was,
in any event, still subject to approval by the
Minister, and, in my opinion, in all the circumstances, subject to the
execution of
a formal document.
<P>

103	The next letter in the agreed bundle of agreed documents is the letter
dated 31 August 1995 from the Minister for Land and Water
Conservation to RANSA
Sydney Squadron and RANSA which as set out above contains the following
paragraphs:-
<P>

	"I refer to your recent letter regarding RANSA's occupation at the Rushcutters
Bay Maritime Reserve.  As you would appreciate,
the finalisation of the
Association's lease has been held up pending finalisation of a Plan of
Management for the Reserve ... these
issues will need to be resolved before the
question of the Association's lease can be finalised."
<P>

104	There is no suggestion that, at this time, or, indeed, earlier, RANSA had
written to the Minister and/or the Trust and/or its
solicitors claiming that in
the light of the earlier correspondence a final and concluded agreement for
lease had been reached. 
From this I infer that the plaintiffs, and, indeed,
the defendants as well, were of the view that there could be no final and
binding
agreement between them until the execution of a formal document.
<P>

105	These considerations are not affected, in my opinion, by the further matter
relied upon and particularised by the plaintiffs,
namely, the resolution of the
RANSA Council to accept the amendments proposed by the solicitors for the Trust
and the subsequent
verbal communication of such resolution to the solicitors
for the Trust and/or to the Trust itself.
<P>

106	<u>The Fourth Submission of the Plaintiffs</u>
<P>

107	The fourth submission on behalf of the plaintiffs was to the effect that
one or other of the plaintiffs was entitled to a lease
upon the basis of
"conventional estoppel (Statement of Claim, paras. 23-26)".
<P>

108	Paragraphs 23 to 26 of the Statement of Claim are in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"23.  In the alternative, since 1 July 1990, or shortly thereafter, and until
September 1998, the Squadron and/or RANSA have, with
the consent of the First
Defendant, used the areas marked by dots and by cross-hatching on the plan
annexed hereto for car-parking
purposes.
<P>

	<u>Particulars of Consent</u>
<P>

	1.5.90 Letter, First Defendant to RANSA
<P>

	3.4.91 Letter, First Defendant to Squadron
<P>

	24.  During the said period of time, the First Defendant on the one hand and
the Squadron or RANSA on the other hand, have conducted
their affairs and the
relationship between them on the assumption that -
<P>

	24.1  The area to be leased to the Squadron or RANSA would include the said
areas marked by dots and cross-hatching or
<P>

	24.2  The First Defendant would grant a lease, licence or right of way over
such areas to the Squadron or RANSA for car-parking
purposes, or
<P>

	24.3  The First Defendant would otherwise grant to the Squadron or RANSA the
right to use such areas for car-parking purposes and/or
for access to a
car-parking area.
<P>

	25.  The Defendants are accordingly estopped and precluded and from denying
the said assumption.
<P>

	26.  The Squadron and RANSA are ready, willing and able to enter into and take
a lease on reasonable terms of the boatshed area,
and a lease, licence or right
of way or other right of occupation on reasonable terms over the areas marked
with dots and cross-hatching
on the plan annexed hereto or any other reasonable
area within the land."
<P>

109	The plaintiffs' submission in relation to conventional estoppel was further
elaborated in the Outline of Plaintiffs' Submissions
as follows:-
<P>

	"2.5  As to the claim founded upon conventional estoppel, the Plaintiffs' case
is as follows:
<P>

	(a)  The relations between the parties have been conducted at all times upon
the basis of an agreed or assumed state of affairs,
namely, that one or other
of the Plaintiffs was entitled to occupy, pursuant to a long-term lease at a
nominal rental, an area of
the Defendants' land which included the boatshed and
the land appurtenant to it for car-parking.  The Plaintiffs rely upon the
matters
set out above in relation to promissory estoppel.  They also rely upon
the delineation of the area of land that they were authorised
to occupy in
March 1991 and upon the fact that, until late 1998 they were permitted by the
Defendants to occupy that area.
<P>

	(b)  There can be no doubt about the relevant principles ..."  (Here reference
was made to various authorities).
<P>

110	The first letter particularised in paragraph 23 of the Statement of Claim
is the letter dated 1 May 1990 from the Chairman of
the Trust to RANSA which
was in the following terms:-
<P>

	"As you know the Trust is faced with the task of raising considerable sums of
money to fund the development of the Reserve and
the restoration of the
building situated upon it.  At the present moment its resources are limited to
existing occupants pending
rezoning of the site which the Trust hopes will be
forthcoming and which will enable the leasing of certain areas as an
income-producing
measure.
<P>

	As an interim measure the Trust is considering leasing the parade ground area
as parking for neighbouring organisations pending
its redevelopment as passive
recreation area for the general public.  
<P>

	Existing occupants would be offered the first opportunity to secure this
temporary facility.
<P>

	The Trust feels a reasonable period of notice is appropriate, and therefore
wishes to advise you that as of 1st July 1990 unrestricted
parking by your
members will no longer be permitted.  In light of this you may wish to advise
your members of the possibility that
the volume of parking presently available
to them may not be so after 1st July.  Naturally a reasonable area will be
allocated for
the exclusive use of RANSA when this arrangement is put into
effect.  The Sub-Committee of the Trust presently negotiating with your
Association in terms of the Lease will be in touch with you to discuss this
proposal in the near future."
<P>

111	The second letter particularised by the plaintiffs in paragraph 23 of the
Statement of Claim is the letter dated 3 April 1991
from the Trust to RANSA
which is in the following terms:-
<P>

	"Following the renewal of the fence along the New Beach Road boundary of the
Reserve, the parade ground area south of the temporary
internal fence will no
longer be available to your members for parking.
<P>

	The lock which formerly secured the main gates will be used to secure the new
entrance accessing the area to the north of the temporary
internal fence.  Your
members are at liberty to use this area for parking for the time being.  In due
course a properly defined area
will be allocated to RANSA.
<P>

	This arrangement will take effect from Friday 12 April 1991.  Please advise
your members."
<P>

112	The passages relied upon on behalf of the plaintiffs in the relevant
authorities included the following:-
<P>

	"The object of estoppel <u>in pais</u> is to prevent an unjust departure by
one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of some act or
omission which,
unless the assumption be adhered to, would operate to that
other's detriment.  Whether a departure by a party from the assumption
should
be considered unjust and inadmissible depends on the part taken by him in
occasioning its adoption by the other party.  He
may be required to abide by
the assumption because it formed the conventional basis upon which the parties
entered into contractual
or other mutual relations, such as bailment ... or
because he directly made representations upon which other party founded the
assumption":
<u>per</u> Dixon J in <i>Thompson v Palmer <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2049%20CLR%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) </i>49 CLR 507</a>
at 547.
<P>

	"...The principle upon which estoppel <u>in pais</u> is founded is that the
law should not permit an unjust departure by a party from an assumption of fact
which he has caused another
party to adopt or accept for the purpose of their
legal relation.  This is, of course, a very general statement.  But it is the
basis
of the rules governing estoppel.  Those rules work out the more precise
grounds upon which the law holds a party disentitled to depart
from an
assumption in the assertion of rights against another.  One condition appears
always to be indispensable.  That other must
have so acted or abstained from
acting upon the footing of the state of affairs assumed that he would suffer a
detriment if the opposite
party were afterwards allowed to set up rights
against him inconsistent with the assumption.  In stating this essential
condition,
particularly where the estoppel flows from representation, it is
often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have
been induced
to act to his detriment.  Although substantially such a statement is correct
and leads to no misunderstanding, it does
not bring out clearly the base or
basal purpose of the doctrine.  That purpose is to avoid or prevent a detriment
to the party asserting
the estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere
to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting"

	"Estoppel by convention is a form of estoppel founded not on a representation
of fact made by a representor and acted on by a representee
to his detriment,
but on the conduct of  relations between the parties on the basis of an agreed
or assumed state of facts, which
both will be estopped from denying.  The
existence of an estoppel based on convention between the parties has often been
recognised"

<P>

113	In my opinion, the "agreed or assumed state of affairs" upon the basis of
which the plaintiffs have alleged that "The relations
between the parties have
been conducted at all times", namely, "that one or other of the Plaintiffs was
entitled to occupy, pursuant
to a long-term lease at a nominal rental, an area
of the Defendants' land which included the boatshed and the land appurtenant to
it for car-parking", is not such as to fall within the principles as to
conventional estoppel referred to above, principally, inter
alia, because the
"agreed or assumed state of affairs" did not include any assumption as to the
particular terms of the "long-term
lease at a nominal rental" pursuant to which
it is alleged that one or other of the plaintiffs was entitled to occupy the
relevant
area.  In this connection the considerations and reasoning applied in
relation to the submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs in
respect of estoppel
by representation as set out earlier in this judgment apply, <cite>mutatis
mutandis</cite>.  
<P>

114	In my opinion, in the absence of any common agreement or assumption as to
the terms of any such lease it cannot be said that
it would be inequitable for
the defendants to refuse to grant a lease to one or other of the plaintiffs of
the relevant area.  Conversely,
in my opinion, in those circumstances, it was
not reasonable for the plaintiffs to conduct their affairs in reliance upon any
assumption
that the defendants would grant to the plaintiffs a lease on terms
acceptable to them, and any detriment that they may have suffered
by reason
thereof could not have the effect of rendering it inequitable for the
defendants to refuse to grant to one or other of
the plaintiffs a lease of the
relevant area other than a lease upon terms acceptable to them (the
plaintiffs).
<P>

115	Accordingly, in my opinion, the submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs to
the effect that one or other of the plaintiffs was
entitled to a lease of the
car-parking area based upon the principles relating to conventional estoppel
must be rejected.
<P>

116	<u>Submissions As To The Plan of Management</u>
<P>

117	Having regard to the above findings, it is unnecessary for me to deal with
the defence of the defendants to the effect that
by reason of the adoption by
the Minister of the plan of management in relation to, inter alia, the subject
land, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 114</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act 1989</a> (NSW),</i></b>
which plan relevantly precludes car-parking on the land, any agreement which
the Court might find binding upon the defendants to
grant a lease including car
parking to either of the plaintiffs has been frustrated and is not enforceable,
and further that, as
a matter of discretion, the Court would not order specific
performance of any such agreement nor make any orders sought by the plaintiffs
even if the estoppel alleged by the plaintiffs in the Statement of Claim were
made good.  I note that in relation to this defence
the plaintiffs have
submitted that the adoption of a plan of management at a time when the second
defendant well knew of the rights
of the plaintiffs cannot operate to defeat
those rights since otherwise the defendants would be entitled to rely upon
self-imposed
impossibility" to avoid their obligations.
<P>

118	Having regard to my findings, there was, in my opinion, no impediment to
the adoption by the Minister of the plan of management
in relation to the
subject land.
<P>

119	<u>Submissions of the Plaintiffs as to the Terms of the Alleged
Lease</u>
<P>

120	As stated above, I have found that there was no agreement between the
parties as to the terms of any proposed lease to be granted
to one or other of
the plaintiffs, and my finding to that effect necessarily involves the
rejection of the plaintiffs' submissions
as to the terms of the lease.  Those
submissions are contained in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of the Outline of
Plaintiffs' Submissions
which are in the following terms:-
<P>

	"3.1  The terms of the 1979 Agreement and of statements made by the parties at
that time make it plain that the relevant Plaintiff
would be entitled to occupy
the relevant land indefinitely and at a nominal rental.  The Plaintiffs accept
that, prima facie, because
the land is Crown Land and there is now a statutory
maximum period of a lease of such land of 100 years (<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act 1989</a>,
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 41)</a>, that, 20 years having passed, they are only reasonably
entitled to a lease for another 80 years.  They accept that the rental agreed
upon between them and the First Defendant in 1994-1995, namely, $5,000 per
annum is a `nominal rental'.  Prima facie, no other terms
are necessary, since
the obligation to keep the premises in good order can reasonably be implied.
<P>

	3.2  However, the Plaintiffs accept that such a lease could properly include
such terms as might reasonably be found in a long-term
lease of Crown Land to a
voluntary organisation for sporting purposes.  It was plainly not within the
contemplation of the party
to the 1979 Agreement that the lease to the RANSA
Sailing Association would be on `commercial terms' such as those sought to be
imposed
by the First Defendant in the lease which is presently on offer:
AB699."
<P>

121	In my opinion, it is plain from the correspondence between the parties that
there was never any final agreement between the
parties to the effect that "the
relevant Plaintiff would be entitled to occupy the relevant land indefinitely
and at a nominal rental"
as alleged by the plaintiffs.  Any apparent agreement
to that effect was plainly conditional upon agreement on all the other
contemplated
terms of the proposed lease, and until agreement had been reached
on all the terms of the proposed lease, there could be no final
and concluded
agreement on any particular terms of any such lease, even if, as is doubtful,
meaning could be given to the words "indefinitely"
and "nominal rental".
Moreover, in my opinion, for these reasons there was no final and concluded
agreement to the effect that the
sum of $5,000 per annum would be "a nominal
rental' within the meaning of the alleged agreement.  Nor, in my opinion, is it
to the
point to submit, as the plaintiffs do, that "no other terms are
necessary, since the obligation to keep the premises in good order
can
reasonably be implied", in circumstances where the relevant correspondence
makes it plain that it was at all material times intended
that the lease would
contain many other detailed terms as to which agreement was never reached.
<P>

122	I am also of the opinion that even if there were agreement to the effect
that a lease would be granted containing terms "such
... as might reasonably be
found in a long-term lease of Crown Land to a voluntary organisation for
sporting purposes" because "it
was plainly not within the contemplation of the
parties to the 1979 Agreement that the lease to the RANSA Sailing Association
would
be on "commercial terms", such an agreement would be void for uncertainty
having regard to the uncertainty of identifying what were
and what were not
"such terms as might reasonably be found in a long-term lease of Crown Land to
a voluntary organisation for sporting
purposes."
<P>

123	<u>Order of the Court</u>
<P>

124	I therefore dismiss the statement of claim of the plaintiffs and I order
that the costs of the defendants of these proceedings
be paid by the
plaintiffs.
<P>
