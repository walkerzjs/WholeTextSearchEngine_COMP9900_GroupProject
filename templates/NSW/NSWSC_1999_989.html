WEDNESDAY, 29 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>3807/99	LEVENSTRATH COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION INC v COUNCIL OF THE SHIRE OF
NYMBOIDA &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

<b>The Question</b>
<P>

1	The question in this matter is whether, under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act 1993</a>
("the Act"), councillors who have disclosed an interest in a development
application and are thereby disqualified from participating
in the
consideration of or from voting on it, can, if present at the meeting, be
counted as part of the quorum. 
<P>

<b>The Legislative Provisions</b>
<P>

2	The relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:
<P>

"368	What is the quorum for a meeting?
<P>

The quorum for a meeting of the council is a majority of the councillors of the
council who hold office for the time being and are
not suspended from
office.
<P>

370	What are the voting entitlements of councillors?
<P>

(1)	Each councillor is entitled to one vote.
<P>

(2)	However, the person presiding at a meeting of the council has, in the event
of an equality of votes, a second or casting vote.
<P>

371	What constitutes a decision of the council?
<P>

A decision supported by a majority of the votes at a meeting of the council at
which a quorum is present is a decision of the council.
<P>

451	Disclosure and participation in meetings
<P>

(1)	A councillor or a member of a council committee who has a pecuniary
interest in any matter with which the council is concerned
and who is present
at a meeting of the council or committee at which the matter is being
considered must disclose the interest to
the meeting as soon as practicable.
<P>

(2)	The councillor or member must not take part in the consideration or
discussion of the matter.
<P>

(3)	The councillor or member must not vote on any question relating to the
matter.
<P>

458	Powers of Minister in relation to meetings
<P>

The Minister may, conditionally or unconditionally, allow a councillor or a
member of a council committee who has a pecuniary interest
in a matter with
which the council is concerned and who is present at a meeting of the council
or committee to take part in the consideration
or discussion of the matter and
to vote on the matter if the Minister is of the opinion:
<P>

(a)	that the number of councillors prevented from voting would be so great a
proportion of the whole as to impede the transaction
of business, or
<P>

(b)	that it is in the interests of the electors for the area to do so."
<P>

3	The following provision of the Local Government (Meetings) Regulation 1993
was referred to in argument:
<P>

"23	Voting at council meetings
<P>

(1)	A councillor who is present at a meeting of a council but who fails to vote
on a motion put to the meeting is taken to have
voted against the motion.  This
subclause does not apply to a councillor who does not vote because he or she
has a pecuniary interest
in the subject-matter of the motion.
<P>

(2)	If a councillor who has voted against a motion put at a council meeting so
requests, the general manager must ensure that the
councillor's dissenting vote
is recorded in the council's minutes.
<P>

(3)	The decision of the chairperson as to the result of a vote is final, unless
the decision is immediately challenged and not fewer
than 2 councillors rise
and demand a division.
<P>

(4)	When a division on a motion is demanded, the chairperson must ensure that
the division takes place immediately.  The general
manager must ensure that the
names of those who vote for the motion and those who vote against it are
respectively recorded in the
council's minutes.
<P>

(5)	Voting at a council meeting, including voting in an election at such a
meeting, is to be by open means (such as on the voices
or by show of hands).
However, the council may resolve that the voting in any election by councillors
for mayor or deputy mayor is
to be by secret ballot.
<P>

Note.  The Local Government (Elections) Regulation 1993 provides that a council
is to resolve whether an election by the councillors
for mayor or deputy mayor
is to be by preferential ballot, ordinary ballot or open voting (clause 120 and
clause 3 of Schedule 3).
 Clause 3 of Schedule 3 also makes it clear that
`ballot' has its normal meaning of secret ballot."
<P>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

4	The Nymboida Shire Council has six members.  A quorum is four.  It is common
ground that one councillor is sick and cannot attend
meetings.  It is equally
common ground that two councillors, Peter Williamson and Brenda Constable, have
a pecuniary interest in
development application 123/99 ("DA 123") within the
meaning of ss 442 and 451 of the Act.  They have complied with their
obligations
under s 451(1) and disclosed their interests. Without the presence
of at least one of them, the Council cannot in present circumstances
have a
quorum in respect of DA 123.  There has been no delegation by the Council of
its powers which would enable the determination
of DA 123 under delegated
authority.  At least one of the disqualified councillors has indicated an
intention to be present at a
meeting at which DA 123 is to be considered.  The
Council has indicated an intention to count the disqualified councillors, if
present,
as part of a quorum for the conduct of the relevant item of business.
The plaintiff contends that this cannot in law be done.  The
plaintiff's
standing to bring these proceedings is not challenged.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's</b> <b>Contention</b>
<P>

5	The plaintiff's contention is that persons who cannot consider and vote on a
subject matter at a meeting cannot be counted towards
the quorum.  A quorum
must consist of councillors who are capable of taking part in the consideration
and discussion of and the voting
upon the business at hand.  It is said that
this is a principle of the common law of meetings, and that nothing in the Act
displaces
it.  Indeed, it is said that the obligations of consideration imposed
on councillors in determining development applications by s
79C(1) of the
Environmental Planning &amp; Assessment Act 1979 conduce to the conclusion that
disqualified councillors should not
be counted.  
<P>

6	The <i>locus classicus </i>relating to the principle<i> </i>propounded is
<b>In re</b> <b>Greymouth Point Elizabeth Railway and Coal Company Limited</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%201%20Ch%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] 1 Ch 32.</a>  In that case, article 106 of the articles of association of
the company prohibited a director from voting on matters in which he
had an
interest and, if he did so, his vote was not to be counted.  Article 116
provided that in relevant circumstances two directors
should be a quorum.
Farwell J said (at 34):
<P>

"I think that ... the meaning of art 116 is that the two directors to form the
quorum for the despatch of business must be two directors
who are capable of
voting on the business before the board; otherwise it is idle."
<P>

	
<P>

	<b>Greymouth</b><i> </i> has been consistently applied.  In <b>Stewart v
Oliver (No 2</b>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%2018%20FLR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 18 FLR 83</a> Joske J said (at 84-5):
<P>

"The presence of a quorum means a quorum competent to transact and vote upon
the business before the meeting.  If some of those
present are disqualified
from voting and there is not otherwise a quorum no business can be validly
done."

Master White; and see generally Joske's <i>Law and Procedure at Meetings in
Australia </i>(8th ed, 1994) 31.  Most importantly the principle has received

Attention was also drawn to the decision of Young J in <b>Ball v Pearsall

<P>

	
<P>

7	The provision of the former Act corresponding with s 451, s 46C of the Local
Government Act 1919, as it stood at the time of its
replacement, was similar to
s 451.  The new provision was therefore enacted in a familiar statutory context
and in a context in which
the established common law principle in
<b>Greymouth</b> was well understood.
<P>

	
<P>

8	For these reasons it was submitted that, consistently with the principle in
<b>Greymouth</b>, a councillor who is not capable of voting on the business
before the council does not form part of the quorum.
<P>

	
<P>

9	This result is also conduced to by the need for the public appearance, as
well as the actuality, of integrity.  One of the purposes
of the disclosure of
interest provisions was to aid the public to have confidence in councillors and
"they must also be seen to act
properly": Second Reading Speech, 27 November
1992, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 10423.  The counting of a councillor to
found
a quorum in respect of an item of business in which the councillor was
interested, albeit the interest had been disclosed and there
was no
participation in consideration or voting, could detract from the public
appearance of integrity.
<P>

<b>The Defendant's Contention</b>
<P>

	
<P>

10	As I understand it, the defendant concedes the correctness of the
<b>Greymouth </b>principle as a proposition of law, but says that it has no
application to the present situation because displaced by the provisions
of the
Act.  That contention is summarised as follows.  The Act and the Regulation
clearly contemplate:
<P>

&#183;	a quorum formed by the presence of persons;
<P>

&#183;	the disclosure of pecuniary interests;
<P>

&#183;	the continued presence at the meeting of those interested (on condition
that they not vote/participate);
<P>

&#183;	the taking of a vote;
<P>

&#183;	the making of a decision (by a majority of <b>the votes</b> at a
meeting)and the disregard of an abstaining vote (because of a pecuniary
interest) as a vote in the negative.
<P>

The defendant particularly relies on the words of s 368 itself as indicating
that councillors "who hold office" are to be counted
not only in establishing
the number needed for a quorum but, if present at a meeting, towards those
constituting the quorum, albeit
disqualified from participating in
consideration or voting.
<P>

11	The defendant submits that to adopt the plaintiff's construction of quorum
by reference to common law principles of disqualification
would be to ignore
the express terms of the section, and to import words into the section which
are not required for the resolution
of any ambiguity, for there is none.  The
legislature clearly chose to exclude certain persons from the calculation of a
quorum,
and by its silence is to be taken as having chosen to include others
(those interested in a pecuniary sense).  To read into an Act
of Parliament
words which do not appear in the enactment (in the absence of necessity) is
inappropriate: see Pearce &amp; Geddes'
<i>Statutory Interpretation in
Australia</i> (4th ed, 1996) [2.16].
<P>

12	Furthermore, the defendant claims support for its construction of s 368 in
the maxims <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>: Pearce &amp; Geddes
[4.22], and <i>Expressum facit cessare tacitum</i>: Pearce &amp; Geddes [4.23].
With respect to the former, it is submitted that authorities declining to use
the principle as a "bolster"
in the interpretation of the clear words of a
statute (as here, with respect to s 368) are confined to instances where,
traditionally,
courts have construed narrowly a claimed intention by Parliament
to exclude fundamental rights (such as natural justice) or assumptions
of law.
The maxims may be used to infer an intention to exclude matters, not
specifically dealt with.  In this case, express words
excluding certain persons
from the determination of a quorum may be taken to import the inclusion of all
others in that determination.
 Here:
<P>

a.	Parliament has prescribed a regime for the conduct of the Council's
business;
<P>

b.	as a subset of that prescription, Parliament has defined by reference to
certain matters what is to be taken as a quorum;
<P>

c.	it has excluded a certain body of persons (namely those suspended from
office);
<P>

d.	it has not excluded any other body of persons; and
<P>

e.	(thereby) may be taken not to have excluded those other persons.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

13	In my view, the defendant's contentions fail.  The statement of principle in
[6] is correct.  Equally, the statement by the defendant
that it would be wrong
to read words into the statute is correct.  However, in my view, it is not
correct to say that the legislature
clearly chose to include among those to be
counted towards a quorum those disqualified by interest from speaking and
voting.  Section
368 clearly speaks of those to be taken into account in
determining the number whose presence is necessary to constitute a quorum;
in
my view, it does not speak at all of those who are to be counted or not counted
towards the number present; certainly it does
not speak clearly of them.  Nor
can I derive from other provisions of the Act the clear indication the
defendant seeks that the legislative
intent was to include disqualified
councillors in the count of the quorum and thus to displace the common law
rule.  If anything,
s 358 indicates to the contrary by providing a mechanism
whereby the Minister can solve the problem if it arises and, so far as
development
applications are concerned, the provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> for appeal to the Land and Environment Court
upon a deemed refusal by Council provides another avenue to avoid
stultification of
the approval process if the numbers fall short.  I do not
find the statute ambiguous, but rather enacted upon the assumption of the
existence of the common law rule as to the persons to be counted in a quorum.
If there were an ambiguity, then, in the absence of
clear legislative intention
to the contrary, the common law rule should be taken to survive: <b>Potter v
