<b>	NO 4406/98  - GAIDA JANSONS V PETER JANSONS AS 	EXECUTORS OF ESTATE OF
IMANTS JANSONS &amp; ANOR.</b>
<P>

<b>	JUDGMENT:</b>
<P>

1   	MASTER: This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a> in respect of the estate of the late Imants Jansons who died on 27 March
1998.  The deceased was survived by his widow, the plaintiff,
and four children
and his son in law of the deceased's daughter. The deceased made his last will
on 17 March 1993. Under that he
appointed two of his children, Peter Jansons
and Marite Jansons as executors. He gave all his personal estate to his widow
the plaintiff
in this action. He bequeathed his house at 15 Greenhaven Drive
Emu Plains to his widow, "as long as she wishes to reside there permanently,
or
till her death. When any of the two above mentioned situations eventuate the
said house and land to be sold".  
<P>

2   	The will went on to provide that in the event of the sale
of the property the estate was to be divided into six shares, one
for the
plaintiff, one for the daughter, Marite Jansons, one for the son Janis Jansons,
one for the son Ojars Jansons, one for the
son Peter Jansons and one for Colin
Berning who was the husband of his deceased child. That share was to be held
equally between
Colin Berning and his children Angela and Etienne.
<P>

3   		The asset of the estate substantially consisted of the
house at 15 Greenhaven Drive Emu Plains. That is a house which has
a separate
flat in it and it is valued at $180,000. That flat has been occupied by the
son, Ojars who at times has paid rent. At
one stage it was $75 per week and
recently the rent has increased up to $120 a week. There was also furniture in
the estate and that
was valued on the probate application at $3,000, there was
a 1991 Nissan Pulsar car valued at $6,000. The rents which have been collected
in respect of the flat have led to the debts in the estate having been paid.
The only debts are the costs to which I will shortly
refer.
<P>

4   		There previously was a dispute between the parties as to
whether or not the car was held by the plaintiff and the deceased
as joint
tenants or tenants in common. The reason for the dispute was that there were
debts to pay in the estate and an attempt was
made to obtain the car and sell
it to pay those debts. Those debts have now been paid and the estate does not
dispute that the estate's
share, if it were held as tenants in common, would
pass to the plaintiff. It does not seek to disturb that gift. Given the
conversations
about the purchase of the car outlined by the plaintiff in her
affidavit I, in any event, would have thought it was held by the plaintiff
and
the deceased as joint tenants and would thus pass to the plaintiff by
survivorship.
<P>

5   		This is contrary to the position which normally applies
apt at any particular evidence as to how the property is to be held.
See the
discussion on this topic in a judgment of mine in <b>Rassick v Tracey</b> 18
September 1998, unreported. 
<P>

6   		There are however costs that have been incurred in these
proceedings, for the defendant's part the costs at the conclusion
of the
proceedings are $10,862 while those of the plaintiff are $16,262. This totals
$27,124. If the house has to be sold there will
be selling expenses such as
solicitor's costs and agent's fees and accordingly it will be seen that the
distributable estate if the
house was sold would be in the order of $150,000.

<P>

7   		I will just deal with some matters going to the history of
the relationship. The plaintiff was born on 8 February 1930 and
is now sixty
nine years of age. In 1981 the testator's first wife died. The plaintiff knew
the testator and his wife and eventually
in 1989 the plaintiff and the testator
holidayed at Ayres Rock. After that the plaintiff gave up her job and commenced
to work with
the testator in his building business. She also moved into live
with him in his home. In 1990 the plaintiff sold her home, her former
matrimonial home and she distributed part of the proceeds to her children and
her grandchildren and used part of the proceeds to
contribute towards the
expenses of herself and the testator in the acquisition of assets enjoyed by
both. As an example she made
a considerable contribution and I will deal with
that later. It is apparent that she gave $18,333 to each of her five children.

<P>

8   		On 10th August 1991 the testator and the plaintiff married
and on 17 March 1993 the will was made as I have recounted. In
1995 the
testator contracted tuberculosis and in the following year in 1996 he was
diagnosed with leukemia. Both these problems required
extensive medical
attention and the testator eventually died on 27 March 1998.
<P>

9   		In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High
Court has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b> (1994) 181 CLR set out the two
stage approach that a Court must take. At page 209 it said the following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life? The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the interrelationship
which exists between 'adequate
provision' and proper maintenance' etc were
explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>. The determination of
the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an assessment of whether the
provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in all the circumstances, was
the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for the applicant having
regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial position, the size
and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship
between
the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and
other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or her bounty.
<P>

	The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations. Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant. In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court could
refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper maintenance.
Take, for example, a case
like <b> Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order
could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors".
<P>

10   		As directed by the High Court I turn to consider  the
situation of the plaintiff. She is sixty nine years of age and has
no
dependents. Her assets comprise cash on deposit of a little under $10,000. She
has the furniture which is in the home, some of
which was hers and contributed
at an earlier time. She lives on a pension amount to $362 per fortnight.
Apparently she is in good
health. There was some evidence going to the
relationship with the deceased. One of the children of the deceased, Marite,
gave some
evidence about her perception of the relationship and indicated that
certainly at the commencement it was a happy relationship. She
dealt with a
number of disputes between herself and the plaintiff and indicated that towards
the end of the relationship the deceased
may have felt that he was never left
alone by the plaintiff. It may be true but the evidence does not indicate to me
that there was
any serious rift between the plaintiff and the deceased. 
<P>

11   		It is important to recognise the contribution which the
plaintiff has made to the estate of the deceased. The plaintiff in
her
affidavit evidence suggested that she had $36,000 which she contributed to the
relationship. This does not seem to be borne out
by the documents that were
produced. The bank records show from the sale of the home she retained $18,325
and from her severance
pay on retirement the amount which she received
ultimately built up to $8,526.73. This totals $26,851. The amounts were
withdrawn
from these accounts over a period of time up to the period prior to
the deceased stopping work once he contracted tuberculosis. The
plaintiff still
has $10,000 and there is no other source of funds so it would seem that the
plaintiff applied at least $16,000 in
various purchases which she describes in
her affidavit. Basically these were to make some home improvements. There was a
new bedroom
extension and the purchase of a new fridge and a stove. There was
also assistance to build a home for the deceased brother in Latvia,
the details
of which are not available. There were the costs of a trip to New Zealand and
the costs of four trips back to Latvia.
There was also a new bedroom suite to
which she contributed. The plaintiff also brought a quantity of furniture into
the marriage.
<P>

12   		She also gave evidence of having assisted the deceased at
work but there is no detail sufficient for me to be able to assess
the extent
of that work. Part of it was regarded by the deceased as a contribution towards
her share of the purchase of the car.
She also contributed $4,000 in cash to
the purchase of that car which was in addition to the funds I have mentioned
above.
<P>

13   		The Court has to consider the situation of others having
a claim on the bounty of the deceased. These are the beneficiaries
to whom I
have referred. In this case, contrary to the usual situation the executor gave
evidence for both his own situation and
that of his brothers and sisters. There
was no objection to that course. Apparently Janis Jansons is forty four years
old and is
married to a wife of a similar age and they have been married for
some twenty four years. They have three children aged from 17 to
23 all of whom
still have some dependence upon them. Janis was employed by State Rail as a bus
driver in Grafton until he was made
redundant in 1995 apparently Janis has
retrained and today owns a house in Bush Road Grafton with a market value of
$100,000. They
apparently have no liabilities as they have used the redundancy
and superannuation monies to put out the mortgage. Janis owns a 1980
Mazda 626
and they intend apparently to sell their property and move to Sydney in due
course. They and their children apparently
in good health. 
<P>

14   		Ojars Jansons is forty one years of age. He is married to
Paula who is forty years old. They have been married for fifteen
years. They
have one eleven year old child. Apparently Ojars was working in the family
building business until that ceased in 1995.
After a period of unemployment
benefits he started subcontracting work as a builder. His wife has started
working as a receptionist.
 They apparently have a house and land at Emu
Heights purchased for $150,000 and there is a mortgage of $120,000. Ojars owns
at 1981
Nissan Bluebird. They also are in good health. Marite Jansons is forty
seven years old. She is married to Glen Cleary. They have
been married for some
two and half years and do not have any dependents. They have a cottage at
Lascelles St, Braidwood worth $150,000.
They also own some land valued at
$65,000. They have a mortgage of $140,000. Apparently they are both on a
working holiday travelling
around Australia. Both of them have occupations and
have worked since leaving school. They have a Land Cruiser worth approximately
$10,000. They also are in good health. 
<P>

15   		Colin Berning is the husband of the deceased daughter
Zaiga Jansons who predeceased the deceased. He is fifty three and is
a teacher.
He is Deputy Principal of a school. He has a house worth $170,000 which has a
mortgage to the bank of $15,000. He is another
house in Toowoomba valued at
$70,000 with a mortgage to the bank for $50,000. He has superannuation and he
drives a ten year old
motor vehicle. He has two children who apparently are not
dependent. 
<P>

16   		The executor, Peter, he is thirty four years old. He has
been married some fourteen years and he has two children twelve
and eleven. He
is an accountant by profession and a financial controller by occupation and has
worked for some sixteen years. His
wife works part time in a nursery. They own
a property at 41 Thirteenth St which is valued at $190,000 on which they have a
mortgage
of some $100,000 with Bank West. They have superannuation and are in
good health. 
<P>

17   		There is evidence of some assistance which was given by
Peter to his parents. In the affidavit of the plaintiff she makes
some
suggestion that the deceased's children did not assist her in the day to day
care of him between 1995 and the date of his death.
I would have thought that
would be unlikely, given their separate lives, that they would have taken part
in that day to day care.
 That really was a matter for the plaintiff and which
she did quite willingly. 
<P>

18   		Unfortunately there appears to have been some friction
between the plaintiff and the children of the deceased. This is not
unnatural
where the situation of the children of the first marriage have to deal with a
second wife. However there is nothing in
any of the material that has been
produced before me which would in any way detract from the proper claim of the
children on the
bounty of the testator if the estate is sufficient to
accommodate that claim. In general the children are all able to cope and look
after themselves, some of them obviously are better off than others. 
<P>

19   		The provisions normally made in respect of widows have
been set out in many cases and recently the President of the Court
of Appeal in
<b>Golosky &amp; Anor v  Golosky</b> unreported 5 October 1993, summarised them
in the following terms:
<P>

"In testing the Master's decision it is appropriate to keep in mind the
principles which governed the approach which he was obliged
to take to the
widow's application under the Act, these included:
<P>

(a) Proper respect as to be paid for the right of testamentary disposition
which is the fundamental premise upon which the provisions
of the Act are
based. That premise requires the Court, out of respect for the continuing right
of testamentary disposition, to limit
its disturbance of the testator's will to
that which is necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act, and not more. See
<b>The Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith and St Charles
Seminary, Perth v Scales </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20107%20CLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 107 CLR 9</a>,19: <b>White v Barron and
Anor,</b> above, 458, <b>Hunter,</b> above, 576:
<P>

(b) The purpose of the jurisdiction is not the correction of the hurt feelings
of sense
<P>

of wrong of the competing claimants upon the estate of the testator. The Court
is obliged simply to respond to the application of
the eligible person who was
a member of the testator's household and to consider whether, as claimed, the
provision made by the will
is inadequate for that person's proper maintenance
and advancement in life. See <b>Heyward v Fisher</b>, Court of Appeal,
unreported, 26 April 1985; (1985) NSWJB 81.
<P>

(c) Consideration of other cases must be conducted with circumspection because
of the inescapable detail of the factual circumstances
of each case. It is in
the detail that the answer to the proper application of the Act is to be
discovered. No hard and fast rules
can be adopted. Nevertheless, it had been
said that in the absence of special circumstances, it will normally be the duty
of a testator
to ensure that a spouse (or spouse equivalent) is provided with a
place to live appropriate to that which he or she has become accustomed
to.  To
the extent that the assets available to the deceased will permit such a course,
it is normally appropriate that the spouse
(or spouse equivalent) should be
provided, as well, with a fund to meet unforeseen contingencies; see <b>
Luciano</b> (above) 69-70;
<P>

(d) A mere right of residence will usually be an unsatisfactory method of
providing for a spouse's accommodation to fulfil the foregoing
normal
presupposition. This is because a spouse may be compelled by sickness, age,
urgent supervening necessity or otherwise, with
good reason, to leave the
residence. The spouse provided and will then be left without the kind of
protection which is normally expected
will be provided by a testator which is
both wise and just. See <b>Moore v Moore</b>, Court of Appeal, unreported, 16
May 1984, per Hutley JA;
<P>

(e) Considering what is 'proper' and by inference what is 'improper' as a
provision in a will, it is appropriate to take into account
all of the
circumstances of the case including such matters as the nature and quality of
the relationship between the testator and
the claimant; the character and
conduct of the claimant; the present and reasonably anticipated future needs of
the claimant,; the
size and nature of the estate and of any relevant
dispositions which may have reduced the estate available for distribution
according
to the will; the nature and relative strengths of competing claims f
testamentary recognition; and any contributions of the claimant
to the property
or to the welfare of the deceased."
<P>

20   		In talking of the need to provide a house and a sum for
contingencies the President is clearly referring to <b> Wellman </b> and
passages in <b>Luciano v Rosenblum</b> and other cases. As was pointed out by
the Court of Appeal in <b>Elliott v. Elliott</b>, unreported, 29 April 1986,
such a type of provision only applies where it can be said there has been a
long and happy marriage and
a widow has helped build up the estate of the
deceased. It also is accepted that in such cases that she should have a
sufficient
income to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and
free from any financial worry.
<P>

21   		In the present case the plaintiff and the deceased lived
together for nine years. They were married for six and half of those
years. For
the purposes of the application of these rules I accept that it was a happy
relationship for them. The plaintiff looked
after the deceased when he was sick
for a period of some three years. She also contributed some $20,000 at least to
the family home
and the purchase of the car. Certainly one thing has to be said
and that is that it was not a long marriage to which the court has
referred to
in the passages I have quoted above, but nevertheless it was still substantial.

<P>

22   		The defendants are like all children in their situation
concerned that if the property passes to the plaintiff they ultimately
will not
receive any benefit. Her own children have already benefited once when she sold
her home when she married. 
<P>

23   		The plaintiff is sixty nine years old and in this regard
I am mindful of what was said by the High Court in <b>White v Barron
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1924/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%2d1980%29%20144%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979-1980) 144 CLR 431.</a> At page 444 the court said that:
<P>

"A capital provision should only be awarded to a widow when it appears that
this is the fairest means of securing her proper maintenance.
However, the
provision of a large capital sum for a widow who is not young, may, in the
event of her early death, result in a substantial
benefit to her relatives,
contrary to the wishes of the testator, when a benefit of another kind would
have afforded an adequate
safeguard to her personally, without leaving her in a
position in which she could benefit her relatives from the proceeds of the
legacy". 
<P>

24   		However what I have to consider in the present case is
the appropriate provision for a partner of some nine years who in
a modest way
has contributed to the estate of the deceased. I have already adverted to the
Court of Appeal's comments in <b>Golosky v. Golosky</b> where they indicated
that they thought a life estate was usually inappropriate. The defendant made a
number of suggestions when he
gave evidence, when he was asked about how the
costs in respect of this matter could be paid. The one realistic suggestion
that he
made was that he could mortgage the estate property to repay the costs
and repay the loan from the rents of the upstairs flat. 
<P>

25   		The difficulty with this is the situation of the
plaintiff that if either the mortgage is not met or she needs to move to
some
other accommodation, in such case under the will she is only entitled to one
sixth of the estate. Now on the present value that
is about $25,000 and it is
not sufficient for her to obtain any type of relevant accommodation. This
highlights again what is the
proper provision for the plaintiff. Other Judges
in this division have all dealt with this problem. For instance in <b>Court v.
Hunt</b>, Young J (unreported) 14 September 1987, he said:
<P>

"Old age is a growing problem in our community and judges who sit in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> applications get experience, as well as their own experience in
the community, as to what happens when people reach the age when
they can no
longer look after themselves and one judges the evidence in these sort of
proceedings against that background knowledge".

<P>

26   	His Honour then went on to talk about the assumptions one
could make about the fact that frequently, people, once they pass
fifty-five,
have to change their accommodation and locate themselves either in retirement
villages or nursing homes which have different
requirements for capital
contribution.
<P>

27   		After talking about the evidence necessary, his Honour
went on to say:
<P>

"In many cases these days a life estate will not be sufficient because it does
not cover the situation of the plaintiff moving from
her own home to retirement
village to nursing home to hospital. Sometimes it is possible for a court to
alter a life estate to a
more flexible non-capital provision, such as was done
by Holland J in <b>Crisp v Burns Philp Trustee Co Ltd, </b> 18 December 1979,
unreported, but noted in Mason &amp; Handler Probate Service, at page 13206.
Other times the proper provision is
for a fee simple gift, realising that this
property will be sold and will be turned over into the appropriate property to
maintain
the widow for the rest of her life. Care also has to be given by those
administering the plaintiff's property to ensure that there
is sufficient
income being raised after tax that will provide for maintenance levies and the
other payments that have to be made
by the widow". 
<P>

28   		I think, sadly for the beneficiaries in this case that
this really is one of those cases where the estate is not large enough
to
accommodate the plaintiffs' claim and the appropriate orders are as follows:
<P>

(1) That in lieu of the bequest in the will of the deceased the plaintiff
receive a bequest of the whole of the estate of the deceased.
<P>

(2) The defendants' costs on an indemnity basis be paid or retained out of the
estate of the deceased.
<P>

(3) The exhibits to be returned.
