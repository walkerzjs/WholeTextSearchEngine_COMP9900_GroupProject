SOUTH WALES<br>EQUITY DIVISION - COMMERCIAL LIST<br><br><b>EINSTEIN
J</b><br><br>SYDNEY    28 October 1999<br><br><b>50113/98   Idoport Pty Limited
&amp; Market Holdings Pty Limited v National Australia Bank Limited &amp;
ors.</b><br><br><b>JUDGMENT</b><br><br><br>1   	HIS HONOUR: 
There is before the court a further amended notice of motion filed on 25 October
1999 by the plaintiffs seeking
the following
orders:<br><br><i>&#8220;(1)	Pursuant to Part 23 rule 3 of the Rules, that the
Defendants give discovery to the Plaintiffs of the documents described
in
Schedule A to this Notice of Motion by the dates referred to in paragraphs 3.2
and 3.3 of the directions made by the court on
28 May 1999 . .
.;</i><br><br><i>(2)	That the parties provide continuing discovery (by the
service of further Lists of Documents) in relation to discovery categories
(including that referred to in paragraph 1 of this Notice of Motion) every two
months from the filing of initial Lists of Documents;</i><br><br><i>(2A)	In the
alternative to (1), that the Defendants give discovery of the documents
described in Schedule B to this Notice of Motion
by the dates referred to in the
directions made by the court on 27 August
1999.&#8221;</i><br><br>2   	Schedule A to the amended notice of
motion is in the form annexed to this
judgment.<br><br>3   	Schedule B to the notice of motion is in
the form annexed to this judgment.<br><br>4   	The present
discovery regime requires continuing discovery on a three monthly basis.  This
is satisfactory and practicable.<br><br>5   	To my mind there is
no substance in the application seeking order (2) in the notice of motion and so
much of the application
is dismissed.  <br><br>6   	To my mind
there is no substance in so much of the application as seeks an order that the
defendants give discovery of the documents
referred to in paragraph 4.1.4 of
either schedule to the motion being effectively a mode of interrogation and to
that extent the
notice of motion is dismissed.  Applications to administer
interrogatories cannot be achieved by this indirect
route.<br><br>7   	The essential contest for determination is as
to the matters dealt with in paragraphs (1) and (2A) of the amended notice of
motion.<br><br>8   	Part 23 Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules
provides inter alia as follows:<br><br><i>&#8220;(1)	The Court may, on the
application of a party or of its own motion, order that any party (party B) give
discovery to any
other party (party A) or parties (each of which is included in
the expression &#8216;party A&#8217;) of:</i><br><br><i>(a)    documents within
a class or classes specified in the order;</i><br><br><i>(b)    one or more
samples (selected in such manner as the Court may specify) of documents within
such a class.</i><br><br><i>(2)	A class of documents shall not be specified in
more general terms than the Court considers to be justified in the
circumstances.</i><br><br><i>(3)	Subject to subrule (2), a class of documents
may be specified:</i><br><br><i>(a)	by relevance to one or more facts in
issue;</i><br><br><i>(b)	by description of the nature of the documents and the
period within which they were brought into existence;</i><br><br><i>(c)  in such
other manner as the Court considers appropriate in the
circumstances.&#8221;</i><br><br>9   	Part 23 Rule 1 in giving
relevant definitions provides, inter alia, as follows:<br><br><i>&#8220;A
document or matter is taken to be relevant to a fact in issue if it could, or
contains material which could, rationally affect
the assessment of the
probability of the existence of that fact (otherwise than by relating solely to
the credibility of a witness),
regardless of whether the document or matter
would be admissible in evidence.&#8221;</i><br><br>10   	The
proceedings are presently fixed for hearing to commence in May 2000 following an
extended interlocutory application heard
between 26 July 1999 and 5 August 1999
and the subject of a reserved judgment handed down on 19 August 1999.  For
present purposes
the reserved interlocutory judgment serves to sketch out the
principal issues pleaded although bearing in mind the focus of the subject
application it will be necessary to refer again to the
pleadings.<br><br>11   	During argument on the notice of motion
the plaintiffs&#8217; counsel, Mr Dicker, took the court closely to a number of
relevant
paragraphs in the Third Further Amended Statement of Claim.  That
statement of claim presently runs for 73 pages and it is clearly
inappropriate
to repeat it in any detail.<br><br>12   	I accept as correct Mr
Dicker&#8217;s submission that, although dealing particularly with the relevant
provisions of the Federal
Court Rules, the following passage is apt to describe
the position as it obtains in relation to proceedings in the Supreme Court.

That is to say:<br><br><i>&#8220;A document relates to a matter in question
between the parties if it is reasonable to suppose that the document contains
information
which may - not which must - either directly or indirectly enable
the party requiring [the production of the document] either to
advance his own
case or to damage the case of his adversary.&#8221;  -
</i><br><br><i>Commonwealth v Northern Land Council</i> (1991) 103 ALR 267 at
290, per Black CJ, Gummow  and French JJ.<br><br>Part 23 Rules 3(b) and (c) of
the Supreme Court rules of course permit the Court, depending upon the
circumstances, to require discovery
by reference to a wider field of reference. 
The primary approach must, however, be to ascertain the matters in issue.  The
exercise
of the Court&#8217;s discretion to be exercised under the rules
involves a balancing of the respective interests of the parties having
regard to
the issues examined in context.<br><br>13   	Both parties took
the court to the well known passage from the judgment of Menzies J in <i>Mulley
v Manifold</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20103%20CLR%20341" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 103 CLR 341</a> at 345:<br><br><i>&#8220;I now turn to the
pleadings to determine what are the matters at issue between the parties,
because discovery is a procedure
directed towards obtaining a proper examination
and determination of these issues - not towards assisting a party upon a fishing
expedition.  Only a document which relates in some way to a matter in issue is
discoverable ... &#8220;</i><br><br>14   	Mr Insall of counsel
who appeared for the defendants on the initial hearing of the then notice of
motion in form as filed on
28 September 1999, submitted that the appropriate
exercise in which the court is engaged on the hearing of the motion is to
identify
a category of document in no more general terms than is appropriate but
which category must relate to an issue disclosed or thrown
up by the pleadings. 
Mr Insall&#8217;s submission was that &#8220;there is no issue on the present
pleadings which requires the
discovery by the Bank generally of documents
relating to E-commerce&#8221; - transcript 32.<br><br>15   	What
then are the issues raised by the pleadings sought to be relied upon by the
plaintiff and said within the above principles
to throw up a requirement for
discovery by the defendants of the documents sought to be discovered as set out
in paragraphs (1) or
alternative (2A) of the further amended notice of
motion?<br><br>16   	The plaintiffs assert, and I accept, that
the AUSMAQ Service in the sense of ascertaining precisely what that service
comprises
and what has been at material times its precise functionality, is at
the centre of the pleaded issues.  There are of course a number
of other
important issues.  The plaintiffs intend to assert that the AUSMAQ Service is an
E-commerce service.  The plaintiff&#8217;s
submission is that the subject
documents sought to be included in the defendants&#8217; discovery are relevant
to the following issues:<br><br>(a)	The identity of the AUSMAQ
Service;<br><br>(b)	The issue of functionality, namely whether the subject bank
services referred to in the pleadings and summarised in the interlocutory
judgment are services with &#8216;equivalent or similar functionality&#8217; to
the AUSMAQ Service;  [see the definition of AUSMAQ
Service referred to in
paragraph 3 of the Interlocutory Judgment]<br><br>(c)	Damages - the
plaintiffs&#8217; claim including loss of opportunity damages should the AUSMAQ
Service be held to be a version
of
E-commerce<i>.</i><br><br>17   	The plaintiffs submit that if one
of the bank documents now sought to be made the subject of the further order for
discovery
recognises that E-commerce is a crucial service in the modern banking
environment, then the plaintiffs are entitled to rely upon
such document in
support of the plaintiffs&#8217; case that the AUSMAQ Service ought to have
been, but was not, promoted, developed
and exploited pursuant to the
bank&#8217;s alleged contractual obligations to so promote, develop and exploit
that service.  [See
paragraph 18.1 of the Third Further Amended Statement of
Claim for the allegation as to the implied term].  On the plaintiffs&#8217;
submissions these are all matters which go to quantum of the plaintiffs&#8217;
claims to damages.<br><br>18   	The plaintiffs seek discovery of
these documents in an attempt to prove as part of their case that the prospects
of success
in the marketing and exploitation of the AUSMAQ system were clearly
perceived to be such by the bank as to warrant it entering into
the various
agreements with the plaintiffs;  that the defendants and in particular the Bank
in fact recognised and recognises that
E-commerce banking was and is likely to
be the major direction of future banking or to provide a substantial base for
the revenue
of banks including the National Australia Bank and as I have
indicated, for the purpose of proving that material in the possession
of the
defendants relating to E-commerce which it is submitted includes the AUSMAQ
system, will be shown to be relevant to the perceived
value and importance of
the AUSMAQ system as part of E-commerce to the Bank.  The submission is that
such documents may be admissible
as admissions of the Bank relating to the
importance of E-commerce and hence the AUSMAQ system.  The submission is that
such documents
will also be relevant to the question of loss of a chance.  The
submission is that if the Bank itself formed the view that E-commerce
and the
AUSMAQ system were important, then the court is able to logically draw an
inference both from that fact and from the Bank&#8217;s
position as the main, or
one of the main financial institutions in Australia, that other financial
institutions including leading
international financial institutions would
similarly have regarded and presently regard the AUSMAQ System as a valuable,
attractive
and a worthwhile system to be party to or worthy of consideration in
respect of purchase or otherwise use.  <br><br>19   	The
plaintiff&#8217;s submission is further that matters relating to E-commerce and
the defendants&#8217; comments and perceptions
in relation to E-commerce are
clearly relevant to issues of breach including motive and damages and by
potentially revealing admissions
in documents.<br><br>20   	The
defendants, on the other hand, contend that the plaintiffs have not in their
Third Further Amended Statement of Claim pleaded
any cause of action in relation
to &#8220;E-commerce&#8221; and that there are no issues thrown up by the
present pleadings which
require the bank to discover generally documents
relating to E-commerce.<br><br>21   	The defendants submit that
there is no <u>necessary</u> nexus between E-commerce and the AUSMAQ system. 
The defendants seek to summarise the plaintiffs&#8217; argument as a four stage
argument as follows:<br><i>&#8216;(1)	That the AUSMAQ system is an E-commerce
system;</i><br><br><i>(2)	That the prospects of success of the AUSMAQ System led
the first defendant to enter into various agreements with the
plaintiffs;</i><br><br><i>(3)	That E-commerce banking is likely to be the major
direction of future banking;</i><br><br><i>(4)	That documents on the perceived
value and importance of the AUSMAQ system as part of E-commerce to the Bank are
highly relevant
and may be admissible as admissions of the Bank relating to the
importance of E-commerce and hence the AUSMAQ
System.&#8217;</i><br><br>22   	Mr Sackar QC, who appeared for
the defendants on 25 October, submitted as follows:<br><br>(i)	To make the
proceedings intelligible one has to look at the [AUSMAQ] Service and how it was
defined and how it was understood
by the parties to be read.<br><br>(ii)	That
the Service might be a species of E-commerce could not of itself make
discoverable the kind of documents which are described
so generally in Schedule
B.<br><br>(iii)	What is not pleaded is that every E-commerce initiative taken
after the date of the Consultancy Agreement is and should be regarded
as an
AUSMAQ service for the purposes of the payment of moneys pursuant to that
Agreement.  In short, the plaintiffs have not pleaded
that Mr Maconachie or any
company associated with him was the sole inspiration, or in terms of causation,
the only relevant inspiration,
for E-commerce initiatives or innovations within
the Bank.<br><br>23   	On the defendants&#8217; written
submissions of 8 June 1999 furnished well in advance of the date which was
finally fixed for
the hearing of motion, the following criticisms of each of
these stages in the plaintiffs&#8217; suggested argument were put.<br><br>As to
stage 1 - the submission was that this matter had not been pleaded and was that
the plaintiffs had not as at 8 June led any
evidence on the motion to support
the allegation.<br><br>As to stage 2 - the submission was that the plaintiffs
had as at 8 June led no evidence on the motion to support the
allegation.<br><br>As to stage 3 - the submission was that this allegation had
not been pleaded by the plaintiffs, clearly related to issues outside
the
proceedings and was not supported by any evidence.<br><br>As to stage 4 - the
submission was that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the nexus between
the AUSMAQ System and E-commerce
and that there is no necessary nexus between
E-commerce and the AUSMAQ System.<br><br>24   	The plaintiffs in
submission took the court particularly to so much of the Third Further Amended
Statement of Claim as included:<br><br>(a)	Paragraph 8.3  The particulars of
which are in the following terms:<br><br><i>&#8220;The AUSMAQ IP included
confidential information, trade secrets and know-how, copyright in computer
software programmes, trade
marks, copyright and other licences and licensing
rights comprised or used in the AUSMAQ service or in the development or
commercialisation
of the AUSMAQ service and the AUSMAQ
IP.&#8221;</i><br><br>(b)	So much of paragraph 10.1 as includes the last four
lines of particular (a) referring inter alia to the &#8216;NAB Group E-commerce
Council&#8217;.<br><br>(c)	The paragraphs dealing with the Consulting
Agreement.<br><br>(d)	Paragraphs 15.3 and 15.4 <br><br>(e)	The paragraphs
dealing with the implied terms in the Consulting Agreement<br><br>(f)	The
paragraphs dealing with the alleged fiduciary relationship of NMG and NAB to
JMG.<br><br>(g)	Paragraph 29.<br><br>(h)	The allegation in paragraph 30 that the
Gateway Service is and will be a service within the definition of the AUSMAQ
Service (as
defined in the Consulting Agreement) being a service with equivalent
or similar functionality to that described in subparagraphs
30.1 -
30.3.<br><br>(i)	The paragraphs which plead allegations in the same terms in
relation to the other relevant Bank services.<br><br>(j)	Paragraph 49A and in
particular particulars 1 to 4 to that paragraph describing Independence One,
inter alia as follows:<br><br><i>&#8220;. . . an integrated financial services
platform offering international business people unmatched customer value through
access
to financial services at any place and time through the convenience and
tools of the internet, personal digital assistance and modern
communications
devices &#8216;and&#8217; as designed to deliver its functionality through the
integration of the internet and existing
communication devices [and which would]
represent a significant advance in the ability of the NAB Group to respond to
the competitive
threat posed by the on-line financial
services.&#8221;</i><br><br>(k)	Paragraphs 49B.1 .2 and .3 describing inter alia
the Independence One Service.<br><br>(l)	Paragraph 49H and in particular the
particulars in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 on pages 37 and 38 of the amended statement
of claim.
 Here again descriptions of Project Maple Leaf/Operation First Choice
are set out.  Particular I commences:<br><br><i>&#8220;Project Maple
Leaf/Operation First Choice is a project to create a fundamental shift in the
NAB&#8217;s operating model, from
a traditional branch based regional retail
bank to the paradigm of a highly customer focussed <u>information driven</u>
globally integrated financial services operation [and then continues with the
reference to the use of technology including the convenience
and tools of the
internet, personal digital assistants and modern communications
devices].&#8221;</i>	<br>[emphasis added]<br><br>Particular (3) of paragraph 49H
refers to &#8220;E-commerce generally&#8221; in the following
terms:<br><br><i>&#8220;The Direct Bank Service involves an integrated financial
services platform offering customer value to customers generally through
access
to financial services at any place and time through the convenience and tools of
the internet, personal digital assistants
and modern communications devices, and
E-commerce generally.&#8221;</i><br><br>Reference is also made to E-commerce in
particular (5) to paragraph 59H.<br><br>(m)	Paragraph 55.1(c) and (d) and 56.1
(c) and (d).<br><br>(n)	Paragraph 55.6 (c) and
(d).<br><br>25   	To my mind the absence of an express pleading
to the effect that the AUSMAQ System is an E-commerce system is far from fatal
to the plaintiffs&#8217; present application for the extended discovery.  The
primary question is and remains whether the subject
discovery seeks production
of documents relevant to facts in issue.<br><br>26   	To my mind,
the plaintiffs&#8217; submissions outlined in paragraphs 16, 17, 18 and 19 are
of substance.  I am satisfied from
the argument and the pleadings that the
documents sought &#8216;could or contain material which could, rationally affect
the assessment
of the probability of facts [in issue]&#8217;.  It is reasonable
to suppose that documents relating to E-commerce sought to be the
subject of the
more extended discovery, contain information which may, not which must, either
directly or indirectly enable the plaintiffs
to advance their cases or to damage
the case of the defendants.  It is reasonable to suppose that the documents
sought relate to
the substance of the dispute thrown up by material allegations
pleaded.<br><br>27   	I do not accept the submission that the
plaintiffs are shown to be attempting to here embark on a fishing expedition.  A
clear
attempt has been made in paragraph 4.1.3 of Schedule B to the further
amended motion to limit the meaning of high level documents
to documents
prepared for the purposes of proposal, summary, submissions or report to the
identified categories of persons.  I accept
that this represents an attempt to
cut down dramatically the width of the wording which appeared in Schedule A
being the only schedule
to the motion in its form as originally
filed.<br><br>28   	The question requires to be approached using
common sense, applying a sense of perspective and by finding a workable and
practicable
solution.<br><br>29   	Plainly enough the defendants
are obliged to discover documents only if it is reasonable to suppose that the
documents contain
information which may, not which must, either directly or
indirectly enable the plaintiffs to advance their own case or to damage
the
defendants&#8217; case.  Only high level documents going to the
defendants&#8217; strategic examination of the importance of
E-commerce to the
defendants and to the defendants&#8217; strategic plans which could or may, on
an expansive approach to the definition
of &#8216;AUSMAQ Service&#8217; and to
the words &#8216;service with the equivalent or similar functionality&#8217; [to
the AUSMAQ
Service] advance the plaintiffs&#8217; case or damage the
defendants&#8217; case, require to be discovered.<br><br>30   	I
do not see it as appropriate to have a definition of &#8216;E-commerce&#8217; in
the order for discovery.  That the term may
be capable of referring to any
electronic means of providing transactional and financial banking services or
indeed of conducting
commerce is not to the point.  What is to the point is that
the proceedings throw up for determination, assertions by the plaintiffs
and a
denial by the defendants:<br><br>(a)	As to the ambit of the subject definition
of &#8216;equivalent or similar functionality&#8217; [to the AUSMAQ
Service];<br><br>(b)	As to whether the defendants, and in particular the Bank,
has developed services falling within that definition;</p>
<p>(c)	As to the recognition by the defendants and in particular by the Bank of
the significance of E-commerce banking generally in terms
of the direction of
future banking.<br><br>31   	I do not regard the presently agreed
categories of documents [see in particular paragraphs B.C.1, E.1 and E.3 on
pages 78, 81
and 82 of Exhibit A2] as sufficient to satisfy the
plaintiffs&#8217; entitlement.<br><br>32   	A careful examination
of those closely defined categories reveals that they do not cover the expanded
description of documents
now pursued.<br><br>33   	Category B.C.1
treats with documents relating to the functionality of &#8216;the NAB
Services&#8217; or to the functionality
of the AUSMAQ Service,
including:<br><br>-	the functional specifications of the NAB Services and the
AUSMAQ Service;<br><br>-	any comparison of the functionality of the NAB Services
and the AUSMAQ Service;<br><br>-	documents recording, referring to or relating
to the benefits and advantages including future benefits and advantages of
acquiring
the AUSMAQ Service and the AUSMAQ IP
rights.<br><br>34   	Category E.1 is squarely aimed at documents
recording, referring to or relating to the AUSMAQ or EUROMAQ Services on the
three
defined parameters (see sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c).<br><br>35   	Category E3 is again squarely aimed at
documents recording, referring to or relating to :<br>-	analyses and evaluations
of benefits and the like of the AUSMAQ or EUROMAQ Services;<br><br>-	proposals,
offers and the like by persons interested in purchasing the AUSMAQ or EUROMAQ
Services, and internal considerations by
corporate defendants of such proposals
and offers;<br><br>-	profits (potential, possible or future) or applications of
the four NAB Services;<br><br>-	analyses or evaluations or consideration why the
defendants should or should not make the AUSMAQ Service or the EUROMAQ Service
available to any person, whether in Australia or
overseas.<br><br>36   	As Rolfe JA said, albeit in a slightly
different context:<br><br><i>&#8216;In determining the question of relevance the
Court must bear in mind that the parties are entitled to build up an evidentiary
mosaic.  Generally that cannot be done in complicated commercial litigation by
the tender of one piece of evidence or the assertion
that only limited material
is relevant to the issues involved.   . . . the Court should not be astute to
find irrelevance at an early
stage of the proceedings . .
.</i><br><br>[<i>Lakatoi Universal Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Walker &amp; Ors,</i>
Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 31 July 1998 at
18]<br><br>37   	I am further satisfied that the proposed
expanded discovery categories are such as are &#8216;reasonably likely to add,
in the
end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case&#8217;. 
[Cf, (again dealing in a slightly different field of discourse,)
the judgment of
Waddell J in <i>Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LMC Industries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20921" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR
921</a> at 297, seeking to summarize views expressed by Moffitt P in <i>National
Employers Mutual General Association Ltd v Waind and Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 372</a>
at 383, 384].  I particularly have in mind the wording extracted in paragraph
23(l) of the Judgment which makes it clear that the
plaintiffs seek to make a
case to the effect that the defendants are seeking to fundamentally shift the
Bank&#8217;s operating model
from a traditional branch based regional retail
bank to &#8216;the paradigm of a highly customer focussed information driven
globally
integrated financial services operation [using technology including the
internet, personal digital assistants and modern communication
devices . . . and
E-commerce generally].  These are broad concepts indeed and involve, as the case
sought to be made, an examination
of an alleged radical move from one type of
operation to another.<br><br>38   	To my mind there is however
substance in Mr Insall&#8217;s submission that it may be oppressive to include
the words &#8216;for
the purposes of proposal, summary, submission or report in
the definition of &#8216;high level documents&#8217;.  Those words require
a
degree of interrogation of those who prepared the documents which may be
oppressive in terms of what may be reasonably required
by the
plaintiffs.<br><br>39   	In the course of the argument which took
place on 25 October 1999, the defendants by leave read an affidavit of Mr
Gregory D.
J. Richards made on 22 October 1999 which provides details of the
individual defendants, of the boards of directors of the corporate
defendants
and of the persons, committees and sub-committees reporting to individual
defendants or to the boards of the corporate
defendants.  The affidavit descends
into considerable detail in terms of the documents believed to have been
generated in connection
with NAB board meetings, NMG and AUSMAQ board meetings
and meetings of the board of directors of National Australia Financial
Management
Limited.  In like fashion the affidavit descends to considerable
detail in relation to the reporting by individuals and entities
within the
defendants over particular periods of time.  The affidavit also provides
evidence that there is no one part of the National
Australia Bank that deals
exclusively with E-commerce issues and that a substantial volume of
documentation has been sent to the
Board of the Bank or persons supporting the
Board of the Bank on the subject of E-commerce for the provision of financial
services.
 The affidavit deals with the volume of documents said to be relevant
to the subject &#8216;E-commerce for the provision of financial
services&#8217;.
Mr Richards deposes that he is of the opinion, on the basis of his instructions,
that:<br><br><i>&#183;	</i>There is no one source within the Bank from which
documents falling within the terms of paragraphs 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of Schedule B
to
the motion would originate.<br><br><i>&#183;	</i>There is no one place within
the Bank where copies of such documents would be filed.<br><br><i>&#183;	</i>It
would take a very substantial amount of time to carry out the enquiries
necessary to identify such documents.<br><br>40   	Mr Richards
also deposes that it is impossible at this stage to estimate the work required
to be performed to provide discovery
in the terms required by paragraphs 4.1.1
and 4.1.2 of Schedule B.  He deposes that further substantial enquiries would
need to be
made in this regard.  He deposes that it would be necessary to
interview not less than 50 persons.  He estimates on current information
that it
would take a number of months to complete this aspect of the
discovery.<br><br>41   	During argument, I indicated to Mr Sackar
that it would be of assistance for the Court to be given some indication by the
defendants
as to the time presently believed to be necessary if the categories
of extended discovery were to be ordered.  On taking instructions,
Mr Sackar,
whilst making plain that it was not possible to be at all precise about the
matter, referred to the possibility for example
that the time required would be
four months before the documents could be identified.  He pointed out, of
course, that this may be
an underestimate or an
overestimate.<br><br>42   	There is then, so Mr Sackar put, a
question as to whether the hearing dates now in place could be retained if, for
example,
after four months, the documents were able to be produced to the
plaintiffs, and if the plaintiffs then required to digest the content
of the
documents so as for example to include that material in their opening
address.<br><br>43   	Outside this question of the difficulties
of fixing an exact timetable if the categories of extended discovery are to be
ordered,
Mr Sackar on instructions approached the matter on what he put was a
&#8216;fall back&#8217; position.  This included the tender
of a confidential
document which became Exhibit &#8216;250.1&#8217; and was the subject of a
confidentiality order.  That exhibit
is but one of the documents which are in
fact presently in train to be discovered under the present discovery regime.  It
is inappropriate
to open up that confidentiality by now referring to particular
sections of the subject exhibit.  The broad proposition which Mr Sackar
advanced, was that this document was an example of documents which would
presently be produced under the existing discovery regime
by the defendants.  Mr
Sackar&#8217;s proposition was that what the plaintiffs were seeking are
documents which refer to or comment
upon or consider the importance of
E-commerce and/or the benefit of E-commerce to one or more of the defendants in
relation to the
provision of financial services.  It was then submitted that, as
I understood the submission, documents already in train to be discovered
under
the existing discovery regime, would identify the importance and benefit of
electronic commerce to the Bank.<br><br>44   	I am not persuaded
that Exhibit 250.1 or documents similar to this exhibit presently to be
discovered removes the burden of
the plaintiffs&#8217; claim to the expanded
categories of discovery.<br><br>45   	On the question of the
suggested oppression in terms of the expanded categories of discovery, it is
necessary only to refer
back to the interlocutory judgment which identifies the
issues and the significance to both parties of those issues.  Discovery being
one of the interlocutory procedures will no doubt be included in the ambit of
costs orders at the end of the proceedings.  I do not
accept the
defendants&#8217; submission that the plaintiffs are not entitled on their case
as pleaded to discovery in terms of the
extended categories of
documents.<br><br>46   	To my mind, the appropriate way forward
is to distinguish between discovery in terms of the categories referred to in
sub-paragraphs
(a) and (b) of Schedule B to the amended motion.  Those documents
will be the subject of an order for production in four months,
namely by the end
of February 2000.  On the other hand, the documents the subject of
sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of the definition
of &#8216;high level
documents&#8217; in Schedule B of the amended motion will be discoverable by the
end of March 2000, giving the
defendants five months within which to produce
those documents.  Additionally, the proceedings will be listed for directions in
relation
to these categories of discovery on the first day of the new term in
early February 2000, prior to which date the defendants are
to file and serve an
affidavit, identifying precisely what steps have by then been taken to satisfy
the extended discovery categories
order.  That form of affidavit should assist
the Court in being able to further tailor appropriate ancillary directions if
necessary.<br><br>47   	In my view, the plaintiffs are entitled
to the following order:<br><br>Order that the defendants give discovery of the
following documents by the following dates:<br><br>(1)	High level documents
created in the period from 6 November 1996 internally with any one or more of
the defendants referring to
or commenting upon or considering the importance to
any one or more of the defendants of E-commerce for the provision of financial
services.<br><br>(2)	High level documents created in the period from 7 November
1996 recording, referring to or relating to analyses or evaluations
or
consideration of the benefit to any one or more of the defendants of E-commerce
for the provision of financial services.</p>
<p>(3)	In paragraphs 1 and 2 of this order &#8216;high level documents&#8217;
means:<br><br>All documents which were sent to:<br><br>(a)	Any one or more of
the individual defendants;  and/or<br><br>(b)	The board of directors of one of
more of the corporate defendants;  and/or</p>
<p>(c)	Any person or committee or subcommittee reporting to any of the
individual defendants or the boards of any one of the corporate
defendants,
and/or<br><br>(d)	Any one or more persons in the Group Leadership Team (as
described on page 13 of the National Australia Bank Limited 1998 Annual
Report
[being exhibit A1 as marked on the interlocutory discovery application heard on
28 September 1999].<br><br>(4)	Discovery of documents sent to the persons and
entities referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 is to take
place
by 29 February 2000.<br><br>(5)	Discovery of documents sent to the persons
and entities referred to in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of paragraph 3 is to take
place
by 31 March 2000.<br><br>(6)	The proceedings are stood over for further
directions on the first day of term next year, prior to which date the
defendants&#8217;
solicitors are to file and serve an affidavit dealing with the
defendants&#8217; progress in complying with these directions.  The
affidavit is
to detail the precise steps taken in endeavouring to comply with these
directions.<br><br><b>Rulings as to Evidence</b><br><br>48   	On
the hearing of the motion, the plaintiffs sought to read a number of sections of
Mr Maconochie&#8217;s third, fourth and
fifth statements.  The sections are
identified on pages 14 to 16 of the transcript.  The Court&#8217;s ruling on
admissibility of
those paragraphs was reserved to be handed down as part of the
Judgment.<br><br>49   	Also on the hearing of the motion, the
plaintiffs sought to tender a number of National Bank documents which were
marked for
identification &#8216;A3&#8217;.  Again the ruling in relation to
that tender was reserved to be handed down as part of the
Judgment.<br><br>50   	In <i>Mulley v Manifold</i>, Menzies J
pointed out that there are circumstances in which insufficiency in discovery may
appear from any source which constitutes
an admission of the existence of a
discoverable document.  Hence, if a party can show from the record or from an
admission that incomplete
discovery has been given, the Court may order a
further and better affidavit of discovery to be
filed.<br><br>51   	As I understood the way in which both parties
approached the motion here, the question was put as one of principle, namely as
put by Menzies J in <i>Mulley v Manifold</i> at 344:<br><br><i>&#8216;. . . the
only important question ie. . . whether certain documents, of which some do
exist, and some may or may not exist,
do, or if they were to exist, would,
relate to any matter in question in the actions.  This is clearly something that
must be determined
from the pleadings, not from an argumentative
affidavit.&#8217;</i><br><br>52   	To my mind, in the way in
which the motion before the Court was argued, the plaintiffs are not entitled to
read those sections
of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s statements already referred to or
to tender the documents in the material marked for identification
&#8216;A3&#8217;.
 Those affidavits and the materials marked for identification
&#8216;A3&#8217;, are therefore not admitted into evidence or taken
into account
on the hearing of the motion.<br><br><i>*****</i><br><br><br>LAST UPDATED:
