<P>

                   <b>JAMES BURDEN</b> 
<P>

<b><u>20480/94 - ROBERT CLARK -v- LEONARD AINSWORTH</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  These are applications on behalf of Leonard Hastings Ainsworth,
that he be granted leave to be relieved from implied
undertakings as to
confidentiality in relation to pleadings in each of the actions, that is, the
one brought by Robert Clark against
Leonard Hastings Ainsworth and that brought
by Mr Ainsworth against Leslie James Burden. It is convenient to deal with the
application
in relation to Mr Clark first.
<P>

2	The material before me indicates that the proceedings in the Licensing Court
in which Mr Ainsworth is intimately involved have
been adjourned so that the
pleadings in the proceedings in Mr Clark's defamation action may be tendered
before the Licensing Court.
Reference is made in the particulars of the
applicant's objection to that action. There is some doubt as to the extent to
which,
if at all, confidentiality attaches to the pleadings, particularly to
those of Mr Ainsworth.
<P>

3	What seems to be the position now is that there is an amended statement of
claim, with annexures, a further amended statement
of claim with annexures of
11 August 1994, a further amended statement of claim of 9 October 1998 a
defence and cross-claim filed
on 25 September 1994, and a defence to
cross-claim of 30 November 1994. These dates refer to the dates on which the
documents were
filed in the court registry.
<P>

4	I see no difficulty in permitting those documents to be tendered to the
Licensing Court, provided that no other use is made of
them and in due course I
will make an order to that effect.
<P>

5	The question of costs then arises.  Mr Ainsworth has sought an indulgence,
the reason being that he wishes to be able to use the
documents in the
Licensing Court proceedings. When the matter came before this Court, the
attitude of Mr Clark's counsel was that
he neither consented nor opposed the
order and said it was a matter for the Court.
<P>

6	The motion as framed did not limit the release to tendering the document in
the Licensing Court. It is my view that in the circumstances
the costs of Mr
Ainsworth's application to this Court today ought to be Mr Clark's costs in the
cause.
<P>

7	In relation to Mr Ainsworth's claim against Mr Burden, there is no difficulty
in permitting the statement of claim and the statement
of defence to be
tendered in the Licensing  Court and I will make an order to that effect a
little later. The matter for contention
is whether the reply should also be the
subject of an order. The reply first of all joins issue with the defendant on
his defence,
save and except as far as it contains admissions.
<P>

8	Next it asserts in answer to Para 4 of the defence that the defendant was
motivated by express malice in the publication of the
matter complained of in
this court.  That is important in relation to the privilege defences.
<P>

9	I would have no difficulty in permitting Paras 1 and 2 of the to be tendered
before the Licensing Court.
<P>

10	The particulars contain a variety of assertions  as to the conduct of the
defendant which in combination are said to amount to
malice. It would be
inappropriate for the Licensing Court not to have all the pleadings which
define the issues.  It probably needs
to have the particulars of malice so that
it can see what lies behind the allegation in Para 2 of the reply.  I do not
see that the
disclosure of these matters would lead to further disclosures.
<P>

11	As to costs, I will again order the costs of this application be Mr Burden's
costs in the cause, for the reasons I have earlier
given in relation to Mr
Clark.
<P>

12	The orders which I have made are to facilitate the conduct of the
proceedings in the Licensing Court.  That court will take care
of the use which
is made of the documents and will appreciate that at this stage assertions of
fact have been made and, except where
there are admissions, have yet to be
proved.
<P>

13	The orders I will make are as follows:
<P>

That Leonard Hastings Ainsworth be granted leave to tender a copy of the
amended further statement of claim  of 11 August 1994,
the further amended
statement of claim of 9 October 1998, the defence and cross-claim, filed 25
September, 1994 and the defence to
cross-claim, filed 30 November 1994 in
proceedings 20480/94, in the Licensing Court, in the proceedings between
Ainsworth Technology
Pty Ltd and Owen John Anderson on behalf of the New South
Wales Police Service, and presently adjourned to 11 May, 1999. This is
in the
matter of Clark against Ainsworth.  I order that the costs of this application
be Mr Clark's costs in the cause.
<P>

14	I will add one sentence to the reasons for judgment.  The Licensing Court
should note that the defamation action between Clark
and Ainsworth is due to be
heard on 11 November 1999 and care should be taken to ensure that nothing
happens to cause that trial
to be aborted.
<P>

15	In Ainsworth against Burden, I order that Leonard Hastings Ainsworth be
granted leave to tender a copy of the statement of claim,
defence and reply, in
proceedings numbered 21216/96 in this Court between Mr Ainsworth and Leslie
James Burden, to the Licensing
Court, in the proceedings between Ainsworth
Technology Pty Ltd and Owen John Anderson on behalf of the NSW Police Service,
presently
adjourned to 11 May 1999.  In each case liberty to apply on 3 hours
notice.
<P>

16	I order that the costs of this application be Mr Burden's costs in the
cause.
