Tuesday 15 June 1999

<b><u>11703/97  -  NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD v JOSEPH HAYEK</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  These are what might be described as
relatively conventional proceedings brought by a mortgagee bank. The mortgagor
gave a guarantee in respect of accommodation to be granted by the bank to a
company of which the defendant is said to have been a
director.  The defendant
has appeared for himself today.  There are solicitors on the record but it
seems that he is no longer in
contact with them.
<P>

2   	Directions were given some considerable time ago concerning
the filing of affidavits on the part of the defendant but no affidavits
have
been filed.
<P>

3   	At this stage of the delivery of the judgment, Mr Hayek has
raised his hand and I will pause in order to hear what he has to
say.
<P>

4   	When I paused in giving these reasons, Mr Hayek asserted
that he had exchanged contracts with a purchaser in respect of the
property.
<P>

5   	In response to my enquiry, Mr Williams of counsel
indicated, as had been agreed earlier in the proceedings, there had been
without prejudice negotiations, apparently through a Mr Freeman, and the bank
was aware that there had been attempts to find a purchaser
for the property by
the defendant but neither Mr Williams nor those present in court instructing
him has any knowledge of any exchange
of contracts.
<P>

6   	I am conscious that if such an exchange has taken place
there may be complications, not in the least in the form of protest
by the
purchaser, but it does not seem to me that the assertion by the defendant in
the circumstances I have mentioned should lead
to the hearing today being
rendered abortive.
<P>

7   	I was proceeding to indicate that the defence pleaded
raised an issue concerning the alleged absence of consideration for the
guarantee.  There is express consideration in the request of the defendant in
paragraph 1 of Part A of the exhibited copy of the
written agreement for
guarantee and indemnity.  Relief under the Contracts Review Act was sought but
no evidence or argument in support
of it was forthcoming.  The requisites of
proof of the plaintiff's claim are amply demonstrated in the two affidavits of
Peter John
Crane sworn respectively 31 July 1998 and 15 June 1999.  The latter
manifested that the current amount due is $465,919.93.
<P>

8   	In my view there is no reason why the order sought by the
plaintiff should not be made.  In response to my enquiry the defendant
frankly
told me that he is not occupying the subject premises as his home.
<P>

9   	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.  I direct entry of judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the property
Certificate of Title Folio Identifier 2/259764 and
known as 31 Wilbung Road,
Illawong.
<P>

     	2.  I grant leave to the plaintiff to issue a writ of  possession for
that property.
<P>

     	3.  I direct entry of judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of
$465,919.93.
<P>

     	4.  I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the action.
<P>
