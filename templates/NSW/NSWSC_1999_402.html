Act, 1995</a> (NSW)</i>)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Marked for identification 1 is a blank form of a document
entitled "<i>Request for Inspection of Documents Produced Under Subpoena and
Undertaking"</i>.  It is a document which, when completed by the party seeking
access to documents produced to the court on subpoena, contains an
undertaking
in the following terms:  "<i>Except with leave of the Court, I will not,
otherwise than for the purpose of these proceedings, divulge, communicate or
refer to
any person any information obtained in inspection of any document or
thing produced by the Court to me or a copy of any document
produced and
inspected by me unless it is admitted into evidence in the proceedings</i>."
It is not necessary for me to dilate upon the curious wording of that
undertaking.  What is sought to be tendered is a completed
undertaking, (at the
delivery of this ruling the documents (the Undertakings) have not been
collated), executed by or on behalf of
the solicitors for the plaintiff in the
defamation proceedings.
<P>

2	In relation to documents produced on subpoena by the Police and the
Department of Community Services, the tender is said to be
relevant to a
proposition that the plaintiff's legal privilege in the documents is amenable
to be found to have been lost by means
of the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>. The tender of the document, it is said, is probative of
the issue of whether or not there was a communication of the content of
the
documents by the plaintiff in respect of which communication there ought
reasonably to have been known that the making of that
communication was in
furtherance of a deliberate abuse of power.
<P>

3	Both for the plaintiff in the defamation action and for Messrs Corrs Chambers
Westgarth (the party under subpoena), submissions
are made that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> would preclude a finding that the tender of this
undertaking could affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the
probability
of the existence of a fact in issue, namely, what I will, in short
form, call the asserted deliberate abuse of power for the purposes
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125.</a>  I
am not persuaded by that argument against its admissibility in terms of
relevance. I am persuaded, however, that its probative
value in relation to the
issue of deliberate abuse of power by the plaintiff, or if there remains any
question about Mr Potter or
Mr Lee, is virtually zero.
<P>

4	The evidence from Mr Lee of the circumstances of having possession of
documents subpoenaed by the police in the defamation action
and any use
thereafter made by him, could not, on any rational view of the totality of his
evidence, go any where near the establishment,
on the balance of probabilities
to a very high level of satisfaction, of a deliberate abuse of power. Argument
on the tender, on
one view, has already resulted in an undue expenditure of
time; in fact the whole of the morning session of these proceedings today.
<P>

5	This is a clear case, to my mind, given the want of probative value of the
document tendered on the issue under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> that calls for the discretion under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>,</i> at least under subparagraph (c), if not the
others of that section.  The course of the evidence, particularly at T1825, in
my view,
points to, an indication that there may well have been, at that time
in the evidence, been consideration of the existence of this
basis for the
elimination of the privilege.  When the point was reached in the
cross-examination of Mr Lee that he had not even turned
his mind to the
question, there would have become exposed, in my respectful view, very, very
weak preliminary grounds for an assertion
of a deliberate abuse of power for
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125.</a>
<P>

6	The plaintiff has not given evidence on these issues. It is an interlocutory
matter in which evidence in the usual form has been
given; but even taking
those factors into account, no groundwork on any reasonable or rational basis
has been laid to pursue this
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> issue and the tender is rejected.
