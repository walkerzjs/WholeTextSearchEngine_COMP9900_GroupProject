<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	This is an appeal brought under s.107 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act
1987</a> </i>("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>")<i> </i>from a decision of the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal (`the Tribunal') delivered on 25 October 1996.  This appeal relates
solely to
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. 
<P>

2	The proceedings before the Tribunal, nos. 24034, 24035 and 23338 of 1995,
concerned a retirement village known as Rowland Village
("Rowland") at Galston
owned by the plaintiff, the Returned and Services League of Australia (New
South Wales Branch) ("the RSL").
 Rowland had been set up by the plaintiff as a
retirement style village for persons who were eligible to be members of the
RSL. 
The defendants, William Walker, John McKenzie and Alan Buxton, were three
of the original residents at Rowland. 
<P>

3	In 1993, a dispute arose between the defendants and the RSL concerning
financial arrangements in existence between the parties.
The practice at
Rowland had previously been that prospective residents of the village were
given a document headed "Finance" ("the
finance sheet") prior to each entering
into a licence agreement to secure a unit at Rowland. The finance sheet
provided that prospective
residents of Rowland were to make a formal interest
free loan to the RSL in return for the grant of a licence by the RSL to occupy
a unit at Rowland.  The loan would be subject to two categories of
non-refundable deductions.  The first was a $10,000 deduction
upon entering the
village.  This deduction was described in the finance sheet as being one "to
assist with ongoing care and village
amenities". The second was a series of 3%
deductions on the principal loan after the $10,000 had been deducted, each year
for a period
of five years.  The 5 x 3% deductions were earmarked as "a
depreciation factor", "to cover long term maintenance", the purpose being
"to
enable management charges to be kept as low as possible."  
<P>

4	A formal dispute arose when the Rowland Village Residents' Association ("the
Association") referred the issues to the Rowland
Village Disputes Committee
("the Disputes Committee") by letter dated 5 September 1994.  The Disputes
Committee was a body set up
in accordance with the Retirement Village Industry
Code of Practice Regulation 1989 (`the 1989 Code'), which was subsequently
repealed
and replaced by the Retirement Village Industry Code of Practice
Regulation 1995 (`the 1995 Code').  The Codes were created and given
effect by
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW)</i>.
<P>

5	It was claimed by the Association in its letter that, on the basis of the
finance sheet, the Rowland residents had an expectation
that the loan
deductions would be placed in dedicated accounts to "ensure their preservation
for their stated purpose".  The residents
also believed that the interest
earned on the surplus in each account would be credited to the "Village
Maintenance Revenue Account".
<P>

6	It was claimed that the RSL, in July 1992, without consulting Rowland Village
residents, removed from its finance sheet the words
relating to the purpose of
the $10,000 deductions, and then those words relating to the 3% deductions were
removed in October 1993.
 As a result of this, the residents complained that no
money had been set aside for amenities since mid 1992, no income had been
received from interest on surpluses in the dedicated accounts; that they had no
guarantee of long-term maintenance; and, the expectations
of incoming residents
in relation to amenities at Rowland was reduced, thus reducing the
attractiveness of units being sold by outgoing
residents. 
<P>

7	The final two paragraphs of the letter to the Disputes Committee provided as
follows: 
<P>

	"We requested the R.S.L. in our Rowland Village Residents Council letters
dated 3/11/93 and 5/5/94 to re-instate the original Finance
Sheet and to credit
interest on the dedicated accounts to Village maintenance revenue account. 
<P>

	We are in dispute because the R.S.L. in their letters JS:IC 3470/9 of 17/3/94
and JS/AC of 20/5/94 refused to re-issue the earlier
Finance Sheet containing
the deduction qualifications and to credit residents with any interest earned
on the two funds."
<P>

8	It was the RSL's case that the finance sheets had been given out by mistake,
by an agent who had for a brief time been involved
in marketing the units, to
residents who had bought units in the early years.  The RSL discovered the
error in 1992 and 1993 and
wished to stop the practice of handing out the
finance sheet.  
<P>

9	In October/November 1995, there being no determination by the Disputes
Committee, there were two unsuccessful attempts at mediation
at the Commercial
Disputes Resolution Centre. In November 1995, the defendants applied to the
Tribunal for the following orders under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> seeking:
<P>

	"1. An order requiring the administering authority to restore the original
(1988) wording of the "Finance" Sheet issued to potential
residents enquiring
about Village entry and costs.
<P>

	2. An order requiring the administering authority to fully account for and
protect [the respective applicant's] interests in these
funds [being the funds
which had been set up for the $10,000 deductions and the 5 x 3% deductions] in
the event of the Village being
sold to another organisation."
<P>

10	The third defendant further sought orders, as set out:
<P>

	"1. An order requiring the administering authority to carry out work or take
such other steps to make good the broken terms of
the residence contract. 
<P>

	2. A dispute committee was formed May '94. Nothing resolved to date. 
<P>

	3. Dispute is between Admin. Authority and Rowland Village Residents'
Association.
<P>

	4. Following the appeal, the Commisioner (sic.) of Consumer affairs approved a
mediation process hearing which was held Friday
3-11-95 at O.R.E.S., Sussex
Street.  Mr George Sarris, Compliance Officer, said to contact him if
necessary, ph. 377-9234. 
<P>

	5. The main subjects of dispute were not discussed because the dispute
committee had not reached its judgment. 
<P>

	6. Other relevant orders will need to be added if and when the sale of R.V.
occurs as the repayment of unspent funds to R.V.R.A.
will be a major
consideration." 
<P>

11	The Disputes Committee did not hand down its determination until 11 January
1996, notwithstanding the provision in its Charter
requiring that
determinations be made and notified in writing within 30 days of receiving an
application to have a dispute heard.
 The Disputes Committee found:
<P>

	"The RSL has the right to remove the Finance sheet and other promotional
material at its discretion at any time and therefore was
acting within its
rights when those documents were withdrawn in 1992 and 1993.  The withdrawal of
those documents, however, does
not mitigate the RSL's obligations to the
Initial Residents in respect of both long term maintenance and the provision of
the promised
amenities."
<P>

12	The Disputes Committee also made two recommendations:
<P>

	"The Committee recognises that the discussions over the past twelve months
have canvassed many issues outside the ambit of the
initial disputes.  To
assist in ameliorating the current situation, this committee recommends:
<P>

	1. That the balance of $125,000 which remains from the $10,000 amounts
contributed by the Initial Residents be made available for
the provision of
further amenities as outlined in the Initial Selling Brochure, and that this
amount would be in full settlement
of the claims in respect of amenities
detailed in the initial selling brochure. 
<P>

	2. Attached is a report on the Rowland Village visit of Messrs Danks and Lang
in which the inspection revealed the Village to be
in first class order and
that it was evident that long term maintenance would be minimal, requiring only
life cycle maintenance.
<P>

	"For residency comfort, a short deed or letter should be issued for attachment
to the initial Residents' contracts confirming that
life cycle maintenance will
be provided as necessary to resident's (sic) buildings without cost to the
residents."
<P>

13	The RSL was therefore substantially successful before the Disputes
Committee. It subsequently complied with all aspects of the
determination, and
wrote to all residents on 22 January 1996 undertaking to provide life cycle
maintenance as necessary to residents'
buildings without any cost to the
resident. 
<P>

14	Then on 31 July 1996, some six months after the Disputes Committee's
determination had been given, the defendants (applicants
before the Tribunal)
wrote to the Registrar attaching amended orders which they proposed to seek at
the next hearing date. The "Amended
Orders Sought" were as follows: 
<P>

	"1.That the administering authority prepare a correct Balance Sheet and
financial information as at 31/12/95 in respect to "Rowland
Village" so that it
reflects the position that the maintenance provision of $1,783,627 (being the
total of $1,503,068 - Maintenance
Provision, and $280,559 - Capital Receipts)
is a sum to be set aside "to cover long term maintenance;
<P>

	2. That all of the amount, calculated at 3% for 5 years on the principal loan
after deducting $10,000 paid by residents, be applied
by the administering
authority for the purpose for which it was, and is, collected, namely "to cover
long term maintenance". 
<P>

	3. That the administering authority be required to deposit into an account
reserved for that purpose on the 31/12 each year a sum
equal to the 3% for 5
years on the principal loan after deducting $10,000 from each lender and that
the money so accumulated be used
"to cover long term maintenance".
<P>

	4. That the administering authority be restrained from transferring the amount
(and any future amounts collected) to "against cost
of village" and that that
amount and future sums collected or accumulated from the same source be used
and applied towards "the cost
of long term maintenance".
<P>

	5. That the administering authority provide in tis accounts that any and all
non-refundable contributions of $10,000 received from
past, current and future
residents in accordance with the "Finance" document given to residents at the
commencement of their residency
is to be a reserve sum "to assist with ongoing
care and village amenities".
<P>

	6. That the administering authority be restrained from transferring any
portion of the $10,000 received from residents to "against
the cost of village"
in its accounts and that such sums be used for the purpose for which they were
and are received namely "to assist
with ongoing care and village amenities".

<P>

	7. That the administering authority be required to create a reserve account
into which shall be deposited an amount equal to each
of the non-refundable
contribution of all residents less any sum(s) properly expended to date and
that such funds be used and applied
only for the purpose for which such
contributions are made and received, namely to "assist with ongoing care and
village amenities".

<P>

	8. That the reserve accounts referred to in orders sought 3 and 7 hereof be
created prior to the administering authority entering
into any agreement to
sell the Retirement Village and that each resident be given an audited
statement setting out the manner in
which the sum deposited to create the two
reserved accounts is calculated. Such statement shall set out the total amounts
received
by the authority and the amount and purposes of all expenditures
and/or transfers within the accounts of the authority. 
<P>

	9. That the administering authority be restrained from restricting the
movement of residents from the Rowland Village self care
accommodation to the
Rowland Court and that as residents of Rowland Court they be entitled to full
care services without the requirement
of medical assessment."
<P>

15	By letter of 21 August 1996, the solicitors for the RSL, the respondent
before the Tribunal, advised the defendants that the
RSL would object to the
amended orders sought on the ground that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to
hear the matters raised by the
amended orders.  
<P>

	
<P>

	<b>(1) The Tribunal Hearing</b>
<P>

16	The application before the Tribunal was heard before Chairperson Toose over
two days, on 24 and 25 October 1996.  As foreshadowed,
the question of
jurisdiction was raised on behalf of the respondent early on the first day of
the hearing. 
<P>

17	Section 14(1) and (2) of the <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989 (NSW)
</i>provides as follows: 
<P>

	"<b>Applications to Tribunal relating to disputes</b>
<P>

	<b>14(1)</b> If a resident or the administering authority of a retirement
village claims that -
<P>

	(a) a dispute has arisen between the resident and the authority or the
authority and one or more residents or the resident and
another resident;
and
<P>

	(b) all procedures for settlement of the dispute under any applicable code
(otherwise than be reference of the dispute to the Tribunal)
have been
exhausted without resolving the dispute to the satisfaction of the resident or
the authority or, if there are no such procedures,
the dispute has not been
resolved, 
<P>

	the resident or authority may apply to the Tribunal for an order in respect of
the dispute."
<P>

	<b>(2)</b> The Tribunal shall not hear an application under subsection (1)
(other than an application relating to a dispute arising out of the
transfer or
the proposed transfer of a resident of a retirement village from one kind of
accommodation in the retirement village
to another) unless it is of the opinion
that -
<P>

	(a) the dispute materially affects a party to the dispute; or
<P>

	(b) it is in the public interest to do so."
<P>

18	Section 3 of that Act makes the Tribunal the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal.
<P>

19	Part 6 of the 1995 Code makes the following provisions:
<P>

	"<b>PART 6 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>
<P>

	<b>43. Dispute resolution</b>
<P>

	<b>(1) </b>It is recognised that in any communal living situation such as a
retirement village where facilities are shared, disputes between
residents and
management and between residents will arise from time to time. 
<P>

	<b>(2) </b>This Code places particular emphasis on providing easy access to an
informal and inexpensive process to resolve disputes. 
<P>

	<b>(3) </b>However, the obligation remains on the parties to a dispute to
attempt to resolve the dispute themselves. 
<P>

	<b>44. Disputes committee</b>
<P>

	<b>(1) </b>Management is required to convene a disputes committee to hear and
mediate disputes that arise within a retirement village.
<P>

	<b>(2) </b>The disputes committee is to have 3 members:
<P>

	(a) one person appointed by residents; and 
<P>

	(b) one person representing management; and 
<P>

	(c) one person agreed to by both the resident and management representatives.

<P>

	<b>(3) </b>The residents and management of the retirement village must agree
upon and establish a charter for the disputes committee so that
residents and
management are aware of the process to be followed should a dispute arise. 
<P>

	<b>45. Applications to disputes committee</b>
<P>

	<b>(1) </b>Where a dispute arises within the charter of the disputes committee
a resident, a group of residents or management may apply to the
disputes
committee to have the matter heard. 
<P>

	<b>(2) </b>The disputes committee should meet as soon as possible after being
notified of a dispute and may hear or mediate the matter in accordance
with its
charter. 
<P>

	<b>(3) </b>The disputes committee must advise the parties to the dispute, in
writing, of its decision within 30 days of receiving notice of the
dispute.
<P>

	<b>46. Appeal mechanism to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal</b>
<P>

	<b>(1) </b>The Retirement Villages Act 1989 provides that either the resident
or management may apply to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal for
an order in
respect of a dispute. 
<P>

	<b>(2) </b>Applications about a dispute (other than a dispute about a transfer
or about village rules) may be made to the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal in
the following circumstances:
<P>

	(a) where there is no disputes committee for the retirement village;
<P>

	(b) where the nature of the dispute or any other circumstances of the case
make it inappropriate or undesirable for the dispute
to be determined by a
disputes committee;
<P>

	(c) where either party to a dispute is dissatisfied with the determination of
a disputes committee;
<P>

	(d) where a disputes committee declines to hear or determine the matter.
<P>

	<b>(3) </b>The Residential Tenancies Tribunal is not to hear an application
about a dispute (other than a dispute about a transfer or about village
rules)
unless it is of the opinion that:
<P>

	(a) the dispute materially affects a party to the dispute; or 
<P>

	(b) it is in the public interest to do so. 
<P>

	<b>(4) </b>Upon receipt of the application the Residential Tenancies Tribunal
will set a date and venue for hearing the dispute and will notify
all the
relevant parties accordingly.
<P>

	<b>(5) </b>After the hearing the Residential Tenancies Tribunal will notify
the parties in writing of the outcome and of any orders made at the
hearing."

<P>

	
<P>

	<i>(a) The RSL's Submissions on Jurisdiction</i>
<P>

20	It was argued on behalf of the RSL that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to
grant the applicants' "Amended Orders Sought" because
the defendants had
neither complied with s.14(1) of the Act, nor Part 6 of the Code, before taking
the matter to the Tribunal.  It
was submitted that the defendants had not
"exhausted" all procedures for settlement of the dispute under the applicable
code, since
the dispute particularised in the "Amended Orders Sought" had never
been referred to the Disputes Committee (Indeed, it was submitted
that the RSL
could have taken the jurisdiction point as to the original applications made by
the defendants to the Tribunal, however
the subject hearing related to the
"Amended Orders Sought"). Therefore, it was submitted that the defendants were
not entitled to
apply to the Tribunal for the "Amended Orders Sought" because
of failure to comply with s.14(1) of the <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989</i>.

<P>

21	It was submitted that orders 1 to 8 had nothing to do with the dispute
originally referred to the Disputes Committee, which had
sought relief in
respect of the RSL ceasing to give out the old finance sheet.  Rather, it was
argued orders 1 to 8 were effectively
seeking injunctions relating to how the
RSL should prepare its balance sheets, the accounts into which certain moneys
were to be
deposited and the creation of reserve accounts in its formal
accounting system. 
<P>

22	As to order 9, it was argued on behalf of the RSL that it encroached upon
"absolutely new territory", this was conceded by counsel
for the defendants and
thus order 9 was not pressed. 
<P>

23	In support of his submission that the "Amended Orders Sought" could not have
come within the dispute originally referred to the
Disputes Committee, counsel
for the RSL pointed to the fact that the orders made reference to the RSL's
accounts of 31 December 1995,
which did not even exist at the time the original
application to the Disputes Committee was made. It was submitted that by the
end
of 1995, the accounting was happening in a way that the residents were
happy with.  It was after the Disputes Committee's decision,
when the accounts
came out again with an adjustment consequent upon that decision, that the
defendants raised their "Amended Orders
Sought", which should have been
referred back to the Disputes Committee.
<P>

24	Counsel for the RSL also relied upon a letter from the Association dated 8
July 1995 to show that the issues raised by the "Amended
Orders Sought" were
understood by the residents themselves to differ from the dispute that was put
before the Disputes Committee.
This letter is not before this court, although
exerpts of the letter are set out in the transcript of the Tribunal proceedings
of
24 October 1996 at pp. 23 and 24.
<P>

25	Section 14(1)(b) of the <i>Retirement Villages Act </i>requires settlement
procedures "under any applicable code" to have been exhausted. Counsel for the
RSL contended that the provisions
of the Code relating to disputes had not been
complied with.  It was submitted that the 1989 Code of Practice had "quite
clearly"
not been complied with because it had an appeal mechanism within it.
As for compliance with the 1995 Code, clause 46 makes special
provision for
appeals to the Tribunal. Counsel for the RSL referred specifically to clause
46(2)(a)-(d).  It was argued that the
only possibly relevant subclause to the
present fact situation was clause 46(2)(b), which allows for an appeal to the
Tribunal if
the circumstances are such that it is "inappropriate" or
"undesirable" for the relevant Disputes Committee to hear the dispute. 

<P>

26	Firstly, it was contended that this avenue was not available to the
defendants since, as a matter of law, a later regulation
could not qualify the
Act.  Secondly, it was argued that there was nothing in the present case that
made it "inappropriate" or "undesirable"
for the Disputes Committee to hear the
dispute. The composition of the Disputes Committee was such that one member of
the three had
been appointed by the residents and another had been agreed upon
by the residents and the RSL (the third having been appointed by
the RSL).
Therefore, there could be no issue that the residents were not adequately
represented.  Further, it was submitted that
it was much more appropriate that
the Disputes Committee, whose members had detailed knowledge of Rowland and
were well acquainted
with the issues, determine the dispute in the informal and
inexpensive way prescribed by its Charter. 
<P>

27	Finally, counsel for the RSL described the dispute resolution process that
should have been adopted by the applicants. In relation
to the "Amended Orders
Sought", the Residents' Association should have first raised the matter with
the RSL, then if the RSL had
not agreed to the residents' requests, they should
have applied to the Disputes Committee.  Then if the Disputes Committee's
decision
was considered unsatisfactory, the residents would have been entitled
to apply to the Tribunal under clause 46(2)(c) of the Code.
<P>

	<i>(b) The Defendants' Submissions on Jurisdiction</i>
<P>

28	Counsel for the defendants contended that the issues raised in the "Amended
Orders Sought" merely <i>particularised </i>the defendants' original
applications to the Tribunal filed in November 1995.  Counsel for the
defendants appears to have been working
on the assumption that the defendants'
original applications to the Tribunal were substantially the same as their
application to
the Disputes Committee, because the issue here is whether the
issues raised in the "Amended Orders Sought" were put before the Disputes
Committee.  It was submitted that it was incorrect to assert that the original
applications to the Tribunal sought to deal solely
with a dispute about the
finance sheets.  
<P>

29	In support of this submission, counsel for the defendants referred firstly
to the wording of Mr Walker's Application for an Order
filed with the Tribunal
on 14 November 1995, specifically to oppose order 9, "Reasons for asking for
this order or orders?...":
<P>

	"1. The items in dispute are non-refundable (1) $10,000 for amenities; (b)
long term maintenance, maintenance costs charges, minimisation
and
depreciation.
<P>

	2. As far back as 89/90 a finance sheet setting out these qualifications was
issued to the RSL official sales brochure....
<P>

	3. The RSL simply refused to be held accountable and would not provide details
as to the moneys geld and disbursements, etc. Also
amenities as promised have
not been provided.  Residents needed assurances that the funds had not been
used for purposes other than
those intended hence the dispute.
<P>

	4. The dispute must be resolved irrespective of sale. 
<P>

	5. If a sale takes place the long term becomes the short term and the RSL
(NSW) will be required to refund to Rowland Village Residents
Association all
unspent funds in the two non-profit accounts shown as liabilities in the books
- that is, liability to licences of
R.V. Community."
<P>

30	The text under that contention as to order 9 in the applications of Messrs
McKenzie and Buxton was not identical to that set
out above, however it was
submitted that it involved substantially the same issues.  
<P>

31	Counsel for the defendants further supported his contention that the
"Amended Orders Sought" were not in substance different
from the defendants'
original applications to the Tribunal by reference to the <i>Anshun
estoppel</i> principle (<i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981)
147 CLR 589</a></i>).  It was submitted that if the decision of the Disputes
Committee had been that of a court, and the defendants had then put on another
Summons seeking the "Amended Orders Sought", they would have been estopped from
proceeding by virtue of the operation of the <i>Anshun estoppel </i>principle,
because the "Amended Orders Sought" were to precisely the same effect as the
original orders. 
<P>

32	Counsel for the defendants contended that the references to the 1995
accounts were provided by way of illustration.  It was submitted
that the
provision accounts had always existed but the figures had been added to year by
year, the residual of which was last reported
in the accounts for 1995
contained in the 79th Annual Report and Financial Statements of the RSL,
exhibited before the Tribunal.
 It was submitted that the accounts of 1995 had
merely confirmed the defendants' worst fears in relation to what they had been
arguing
before the Disputes Committee since 1994. 
<P>

	
<P>

	<i>(c)Discussion of Issues Arising</i>
<P>

33	Counsel for the RSL agreed that the word "claims" applies to both
subsections (a) and (b) of s.14(1), however it was submitted
that it had to be
read objectively and be capable of examination.  It was submitted that if
"claims" was not read objectively, then
the section would allow a person who
made a false or frivolous claim that a dispute had arisen and that all avenues
of dispute resolution
had been exhausted to apply to the Tribunal to have the
matter heard.  It was submitted that this was a result that could not have
been
intended by s.14(1). 	
<P>

34	Chairperson Toose enquired as to whether, during the 16 months that the
Disputes Committee was considering its decision, other
communication and
correspondence was put to it which may have drawn its attention to the matters
raised in orders 1 to 8, as a result
of which it was ascertained that there
were two relevant documents which came before the Disputes Committee in the
period between
the making of the application and the Committee's determination.
There was a document emanating from the Rowland finance panel dated
7 November
1994 and a reply to it dated 11 November 1994 (Annexures "AF6C" and "AF6D" to
the affidavit of Annette Fontana sworn 24
February 1997).
<P>

35	It was submitted by counsel for the defendants that the above correspondence
made it perfectly clear that the Disputes Committee
had before it precisely
what had been encapsulated in the "Amended Orders Sought".  
<P>

36	There was a witness at the Tribunal hearing, a Mr Wilkinson, who was a
member of the Disputes Committee. He was never formally
called to give
evidence, however he advised that, except in a very limited sense in relation
to orders 2 and 5, none of the issues
in 1 to 9 had ever come before the
Disputes Committee.  
<P>

37	Chairperson Toose raised the issue that disputes relating to retirement
villages could be taken through a vast array of avenues
of dispute resolution,
other than the Disputes Committee.  With this in mind, she invited counsel to
comment on whether "exhausted"
meant that every single applicable avenue for
dispute resolution had to be pursued from start to finish before an application
to
the Tribunal could be made. 
<P>

38	The issue of whether the Disputes Committee's delay in reaching its decision
affected the determination of whether all settlement
procedures had been
"exhausted" was also considered. A significant delay could justify a belief,
albeit subjective (and the word
"claims" would have to be interpreted
accordingly), that all avenues to resolve the dispute had in fact been
exhausted.  An example
of such a subjective belief was provided by the
statement annexed to the William Walker's original application to the
Tribunal.
<P>

<u>39	</u> Counsel for the RSL submitted that the delay was irrelevant to the
jurisdictional issue, since the issues now raised by orders 1
to 9 were never
put before the Disputes Committee in the first place.
<P>

<u>	</u> 
<P>

<u>	</u><b>(2) The Tribunal's Decision on the issue of Jurisdiction</b>
<P>

40	Judgment on the jurisdictional issue was delivered on 25 October 1996,
detailed written reasons for which were sent out on 11
November 1996. The
findings were as follows:
<P>

	1. The application to the Disputes Committee dated 5 September 1994 was
intended to be read as a whole. The original application
to the Disputes
Committee was not restricted to the matters contained in the final two
paragraphs of the letter of 5 September 1994;

<P>

	2. The word "claims" in s.14(1) of the Act applies to both subsections (a) and
(b). There is no condition precedent that what is
claimed must actually have
occurred before an application may be made to the Tribunal; 
<P>

	3. There is an extraordinary number of avenues of dispute resolution available
to retirement village residents due to the application
of a variety of other
pieces of legislation to the Act and Regulations. There was no evidence that
each and all of these other avenues
had been exhausted.  However, it can not
have been the intention of the legislation that each and all avenues had to be
exhausted
before a person could apply to the Tribunal;
<P>

	4. Section 14(1) of the Act should be read subjectively and read down and on
the basis of settlement procedures reasonably available
to the parties or
reasonably contemplated by them.  Since 1993 the disputed matter had been to
the administering authority, the Tenancy
Commissioner, mediation and the
Disputes Committee, and more then two years later remained unresolved;
<P>

	5. The applicants' original applications to the Tribunal were made more than
12 months after the matter had been referred to the
Disputes Committee. Given
the passage of time and the imperative obligation imposed upon the Committee
that it deliver its determinations
within 30 days, and given all the other
avenues of dispute resolution attempted, each of the applicants was entitled to
assume that
the Disputes Committee was unable or unwilling to resolve the
dispute or deliver a decision and that the applicants could deem that
avenue of
dispute resolution exhausted;
<P>

	6. In relation to the issues raised by the applications of Messrs Buxton and
McKenzie, the Tribunal had jurisdiction under s.14(2)
of the Act, because the
issues materially affected a party to the dispute. This jurisdiction was
however subject to s.14(3) which
sets out the types of orders the Tribunal is
able to make. Messrs Buxton and McKenzie were entitled to bring their
applications under
s.14(1);
<P>

	7. In his application, Mr Walker raised the issue of the proposed sale of
Rowland, which had not gone before the Disputes Committee
and therefore was not
able to be referred to the Tribunal.  However, Mr Walker's application raised
issues that were in the "nature"
of the issues raised in the application
submitted to the Disputes Committee and therefore he was also entitled to lodge
his application
pursuant to s.14(1);
<P>

	8. As to the applications of Messrs Buxton and McKenzie, the "Amended Orders
Sought" filed on 31 July 1996, orders 1 to 8 were
within the nature of the
issues that were dealt with by the Disputes Committee and therefore they were
able to be the subject of
an application pursuant to s.14(1).  There was no
evidence that order 9 had been previously put to the Disputes Committee, the
Tenancy
Commissioner or mediation, therefore it was not an appropriate issue to
be heard by the Tribunal;
<P>

	9. The amendments sought to be made to the original applications of Messrs
Buxton and McKenzie by "Amended Orders Sought" 1 to
8 should be allowed,
however the inclusion of order 9 should not be allowed;
<P>

	10. The same finding as in 9) was made in relation to Mr Walker's application,
because what was termed "Amended Orders Sought"
1 to 8 were, in fact, further
particulars and a redrafting of his original application in a more succinct and
legalistic fashion.
<P>

	
<P>

	<b>(3) The Appeal to the Supreme Court</b>
<P>

41	On the basis of Chairperson Toose's findings, the RSL appealed to this Court
by way of Summons seeking the following orders:
<P>

	1. An order allowing the appeal in so far as it relates to jurisdictional
issues in relation to orders 1-8 in the defendants' "Amended
Orders Sought";
<P>

	2. An order dismissing each of the proceedings;
<P>

	3. (Alternatively to 2), an order that the respective proceedings be stayed
(or not be heard) until the defendants have fulfilled
the requirements of
s.14(1) of the <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989</i> in respect of the issues
raised by the said orders 1-8;
<P>

	4. Costs (including the costs of the proceedings to date in the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal).
<P>

42	Filed with the Summons on behalf of the plaintiff was a Statement of Grounds
pursuant to SCR Pt 51A r5.  They grounds can be
briefly summarised as
follows:
<P>

	1. Chairperson Toose erred in law in characterising and considering the
original applications filed with the Tribunal by the defendants
when
determining whether the requirements of s.14(1) of the Act had been met;
<P>

	2. Chairperson Toose should instead have addressed the issue of whether the
requirements of s.14(1) of the Act had been met in
respect of the "Amended
Orders Sought";
<P>

	3. Chairperson Toose erred in law in her construction of the application made
by the Association dated 5 September 1994;
<P>

	4. Chairperson Toose should have found that the dispute raised by the letter
of 5 September 1994 concerned the discrete issues
of the RSL's refusal to
reinstate its original finance sheet and to credit residents with interest
earned on the two alleged funds;
<P>

	5. Chairperson Toose erred in law by finding, in relation to the "Amended
Orders Sought", that the defendants had complied with
s.14(1) in that all
procedures for the settlement of the dispute had been exhausted under the
provisions of the applicable code;
<P>

	6. Chairperson Toose erred in law in finding that s.14(1) was to be read
subjectively;
<P>

	7. The Chairperson erred in law in finding that the defendants had satisfied
the requirements of s.14(1)(a) and (b) because there
was no evidence of any
"claim" by the defendants in terms of either the existence of a dispute or that
all avenues of dispute resolution
had been exhausted;
<P>

	8. Chairperson Toose erred in law in finding that the "Amended Orders Sought"
nos. 1-8 had been dealt with by the Disputes Committee
and that s.14(1) had,
impliedly therefore, been satisfied by the defendants;
<P>

	9. In relation to her findings in relation to the Disputes Committee, the
Chairperson erred in law in that:
<P>

	(a) she failed to consider whether the delay of the Disputes Committee in
giving its decision was caused by and assented to by
both parties while they
attempted to mediate the dispute;
<P>

	(b) she failed to address whether the delay had been waived;
<P>

	(c) she erred in finding clause 45(3) of the Code (relating to the time within
a determination by the Disputes Committee shall
be given) to be mandatory;
<P>

	(d) she equated a past delay of the Disputes Committee in making a
determination with exhaustion of all procedures for dispute
resolution under
s.14(1) of the Act;
<P>

	10. The Chairperson should have found that the "claim" under s.14(1):
<P>

	(a) had not been made in respect of the "Amended Orders Sought";
<P>

	(b) even if it were made, it was examinable by the Tribunal so as to determine
objectively whether the subsection had been satisfied.
<P>

	
<P>

	<i>(a) The RSL's Submissions on the appeal</i>
<P>

43	Outlined below are submissions which were made by the RSL, additional to
those already made at the Tribunal hearing.  
<P>

44	It was submitted that Chairperson Toose ignored the central point of the
RSL's submissions, that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction
in respect of the
"Amended Orders Sought" (and not the original applications). It was submitted
that Chairperson Toose focused on
the original applications made to the
Tribunal and not the "Amended Orders Sought".  By allowing an "application to
amend", such
an application not being necessary in the first place, it was
submitted that Chairperson Toose had attempted to "buttress a finding
by taking
on something neither in issue nor the subject of addresses".  It was conceded,
however, that this was not a point of substance
since the same issue of
jurisdiction would have arisen on any formal application to amend. 
<P>

45	It was submitted that the right to remove the finance sheet, adjudicated on
by the Disputes Committee, was not challenged nor
sought to be reopened in the
"Amended Orders Sought".  There were no complaints arising out of the Disputes
Committee's recommendations
either.  These were  issues which would have fallen
within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by virtue of s.14(1) and the operation
of clause 46(2)(c) of the Code, and can be contrasted with the issues that were
raised by the "Amended Orders Sought".
<P>

46	In relation to the Chairperson's interpretation of s.14(1), it was submitted
that to read down the words, "all procedures for
settlement of the dispute
under any applicable code...have been exhausted" was contrary to the ordinary
principles of statutory interpretation.
 It was submitted that words are to be
construed according to their ordinary and natural sense.  In short, it was
submitted that
"all" means "all".
<P>

47	It was submitted that the Chairperson's interpretation of "claims" as
subjective was also incorrect in light of the principles
of statutory
interpretation. Firstly, "where two meanings are open...it is proper to adopt
that meaning that will avoid consequences
that appear irrational and unjust"
(<i>P.T.C. of NSW v J Murray-More (NSW) Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%206%20ALR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 6 ALR 271</a>, at 282</i>).
Secondly, one should resist an interpretation which renders a statute
nugatory.
<P>

48	It was contended that if "claims" were to be read subjectively, a person who
had not participated in any procedure for settlement
of a dispute under any
applicable code could simply "claim" he had, and by the mere fact of his making
such claim could set at nought
the obvious intention of the legislation and the
Code that applications to the Tribunal should be a last, not first, resort,
especially
in light of the informal, inexpensive and accessible mechanisms that
had been set up in respect of Rowland Village. It was submitted
that "claims"
should be interpreted objectively and should be, in effect, examinable. 
<P>

	
<P>

	<i>(b) The Defendants' Submissions on the appeal</i>
<P>

49	It was submitted that, by reference to the late addition of s.14(1) when the
original <i>Retirement Villages Bill</i> was introduced, the formalistic
approach to interpretation of that section advocated by the RSL could not have
been intended by the
legislature.  The following passage from a speech by the
then Deputy Leader of the Opposition was relied on:
<P>

	"If agreed to, this amendment [the addition of s.14(1)] will have the effect
of allowing the tribunal to arbitrate in relation
to a range of disputes before
a breach is notified. It aims to further the underlying philosophy of the 1987
legislation to enable
arbitration and mediation to take place, which was always
the central thrust of the legislation.  Under the Government's proposal
tenants
will be compelled to breach an agreement to ensure the resolution of a dispute
- a proposition that the Opposition cannot
support."
<P>

50	It was submitted that it was incorrect to argue that, just because the
"Amended Orders Sought" were not worded identically to
the original application
to the Disputes Committee, the issues raised in the "Amended Orders Sought" had
never been put to the Disputes
Committee.  It was submitted that the nature of
the dispute as identified on 5 September 1994 and then particularised in the
"Amended
Orders Sought" were in substance and effect the same.  Reference was
made to s.89 of the Act, however it is irrelevant as that Act
applies in a very
limited sense only to disputes under the <i>Retirement Villages Act</i>. 
<P>

51	Counsel for the defendants referred to Part 6 of the 1989 Code which dealt
with dispute resolution:
<P>

	"<b>Applications to Disputes Committee</b>
<P>

	Where a dispute arises within the charter of the disputes committee (as
decided by the residents and management of a retirement
village) either a
resident or management may apply to the village's disputes committee to have
the matter heard"
<P>

52	Reference to the Rowland Disputes Committee's Charter was also made:
<P>

	"Applications to the committee shall be made in writing and shall state: -
<P>

	(i)the names of the parties to the dispute;
<P>

	(ii) the nature of the dispute; 
<P>

	(iii) and how the applicant would like the dispute to be resolved"
<P>

53	On the basis of the above provisions, it was submitted that at the level of
a referral to the Disputes Committee, informality
was encouraged.  However,
when a matter comes before the Tribunal, there is a need for particularity with
a view to resolving the
real issues in dispute.	
<P>

54	Prior to the hearing and the reserving of the decision in this matter, the
court was advised that the question of validity of
the Codes was to be decided
by Windeyer J in the Equity Division of this Court.  Subsequent to reserving
this decision, his Honour
delivered his judgment in <i>Murphy and Ors v Overton
Investments Pty Ltd (Windeyer J, 10 December 1997, unreported)</i> in which his
Honour upheld the validity of the Code.  This matter was subsequently taken to
the Court of Appeal, however the issues
in the appeal did not concern the
validity of the Code. 
<P>

	
<P>

	<b>(4) Analysis of the Arguments and Law</b>
<P>

55	The legislative structure which set up the Codes of Practice as part of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW)</i> as variously amended, was a specific
legislative scheme intended to obviate legal proceedings, legal expenses and
the problems involved
in court proceedings.  The intention was to provide
simple and prompt resolution mechanisms.  The very terms of the Code itself as
approved by the Minister is to emphasise, in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a>, the mechanism for
resolution of disputes and the appeal mechanism to the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal.  
<P>

56	The fact that the appeal mechanism is specifically referred to as such,
underlines the fact that it is intended that the dispute
be dealt with by the
Disputes Committee before the appeal takes place.  
<P>

57	Clause 46(2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> sets out the circumstances where matters may go to
the Tribunal, namely in circumstances where there is no Disputes Committee,
where
the nature of the dispute makes it inappropriate for the matter to go
before the Disputes Committee, where a party is dissatisfied
with the
determination of the Disputes Committee and where a Disputes Committee declines
to hear or determine the matter.  
<P>

58	It seems to me that, except for the circumstances of there being no
Committee, or the declining of an existing Committee, or
the matter being
inappropriate, that it is clear that the Committee dispute mechanism is
intended to work before the matter proceeds
to the Tribunal by way of appeal.

<P>

59	The essence of the Code is the use of the Disputes Committee.  Section 14 of
the <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989</i> makes it abundantly clear that there is
a requirement that the mechanisms under a Code have to be exhausted.  Section
14 of that
Act does not require all procedures outside the Code to be
exhausted, it requires that the Code be complied with.  There seems to
be no
reason for that specific provision, s.14(1)(b), to be read other than in
accordance with the principles of statutory interpretation,
and it must be read
objectively.  I consider that to read it other than objectively would render
the statute of no effect.  
<P>

60	Similarly, I consider that the word "claims" should be interpreted in
accordance with the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation.
 It is to have
its ordinary meaning, and the circumstances of each claim will be interpreted
by the body determining that claim as
to whether it is spurious or frivolous,
or a claim of substance to be heard.  
<P>

61	"Claims" should have its ordinary meaning.  If a claim arises, it should be
dealt with.  A Tribunal must examine whether a claim
exists.  I agree with the
submission of Mr Young for the RSL, that the provision in s.14(2) of the
<i>Retirement Villages Act 1989</i>, requiring that there be public interest or
a material affect to a party, underlines the requirement that a Tribunal is not
to hear
a frivolous matter.  A claim is to be examined on its merits. 
<P>

62	With the greatest of respect to the learned Chairperson, the decision on
jurisdiction seems to have missed the principle matter
before her, in that the
primary dispute before the Tribunal related to the "Amended Orders Sought" and
that in relation to those
orders, there had not been compliance with the
provisions of the Act and the Code of Practice requiring exhaustion of
procedures
for settlement of the dispute.  The "Amended Orders Sought" as such
had not been put before the Disputes Committee and the informal
procedures had
been by-passed.  The Chairperson does not seem to have accepted the submission
before her that the case was about
the "Amended Orders Sought".  It is
unfortunate that the delays in the Disputes Committee procedure had frustrated
the intention
of the Code, ie. the production of a prompt result, however that
mechanism in fact eventually worked, and the issues before the Disputes
Committee were resolved. 
<P>

63	The whole reason for seeking of the "Amended Orders Sought" was to take the
matters in dispute into a somewhat more complex accounting
and accountability
issue, whereas the earlier dispute related to matters of principle, concerning
the issues arising out of the "Finance
Sheet" and the consequences of those
matters of principle.  
<P>

64	The "Amended Orders Sought" raise issues which obviously are directly
related to the earlier dispute, but it is necessary to
look at the substance of
what the new issues were, rather than whether the new issues raised were simply
related to the earlier issue.
 The whole reason for the "Amended Orders Sought"
was to raise the new issues. If these new issues had gone before the Disputes
Committee,
there would have had to have been a significantly different and more
sophisticated debate dealing with accounting matters and matters
of legal and
fiscal consequence, which, although more difficult, are still within those
areas contemplated by s.14 of the <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989</i> and
contemplated by Part 6 of the Code. 
<P>

65	It is obvious, in determining whether a claim is the same, that it is the
substance of the claim which has to be looked at. 
It seems to me, however, in
this case, the substance of the dispute issues are significantly wider and of
very different consequence
from the issues originally raised before the
Disputes Committee.  
<P>

66	It seems to me that the learned Chairperson has erred in her determination
that items 1 to 8 in the "Amended Orders Sought" are
in the nature of the
issues dealt with by the Disputes Committee.  The Chairperson refers to the
power to amend and that no application
is sought to amend to include items 1 to
8 of the "Amended Orders Sought".  It seems to me the simple reason for no such
application
being made was that it was clear to counsel that, as outlined
before the Chairperson, if the issues raised were substantially different,
then
the jurisdictional point was valid.
<P>

67	I consider, therefore, that the "Amended Orders Sought" bring in to the
dispute new and significantly different issues which
had not been before the
Disputes Committee.  The <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989 </i> and the Code both
apply. This dispute is clearly one contemplated by the Act and the Code, and
the "Amended Orders Sought" ought
to have gone through the proper mechanisms
described.  It seems to me, therefore, that the learned Chairperson was in
error, and
that the submission on jurisdiction should be upheld.  I find
therefore that the learned Chairperson did not have jurisdiction to
hear the
matter. 
<P>

68	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1. That the appeal be allowed in so far as it relates to the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal in relation to the defendants' "Amended
Orders Sought";
<P>

2. That the respective proceedings be stayed until the defendants have
fulfilled the requirements of s.14 of the <i>Retirement Villages Act 1989
</i>in respect of the orders raised by items 1 to 8;
<P>

3.  That the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of this Summons.
