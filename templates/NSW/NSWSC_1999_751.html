FRIDAY 9 JULY 1999
<P>

<b>NO 1428/99 -  CASTLE CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED V SHERWOOD FURNITURE PTY
LIMITED.</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT:</b>
<P>

1   	MASTER: This is the hearing of an application to set aside
a statutory demand.  The statutory demand is one which was issued
by the
defendant company against the plaintiff company and claims an amount of
$45,000. The demand is dated 27 January 1999. The
proceedings were instituted
on 18 February 1999 and affidavits in support were filed at that stage.
Accordingly, it would be within
time. Importantly the claim in the statutory
demand is a claim for a dishonour of three cheques dated in July and August
1997 in
the amount totalling in all $45,000. 
<P>

2   	The arrangements between the parties were that the
defendant was to construct and install in the plaintiff's offices various
furniture some of which had to be built in and some of which was loose. The
initial arrangements appear to have been made towards
the end of June 1997. At
that stage there is a variety of evidence before me which refers to requests
for cheques to be paid on account
of the purchase price. There was an initial
deposit and over a period the plaintiff company issued some cheques according
to Mr Lahood
on the basis that they were not to be presented until completion
of the work. The matter of the construction work seems to have come
into
dispute in the second half of 1997 with allegations of at least delays in the
completion of the work. What happened then was
that the plaintiff company
stopped payment on the cheques in about August.  In October the three cheques
concerned were presented
and were dishonoured. Thereafter there were further
discussions between the lawyers for the parties as by this stage lawyers had
become involved in the matter. Their involvement led to the execution of an
agreement dated 1st December 1997 and that seems on the
face of it to have
substituted a new regime for whatever might have been the contract between the
parties prior to that date. 
<P>

3   	The contract in clause 1 provides for the delivery and
installation of the remainder of the goods and clause 1.4 deals with
defects.
In particular it provides for making good, involving rectification of any
defects by 5 March and clause 1.4.4 provides that
if the making good of
rectification works not completed by 5 March 1998 any monies under clause 2.4
will be repaid to the plaintiff.
Clause 2 appears to be a fairly comprehensive
clause which deals with payment. It refers to the agreement that there has
already
been paid $49,000 as part of the price and provides for further
payments. 
<P>

4   	Under clause 2.2.1 there is a payment which provides for
items delivered by December 1997 and clause 2.2.2 provides for payment
for free
standing items and completed installation of all built in items of $9,000.
Clause 2.4 provides that the balance of the funds
namely $48,700 be held by the
plaintiff's solicitor and provision is made for payment out once the contract
is completed. One of
the parties to the agreement is a Mr Ficus an architect
and he accepted an appointment and was appointed as an expert under the
contract
to certify as to certain matters on completion. 
<P>

5   	After lst December there were a number of things done
including inspections by Mr Ficus from time to time and one of which
he
indicated in his view that there was no compliance with clause 2.2.2. There are
outstanding defects according to his evidence
which still have not been
rectified and that would mean as we have now passed March 1999 that the sum for
the balance of the work
would have to be paid to the plaintiff rather than the
defendant under the terms of the agreement.
<P>

6   	The difficulty is that the statutory demand claims money
pursuant to cheques. Under s 71 of the Cheques Act there is a liability
by the
drawer that on presentation of the cheque, the cheque will be paid according to
its tenor and under s 76 the measure of damages
in Australia is the amount of
the cheque. That would seem to provide strict liability normally to make
payment on a cheque.  That
is the claim which the demand makes under s 6 of the
Cheques Act. The provisions of that last two mentioned sections, namely, s 71
and 76 are subject to any agreement that there may be between the parties as to
payment. This means that one has to look to see whether
there might be some
other agreement governing payment between the parties.
<P>

7   	The agreement of lst December 1997 appears on its face to
be a complete code dealing with the remainder of the contract. There
is
obviously from the affidavit evidence and from the way the case has been
presented a substantial dispute between the defendant
company and the plaintiff
as to whether the work has been carried out appropriately. That really is not
the dispute which I have
to judge for the purposes of this application. The
real dispute which I have to judge is more of a legal dispute.  That is whether
there is a genuine dispute at all as to whether or not the agreement of the lst
December 1997 has superseded any liability for the
cheques. 
<P>

8   	In determining that it is necessary to remind oneself as to
what are the principles to be applied and I think the most useful
summation is
that given by McLelland CJ in Equity in <b>Eyota Pty Limited v. Hanave Pty
Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 669.</a> At page 671 his Honour made the following
comments in respect of the expression "Genuine dispute".
<P>

"It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression 'genuine
dispute' where it occurs in s. 459H. In my opinion
that expression connotes a
plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of
consideration as the 'serious
question to be tried' criterion which arises on
an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal
of
a caveat. This does not mean that the Court must accept uncritically as
giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an affidavit
however
equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary
documents or other statements by the same deponent,
or inherently improbable in
itself, it may be' not have sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit
further investigation as to
(its) truth' (cf <b>Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC 331</a> at 341), or 'a patently feeble legal argument, or an assertion of
facts unsupported by evidence; (cf <b>South Australia v Wall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2024%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 24 SASR
189</a> at 194).
<P>

But does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a Court required to
determine whether there is a genuine dispute should not
embark upon an inquiry
s to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute. There
is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute. In <b>Mibor
Investments</b> (at ACLC  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1066%20ACSR%20366%2d7" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1066; ACSR 366-7)</a> Hayne J said, after referring to the
state of the law prior to the enactment of Division 3 of Part 5.4 of the
Corporations Law, and
to the terms of Division 3:
<P>

'These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it
is not expected that the Court will embark upon any
extended inquiry in order
to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and
certainly will not attempt to weigh
the merits of that dispute. All that the
legislation requires is that the Court conclude that there is a dispute and
that it is a
genuine dispute.'
<P>

In <b>Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Limited </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20919" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 919</a> at 922
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 601</a> Thomas J said:
<P>

'There is little doubt that Division 3...prescribes a formula that requires the
Court to assess the position between the parties,
and preserve demands where it
can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine
offsetting claim. That is not
to say that the Court will examine the merits or
settle the dispute. The specified limits of the Court's examination are the
ascertainment
of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there is a
"genuine claim". It is often possible to discern the spurious, and
to identify
mere bluster or assertion. But beyond a perception of genuineness (or the lack
of it) the Court has no function. It is
not helpful to perceive that one party
is more likely than the other to succeed, or that the eventual state of the
account between
the parties 	is more likely to be one result than another. The
essential task is relatively simply - to identify the genuine level
of a
claim(not the likely result of it) and to identify the genuine level of an
offsetting claim (not the likely result of it)'.
<P>

I respectfully agree with those statements".
<P>

9   	The question then is whether there is a genuine dispute
about the supplanting of the right to sue on the cheque by the agreement
of 1st
December 1997. This means that the genuine dispute has absolutely nothing to do
with whether the work was properly completed
under the contract. That is a
dispute for another place if the demand is set aside. The things that incline
me towards the view that
there is a very substantial argument and certainly a
genuine dispute as to whether the cheques could be sued upon is that the
agreement
of the 1st December 1997 is the code which regulates the rights
between the parties and their ability to sue each other for monies
in respect
of the remainder of the contract. 
<P>

10   	Given the terms of the agreement it seems to me that it
really does encompass the parties' rights and therefore the ordinary
presumptions that might apply by reason of s 71 and 76 of the Cheques Act are
not applicable. For these reasons I am satisfied there
is a genuine dispute in
respect of the matter. 
<P>

11   	Accordingly I set aside the statutory demand made by the
defendant on the plaintiff dated the 27th January 1999 in the amount
of
$45,000. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs. 
<P>

12   	There has been an application for costs on an indemnity
basis. This might apply if there is some action which has been taken
which
tries to raise false issues. However what has been sought to be argued
obviously by the solicitors who earlier appeared was
some argument perhaps that
the cheques might still be valid. The matter has been dealt with and I do not
think that I will make an
order on an indemnity costs basis and accordingly
costs will be on the ordinary party and party basis. The exhibits are to be
returned.
