<b><u>3604/98 PATRICK JONES PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIOS PTY. LTD v KARIN
CATT</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Outline</b>
<P>

1	The question to be decided is whether the plaintiff company, Patrick Jones
Photographic Studios Pty. Ltd. (the company) has a
beneficial interest in
property 3A Rainford Street, Surry Hills (the property) of which the defendant
Miss Karin Catt (Catt) is registered
proprietor, or whether it should be
declared that Catt holds the property upon constructive trust so as to give the
company an interest
or whether the company has no interest at all in the
property.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2	As will become obvious there is no proper evidence of some important or
relevant matters.  In addition, while the parties did
try to restrict the case
to evidence which avoided their personal relationships it became clear that
there had developed a very bitter
personal conflict between Mr. Patrick Jones
(Jones) and Catt so that the case seemed to proceed in a sort of twilight
zone.
<P>

3	There is no evidence of the shareholders or directors of the company.  It was
accepted it was controlled by Jones.  It was, and
presumably still is, a
successful photographic company with substantial earnings from its photography
and photographic studio operations.
 It does not appear to have any
photographer employees, other than Jones, all such photographers being engaged
on a contract basis
using the company studios and having a profit sharing
arrangement with the company.  It does, however, have an administrative manager
and at least a receptionist, although the former is engaged on some consultancy
basis.  Jones and Catt had been friends since 1992
and at least by the end of
1993 had developed a close personal relationship.  At that time Jones was
living in rented accommodation
at Bondi and Catt lived there with him from time
to time.  The company owned property 26-28 Rainford Street, Surry Hills and
Jones
himself owned a next door property 22 Rainford Street Surry Hills, in
which property Catt also lived from time to time.  By this
time Catt owned two
properties at Newcastle and for the purchase of at least one of these she
raised moneys on mortgage from the
Newcastle Permanent Building Society.  Both
were investment properties and both were leased out.
<P>

4	In February 1994 Catt commenced work with the company as what Jones described
as a trainee photographer.  Catt seemed to resist
this description, although in
her affidavit she said that she was an assistant photographer, claiming that
the quality of her work
was at least as good as that of Jones.  Her wage was
$400 per week.  In December 1994 Catt entered into a contract for the purchase
of the property, which was almost directly opposite the property of the
company.  The purchase price was $270 000.  Catt gave almost
incomprehensible
oral evidence about the source of the purchase funds none of which was
supported by documents.  The mortgage on
the property to Newcastle Permanent
Building Society secured the sum of $165 000.  There is evidence that Catt
borrowed $68 500 from
her parents and that she provided the balance of the
moneys, together with the purchase expenses from her own funds, some of which
may have been raised on one of the other properties.  I am prepared to find
that to be the position.  Why no one bothered to establish
the important facts
through the building society records I cannot fathom.  Whether from borrowings
alone or from borrowings and her
own funds, Catt paid the purchase moneys and
the associated expenses of about $17 000.
<P>

5	The property was in a very run down state on purchase.  I accept the evidence
that it was uninhabitable and untenantable.  Catt
expected that she would be
able to rent it and cover the mortgage interest through rent, but her attempts
to find a tenant failed,
due at least in part, and probably in whole, to the
condition of the property.  Without income Catt was forced to defray the
mortgage
payments out of her own funds.  She was at a time very ill herself,
although during this stage the company continued to pay her wage
as a trainee
photographer.  Whatever the position, it was quite unlikely that a salary of
$400 per week could support borrowings
of $165 000 let alone the additional
funds borrowed from her parents, who themselves raised a loan over their
Newcastle home to enable
them to provide the funds which they did provide.
<P>

6	In late 1995 there were discussions between Jones and Catt about the property
and its financing.  It was clear by then it could
not be let in its existing
condition.  Catt had arranged for some work to be done but it was not
sufficient.  It was also clear and
I find that Catt was in danger of losing the
property unless she obtained further financial assistance.
<P>

7	Paragraph 10 of the affidavit of Jones sworn 28 August 1998 is as follows:
<P>

10.	During late 1995, the Defendant informed me that she had run out of money.
By this time the Property was still in a derelict
condition, so the Defendant
and I discussed the possibility of me, through the Plaintiff, assisting the
Defendant to complete the
renovation of the Property by investing funds into
the Property.  At the time, the Defendant and I had numerous discussions using
words to the following effect:
<P>

<i>Jones:	I'd be interested in investing some money in 3A Rainford Street to
help you complete renovating it.  The company could invest
some money and take
a financial share in the property and use the building for extra studio space.
You could live upstairs.  This
would ease your financial problems and you would
not be put in a position where you would have to sell the property.  What do
you
think?</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:	How would you work it?</i>
<P>

<i>Jones:	So far, you have invested $30,000.00 of your own money and put in the
$275,000.00 from the Newcastle Building Society.  The
company will finance the
renovations.  The company will pay three-quarters of the mortgage and you will
pay one-quarter.  We will
also run and administer the property.  At the end of
a pre-determined time, say 2 or 3 years, with extension options, the company
will have the option to get out of the deal.  The formula for this is that you
will be repaid your $30,000.00 investment plus interest.
 The company will be
repaid its investment plus interest.  The $275,000.00 from the Newcastle
Building Society will be taken out
and what is left after the property is
valued is the net profit.  This will be divided equally between you and the
company.  You
will have first option to buy the company's financial share in
the property.  If you don't want to keep the building, the company
will have
the first option to buy the building from you.  If either party wants to sell
the property, it will be sold at public auction
and the proceeds will be
applied using the same formula.</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:	I agree to this.  If possible, I will try to raise some money to
assist with the renovations.</i>
<P>

8	As I will show, when I deal with the pleadings, the plaintiff's claim is
founded on the agreement Jones says was arrived at through
these words.  In
cross-examination Jones was asked to state again what was said.  The following
appears on pp 61-64 of the transcript:
<P>

Q.	In the position she was in?
<P>

A.	Of course, if you would like me to read the formula for you, she didn't have
to put any money in.  She only had to pay a quarter
of the mortgage each week
and for that she had a place to live.
<P>

Q.	A place to live - all right.  What do you say the actual agreement was
between you in November 1995?
<P>

A.	Is this the financial agreement?
<P>

Q.	Yes?
<P>

A.	The financial agreement is whatever Karin put in --
<P>

Q.	Number one --
<P>

A.	She had --
<P>

Q.	Take it slowly --
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	He is trying to tell you what she put in.
<P>

WITNESS:	She invested - I said to Karin you have invested $30,000 of your own
money.
<P>

HOUGHTON:	Q. Yes?
<P>

A.	And you have borrowed $270,000 from the building society, is that not
correct?  She said yes.  I said, the company --
<P>

OBJECTION
<P>

HOUGHTON:	Excuse me, your Honour, I would ask that the witness not read from
his affidavit.
<P>

WITNESS:	I'm sorry.  She would put in - I asked her - I said "You put in
$30,000" and she said, "Yes" - "From your own money". 
I said, "You have
borrowed $275,000 from the building society" and she said, "Yes."
<P>

	Now, I said, "What we will do is we will complete the renovations for the
financial share in the property.  You will have somewhere
to live in the
property and we will use the rest of the property as photographic studios for
extra work."
<P>

Q.	I'm sorry?
<P>

A.	For extra work that may overflow from our main studio.
<P>

Q.	So you would sublet, is that what you mean?
<P>

A.	There was a certain amount of subletting.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	It is quite impossible for this witness to tell you what the
agreement was if he keeps being interrupted.
<P>

BEVAN:	I ask that the last exchange be struck out.
<P>

WITNESS:	So I said there is a formula; the formula will be for the deal and the
formula is "whatever you put in Karin you get back",
so at this point she put
$30,000 in.  Whatever you put in you get back with interest and whatever we put
in, whatever money we invest
we get back with interest.  At the end of the deal
we pay whatever is owing to the Newcastle Building Society on the $275,000
mortgage
and what is left over we split between you and the company, fifty
fifty.
<P>

	We will pay three quarters of the mortgage and you will pay one quarter of the
mortgage.. The deal will be for ten years with every
two years we will have the
option to get out of the deal - every two to three years.  At the end of ten
years the options will return
to Karin.
<P>

	Now, how that would work would be:  that at the end of, say, three years, if
we decided that we couldn't afford to be there or
if there was some reason that
we wanted to get out of the deal we would get two independent valuers and those
independent valuers
would give their valuation - one from Karin and one from me
- and we would come up with an average price that the property was worth.
<P>

	So whatever Karin put in the building she would get back, with interest.
Whatever the studio put in we would get back with interest.
 The building
society would be paid back and the net profit would be divided fifty fifty
between the two of us.
<P>

	Now, Karin had the first option.  If we wanted to get out of the deal she paid
us back according to that formula.  If we wanted
- if she didn't want to take
her option up we had first option by the same formula to buy the property.  If
neither of us wanted
to own the property we would put the property up for
public auction and we would split the money according to the deal.
<P>

	And when I said this, I told Karin this deal and she said - I said, "Do you
understand it?" and she said, "Yes, I understand it."
 And I said, "Do you
agree with this?  Do you want to do this?" and she said, "Yes, I am prepared to
do this, I agree and will do
it".
<P>

	She also said to me that she was going to try and raise some money of her own
to put into the project, but as it turned out she
couldn't.  She never - she
couldn't raise any more finances.
<P>

Q.	Is that it?
<P>

A.	That was the deal.
<P>

Q.	Well, let me ask you this --
<P>

A.	That was the financial deal.
<P>

Q.	What other deals were there?
<P>

A.	Well, there was now we would run the property.  We would look after the
management and the running of the building.  We would
pay the electrical bills,
the gas bills, the rates, the council rates --
<P>

Q.	This is a separate deal, is it?
<P>

A.	No, this is part of this deal.  It was just the running of the deal.
<P>

Q.	Could you just repeat what you said?  
<P>

A.	We would manage and run the building, the studio would.  Karin would live
somewhere in the building.  We would use sections of
the building as a
photographic studio.  We would ran and manage - we would pay the electrical
bills, the gas bills, the water rates,
the council rates as part of our
obligations.
<P>

Q.	Any other deals?
<P>

A.	No, I think - I mean, I might be forgetting some little point on it, but in
essence that was our arrangement and that was the
deal that Karin agreed to and
that is the deal, that is what we are arguing over essentially in a
nutshell.
<P>

Q.	You were concerned to acquire an interest in the land, weren't you?
<P>

A.	No, I was interested in - it was a financial deal that I made with Karin as
far as I was concerned.
<P>

Q.	Yes --
<P>

A.	Regarding the property.
<P>

Q.	It was a deal for ten years, wasn't it?
<P>

A.	We had the options for ten years, and then Karin had the options after
that.
<P>

Q.	It was a deal for ten years, wasn't it?
<P>

A.	No, it was a deal that we could get out of every two or three years.
<P>

Q.	What, at your --
<P>

A.	According to the formula I just stated.
<P>

Q.	So that you could do that at any time, could you?
<P>

A.	No, at the end of every two or three years.
<P>

Q.	So it would be wrong for me to say you could get out of it at any time.
When you could get out of it was every two or three years,
is that right?
<P>

A.	That's right, unless --
<P>

Q.	Well --
<P>

OBJECTION
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	Let him answer the question.
<P>

Q.	"Unless" - do you want to say something more?
<P>

A.	No, but in our deal it was every - we hadn't finalised the drafting of the
document.  We had agreed to the deal and Karin had
agreed to the deal.  We
hadn't finalised the documenting, putting it on paper, and that was a dilemma
for the next couple of years.
<P>

9	Catt did not deny the conversation, although she denied that she had run out
of money.  She said in those parts of paragraphs
32 and 33 of her affidavit of
26 February 1999 which were admitted in evidence and which might be an indirect
denial as follows:
<P>

32.	...  However, some time in about November 1995, the precise date of which I
cannot recall, I had a conversation with Jones at
26 Rainford Street to the
following effect:
<P>

<i>Jones:	I have been thinking about your plans for 3A and we may be able to
help each other.  I have got Tim (Robinson) complaining
that I haven't got
enough space for him and that I am renting the studio out to other
photographers when he should be using it. 
So why don't I help you finish it
off and rent it back off you at a reduced rate.  How does that sound?</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:	I will have to think about it.  I was going to live there
myself.</i>
<P>

<i>Jones:	Well you can live in when ever you like.  I will continue to teach
you and employ you as a photographer.  You can have access
to any of the
studios for your own work.</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:	I would still like to think about it.</i>
<P>

33.	I considered the offer ...  I approached Jones and we had a conversation to
the following effect:
<P>

<i>Catt:	I have thought about your offer.  Can I ask you what you had in
mind?</i>
<P>

<i>Jones:	I will pay to finish off the place in accordance with your plans and
turn it into two studios.  I will rent it back off you
and pay up to $500.00
per week for up to ten years.  I will continue to employ you as a photographer
throughout the term.</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:	I agree.</i>
<P>

10	There is no documentary evidence of the amount of the mortgage payments.
From mid-December 1995 the company paid to Catt $450
per week, Jones saying
that it amounted to three quarters of the mortgage payment of $650 per week.
In fact if the $650 figure was
right, the payments were less than 75%.  
<P>

11	Mr. Coombe was engaged in October 1995 to provide managerial and financial
consulting services to the company.  As I understand
the evidence this was a
full time position.  Coombe said that both Jones and Catt told him on many
occasions that the company was
investing in the property to turn it into
studios, that it was to pay her $450 per week which was three-quarters of the
mortgage
payment; that the company would have a one half share in the property
and use it as studios and Catt would live in the top deck accommodation.
 He
drew the first cheque for $450 on 29 November 1995.  He said that prior to
doing so Catt came to his office and the following
conversation took place:
<P>

<i>Catt:		You should call Patrick's contribution towards the 			mortgage
rent.</i>
<P>

<i>Coombe:		Why is that Karin?</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:		Because I need to negatively gear the property</i>.
<P>

<i>Coombe:		But Patrick has told me that this is a mortgage 			payment.</i>
<P>

<i>Catt:		What you call it will not affect Patrick's financial 			share in the
property.</i>
<P>

12	He said he continued to do this, that it was unlikely Jones saw the cheque
butts, and that he did what Catt told him as she was
obviously in a position of
power in the organisation.  The company claimed the outgoings of rent in its
tax returns.  Coombe did
not prepare these and was not prepared to admit that
he considered them carefully.  Jones has a serious reading problem and I am
satisfied he signed whatever was put in front of him by his accountants.  He
said that he did not know until the case commenced that
the cheque butts had
shown the payments to be payment for rent and that when he found out he
immediately gave instructions to the
company's accountants to file amended tax
returns.
<P>

13	The payments to Catt of $450 per week continued until March 1998.  Jones
said that Catt then said that she could not afford to
make the weekly payments
to the building society.  Mr. Coombe said that Catt told him that she wanted
him to pay the building society
direct and said "I want you to start paying my
building society directly.  You can take $200 per week out of my wages and add
that
to Patrick's contribution of $450 towards the mortgage to make a $650 per
week direct deposit."  Arrangements were then made to pay
$650 direct to an
account of Catt with the building society, which, as far as can be gleaned from
the inadequate evidence, was not
the mortgage loan account.  Whether by direct
payment or by subsequent payment by Catt the $450 at least is accepted as being
put
towards the mortgage repayments, although Catt said it remained properly
categorised as rent.  That continued until 2 July 1998 when
the employment of
Catt by the company came to an end.  For some two weeks thereafter reduced
payments of $450 were made because there
were no wages from which the $200
could be deducted.  Payments were not made after 15 July 1998 because,
according to Jones, Catt
had locked the company out of the property. 
<P>

14	Catt did not deny the conversation which Mr. Coombe said took place or the
evidence of Jones as to mortgage payments, until she
did so, in paragraph 13 of
an affidavit sworn the day the hearing commenced.  This was overlooked by
counsel for the plaintiff, which
is not surprising as the affidavit was in
reply to one of Jones sworn 16 March 1999.  It explains the stated reason for
not cross-examining
on the matter.  Mr. Coombe was cross-examined about this
but not shaken.  Although it is obvious enough that Mr. Coombe is not entirely
disinterested in view of his employment situation, I thought that he was an
acceptable witness.  I accept the evidence of Mr. Coombe
which I have set
out.
<P>

15	Catt does not suggest there was no conversation about the property or that
there was an initial agreement.  Her case is that
Jones or the company was to
pay to fit out the property and lease it at a reduced rent for ten years.  No
evidence was given as to
the true rental value in spite of this being the
subject of the cross-claim.
<P>

16	It is now necessary to see what happened between the end of 1995 and July
1998.  Jones met his bank manager on 21 November 1995
at the company's studios
at 26-28 Rainford Street, Surry Hills.  The bank manager was a Mr. Wilson.  He
gave evidence that Jones
had told him that he "was going to invest in a
property across the road" and had said "I'm going to take a share in the
property.
 I won't be on the title.  I'll have a financial share in return for
investing money in the place".  There was some further discussion
because Jones
needed additional finance from the bank to enable him to pay for the
renovations.  He told Mr. Wilson that for putting
money into the property and
contributing to the mortgage he would have a one half share in the property.
The bank did provide the
additional funding, but as it was already adequately
secured no further security was required.  On 24 April 1996, Mr. Jones made
a
request for some further funding saying that it had been decided to do
additional work on the property.  The first conversation
with the bank manager
was close to the time when Jones said agreement was reached.  His application
for a loan for the purposes claimed
was consistent with his claimed
arrangements.  It could not, I think, be referrable to the claim by Catt, that
all the company was
to get was a lease at a low rent.  Jones's evidence was
entirely consistent with that of the bank manager, namely that he said that
he
told Mr. Wilson that he would have a financial share in the property in return
for investing money in the place, but he would
not be on the title.  This
evidence is of course relevant to the claim of part performance, but it does at
least show conduct consistent
with the claimed oral agreement.
<P>

17	The proposed renovations to the property were substantially carried out
between January and June 1996.  It is admitted that the
plaintiff spent $121
032.55 on those renovations.  From then on the company used the premises from
time to time for studio space;
it stored equipment there; and from time to time
it let out space to other photographers, it keeping all the rent.  Catt for
most
of the time lived in separate accommodation in the premises.  Jones says
that from 1996 he was anxious to get the agreement documented.
 He said that he
was concerned that something might happen to Catt.  While it is not clear when
the first draft of a number of draft
agreements documenting the arrangements
was prepared, the significant thing about all those which are in evidence, -
whether they
were prepared by Jones or for him, or by Mr. Catt the defendant's
father, or by Mr. Alderson, a solicitor of Messrs. Gray &amp; Perkins,
who
became what the defendant described as her boyfriend during the period under
discussion, - is that they all proceeded on the
basis that the plaintiff had an
interest in the property and they all contain a provision as to how that
interest is to be calculated
if the property were sold or if the parties
brought it to an end in one way or another.  Mr. Alderson says that to a great
extent
the documents included the contentions of Jones rather than those of his
client Miss Catt.  He does accept however that Miss Catt
was his client and I
am unable to accept that claim at least so far as it went to attempt to
establish that the plaintiff had no
interest in the property.  Catt said she
always maintained the position that the arrangement was one of lease alone.
Were that the
position then there was no possible reason for Mr. Alderson
acting as Catt's solicitor in December 1997 to send to Jones four documents,
one of which set out the proposed term of the lease and another of which set
out a basis for establishing the interest of the company
in the property.  In
all the documents after that date a method of calculating the company's
interest is included.  Catt does not
accept any of the documents put in terms
the agreement reached.  Neither does Jones, although he says that one being
that on page
39 of exhibit A, came closest to setting out an agreement which,
although differing from that which he said was arrived at, was in
general terms
more or less acceptable to him.
<P>

18	In 1996 Jones was going overseas.  Catt was anxious that he should make a
will and in some haste he asked Mr. Alderson to prepare
a will for him.  Jones
says that he discussed his wishes with Catt about the future of the company and
its structure and that upon
Catt agreeing to be bound by those wishes, he went
ahead and made her the residuary beneficiary under the will.  The will included
a clause releasing Catt "from any and all debts owing to me at the date of my
death in connection with the property at 3A Rainford
Street, Surry Hills NSW
2010 and interest owing on any and all such debts".  Why this clause was
considered necessary as Catt was
a residuary beneficiary was never explained.
The significance however is that Mr. Alderson initiated its inclusion and thus
it seems
accepted that something other than rent was involved in the interest
of Jones in the property, but against that it is to be remembered
that in
making the will Mr. Alderson was acting as solicitor for Jones not solicitor
for Catt.
<P>

19	Perhaps not surprisingly in this case, which was full of emotion and
tension, the witnesses fell into two camps.  All of the
witnesses for the
plaintiff said that the defendant had always acknowledged or stated that the
plaintiff had an interest in the property;
some of them said that when
acknowledging this Catt had said she saw no need to document the interest.  On
the Jones side Aloma Trompp,
an administrative assistant for the plaintiff,
deposed in paragraph 15 of her affidavit of 3 November 1998 that Catt had said
to
her some time after February 1998:
<P>

<i>Catt:	I am sick.  I can't work.  I haven't eaten.  Why does Patrick want me
to sign anything about the money he put into the building.
 I want things to be
the way they were.  He knows he's got an interest in the building.  I've never
denied that.  My parents know
that.  Matthew (Alderson) knows that.  I just
don't want to sign anything.  We've had a verbal agreement up until now, so why
does
he want to change things.  Why didn't he tell me he went to Bali.  Please
talk to him for me.</i>
<P>

20.	She also said that on the evening of 29 June 1998, when it is accepted by
Jones that he agreed to settle the dispute on some
lesser terms than those to
which he claimed to be entitled, which were incorporated in a document which
was signed by him and on
which the defendant wrote "seen" but refused to sign,
she had gone with Jones to the property for that purpose as she described it,
"to reason with the defendant" and had said to the defendant "well just tell
Patrick what you really want before you are prepared
to put the agreement in
writing" to which the defendant had replied 
<P>

<i>Patrick you know I have never denied that you own half the property.  I'll
tell you what I want to sign a document.  I want you to
fire Mike Coombe, the
little fat pig.  I want a position of authority in the business.  I want first
option to buy the business and
the studios if you ever decide to sell and I
want it in writing.  I want it stated in a document, that can't be overturned
by a will,
that if you die the business and the studios will be mine.</i>
<P>

21	Tina Irving, who is a friend of the defendant and lived with her for a time
in Jones' property at 22-24 Rainford Street, Surry
Hills said that in late 1995
the defendant said to her "I've made an arrangement with Patrick.  He is going
to renovate 3A and help
with mortgage payments.  I'll be able to live there and
use the studio space.  He'll run a studio and will have a financial share
in
the property".
<P>

22	Timothy Robinson, a director of the company, said that he was aware that the
company had an interest in the property and was
aware that mortgage payments
were being made in respect of that property, but he did not know the
details.
<P>

23	Christopher Walsh, who is a photographer and who had at least for a time,
worked out of the plaintiff's studios, said that he
had discussions with both
Jones and Catt on separate occasions and Catt said words to the effect
"Patrick's my friend, but he keeps
on wanting to document his investment in my
building.  I'm not going to rip him off."
<P>

24	The defendant could not counter all this evidence with evidence her way.
For instance her father, who was an acceptable witness,
said that when he came
to Sydney the first time and made some notes which he transformed into a draft
agreement, he did so after
talking to both Jones and his daughter.  While he
went on to say the documents which he prepared or commented on were prepared
incorporating
information given to him by Jones, he did not suggest that his
daughter ever said to him that the arrangement which the parties had
come to
was a lease arrangement only.  The defendant tried to counter by saying that
her father was not doing what she wished but
what Jones wished and that this
had brought about a falling out with her parents.  In the same way it was
impossible for Mr. Alderson
to explain the documents which he drew up as
solicitor for the defendant, without accepting that there was some arrangement
for the
plaintiff company to have an interest in the property.
<P>

25	Mrs. Catt, the defendant's mother in oral evidence said on a number of
occasions that the agreement between Jones and her daughter
was a lease
agreement.  It is difficult if that was the position how she could have given
the serious attention which she says she
gave to the draft agreements passing
between the parties or their assistants.  I do not accept her evidence.
<P>

26	It is now necessary to find as a fact whether the conversation Jones said
took place did take place substantially as he claims.
 I find it did.  I accept
the evidence of Mr. Coombe, Miss Trompp and Miss Irving, which supports the
version of Jones.  I thought
they were all quite convincing witnesses.  The
texts of the written draft documents are all consistent with the claim and
impossible
to explain unless the plaintiff were to have an interest.  The only
evidence to support the defendant, apart from her own, is the
cheque butts
showing the payments as rent, the payments claimed as outgoings for rent in the
plaintiff's tax returns, and the fact
the payments were made to her not to the
mortgagee, although the later payments to her account direct counter this to
some degree.
 Once the evidence of Mr. Coombe is accepted this loses its force,
and whatever the conduct of the plaintiff in its tax affairs,
it is
insufficient to carry the day for the defendant.  I am satisfied that what
Jones told his bank manager was a proper explanation
of the arrangement to use
a neutral term.  No one other than Mrs Catt supports the defendant's story of
the lease arrangement.  It
is not impossible but highly unlikely a tenant would
pay an unknown amount for a fit out of premises, even for a long lease, where
the owner retained a say in the fit out and a right to occupy part of the
premises.  I accept that conversation relied upon took
place and I reject the
defendant's claim of an arrangement limited to a lease.
<P>

27	It is proper to add that neither Jones nor Catt was a convincing witness,
but I thought the poisonous relationship between them,
made obvious in court,
probably accounted for this lack of appeal.  But Jones was more convincing than
Catt.
<P>

28	Matters between the parties reached a critical point towards the end of June
1998.  I accept the evidence that Jones told the
defendant if she did not agree
to his final proposal then her employment would be at an end and in fact her
employment was terminated
shortly thereafter.  At a time when Jones had
encouraged the defendant to be absent from 3A, the plaintiff company, through
Jones
and with the aid of various of its employees arranged to remove all its
property from 3A and at the same time removed some of the
defendant's property,
although according to Jones, that has since been returned.  As the property
taken included all the kitchen
equipment and some of the bathroom fittings, I
do not think it could seriously be said that this equipment was not part of 3A.
The
kitchen equipment obviously amounted to built in fittings and the pedestal
basin in the bathroom was clearly a fixture.  The attempt
by Jones to lead
evidence to establish it was merely a photographic prop was pure nonsense.
<P>

29	On 3 July after the equipment had been removed by the plaintiff and his
company the defendant changed the locks on the property
and locked the
plaintiff company out.  The plaintiff continued to make the payments to the
defendant's account with the Newcastle
Building Society until 16 July when
those payments ceased.  As I have said the payments were reduced to $450.00
after the employment
of the defendant ceased.  The plaintiff company then
entered a caveat against the title to the property claiming an equitable
interest
in the land by virtue of "funds advanced by the caveator on behalf of
the registered proprietor to improve the land affected by the
caveat".  No
agreement was claimed to give entitlement to this interest.  During July there
was correspondence between the parties
as to the caveat and the plaintiff's
claim, some of which, although emanating from Messrs. Michael Evers &amp; Co,
was in fact drafted
by Mr. Alderson.  In any event the defendant, by letter
dated 8 July 1998, claimed that the plaintiff company had vacated and quit
her
premises and that even if it had not done so, she had terminated any right it
had to occupy the property.
<P>

30	Finally there is evidence of value of the property with the improvements at
various dates as follows:
<P>

		December 1995 and January 1996		$ 290 000
<P>

June 1996					$ 400 000
<P>

March 1998					$ 600 000
<P>

January 1999					$ 670 000
<P>

31	It is accepted that the improvements and restoration of the property was
more or less completed by June 1996 so that the increase
in value after that
date came about as a result of market forces and inflation.
<P>

<b>Pleadings</b>
<P>

32	The plaintiff's claim based on an agreement is set out paragraphs 3 to 6 of
the amended statement of claim as follows:
<P>

3.	In late 1995, the Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an agreement
("<b>Agreement"</b>)
<P>

<center><b>Particulars of Agreement</b></center>
<P>


<P>

	The Agreement was an oral agreement made between the Plaintiff and Defendant
as a result of discussions held between Patrick Jones,
on behalf of the
Plaintiff, and the Defendant that occurred in late 1995.
<P>

4.	The Plaintiff craves leave to refer to the Agreement as if fully set out
herein.
<P>

5.	The Agreement provided, inter alia, for the following three express
terms:
<P>

(a)	in consideration of the Plaintiff provided moneys to the Defendant to
enable the Defendant to improve the Property;
<P>

(b)	in consideration of the Plaintiff paying three-quarters of the Defendant's
loan repayment instalments of $650.00 per week in
respect of the loan obtained
by the Defendant to purchase the Property and  council rates and charges levied
on the Property to enable
the Defendant to acquire the Property;
<P>

(c)	in consideration of the Plaintiff occupying, preserving and administering
the Property,
<P>

	the Defendant would give to the Plaintiff a beneficial interest in the
Property that would be commensurate with the Plaintiff's
entitlement to the net
proceeds of sale of the Property calculated as follows:
<P>

(i)	$275,000.00, being the amount of the loan obtained by the Defendant to
purchase the Property, would be repaid as follows:
<P>

(a)	the outstanding balance due under the loan obtained by the Defendant to
purchase the Property would be repaid to the Newcastle
Permanent Building
Society Limited;
<P>

(b)	the Defendant would be repaid the contributions she made to the acquisition
of the Property, by way of paying one-quarter of
the weekly loan repayments of
$650.00, in reduction of the loan the Defendant obtained.
<P>

(c)	the Plaintiff would be repaid the contributions it made to the acquisition
of the Property, by way of paying three-quarters
of the weekly loan repayment
instalments of $650.00 and council rates and charges levied on the Property, in
reduction of the loan
the Defendant obtained.
<P>

(ii)	the Defendant would be repaid the sum of $30,000.00 which she expended on
the improvement of the Property:
<P>

(iii)	the Plaintiff would be repaid the sum of $121,032.55 which it expended on
the improvement of the Property;
<P>

(iv)	the Plaintiff and Defendant would each be paid interest on their
respective contributions made to the acquisition and improvement
of the
Property being contributions made by way of actual payments of money and in
particular contributions under paragraphs 5(i)(b),
5(i)(c), 5(ii) and 5(iii)
above;
<P>

(v)	the balance of the net increase in value of the Property since its purchase
by the Defendant would be paid to the Plaintiff
and Defendant in equal
shares,
<P>

<b>("Plaintiff's Interest")</b>
<P>

6.	The Agreement also included the following express terms:
<P>

(a)	the Plaintiff could elect to realise the Plaintiff's Interest in the
Property at its discretion (<b>"Election"</b>);
<P>

(b)	the Defendant would have a right of first option to purchase the
Plaintiff's Interest in the Property <b>"Defendant's Option"</b>);
<P>

(c)	in the event that the Defendant did not wish to exercise the Defendant's
Option, the Plaintiff would have a right of first option
to purchase the
Defendant's beneficial interest in the Property (<b>"Plaintiff's
Option</b>);
<P>

(d)	if neither party wished to exercise their respective option, the Property
would be sold at public auction and the proceeds would
be distributed according
to the Plaintiff's Interest in the Property and the Defendant's beneficial
interest in the Property as determined
pursuant to the express terms of the
Agreement pleaded above in paragraph 5.
<P>

33.	It is then pleaded that the plaintiff had performed its obligations by way
of part performance in making payments of $450 per
week; paying the costs of
improvements to the property; paying the outgoings on the property; that it had
occupied and preserved
the property having made payments which are now all
admitted of $121 032.55 for improvements, $59 888 for total weekly payments
each
of $450 and $4 517.38 for council rates and charges.  The plaintiff claims
that the defendant breached the agreement by changing
the locks on the property
and thereby locking the plaintiff out; that this breach was not accepted as a
repudiation but rather the
plaintiff affirmed the agreement and it claimed its
obligations to perform were suspended during the breach; that the plaintiff
exercised
the election thereby compelling the defendant to sell the property to
realise the plaintiff's interest in it.
<P>

34.	This was the main claim of the plaintiff.  The claim is put in a number of
alternative ways.  First that by the agreement the
defendant became trustee of
the plaintiff's interest, the agreement operating as an express oral trust;
second that there is an agreement
to create an express trust which should be
specifically enforced; third that the conduct of the plaintiff in paying the
admitted
sum of $185 437.93 towards the acquisition and improvement of the
property gave rise to a resulting trust or in the alternative a
constructive
trust under which the defendant holds the plaintiff's interest in the property
on trust for the plaintiff; fourth it
is claimed that the defendant has been
unjustly enriched to the extent of $185 437;  fifth it is claimed that the
defendant is estopped
from denying the plaintiff's beneficial interest in the
property because the plaintiff relied on the promises of the defendant and
assisted in the acquisition and improvement of the property, that but for those
promises and an expectation that the plaintiff would
acquire a beneficial
interest the plaintiff would not have paid the said amounts so that the
plaintiff is entitled to a beneficial
interest in the property commensurate
with its interest as pleaded, or in the alternative to a registered charge over
the property
to secure the amounts expended by the plaintiff.
<P>

35.	The plaintiff seeks an order extending the operation of the caveat and a
declaration that the defendant holds the property on
trust for the plaintiff to
the extent of the plaintiff's interest in it, together with an order that all
necessary documents and
deeds be executed to give effect to that interest, or
to enable that interest to be paid to the plaintiff.  Alternative declarations
and orders are sought to give effect to the alternative ways in which the
plaintiff's claim is put, such as a charge over the property,
restitution of
the sum of $185 437.93 for unjust enrichment or for damages for breach of trust
or for breach of the agreement.  It
is fair to say that it is not a claim which
is very clearly enunciated.
<P>

36.	The defendant (a) denies the agreement; (b) denies that the plaintiff took
any steps in part performance of the pleaded agreement
it being admitted that
various payments were made (and those payments claimed now having been admitted
since the trial began). The
defendant says that any moneys paid by the
plaintiff for improvement were expended by it for the purpose of fitting out
the property
for use by the plaintiff as photographic studios.  It is further
pleaded that the funds used for the purchase were provided as follows:
<P>

		Newcastle Permanent Building Society		$ 165 000.00
<P>

		sum borrowed from defendant's parents		$   68 500.00
<P>

		Defendant's own funds				<u>$   49 491.44</u>
<P>

									$ 282 991.44
<P>

37.	The defendant further says that if there were any agreement at all then by
abandoning the premises, removing the fixtures and
fittings without notice the
plaintiff repudiated the agreement.  There is a general denial of all the other
facts stated to give
rise to the alternative forms of relief, and finally the
defendant says that any agreement is void for uncertainty, but if there
were an
agreement it is an agreement dealing with an interest in land not in writing
and unenforceable under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.
<P>

38.	In ordinary circumstances one would have expected a reply of part
performance to the defences of lack of writing presumably
based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23</a> and s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s54a.html" class="autolink_findacts">54A</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, but nothing turns on that as part performance is
pleaded in the statement of claim in terms equally referable to a claim under
contract
or a claim to enforce a trust.  If these claims are otherwise made out
it is clear that the claimed acts of part performance are
made out.
<P>

39.	By way of cross-claim the defendant claims the difference between the
amount paid by the plaintiff for occupation and a fair
and commercial rent, and
further orders for removal of caveat, damages for breach of the agreement and
presumably for wrongful entering
of the caveat.
<P>

<b>Cross claim</b>
<P>

40.	It is convenient to deal with this matter first.  As there is no evidence
of the fair commercial rent for the property the cross-claimant's
claim for the
difference between the amount which she says was paid for occupation of the
property and a fair commercial rent would
have to be dismissed.  As to the
balance, if the plaintiff's claim for an interest in the property succeeds then
the caveat will
be left in place and if it fails the caveat will be removed.
If the caveat is removed then as there is no evidence of any damage
sustained
by the plaintiff as a result of the caveat there does not appear to be any
basis for a reference to the Master to inquire
into damages sustained as a
result of the caveat being wrongly entered, but I would be prepared to hear
further argument on that
aspect.
<P>

<b>Is the pleaded agreement proved?</b>
<P>

41.	The simple answer to this is no.  The reasons for this are as follows:
<P>

A.	Jones and therefore the plaintiff understood that the defendant would occupy
part of the property;
<P>

B.	The plaintiff assumed and the agreement pleaded was predicated upon the
assumption that the whole of the purchase moneys were
provided by the building
society, which was not the case.  The agreement appears to be based on the
requirement to pay $650 per week
to the building society.  There is no proof
that this was the weekly amount due to it.
<P>

C.	The amounts of $30 000 and $121 032.55 which it is pleaded would be repaid
to the parties were unknown or certainly the latter
figure was unknown when any
agreement was made.
<P>

D.	It was not necessarily the balance of the net increase in value which on the
evidence was to be divided between the parties,
although that may not be
significant.
<P>

E.	The agreement as pleaded included a term that the plaintiff could elect to
realise its interest in the property at its discretion.
 That is the election
the plaintiff has purported to exercise.  The evidence was, according to Jones,
that the option could be exercised
every two or three years.
<P>

F.	Jones said that it was a term that the agreement as to occupation would last
for ten years unless terminated in the meantime.
<P>

An agreement in accordance with the pleaded terms is not made out on the
evidence.
<P>

<b>Was there a binding agreement which was not in accordance with the pleaded
agreement?</b>
<P>

42.	The answer to this question would depend upon whether the words in the
affidavit of Mr. Jones, which I have set out, as restated
by him in
cross-examination in the passage set out, constitute a binding agreement.
<P>

43.	The fact that I have accepted the evidence of the plaintiff and his
witnesses does not in itself make out the plaintiff's case
on the agreement
which was denied on the pleadings.  It is necessary to decide whether or not
there was an enforceable agreement
with the required certainty and consensus as
to terms, - leaving aside for the moment the question of any requirement for
writing.
 I have come to the conclusion that there was no concluded agreement
because there is too much uncertainty as to its terms.  The
agreement put
forward by Jones was made on the basis:  (a) that the whole of the purchase
price of $270 000 or $275 000 was borrowed
from Newcastle Building Society; (b)
that the weekly payment due under the building society mortgage was $650; (c)
that $450 was
three quarters of that weekly payment; (d) that there was an
option to terminate every two or three years, but subject to that the
"deal"
would last for ten years; (e) that by the time the agreement was made the
defendant had put in $30 000; (f) that each party
would get back on termination
their contributions (not borrowed sums) with interest, that the building
society would  be repaid the
balance of the $270 000 loan and the balance would
be shared equally.
<P>

44.	The sum of $165 000 was raised on the security of the property; $68 500 was
borrowed from the defendant's parents; some further
sum was more likely than
not raised by the defendant on the security of another property in Newcastle,
but this is not clearly established.
 $450 per week is not three quarters of
$650; the payments were never made direct to the building society and there is
no evidence
of the weekly payments due to it.  It was never envisaged by the
plaintiff that moneys had been borrowed from the defendant's parents,
and until
Mrs. Catt gave evidence there did not appear to have been any understanding
that any borrowings made from her and her husband
might have been repaid,
although it seems there have been substantial repayments.  There was no
agreement about how this was to be
dealt with nor that it had to be dealt with
nor any agreement or understanding as to the interest rate to be charged on the
parents'
loan funds or on contributions, nor whether so far as improvements are
concerned interest was to be charged as payments were made
or after completion
occurred; nor so far as the weekly payments were concerned whether interest was
to run from the date of each
payment.  The pleaded agreement contained a right
to terminate at the plaintiff's discretion; the agreement put forward in
evidence
gave the right to terminate to the plaintiff every two or three years.
That difference between 2 or 3 years in itself is too great
to be left
uncertain for such an important right even without the uncertainty of the
commencement date.  It is an essential term
but an uncertain one.  The
plaintiff has purported to terminate or to exercise its right to elect to
terminate by its pleading in
the amended statement of claim filed on 31 August
1998 and not otherwise.  Nothing else has been put forward.  It is not
suggested
that this was done in accordance with a right to do so every two or
three years.  In fact in the original statement of claim filed
on 24 August
1998, but signed and verified on 20 August 1998, the plaintiff claimed the
defendant had repudiated the agreement by
locking the plaintiff out and
purported to accept such repudiation and to terminate for breach.  In the
amended statement of claim
the plaintiff claims breach by locking out, no
acceptance of this breach as a repudiation, affirmation by the plaintiff of the
agreement
and election to terminate.  Whether it was open to the plaintiff to
adopt these contrary positions was not argued.  The significance
is that the
election relied upon by the plaintiff does not accord with the agreements set
up by the affidavit and oral evidence of
Mr. Jones.  Thus the pleaded contract
is not supported by the evidence; the evidence does not establish with
sufficient certainty
the terms of any oral contract different from the pleaded
contract; there was a lack of consensus on important matters; and the basis
on
which the election is said to have been exercised does not accord with the
entitlement set up in evidence.
<P>

45.	The claims that the defendant holds the property on trust in accordance
with the terms of the claimed agreement, namely for
herself and the plaintiff
on those terms, and the claim for specific performance of an agreement to hold
the property on those trusts
should be dismissed.
<P>

<b>Claim for a resulting or constructive trust</b>
<P>

46.	In dealing with these claims it is necessary to understand that when the
plaintiff's "interest" is referred to in the pleadings,
that is the interest
which is defined in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim, which I have set
out.
<P>

47.	The claim for a resulting or constructive trust is set out in paragraph 21
of the amended statement of claim as follows:
<P>

21.	In the alternative, and in the premises, the conduct of the Plaintiff in
paying the amount of $185,437.93 to the Defendant and
the Defendant's conduct
in applying it towards the acquisition and improvement of the Property gave
rise to a resulting trust or,
in the alternative, a constructive trust, under
which the Defendant, as Trustee, holds the Plaintiff's Interest in the Property
in
trust for the Plaintiff's benefit.
<P>

<center><b>	Particulars of Resulting Trust or Constructive
Trust</b></center>
<P>


<P>

	The Plaintiff's conduct in paying money to the Defendant for the acquisition
of the Property (namely, the payment of three-quarters
of the weekly loan
repayment instalments and council rates and charged [sic] levied on the
Property pleaded above) and for the improvement
of the Property (namely, for
the renovation of the Property) which totals $185,437.93.
<P>

In fact the sum paid for improvements was paid over a time and payments which
for the most part were made direct to contractors
and suppliers, and not to the
defendant.
<P>

48.	It is not really easy to see on the pleadings how the claim for a resulting
trust would arise on the basis there set out, but
it was submitted in address
that the defendant held an interest in the property on resulting trust for the
plaintiff the proportionate
interest being either (1) the fraction arising with
the numerator as 120 032 representing the dollar value of improvements and the
denominator being 400 000 by the value of the property with the improvements
complete; or (2)  the fraction with the numerator being
185 437 being the
dollar value of all contributions of the plaintiff and 600 000 being the dollar
value of the property when the
agreement came to an end.  
<P>

49.	It is not suggested the plaintiff contributed to the purchase price.
Unless some binding agreement were proved, which it has
not been, no resulting
trust as to some proportionate share in the property could arise from payments
for improvement or payment
of mortgage obligations.  The presumption as to
resulting trust arises upon payment of or contribution to the purchase price
not
otherwise <b><cite>Calverley v Green</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20155%20CLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 155 CLR 242</a> at
252.
<P>

50.	So far as the claim for a constructive trust for the same interest is
concerned, as I have explained and found that interest
is too uncertain to be
established.  If there was no agreement which would give rise to an express
trust on the certain terms then
I do not consider a constructive trust could be
imposed to give effect to the same uncertain terms.  The argument for the
imposition
of a constructive trust was more widely stated in submissions than
pleaded and I will deal with this under the claim for a charge.
<P>

<b>Claim for unjust enrichment and claim based on estoppel</b>
<P>

51.	The particulars of the unjust enrichment claim state that if the plaintiff
does not recover "the plaintiff's interest" in the
property then the plaintiff
will have received nothing for payment of the sum of $185 437.  The difficulty
with this claim is that
is not the fact because there can be no doubt that the
plaintiff company did have the benefit of use and occupation of a substantial
part of the property for a period of two years.  Not only that, but the
plaintiff did receive some payments of rent for the property
during that period
and kept those rent payments for itself. 
<P>

52.	Much the same difficulty applies to the claim that the plaintiff is
estopped from denying the plaintiff has a beneficial interest
in the property
commensurate with the plaintiff's interest as pleaded.  I have found that it
was intended by both parties and agreed
by the defendant that the plaintiff
would have some interest in the property.  The difficulty is that the extent of
that interest
was never agreed.  The claim based on estoppel relied on the
pleaded agreement which was not made out.
<P>

<b>Claim for a charge</b>
<P>

53.	This claim was really put under the estoppel and constructive trust heads
but submissions were made on it as a separate claim
and I consider it proper to
deal with it on that basis.  If an amendment were required to the statement of
claim for that purpose
I would allow it. 
<P>

54.	It was intended by the parties and agreed by the defendant that the
plaintiff would have some interest in the property, the
terms of which were not
agreed upon.  There is a further difficulty because while the plaintiff claims
that part of the agreement
was that it would occupy preserve and administer the
property the plaintiff company did actually vacate the property, Mr. Jones
having
formed the view that when the defendant failed to sign some document
evidencing his interest then he was best advised to remove all
the plaintiff's
property from those premises.  The plaintiff acted as it did in making
payments, upon the representations or agreements
of the defendant that it would
have an interest in the property, and it would be entirely unconscionable to
allow Catt to deny any
interest.  Contributions of a particular nature clearly
paid on the statements of the defendant that they would give rise to an
interest
in the property clearly raise an equity in the plaintiff which must be
satisfied.  <b><cite>Chalmers v Pardoe</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20WLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 WLR 677.</a>  However, I
do not think the position arises where it is either proper or necessary to
construe a trust, to give effect in equity
to the plaintiff's claim.  That is
so, particularly having regard to the uncertainty as to the source of all the
purchase moneys,
the intentions had the facts been known, and the uncertain
evidence as to the current state of the loans entered into for the purpose
of
paying those purchase moneys.  As has been most recently pointed out in
<b><cite>Giumelli v Giumelli</cite></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 10</a> at 10 once it is decided
that there is an equity in the plaintiff which ought to be satisfied the
question then is to decide whether
or not there is an appropriate remedy which
falls short of the imposition of a trust.  See also <b><cite>Morris v
Morris</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 61</a> at 64; <b><cite>Baumgartner v
Baumgartner</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%202%20NSWLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 2 NSWLR 406</a> at 419 (approved in
<b><cite>Giumelli</cite></b>). I consider in this case, in view of the
uncertainty, and the determination of the agreement, the appropriate remedy is
the imposition
of a charge over the property in favour of the plaintiff to
secure the sum spent on the renovations and the contributions towards
the
monthly repayments and rates together with interest.  So far as the sum of $121
032 is concerned as it was paid at various times
and in different amounts after
December 1995 and mostly before June 1996.  The plaintiff has only sought
interest from 1 July 1996
and it is reasonable to allow interest on the full
amount from that date as that will balance in a reasonable way those payments
made before that date and those payments made after that date.  The weekly
payments of $450 should each carry interest at the prescribed
rate from the
date of payment until 16 July 1998.  Thereafter interest should be calculated
at the prescribed rate on the full amount
of $59 888.  To avoid any problems of
calculation I will hear argument on whether a proper result as to this interest
calculated
can be achieved as it is in Common Law actions, by allowing interest
at the prescribed rate on one half of the $59 888 from 29 November
1995 until
16 July 1998 and the parties can then make the necessary calculations for a
figure up to a date when final orders can
be made.  I will also hear argument
as to when interest should commence on the sum of $4 517.30.  I would then
propose to make an
order that the total of the amount including interest,
together with prescribed interest be paid to the plaintiff within two months;
that the property be subject to a charge in favour of the plaintiff to secure
that sum, that there be liberty to apply to enforce
the charge and that the
caveat be withdrawn upon payment of the amount of the charge.  I will hear any
argument on costs on that
day.  The cross-claim should be dismissed.
