<P>

	<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff Simon Stuart Brierley instituted proceedings in this Court to
recover damages for horrendous injuries sustained
by him on or about 7 December
1994.  Shortly stated, the plaintiff dived into a swimming pool in the common
area of premises occupied
by the defendant/first cross-claimant and became a
quadriplegic.
<P>

2	Pursuant to orders made by me on 25 August 1997 arrangements were made for
evidence to be taken in London.  
<P>

3	Prior to the commencement of the hearing as between the plaintiff and the
defendant, his action was settled.  In the meantime
a series of cross-claims
have been instituted, and on 21 and 22 October 1997 evidence was given by the
plaintiff and a Ms Addelsee
on the issue of liability.  The matter was then
stood over for a date to be fixed for the resolution of the cross-claims in
Sydney.
<P>

4	The defendant/first cross-claimant seeks to amend its cross-claim against the
cross-defendant (Bright &amp; Duggan Pty Limited)
and its Seventh Cross-Claim
against PMA Electrical Pty Limited (trading as Accurate Pools Pty Limited).
<P>

5	The proposed amendments cover two matters:  first, the compromise reached as
between the plaintiff and the defendant/cross-claimant
and the compromise
reached between the cross-claimant and the second cross-defendant (Meriton
Apartments Pty Limited);  the second
and more critical component of the
proposed amendments is made up of allegations of what is said to be new matters
relating to breaches
of agreement and negligence as between the cross-claimant
and the first cross-defendant and as between the cross-claimant and the
seventh
cross-defendant.
<P>

6	The relevant amendments sought as against the first cross-defendant are in
the following terms:
<P>

	<i>"(f)	Failing to have installed in the pool prior to the plaintiff's
accident, a sign warning against diving into the shallow end of
the pool, a
sign clearly displaying the depth of water at that end, in a position in which
it would be visible to persons such as
the plaintiff using the pool, failing to
ensure that the water in the pool was kept clear and clean so that the depth
was discernible,
failing to ensure that depth signs were installed on both
sides of the pool at reasonable intervals, failing to ensure that such
depth
signs as had been installed in the pool, were in place at all relevant times,
failing to appreciate the risk of injury to persons
using the pool by reason of
the illusion of depth created by reflection of columns in the pool water, and
failing to ensure that
a line, mural or other similar device was installed on
the pool floor so as to provide a visual reference.</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)	Failing to warn the cross-claimant of a risk of injury to users of the
pool, especially those frequently found in the building,
who were inexperienced
with indoor pools and swimming generally and in particular diving in indoor
pools, from the deficiencies in
the pool referred to in the preceding
paragraphs".</i>
<P>

7	It also alleged in paragraph 13 of the proposed Amended First Cross-Claim
that "<i>the cross-defendant was guilty of negligence causing or contributing
to the plaintiff's injuries"</i>, reliance being placed on the allegations in
the plaintiff's Statement of Claim and the particulars of breach which are
sought to
be amended as set out above.
<P>

8	The proposed amendments to the Seventh Cross-Claim include an allegation in
paragraph 4, which has not hitherto been pleaded,
as follows:
<P>

	<i>"4.	On the same date, the Seventh Cross-Claimant further agreed with the
seventh cross-defendant, that the seventh cross-defendant
would inspect, repair
and maintain as necessary the pool machinery and equipment and would ensure
that the pool waters were provided
with suitable chemical treatment so that as
far as reasonably possible those waters were safe and suitable for
swimming.</i>
<P>

9	Paragraph 5:
<P>

	<i>"The agreement for the provision of advice in relation to the swimming pool
referred to in paragraph 3 was understood by the Seventh
Cross-Claimant and the
seventh cross-defendant to mean that the seventh cross-defendant would advise
the Seventh Cross-Claimant as
to whether the swimming pool was so designed and
constructed and its signage was such, as to meet the Seventh Cross-Claimant's
liabilities
both criminal and civil in respect of use of the pool and so as to
ensure that the Seventh Cross-Claimant would comply with its duty
of care to
users of the pool".</i>
<P>

10	Paragraph 7:
<P>

	<i>"Pursuant to an agreement referred to in paragraph 3A, the seventh
cross-defendant commenced to maintain repair and replace as necessary
the pool
equipment and machinery and in purported performance of the agreement commenced
to provide chemical treatment of the pool
water".</i>
<P>

11	Amended particulars of breach are as follows:
<P>

	<i>"(c)	Failure to have installed in the pool prior to the plaintiff's
accident, a sign warning against diving into the shallow end of
the pool, a
sign clearly displaying the depth of water at that end in a position in which
it would be visible to persons such as
the plaintiff using the pool, failing to
ensure that the water in the pool was kept clear and clean so that the depth
was discernible,
failing to ensure that depth signs were installed on both
sides of the pool at reasonable intervals, failing to ensure that such
depth
signs as had been installed in the pool were in place at all relevant times,
failing to appreciate the risk of injury to persons
using the pool by reason of
the illusion of depth created by reflection of columns in the pool water, and
failing to ensure that
a line, mural or other similar device was installed on
the pool floor so as to provide a visual reference.</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	Failing to warn the cross-claimant of a risk of injury to users of the
pool, especially those frequently found in the building,
who were inexperienced
with indoor pools and swimming generally and in particular diving in indoor
pools, from the deficiencies in
the pool referred to in the preceding
paragraphs".</i>
<P>

12	Both proposed Amended Cross-Claims are opposed by the respective
cross-defendants;  it was agreed that I could deal with the
application to
amend by way of written submissions only. 
<P>

13	The first cross-defendant in opposition to the application for the amendment
refers to the commencement of proceedings in 1995,
the giving of directions
relating to that hearing in London, the commencement date for the hearing in
London on 21 October 1997,
and the settlement of the proceedings as between the
plaintiff and the cross-claimant.
<P>

14	The evidence the plaintiff and the other witness gave in London was directed
to the physical surrounds of the swimming pool in
which the plaintiff suffered
his injury and of observations made of that area the pool itself and of the
plaintiff's actions immediately
before diving.  The cross-examination of the
plaintiff was directed to his actions at about the time he dived and he was
cross-examined
about his actions on the hypothesis that particular signs were
present.  He was not cross-examined about depth signs at reasonable
intervals
nor was the question of reasonable intervals between any such signs explored
with him.  It is contended that had there
been assertions as to the precise
positioning of signs, the ambit of cross-examination of the plaintiff and his
witness by the first
cross-defendant may well have been different.
<P>

15	Furthermore, there was no cross-examination, so it is contended, as to the
effect, if any, of lines, murals or other devices
on the pool floor by way of
visual references;  the plaintiff's experience as a diver was not explored
properly.
<P>

16	No explanation is offered in support of the application to amend by the
first cross-claimant other than the recent obtaining
by it of an expert opinion
by Mr Farmer whose ability to give assistance on the issue is said only to have
come to the notice of
the cross-claimant after the conclusion of the hearing in
London.  It was not available to the cross-claimant at that time.  Until
the
amendments sought were proposed the whole thrust of the cross-claimant against
the first cross-defendant was put on a different
basis and related more to the
failure to instruct others to perform tasks which would have rendered the pool
safe.  This idea is
further developed by Mr Deakin Q.C. in his submissions on
behalf of the Seventh Cross-Claimant.
<P>

17	The first cross-defendant, it is said, would be prejudiced by the allowing
of the amendments when the opportunity to explore
the substance of the
allegations further with the plaintiff and other witnesses in cross-examination
has passed and where those persons
are geographically distant and the costs of
obtaining further evidence to enable the first cross-defendant fully to
litigate the
new issues, would be extraordinarily high.  Further, any
suggestion by the cross-claimant that the proposed amendments are but by
way of
"<i>expansion</i>" can be taken as an acknowledgment that they are really the
"<i>same</i>" and the necessity for amendment does not arise.  If the new
amendments in fact relate to different facts, they have not been tested
because
they were not raised before October 1997 and no explanation has been given as
to why that is so.
<P>

18	It is suggested by the first cross-defendant that in the event of leave to
amend being granted and the amendments being made,
a term of the grant of leave
should be that the cross-claimant pays, on an indemnity basis, and in advance,
any costs to be incurred
by the first cross-defendant in having once again, to
go to London to take further evidence from the plaintiff who has been excused
and from any other witnesses.
<P>

19	The submissions for the seventh cross-defendant focus upon the paragraphs
(c) and (d) which I have set out above "<i>as particulars of breach of
agreement</i>".
<P>

20	At the time of the London hearing the Seventh Cross-Claim asserted certain
breaches of agreement and particulars of negligence
which can be summarised as
follows:  "<i>in relation to the breaches of the agreement, breach in respect
of advising that the pool was in legal compliance and advising that
the pool
was safe for use".  </i>With respect to negligence, the case of breach related
to failure to warn or advise that the pool required improved lighting, improved
signage, warnings, depth indicators, failing to warn or advise that the pool
was constructed of unsafe and unsuitable materials,
not kept clear or clean,
failing to advise how to make the pool safe and failing to make the pool
safe.
<P>

21	It is said that the proposed further amendments to the Seventh Cross-Claim
assert new particulars of breach of agreements in
sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) to
the following effect:  failing to install a sign warning against diving into
the shallow end;  failing
to install a visible depth sign at the shallow end;
failing to install other depth signs at intervals on both sides of the pool;
failing to ensure that installed signs remained in place;  failing to ensure a
line or such like was installed on the pool floor.
 The particulars further
allege, so it is said, failure to "<i>appreciate the risk of injury to persons
using the pool by reason of the illusion of depth created by reflections of
columns in the
pool water"</i> and failure to warn the proprietors of the
strata plan of risk of injury to users of the pool who were inexperienced with
indoor
pools, swimming and diving into indoor pools.
<P>

22	It is argued that in circumstances were evidence has already been heard, not
only from the plaintiff but also from the one other
eye witness to the accident
in the course of the hearing in London, the Court would not at this stage
permit any amendment to the
allegations made against the party (the seventh
cross-defendant) in circumstances where to allow such an amendment would or
could
be prejudicial to that party.  It is to be observed, so it is argued,
that the thrust of the allegations initially made against the
seventh
cross-defendant was to the effect that in its dealings with Amanda White, who
was employed by Bright &amp; Duggan Pty Limited
the fourth and fifth
cross-claimants, as the Building Manager for the strata block, the seventh
cross-defendant had failed to proffer
to her appropriate advice and warnings in
respect of the pool.  Such a case is materially and significantly different to
the case
which is now sought to be raised against the cross-defendant.  That
material difference arises in respect of the new allegations
referred to above
and it is to be observed that the allegations aginst the seventh
cross-defendant now seek to assert a duty on its
part to carry out actual work
on the swimming pool in the respects specified going beyond the broad
allegations previously raised
in respect of advice and/or warnings which, it is
said, should have been giving to Ms White.
<P>

23	To permit such amendments at this stage would be manifestly prejudicial to
the seventh cross-defendant because the raising of
such allegations obviously
would have required the eye witnesses to be questioned not only in respect of
what observations of the
pool they had made and of its surrounds at the time of
the plaintiff's injuries, but more importantly, what effect such signs,
warnings
and alterations to the pool, which are now alleged against the seventh
cross-defendant may have had on the plaintiff, particularly
in making his
decision to dive into the swimming pool from the position in which he did (see
<b><i>The Public Trustee v Sutherland Shire Council </i></b>(1992) Aust Torts
Report 81-149 per Gleeson CJ at 61,140).
<P>

24	If the seventh cross-defendant had previously been aware of any allegation
against it that it was required to take positive steps
to remove or reduce the
danger of the plaintiff injuring himself, as opposed to advising or warning Ms
White of the requirement that
such steps be taken by other parties, it would
clearly have been necessary for questions going to the issue of causation to be
asked,
at least, of the plaintiff.
<P>

25	The new allegations raise new matters in respect of the appearance of the
pool water and an illusion of depth apparently created
by reflections in the
water.  The same submissions are made in respect of this discrete new
allegation.  The seventh cross-defendant
would again have required questions to
be asked of all eye witnesses as to whether or not any observation was made
about any such
reflections or any such illusion of depth on the relevant
occasion when they were present at the pool.
<P>

26	Although the failure to warn case had previously been particularised, the
allegation sought to be made against the seventh cross-defendant
in respect to
failing to warn the proprietors of the strata plan of risk of injury to users
of the pool who were inexperienced is
an allegation of particularity in
relation to persons "<i>inexperienced with indoor pools, swimming and diving
into indoor pools</i>".  This new allegation, if made at the appropriate time,
would have required questions to be asked of the plaintiff and his companions
in respect of their experience with indoor pools.  The seventh cross-defendant
again submits that to allow the amendment at this
stage of the proceedings
would give rise to prejudice in reality incurable otherwise than by the
enormous expense involved in reconstituting
a hearing in London to take further
evidence from the plaintiff and lay witnesses. 
<P>

27	The seventh cross-defendant also makes the point that no compelling reason
is put forward by the cross-claimant as to why it
could not have made these
particular allegations before the hearing was conducted in London.  No
explanation is given as to why Mr
Farmer could not have been retained before
the hearing in London.
<P>

28	The new allegations involve the perceptions and experience of people who
have returned to the United Kingdom.  In no practical
or realistic sense can
they now be asked about their experience of indoor pools and diving into them,
or about whether the reflection
of the columns caused an illusion of depth to
them unless great expense and inconvenience is incurred.
<P>

29	A submission is also made that the allegation relating to failure to
"<i>appreciate the risk of injury to persons using the pool by reason of the
illusion of depth ...</i>", in any event is incapable of supporting any
allegation of breach of the agreement.
<P>

30	The cross-claimant by reference to the proposed amendments in (f) and (g)
set out earlier in these reasons asserts that as to
the depth signs, the
original form of cross-claim referred to the absence of a depth sign by
reference to the plaintiff's Statement
of Claim which alleged absence of
adequate signs, warnings and adequate indication of depth.  It is said that the
proposed allegation
merely "<i>enlarges</i>" on this.  The reason is the
obtaining of the opinion from Mr Farmer.
<P>

31	Mr Hewitt refers to the fact that in the course of giving evidence in
London, the plaintiff gave evidence in cross-examination
by Mr Gleeson Q.C. for
the defendant (at T8-9):
<P>

	<i>"Mr Gleeson:	Did you, before you dived into the pool, see any signs saying
`No Diving'?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	No; they were not in evidence.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	If you had seen a sign saying `No Diving', would you have dived
in?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	From the area where you dived, did you see any sign indicating the depth
of the pool?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	If you had seen a sign indicating a depth of 0.8 of a metre, would you
have dived into the pool?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	Not someone of my size, no;  that's not a lot of water.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	When you say not someone of your size, what is your size.</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	I was 6 foot 5.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	You mentioned to Mr Murray, I think, that you could not see the bottom
of the pool?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	So you did not see any markings on the bottom?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	There was nothing to give an indication of depth of the bottom of the
pool, no.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	You used the word `cloudy'.  Can you elaborate on what you mean by
that?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	In such that it was cloudy;  it was as if the water was not very clear,
in a sense that it seemed to have something in it.  It
either was not filtered
very well, or there seemed to be some substance in there to indicate that this
was not clean water".</i>
<P>

32	The first cross-defendant did not cross-examine on this.
<P>

33	As to the illusion of depth, Dr Adams report which was exhibit `A' and which
had been served prior to the hearing in London,
referred to this concept at
page 8 and is referred to in the plaintiff's evidence in cross-examination by
Mr McCulloch for the first
cross-defendant as set out above (page 11), during
re-examination by Mr Murray Q.C.:  
<P>

	<i>"Q.	I have just one thing.  You answered Mr McCulloch by saying that you
thought the pool was of uniform depth?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	Why did you think that?</i>
<P>

	<i>MR DEAKIN:	I object.</i>
<P>

	<i>HIS HONOUR:	I will allow it.</i>
<P>

	<i>MR DEAKIN:	As your Honour pleases.</i>
<P>

	<i>WITNESS:	As I said, my girlfriend was at one end of the pool. It was deep
enough to submerse her - six foot.  Upon looking at the
pool before diving in,
you could not see the bottom.  Now, if you cannot see the bottom of a pool, it
is pretty reasonable that it
is deep enough.  That has been my experience in
the past.  If you cannot see the bottom, through any water, it is because it
has
depth.</i>
<P>

	<i>Now with hindsight, I know that depth was false because of the impression I
was given by the lighting and the quality of the water.
 But that is about it,
you know.</i>
<P>

	<i>MR MURRAY:	Thank you".</i>
<P>

34	The proposed paragraph 10(g) of the Amended Cross-Claim effects an
enlargement of the existing allegations only by reference
to persons who are
inexperienced in pools of this kind and the plaintiff gave evidence about his
inexperience in indoor pools at
pages 18 and following of the transcript of 21
October 1997, in the course of cross-examination by Mr McCulloch.
<P>

35	It is said that the first cross-defendant would or should have known in any
event, that the home unit block in question was used
by backpackers and
overseas visitors.
<P>

36	In relation to the opposition raised by the seventh cross-defendant to the
proposed amendments, the same submissions in effect
are made in support of the
application.
<P>

37	It is said that if the cross-claimant's allegations against the seventh
cross-defendant are proved, the cross-defendant was a
visitor to the building
from time to time who should have become aware of the types of persons using it
and that its location further
increased the likelihood of such usage (such a
proposition, I assume, being advanced, for amongst other reasons, as indicating
that
there be no prejudice in relation to any want of evidence from the
plaintiff or lay witnesses who would otherwise have been questioned
in relation
to any such issue in London).
<P>

38	In the end I am not persuaded by the articulated matters in opposition to
the amendment that the amendment should not be made.
 Upon analysis I am not
persuaded that there would be any need, upon the grant of the amendment, for
further cross-examination of
the plaintiff or any other lay witness in relation
to these issues;  they appear to have been covered in the evidence generally.
The further litigation of these issues before me will, of course, be more
directly under the control of the operation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, 1995
and in a practical sense, if there exists then any prejudice it might be dealt
with appropriately.  It is desirable that all
issues between the parties be
litigated as a matter of general principle and I see no reason to disallow the
amendment.
<P>

39	The illusion of depth, the experience of the plaintiff, certainly have been
covered by evidence hitherto and the nature of the
amendment of the cross-claim
as against the seventh cross-defendant in terms of any shift from mere warning
to a duty to do specific
things, seems to me, to be amenable to evidence that
would be called in Sydney in any event.
<P>

40	What may be described as the "<i>protest</i>" at this late application in
the context of the subsequent provision of the report relied upon the
cross-claimant of Mr Farmer is
fair but not determinative of the outcome of the
cross-claimant's application.
<P>

41	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	I grant leave to the cross-claimant to amend its cross-claims as against the
first cross-defendant and the seventh cross-defendant.
<P>

2.	The first cross-claimant is to file and serve its Amended Cross-Claim
against each of the first cross-defendant and seventh cross-defendant
within 7
days.
<P>

3.	Each of the first and seventh cross-defendant's is to file its Amended
Defences to the Amended Cross-Claims within 7 days thereafter.
<P>

4.	The cross-claimant is to pay the costs occasioned to the first
cross-defendant and the seventh cross-defendant by the grant of
leave to
amend.
<P>

5.	The first cross-defendant and seventh cross-defendant are to pay the costs
of the cross-claimant's application to amend.
<P>
