<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>WINDEYER J</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY 23 SEPTEMBER 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>3916/99 IAN FRANCIS YATES V NICHOLAS WHITLAM &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  This action is part of the continuing contest
between those who support in general the demutualisation of NRMA
Insurance
Limited (Insurance) and those who oppose it.
<P>

<b>FACTS</b>
<P>

2   	As is widely known, at least in New South Wales, there is
at present in progress an election of directors of NRMA Limited which
I will
call NRMA.  That company is the ultimate owner of Insurance.  NRMA has sixteen
directors.  Each two years, eight directors
retire from office and an election
is held for the eight vacant places.  The election is held by postal ballot.
For the present election
the voting opened on 6 August 1999 and will conclude
on 6 October 1999.
<P>

3   	The defendants are standing for election as a team on a
team ticket called "The Members First Team".  Messrs Coyne, Sanchez
and Shaw
are not existing directors; the other five defendants are.
<P>

4   	On 5 September 1999 there was published in the Sun Herald
newspaper the following advertisement:
<P>

<center><b>THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE</b>
<P>

<b>NRMA ROAD SERVICE;</b>
<P>

<b>PUT MEMBERS FIRST.</b></center>
<P>


<P>

If you like the idea of NRMA Road Service staying a mutual, whilst also giving,
the organisation shares worth at least $250 million*
<P>

(and yearly income), vote for the Members First Team.
<P>

<center>Your vote will provide:</center>
<P>


<P>

Upgraded vans to transport stranded passengers.
<P>

New technology to give the most accurate estimated time of arrival.
<P>

An average $3,000* worth of shares to each member.  (*source Macquarie
Equities)
<P>

But only if you vote for all 8 members of the Members First Team.
<P>

<center><b>GOOD FOR THE NRMA, GOOD FOR YOU.</b></center>
<P>


<P>

5   	Underneath the wording which I have set out appeared
photographs of the eight members of The Members First Team, and some words
which I cannot make out from the copy in evidence, but which did include a
statement that more information was available by visiting
website
www.membersfirst.com.au. Mr Carroll, who is a candidate for director in the
election, and it appears, a supporter of Mr Yates,
visited the website on 1
September 1999 and printed off The Members First policy statement appearing on
the site.  I will come back
to that, but as the policy statement has been
altered this may not have much significance as the declarations sought by the
plaintiff
relate to the statements made in the advertisement to which I have
referred, although an injunction is sought restraining the making
of statements
similar to those in respect of which declarations are sought.  Election
brochures distributed for Mr Gleeson and Mrs
Collins contain much the same
statements but in a form which is less objectionable, if the advertisement
statements are themselves
objectionable.
<P>

6   	By summons filed on 10 September 1999, Mr Yates seeks
declarations that by making or authorising the statement:
<P>

<center>THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE
<P>

NRMA ROAD SERVICE;
<P>

PUT MEMBERS FIRST"</center>
<P>


<P>

(the first statement), and the statement:
<P>

"If you like the idea of NRMA Road Service staying a mutual, whilst also giving
the organisation shares worth at least $250 million*
<P>

(and yearly income) vote for the Members First Team. (*source Macquarie
Equities)"
<P>

(the second statement) and by making or authorising the statement:
<P>

"Your vote will provide... An average $3,000* worth of shares to each member
(*source Macquarie Equities)
<P>

But only if you vote for all 8 members of the Members First Team
<P>

(the third statement) the defendants have, in respect of all three statements,
in trade or commerce, engaged in conduct which is
misleading or deceptive, or
likely to mislead or deceive, in breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>; in
respect of the second and third statements have engaged in such conduct in
breach of s995(2) of the Corporations Law, and finally
in respect of the second
and third statements, have published a notice in breach of s1025(3) of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff seeks injunctions restraining the defendants
from making or authorising the making of the first, second or third
statements
or any statements to the like effect, or from further publishing or
broadcasting such statements.  The plaintiff also
seeks an order for the
publication or broadcast of a correcting advertisement in a certain form.
<P>

8   	It is not denied that the statements were made or
authorised by the defendants.
<P>

9   	While the declarations sought do not relate to the
statements published on the website the material is relevant to the claim
for
an injunction in that it is stated that the Members First Team supported the
floating of the insurance company because that would
provide NRMA with shares
worth at least $250 million plus income each year and will "enable members to
receive on average shares
worth about $3,000".  The source, at least so far as
the latter figure was concerned and probably the former was stated on the
website
material to be Macquarie Equities.  Articles from the Daily Telegraph
headed "NRMA float to pay $3,000" and "Vote for Whitlam is
vote for free
shares" were posted on the website.  Also posted was a report, or part of a
report from Macquarie Equities, which referred
to the average NRMA member as
being one of fifteen years standing, being a member of both NRMA and Insurance,
and holding two insurance
policies, and which also stated that based on
Macquarie Equities calculations, the average member would become entitled to
receive
shares worth approximately $3,000 on insurance demutualisation and
further stated that based on the assumption that NRMA would receive
5 percent
of the equity in Insurance by way of shares that would equate to roughly $250
million.
<P>

10   	There is further evidence that visits, as they are always
described, to the website on 10 and 13 September disclosed that
the policy
statement had been altered removing reference to the likely value of shares to
be received by NRMA and the members. The
new statement however said:
<P>

"Every NRMA member would receive a windfall benefit in the form of shares.
This will provide members with an ongoing investment
in the insurance
company".
<P>

11   	The newspaper articles have been deleted from the website
as has the Macquarie Equities material.  The evidence is that what
are
described as "activated headlines" flash across the screen, those appearing on
21 September being the following:
<P>

1.	"NRMA Share Bonanza", Sun Herald, 11 July1999.
<P>

2."	Analysts tip $5b for NRMA float", The Age, Melbourne, 9 July 1999.
<P>

3.	"Why Nick needs the numbers", The Daily Telegraph, 11 July 1999.
<P>

4.	"NRMA Float:  Voter Turnout Key Factor", Australian Financial Review, 9 July
1999.
<P>

5.	"NRMA worth $5 billion: Bank", Sydney Morning Herald, 9 July 1999.
<P>

6.	"Float of NRMA: A Share Bonanza", The Australian, 9 July 1999.
<P>

12   	The defendants raised as a preliminary point the standing
of the plaintiff, Mr Yates, to bring these proceedings.  So far
as the claim
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s65</a> of the<b> </b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></u> for an injunction to restrain
conduct which contravenes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of that Act is concerned, such an application may
be brought on the application of the Minister, the Commissioner or "any other
person",
the same words appearing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s80</a> of the<b> </b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act
1974</a></u>.  In cases under the latter provision, it has been held that the words
mean what they say, so that no particular interest is required
as a condition
of entitlement to bring proceedings.  That reasoning should be reflected in the
interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s65.</a>  So far as the<b> </b><u>Corporations Law</u> is
concerned, standing  to bring the claims based on section 995(2) and s1025(3)
depends upon the plaintiff falling within s1324
of the Law.  That requires the
plaintiff to be a person "whose interests have been, are or would be affected
by the conduct" complained
of.  It is not necessary to go into this question in
detail and there is no time for it. Shareholders have been held to have an
interest,
creditors have been held to have an interest.  If the section
derogates from the rule in<b> <cite>Foss v Harbottle</cite></b> {1843} 2 HAR
461 so be it.  Mr Yates is a director of both NRMA and Insurance.  It is not
necessary to decide whether or not all
members of NRMA would have sufficient
interest to bring the present action.  In my view a member who is a director of
NRMA is a person
who has the necessary interest to bring the present
proceedings.
<P>

<b>CLAIMS FOR RELIEF UNDER THE CORPORATIONS LAW</b>
<P>

13   	Section 995(2) of the<b> </b><u>Corporations Law</u> is as
follows:
<P>

<b>995.	Misleading or deceptive conduct</b>
<P>

(2)	A person shall not, in or in connection with: 
<P>

(a)  any dealing in securities; or
<P>

(b)  without limiting the generality or paragraph (a):
<P>

(i)	the allotment or issue of securities;
<P>

(ii)	any prospectus issued, or notice published, in relation to securities;
<P>

(iii)	the making of takeover offers or a takeover announcement, or the making
of an evaluation of, or of a recommendation in relation
to, takeover offers or
offers constituted by a takeover announcement; or
<P>

(iv)	the carrying on of any negotiations, the making of any arrangements or the
doing of any other act preparatory to or in any
other way related to any matter
referred to in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii);
<P>

engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or
deceive.
<P>

14   	The argument of the plaintiff is that the second and third
statements referring to NRMA Road Service as receiving shares in
Insurance
worth at least $250 million and an average of $3,000 worth of shares being
received by each member, amount to misleading
or deceptive conduct in
connection with the  carrying on of negotiations, making arrangements or doing
other preparatory work in
any way related to the allotment or issue of
securities.  I do not consider it could be thought that the statements which
have been
made are made in connection with negotiations, arrangements or
preparatory acts related to the allotment or issue of securities.
 The
statements which have been made are made in support of the defendants'
candidature for election.  If they succeed, and if they
maintain their present
views, then there can be no doubt that it is likely that a proposal for
demutualisation of insurance will
be put before the members and subsequently
before the court for approval pursuant to a scheme of arrangement.  The
election is, I
consider, too far removed from the possibility of any future
issue of securities to bring the statements within s995(2).
<P>

15   	Section 1025(3) of the<b> </b><u>Corporations Law</u> is
as follows:
<P>

<b>1025.   Certain notices etc. Not to be published</b>
<P>

...
<P>

(3)	Except as provided by subsection (2), a person shall not publish a notice
that:
<P>

(a)	offers for subscription securities of a corporation or proposed
corporation;
<P>

(b)	issues invitations to subscribe for securities of a corporation or proposed
corporation; or
<P>

(c)	refers or calls attention, whether directly or indirectly, to:
<P>

(i)	a prospectus in relation to securities of a corporation;
<P>

(ii)	an offer or intended offer for subscription or securities or a
corporation;
<P>

(iii)	an invitation or intended invitation to subscribe for securities of a
corporation; or
<P>

(iv)	another notice that refers or calls attention, whether directly or
indirectly, to a prospectus in relation to securities of
a corporation or such
an offer, intended offer, invitation or intended invitation, not being a notice
referred to in subsection (2).
<P>

I am unable to see any basis upon which the statements could be said to fall
within this subsection.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">FAIR TRADING ACT</a> CLAIM - IN TRADE OR COMMERCE</b>
<P>

16   	This part of the claim is more difficult.  The defendants
are seeking election or re-election as directors of NRMA.  The statements
in
question were made in support of their claims for election.  I do not consider
standing for election to be a business or professional
activity.  The
ramifications, if it were, considered together with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41</a> of the<b> </b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</a></u>, would be rather frightening.  A candidate for election as a
union secretary or perhaps as a shop steward in a particular company
might well
stand on a platform of increasing workers' rewards by distributions from income
regularly applied by a company to reserves
and stated by the candidate to be
not needed for that purpose in future years. This would be a representation as
to a future matter
in  respect of which the representor would bear the onus to
show reasonable grounds for its making. The activity of seeking election
might
be in connection with a future business intention if elected, but I do not
consider it to be in trade or commerce.  The boundaries
in these matters are
not always easy to determine, particularly when one is dealing with a matter
which requires determination with
great speed to give the determination any
effect, but the boundaries are at least confined by the principles laid down
in<b> <cite>Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Limited v Nelson</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
169 CLR 594</a> at 604. I accept as was held in<b> <cite>Plimer v
Robertson</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2089%20FCR%20302" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 89 FCR 302</a> at 326 that the same principles and
boundaries apply to conduct under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the<b> </b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></u>.
It follows, as Lindgren J said in the latter case at page 326 that "it is
necessary to enquire whether the representations of the
defendants were made by
them in trading or commercial dealings between persons" (or between a personal
representor and a corporation).
 Statements directed to electors by election
candidates may be made <u>in connection with</u> trade or commerce In that they
may bear upon the commercial activities of the body to be governed as a result
of the election, but
in my view they are not made in trade or commerce. Neither
do I think it could be said that the statements were made for the purpose
of
promoting the business of the other members of the NRMA as those members do not
have a business.  Neither could it be said that
the statements were made for
the purpose of promoting the business of NRMA itself.  They are made for the
purpose of giving the defendants
the chance or opportunity to endeavour to
bring about some change in the business of NRMA purportedly for the benefit of
the members,
but that in itself does not make it conduct in trade or
commerce.
<P>

17   	I have of course been directed to the recent decision of
Santow J in<b> <cite>NRMA Limited v Yates</cite></b> {1999} NSWSC 859, where he
held that misleading advertisements as to past claimed loss of $50 million in
one transaction of NRMA
was misleading conduct in trade or commerce of NRMA.
It is, I think with respect, somewhat difficult to see how misleading
statements
as to alleged inefficient management of NRMA, was conduct for the
purpose of promoting the business of NRMA, rather than promoting
the chances of
Mr Yates' success at the election, but in any event the finding was partly
based upon the position of Mr Yates as
a director and his fiduciary obligations
in that capacity which are no part of the present action.  It follows that I
have come to
the conclusion that the statements were not made in trade or
commerce so that relief as sought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s65</a> of the<b> </b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act</a></u> is not available.
<P>

<b>MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT</b>
<P>

18   	If I were wrong in the conclusion I have just reached, it
would have been necessary to determine whether the impugned statements
were
misleading or are deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive and it is desirable
I deal with this.
<P>

19   	So far as the first statement complained of is concerned
it seems to me to be the type of statement one often sees in  advertisements
or
in election campaigns.  In some ways it is like saying that some product is the
best.  When one considers it in the light of its
being published in connection
with an election campaign, the only complaint that could possibly be made about
it, is the inclusion
of the word "only".  It is perfectly true, as appears from
the affidavit of Mr Talbot, that members of rival teams have plans to
improve
NRMA road services.  But the statement of Lockhart J in<b> <cite>Stewart
Alexander &amp; Co (Interstate) Pty Ltd v Blinders Pty Ltd</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1981/152.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] FCA 152</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2053%20FLR%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 53
FLR 307</a> at 310 as to a robust approach being called for when considering
whether television commercials are misleading or deceptive applies
with even
greater force to an election campaign.  There is of course no evidence of
anyone having been misled, but I do not think
that it could possibly be thought
that the members would believe that no other course, apart from the election of
the defendants,
could improve the NRMA road service.  I find that first
statement was not misleading and deceptive within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act</a></u><b>.</b>
<P>

20   	So far as the second statement is concerned, two claims
are made by the plaintiff against it.  The first is that it is misleading
and
deceptive in that it implies that the shares will be free or given to NRMA
without stating that it already controls the board
of Insurance and is entitled
to all its assets on a winding up.  In the context in which the statement was
made I do not think that
anything was said about free shares.  An advertisement
is not to be read in the same light as the documents required for a take over
offer or for a scheme of arrangement. The word "giving" in the second statement
when read in its context can be taken just as appropriately
to mean leaving
NRMA with or delivering to NRMA shares worth $250 million.  It would be wrong,
in my view, to give any undue emphasis
to the word "giving" as it appears in
the advertisement.  The second complaint is the statement of the shares as
being worth at least
$250 million.  The difficulty about this is that the
figure comes from the Macquarie Equities report and relies upon an assumption
in that report that five percent of the net worth of Insurance will be received
by NRMA under demutualisation if it goes ahead. 
As the source of this
statement, or at least the value of the shares, is stated to be the report of
Macquarie Equities, and nothing
whatever is said against that, it would seem to
me that as the defendants clearly and openly stated that the figure was based
upon
the Macquarie Equities report, there were reasonable grounds for making
that representation, provided there was some proper basis
for the assumption
that five percent of the net worth of Insurance would end up in the hands of
NRMA.  This is a difficult matter,
but on balance I have come to the conclusion
that in clearly relying upon the Macquarie Equities report for the statement
made, the
defendants must have accepted the assumption and been prepared to so
act as to work to bring it about and accordingly had reasonable
grounds for
making the representation.  There can of course be no doubt that if a severe
earthquake hit the whole of the central
business district and a large part of
the metropolitan district of Sydney, the value of Insurance would be
substantially  reduced.
 But that does not mean there were not reasonable
grounds for making the representation. I do not consider that the requirements
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41(2)</a> of the<b> </b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></u> require direct evidence by the
defendants that they would act so as to make good the assumption relied upon in
the Macquarie Equities
report.  I do not consider the fact that it has been
shown to be more probable than not that NRMA has received in the last two years
payments from Insurance, make the statement "and yearly income" misleading or
deceptive in the context in which it is considered.
 It would, I consider, be
different, as I have said before, in the case of a prospectus or a take over
document or a scheme of arrangement.
<P>

21   	So far as the third statement is concerned, I consider the
same position as to reliance on the report applies, although it
would probably
have been desirable to have had the statement refer to provision of "$3,000
worth of shares to the average member
being a member of NRMA of fifteen years
standing with two policies with Insurance".  In other words, I consider the
Macquarie Equities
report provided reasonable grounds.  Once again this is
election material and in that context I do not think the statement to be
misleading.  Neither do I think there could be any complaint about the last
part of the third statement, namely, "but only if you
vote for all 8 members of
the Members First Team".  While it may not be necessary for all eight members
of that team to be elected
as directors for demutualisation to be achieved, and
there is no evidence about that, in circumstances where, at least up to the
present time, it has been well-known that the board of NRMA is divided on the
question of demutualisation, but it is established
by the evidence in this
case, that the boards of both companies decided on 25 February 1999 to develop
a restructure proposal which
would involve demutualisation of the insurance
business and the continued provision of road service through a new mutual, and
that
subject to final approval of the board, the restructure proposal would be
put to members of both companies through schemes of arrangement,
it does appear
that there would be more certainty of the boards continuing to put such
decisions into effect if all members of the
Members First Team were elected as
directors.  Once again in the context of an election campaign, this last
statement does not appear
to me to be misleading or deceptive or in any way
likely to mislead or deceive the electors in the context of this particular
election.
<P>

22   	It follows that had it been necessary to so find I would
find the claim under this heading fails.
<P>

23   	Finally I should add that had I considered the statements
were in breach of the Act and it was proper to grant an injunction
I would not
have made an order for publication of some correcting advertisement as I would
not have thought that to be necessary.
<P>

24   	In coming to the conclusion which I have it is not to be
thought that I am recommending to the defendants they go back to
their original
policy statement.  On the other hand, as it  has been raised, it is also right
to say that I can see no objection
to the statement which on the evidence
presently appears on the Members First Team website, which states that if the
insurance company
is floated, every NRMA member would receive "a windfall
benefit in the form of shares".  One of the meanings of the word "windfall"
is
stated in the Macquarie Dictionary to be "an unexpected piece of good fortune".
If the road service continues as the defendants
state it will on
demutualisation of Insurance, then I do not consider that the statement of a
windfall could be said to be misleading
or deceptive, albeit that it could not
be said that the benefit was "free".
<P>

25   	It follows from these reasons that the plaintiff's claim
should be dismissed with costs and I so order.  The summons will
be dismissed
with costs.  The exhibits can be returned.
