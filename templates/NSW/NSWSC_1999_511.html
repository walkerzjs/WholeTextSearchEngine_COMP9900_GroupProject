<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an appeal by the plaintiff
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s146.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 146(1)</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/" class="autolink_findacts">Liquor Act 1982</a></i></b> ("the Act") from a decision
of the Licensing Court of New South Wales of 7 December 1998 in which it
refused an application by Judith
Ann Dinsdale ("the plaintiff") for the grant
to her of a caterer's licence in respect of premises known as AMF Bowl situated
at 99
Woodriffe Street, Penrith.  The grounds of appeal are that the Court
erred in its construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(a)</a> of the Act.  
<P>

The plaintiff's application (exhibit 1) was on the basis that any licence
granted as a consequence of her application would be "owned"
by AMF Bowling
Centres (Aust) International Inc. ("AMF"), "held" by her as manager for AMF,
and that AMF would be solely "entitled"
to the profits of the business.  An
affidavit was filed, in which AMF acknowledged the correctness of these matters
and the Court
found accordingly.  
<P>

2   	By Notice of Objection dated 28 April 1998, the Director of
Liquor and Gaming ("the Director") objected to the Plaintiff's
application on
the ground that it would not be in the public interest to grant such
application, and submitted that the plaintiff
failed to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B</a> of
the Act.  
<P>

3   	The objection by the Director was restricted to the issue
of whether the plaintiff complied with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(a)</a> of the Act, that is whether
she <i>carries on, or is proposing to carry on, the business of providing
catering services </i>and whether <i>the business that she is carrying on, or
is proposing to carry on, is in fact her principal business.</i>  The section
provides:
<P>

54B.  (1)  An application for a caterer's licence must not be granted unless
the court is satisfied that:
<P>

(a)	the applicant carries on or is proposing to carry on the business of
providing catering services and that business is or is
proposed to be the
applicant's principal business; and
<P>

(b)	the applicant has such skills, qualifications and experience, and has
undergone such training, as my be prescribed by the regulations
as necessary
for the holder of a caterer's licence; and
<P>

(c)	the applicant is or will be the occupier of a commercial kitchen which
satisfies any applicable standards and requirements determined
by the Board for
commercial kitchens and for access to the kitchen by the licensee.
<P>

4   	It was not disputed that the plaintiff had the skills,
qualifications and experience as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(b)</a> to hold a caterer's
licence, and evidence provided satisfied the Court that she was indeed
competent in the relevant areas.  Moreover,
the Director did not suggest that
the premises do not include a commercial kitchen which would satisfy the
standards and requirements
determined by the Board pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(c)</a>, nor
that the plaintiff would not have the exclusive use of that commercial kitchen
to carry out her catering activities.
<P>

5   	The nature of AMF's operations at its various bowling
centres was described in the Licensing Court's judgment as follows:
<P>

"The AMF Bowling Centres runs bowling venues throughout Australia and has
fourteen in New South Wales.  It is not necessary to describe
the nature of a
bowling centre in any detail.  The relevant facts are that there are bowling
lanes and a food service area.  The
AMF Bowling Centres operate under the
auspices of Australian Ten Pin Bowling Congress.  That Congress runs
competition ten pin bowling
and ten pin bowling generally in Australia.  It is
part of an international organisation.
<P>

AMF Bowling Centres conduct informal bowling whereby members of the public can
attend, pay a fee and bowl and also being a principle
(sic) part of its
business conducts league competitions.  In addition to those, there are major
competitions such as interstate and
international competitions conducted at
their various bowling ventures (sic).  The league competitions and for which
the majority
of the evidence focuses are conducted under the rules laid down by
the Australian Ten Pin Bowling congress.  In evidence is the rule
book.  That
is sufficient to satisfy me that the entity is formal, conducts competitions in
which players are required to be registered.
 They pay fees.  There are
trophies.  The events are covered by detailed rules of bowl.
<P>

At least six nights a week and occasionally seven at some bowling centres and
other bowling centres seven nights a week and even
at other bowling centres
less than seven nights per week, league competitions take place.  They
generally start at six or six thirty
and the first session goes to eight  or
thereabouts and the second session starts at eight thirty and generally goes
for two hours
concluding at ten thirty.  At that time the majority of the lanes
are occupied by league bowlers.  Other lanes are available for
non-league
bowlers, in other words, non-competition bowlers.
<P>

Members of the public can enter the facilities and observe.  League bowlers can
be accompanied by other people who are not participating
in the competition
although it appears from Mr Moloney's evidence that except for major events
members of the public entering the
premises for the purposes of watching are a
rarity. 
<P>

The league players participate in a competition as I have said.  The current
arrangement is that liquor is only served based upon
the league competition.
In other words, to be sold liquor you have to be a bowler participating in the
league competition.  The current
provisions adopted by the licensee are that
for the first drink a league bowler must purchase at a minimum a bowl of hot
chips. 
After that has been consumed a league bowler may purchase other liquor
without the requirement to purchase food items or edible refreshments."
<P>

The Court also said:
<P>

"The applicant says she will hold the licence on behalf of AMF, by which
company she is employed, and that she is responsible for
the provision of all
catering services at the Penrith Bowl.  In this connection, the Court had
before it a document from the Chief
Executive Officer of AMF Bowling Centers
(Aust) International Inc. (Mr Maloon) to the effect that Ms Dinsdale is the
occupier of
the caf&eacute; facilities at the Penrith Bowl, and that it is the
company's intention that she will remain the occupier as long
as she holds the
Catering Licence sought for the premises.
<P>

The Court was told that Ms Dinsdale attends at the premises and conducts the
catering at certain hours and that if the licence is
granted, she will arrange
to be at the premises in the evenings to cover the hours when liquor is
generally served, and that she
would not engage in any other occupation apart
from the provision of refreshments at the Penrith Bowl."
<P>

The Court further said:
<P>

"The evidence of Ms Dinsdale and of Mr Bober is that the catering activities at
the Penrith bowl are subject to the general policy
guidelines and practices of
AMF Bowling Centers (Aust) International Inc, with little variation being
apparent between the various
bowling venues.  Purchasing is mostly from
designated suppliers with whom advantageous terms have been negotiated
centrally, and
menus are standardised, although the local manager hires and
fires staff, selects and supervises menu variations, orders necessary
ingredients and accompaniments, exercises quality controls, and is afforded the
opportunity of varying some dishes, substituting
items within a range, and
obtaining provisions from local suppliers when small quantities are required,
or special products are available
or needed.  Ms Dinsdale gave evidence that
she follows the standard operational procedures where these are appropriate for
her venue,
but that she responds to customer demand and varies her menus after
consulting with her own clientele.  She has introduced some special
dishes, and
says that she has complete control over the staff and their day to day
activities.  When the State manager calls on her,
she receives support and
advice, not direct orders."
<P>

6   	The Court found that the plaintiff carried on the business
of providing catering services, but that she did so not as a principal,
but on
behalf of AMF.  It also found that her principal activity, and accordingly the
business in which she was principally engaged,
was or will be, the provision of
catering services; but held that was insufficient, because "<i>where a party
other than a principal carries on the business, it is necessary for there to be
a congruence between the applicant and
the applicant's principal, and that the
business carried on by the applicant must be the principal business of both the
applicant
and the proprietor for the section to be satisfied</i>."  Having held
that the provision of catering services was not the principal business of AMF,
the Court accordingly refused the application.
<P>

7   	The Plaintiff submitted that the Court erred in so holding,
and that, having found that the plaintiff "<i>carried on the business</i>" of
providing catering services and that the business she carried on was <i>"her
principal business"</i>, the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(a)</a> were satisfied and the
requirements in respect of subs (1) (b) and (c) not being in dispute, the Court
was bound to grant the application.
<P>

8   	The Director submitted that on the Licensing Court's
findings that the catering business, owned by AMF and from which AMF obtained
all the profits although managed by the plaintiff, was the relevant "business"
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(a)</a>, that such business was AMF's business, but not
its principal business and accordingly the second requirement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)(a)</a>
was not satisfied and the application was rightly refused.
<P>

9   	The Director also filed a Notice of Contention claiming
that the Court erred in construing para 54B(1)(a) as permitting an
application
thereunder by a person who was not a proprietor of the business sought to be
licensed, and submitted that the person
who "carries on a business" is the
proprietor, not an employee.  
<P>

10   	The requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54B(1)</a> are that:
<P>

	(i)	the applicant carries on, or is proposing to carry on, the business of
providing catering services;
<P>

	(ii)	that business is, or is proposed to be, the applicant's principal
business;
<P>

	(iii)	the applicant has the requisite skills, qualifications and
experience;
<P>

	(iv)	the applicant has undergone the prescribed training;
<P>

	(v)	the applicant is, or will be, the occupier of a commercial kitchen;
and
<P>

	(vi)	that kitchen meets the requisite standards.
<P>

11   	With the exception of (vi), all the requirements refer to
the applicant and none of them make reference to the applicant's
employer.  In
particular, item (ii), that "that business is or is proposed to be, the
applicant's principal business" is a reference
to the business referred to in
item (i) namely, the business carried on by the applicant.  If the applicant
does not carry on, or
propose to carry on, a business of providing catering
services, no question arises as to whether it is that person's <i>principal</i>
business.  However, if he or she does carry on, or propose to carry on such
business, then the question becomes whether it is that
person's principal
business.  The section makes no reference to whether the provision of catering
services is the principal business
of anyone else such as the applicant's
employer, and, purely by reference to the words used in the section, I can see
no warrant
for introducing an additional requirement that the provision of
catering services must also be the principal business of the person
on whose
behalf, or for whose benefit, the applicant carries on such business.
<P>

12   	This construction is also in my view consistent with both
the scheme of the Act relating to catering licences and other provisions
in the
Act dealing with them.
<P>

13   	A number of definitions are contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a>, including
the following:
<P>

<b><i>caterer's licence</i></b><i> </i>means a licence that, subject to this
Act and the conditions of the licence, authorises the licensee to sell liquor
at a function,
occasion or event held on any premises, or part of premises, on
which the licensee provides catering services, but only for consumption
on
those premises. 
<P>

<b><i>catering services</i></b> means services for the preparation and supply
of edible refreshments for consumption at functions, occasions and events.
<P>

<b><i>function</i></b><i> </i>means any dinner, ball, convention, seminar,
sporting event, race meeting, exhibition, performance, trade fair or other
fair, fete
or carnival, or any similar event or activity, that is conducted for
public amusement or entertainment.
<P>

14   	In addition, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(2)(d)</a> of the Act provides that the Court
may grant a <i>caterer's licence</i> and specifies such a licence as one which,
<i>subject to this Act and the conditions of the licence, authorises the
licensee to sell liquor at a function, occasion or event held
on any premises,
or part of premises, on which the licensee provides catering services, but only
for consumption on those premises</i>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 23A(1)</a> provides that <i>liquor
shall not be sold . . . . . pursuant to a caterer's licence except at, or as
ancillary to, a function, occasion or event for
which the licensee provides
catering services</i>, and that pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23A(2)</a> <i>if liquor is to be sold
or supplied pursuant to a caterer's licence, the liquor shall be supplied and
consumed with, or as ancillary
to, the consumption of edible refreshments
supplied by the licensee.</i>
<P>

15   	It is to be observed that none of these provisions require
the licensee to be the person conducting the function or the occupier
of the
premises on which the function is conducted or the liquor supplied.
<P>

16   	Reference may also be made to ss 39(2) (since repealed)
and 101(6) which contain provisions limiting the definition of "the
business of
the licensed premises", thereby recognising that the provision of catering
services will not be the principal business
carried on the licensed
premises.
<P>

17   	In her Second Reading speech on the <b><i>Liquor
(Amendment) Bill</i></b> which became Act no. 42 of 1994, the Minister said
(Hansard, 3 May 1994 at 1755): 
<P>

"The bill also alters the caterer's licence provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/" class="autolink_findacts">Liquor Act</a> so
that a caterer will not be required to operate a permanent function centre in
order to obtain a liquor licence.  At present it
is a requirement that a
caterer in order to hold a caterer's licence have a function room with at least
50 seats and minimum sanitary
facilities. Caterers are then authorised to sell
liquor in that function room or on any other premises on which the licensee
provides
catering services, <b>whether or not occupied or controlled by the
licensee.  </b>The bill will remove this function room requirement for caters'
licences" (my emphasis).
<P>

18   	The concept of a catering licence is therefore to permit a
person supplying food at functions, such as conventions, sporting
events, race
meetings, agricultural or other shows and similar events provided for public
entertainment to sell liquor at such functions
for consumption on the premises
on which the function is being held.  Such functions will not normally be
conducted by persons whose
principal business is the provision of edible
refreshments, but by cricket or football associations, race clubs, show
societies,
etc.  If catering licences could only be granted to applicants whose
principal business was the provision of edible refreshments,
it is difficult to
see how they could ever be granted in respect of the great majority of events
referred to in the definition of
"function".  Not only will people providing
catering services not be conducting sporting events, race meetings, etc; but
the persons
conducting such functions (even apart from their corporate nature)
will not have the skills, qualifications or experience required
by holders of
caterers' licences.
<P>

19   	The essential question, it seems to me, is whether an
employee such as the plaintiff can be said to "carry on the business
of
providing catering services".  If she can, the next question is whether such
business is "her" principal business, not anyone
else's principal business.  On
the other hand, if the plaintiff cannot be said to "carry on the business of
providing catering services"
(eg, because she is an employee) the second
question does not arise, because she does not fulfil the first requirement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
54B(1)(a).</a>
<P>

20   	The meaning of to "carry on business" it has been said
depends on its context.  In <b><i>Ex parte Breull, re Bowie </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2016%20ChD%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 16
ChD 484</a><b><i> </i></b>it was held to include carrying on business as an
employee, whereas in <b><i>Graham -v- Lewis </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2022%20QBD%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 22 QBD 1</a> it was held
it only applied to carrying on one's own business.  More recently the Full
Federal Court has followed <b><i>Graham -v- Lewis </i></b>and held that a
person is not carrying on business merely by managing a company of which he is
a director, secretary and "controlling
presence".  However, all these were
bankruptcy cases where, having regard to the serious consequences of a
sequestration order being
made, a narrow construction was warranted.
<P>

21   	Under the<b><i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/" class="autolink_findacts">Liquor Act</a></i></b> where the grant of
licenses is facultative such a narrow construction is, in my view, not
necessary or appropriate.
<P>

22   	In <b><i>Hope -v- Bathurst City Council </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144
CLR 1</a>, Mason J at 8 pointed out that "business" has many meanings and said that
"carrying on business" implied a repetition of acts engaged
in for the purpose
of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis.  That and a number of other
cases, e.g. <b><i>Pioneer Concrete Services</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/68.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 68</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20VR%20675" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] VR 675</a>, <b><i>Town
Investments Ltd -v- Department of the Environment</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 359</a>,
<b><i>Hughes -v- Clubb</i></b> (1987) 10 NSWLR 325 have been concerned with the
repetitive element involved in carrying on a business, but in <b><i>Rolls -v-
Miller</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%2027%20ChD%2071" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 27 ChD 71</a> at 88, Lindley LJ said "business" means "almost
anything which is an occupation as distinguished from a pleasure - anything
which
is an occupation or duty which requires attention is a business".  
<P>

23   	Apart from the bankruptcy cases, no distinction appears to
have been drawn between carrying on business for oneself and carrying
on
business as an employee for someone else; and the same can be said of the
dictionaries, eg, the <b><u>Macquarie Dictionary</u></b> includes in the
definitions of <b>carry on</b> (p 302), "to manage or conduct", and of
<b>business</b> (p 271), "one's occupation, profession or trade", whilst the
<b><u>Concise Oxford Dictionary</u></b>, 2nd ed, includes as the definition of
<b>carry on</b> (p 151), "to manage (business)" and of <b>business</b> (p 133),
"habitual occupation, profession, trade", and the <b><u>Compact Oxford English
Dictionary</u></b>, new ed, under the entry <b>business</b>, includes (p 695),
"serious occupation, work as opposed to pleasure or recreation" and "serious
employment as distinguished from
a pastime".
<P>

24   	In the present case, the plaintiff in conducting and
managing the commercial kitchen will be carrying on her occupation, trade
or
employment requiring her attention of a repetitive nature and not engaged in
for pleasure.  She will therefore, in my view be
"carrying on the business of
providing catering services".
<P>

25   	The Licensing Court found that the applicant's "principal
activity, and accordingly the activities in which she is principally
engaged
is, or will be, that of providing catering services."  Contrary to the
submissions on behalf of the defendant I consider
that finding to be justified
on the material before that Court.  As the provision of catering services is,
or will be her principal
activity, and as I have found such activity amounts to
the carrying on of a business by her, it follows that the carrying on of that
business by her is, or will be, her principal business.
<P>

26   	It also follows that the conditions prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/la1982107/s54b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
54B(1)(a)</a> were satisfied, and the Licensing Court was in error in also
requiring it to be established that the provision of catering services
was or
would be the principal business of AMF.
<P>

27   	For these reasons the defendant's Notice of Contention
fails and the plaintiff's appeal succeeds.
<P>

28   	I make the following orders:
<P>

Appeal upheld;
<P>

Order of Licensing Court refusing the application set aside;
<P>

Application remitted to Licensing Court to be dealt with according to law;
<P>

Defendant to pay plaintiff's costs of the Summons.
