<b>JUDGMENT (On admissibility of MFI 26 - <i>The Sydney Morning Herald
</i>article 26 May 1999- T1656)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock I raised with
Mr Barker Q.C. the fact that media coverage of the plaintiff's presence
in
Brussels had been drawn to my attention:  1, as to it being on a radio station;
and 2, in relation to an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. I did so on the
basis as set out in the transcript.
<P>

2   	After the morning tea adjournment (T1631), for
completeness, I referred to the fact that over the adjournment I had happened
to have read an article in <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>.
<P>

3   	At the close of proceedings yesterday, senior counsel for
the defendant, Mr Nicholas Q.C., sought to tender <i>The Sydney Morning Herald
</i>article which is now MFI 26. Many technical difficulties attend its
admissibility, and at best, in the present context, it could only
be admitted
as evidence of what was published in <i>The Sydney Morning Herald </i>rather
than of the truth of that contained within the publication.
<P>

4   	The matter was quite candidly, as I hope I indicated
yesterday, raised in the context of what I will describe as the "<i>psychiatric
component" </i>of the amendment application. That component will be decided
upon the evidence I in fact have heard, and in the light of submissions
made in
regard to it. No purpose in terms of the resolution of the overall application
can usefully be served by the admission into
evidence of material of so little
technical weight, and it will remain as MFI 26. The matter will be decided on
the evidence I in
fact have heard.
<P>
