<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff, Hungry Jack's Pty Limited, which is referred to in the
pleadings as HJPL, ("HJPL"), for which Mr N.C. Hutley of
Senior Counsel and Mr
T.D. Castle of Counsel appeared, has sued Burger King Corporation, which is
referred to in the pleadings as
BKC, ("BKC"); The Shell Company of Australia
Limited, which is referred to in the pleadings as Shell, ("Shell"), for which
Mr A.J.
Sullivan of Queen's Counsel and Dr A.S. Bell of Counsel appeared; and
Burger King Australia Pty Limited, which is referred to in
the pleadings as
BKAL, ("BKAL").  The proceedings were commenced in 1996 and HJPL will rely on
the hearing, which is due to start
on Tuesday, 27 April 1999 with an estimated
hearing time of three months, on the allegations contained in the Sixth Further
Amended
Summons.
<P>

2	By a Notice of Motion filed on 15 February 1999 HJPL sought leave to
administer a Notice to Answer Interrogatories to Shell in
the form served on
its solicitors on 1 February 1999.  The Interrogatories sought to be
administered are exhibited to the affidavit
in support of the Notice of Motion
of Mr A.J. Black, the solicitor for HJPL, sworn on 15 February 1999, which
became Exhibit A on
the application.  The Notice of Motion also sought an order
for verified discovery.  It came before me on 19 February 1999 and, because
of
time constraints, I was only able to hear the application in relation to
interrogatories, which was opposed by Shell.  Because
of the imminence of the
hearing and the need for continued orderly preparation for it, I took the view,
(from which the parties did
not dissent), that I should hear this aspect of the
motion and give judgment as quickly as possible.
<P>

<b>The Relevant Pleading</b>
<P>

3	The section of the Sixth Further Amended Summons, which commences at
paragraph 99, is headed "Breach of Duty of Confidentiality
by Shell".  It is
pleaded in that paragraph that by clause 12.1 of the Test Site Agreement
between Shell, BKC and HJPL, Shell agreed
that all materials and information
made available by HJPL were and are, to the extent that they are not already in
the public domain,
considered to be proprietary information of BKC.  In
paragraph 100 it is pleaded that by clause 12.2 of that Agreement Shell
undertook
to BKC and HJPL that it would keep the BKC proprietary information
confidential and use it only in connection with that Agreement;
and, in
paragraph 101, that HJPL and its agents provided Shell with confidential
information in connection with the joint venture
or proposed joint venture.
The particulars of the information cover a wide area of the conduct of retail
outlets for the product
of HJPL, the suitability or lack of suitability of
certain of them, data relevant to those matters and available socio-economic
and
traffic data and relevant demographic information in relation to them.  The
particulars also relate to the set-up of such outlets.
<P>

4	Paragraphs 102 and 103 repeat, essentially, the allegations in relation to
confidentiality, and paragraph 104 alleges:-
<P>

	<b>"In breach of clause 12.1 of the Test Site Agreement, or alternatively the
duties pleaded in paragraphs 102 and 103, Shell has used
the information
pleaded in paragraph 101 above to assist in designing and opening further
Burger King restaurants in Shell service
stations which are not operated or
serviced by HJPL.</b>
<P>

<b>	                                PARTICULARS</b>
<P>

<b>	The plaintiff will provide particulars following discovery and
interrogatories."</b>
<P>

5	It is pleaded that in consequence of the alleged breaches HJPL has suffered
and will continue to suffer loss, and that Shell has
profited and is continuing
to do so.
<P>

6	The allegations, and particularly those in paragraph 104, are in issue.  The
application to administer interrogatories goes to
seeking to prove the use,
which Shell allegedly made of the confidential information in breach of the
Agreement.
<P>

<b>Particulars</b>
<P>

7	By letter dated 19 February 1998 the solicitors for Shell sought further and
better particulars of, inter alia, paragraph 104
of the Fifth Further Amended
Summons, which is in the same terms as paragraph 104 of the present pleading.
Paragraph 12 stated:-
<P>

	<b>"Please provide particulars in support of paragraph 104 of the Fifth
Further Amended Summons."</b>
<P>

8	On 24 February 1998 the solicitors for HJPL replied in some detail and, in
paragraph 5, stated:-
<P>

	<b>"The inference that your client used the confidential information provided
to it in designing and opening Burger King Restaurants
in Shell service
stations is available from the fact that it took active steps to provide that
information throughout the period
between mid-1994 and late 1995, including
initiating discussions with officers of HJPL and corresponding with both
Chester and BKC
to obtain that information.  The manner in which your client
used that information, in designing and opening Burger King restaurants
in
Shell Service stations which are not operated or serviced by HJPL, is obviously
a matter within its knowledge, and is not identifiable
by our client except by
review of your client's discovery, interrogatories or cross-examination.  As we
noted above, we are currently
completing our review and analysis of your
client's discovery."</b>
<P>

9	This response immediately flagged the essential matters in issue.  HJPL
alleged that the confidential information had been furnished
and, at least
inferentially, that wrongful use had been made of it.  The intermediate step
was whether Shell had so acted and, if
it had, in what way it had, which the
solicitors for HJPL asserted was a matter within the knowledge of Shell.  Such
knowledge, of
course, extends to two areas, viz what use, if any, Shell made of
the information in doing certain things, and what use it made of
the
information in refraining from doing certain things.  I shall refer to these as
the "positive" and "negative" uses respectively.
<P>

10	By letter dated 9 March 1998 the solicitors for Shell referred to this
response, and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Outside Court on 6 March 1998, you stated that if our client sought a
direction requiring your client to provide the above particulars
and any
particulars to paragraph 104 of the Summons, your client would seek leave to
administer interrogatories and refuse to provide
the particulars requested
until answers to interrogatories are provided.  Our client regards this as
fishing.</b>
<P>

<b>	Our client is of the view that it cannot complete its statements until your
client provides any further particulars to paragraph
101 and particulars in
support of paragraph 104."</b>
<P>

11	By letter dated 10 March 1998 the solicitors for HJPL responded.  They
repeated, in essence, what had been said previously, and
continued:-
<P>

	<b>"In our conversation at Court on 6 March 1998, we noted that, first, it
would be pointless for our client to be directed to provide
further particulars
as to paragraph 104 of the Fifth Further Amended Summons, since it has already
provided the best particulars
which are in its possession, and the matter is
one within your client's knowledge; second, our client would be entitled to
seek leave
to administer interrogatories concerning this subject matter; and,
third, for your client to press for further particulars and our
client to press
for interrogatories would have little utility, since your client is currently
subject to a direction to file and
serve its witness statements.  That
continues to be our client's position concerning this matter."</b>
<P>

12	There was further correspondence between the parties and, by letter dated 12
March 1998, the solicitors for HJPL provided information
by way of particulars
further to that in their letter of 24 February 1998 and sought that that latter
information be amended accordingly.
<P>

13	On 8 May 1998 Shell filed a Notice of Motion seeking further particulars in
relation to paragraphs 104 and 104A of the Fifth
Further Amended Summons.  That
came before Hunter J on 15 May 1998 when his Honour expressed the view, in
argument, that he thought
there should be some further particularisation of
paragraph 104, but recognised there was "a bit of a problem from the
plaintiff's
point of view having regard to the fact that the matters are
substantially within the knowledge of the defendants".  His Honour suggested
that an outline "of, in effect, an opening on the use it's said the information
was put to" should be provided.  In his judgment
he said:-
<P>

	<b>"In this matter, the only remaining issue between the parties, apart from
some response to Notices to Produce, is a dispute as to
the adequacy of
particulars of paragraph 104 of the Fifth Further Amended Summons.  It does not
seem to be in dispute that statements
filed and served by the plaintiff do not
address the particulars of the alleged use of the information said to have been
confidential.
 On that basis, it seems to me clear that the defendants are
entitled to some better particularisation of the allegation of use of
confidential information.  </b>
<P>

<b>	<u>At the same time, I think it should be recognised that that is a task
that is not without its difficulties for the plaintiff, having
regard to the
fact that the allegation of use is that by the defendants of confidential
information about which they would not be
likely to be overt</u>.  However, I
do not regard that as a reason for refusing some assistance to the defendants'
understanding of the case to be met in
that regard."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

14	His Honour recognised that much of the information was solely within the
knowledge of Shell.  His observations, or perhaps more
accurately directions,
led to a letter from the solicitors for HJPL to Shell dated 28 May 1998
enclosing an outline of HJPL's case
as to the use of confidential information
as alleged in paragraph 104.  
<P>

15	In that document HJPL asserted that Shell misused confidential information
provided to it both as to site selection and in relation
to architectural and
design matters, and for the purpose of opening restaurants referred to in
paragraph 3.  It continued that the
misuse of confidential information could be
established by inference from the relevant circumstances, and that it was
sufficient
to establish HJPL's claim that confidential information provided by
it to Shell was used, even if that use was not deliberate or
was unconscious.
It was further asserted that it would not matter if only one portion of the
information provided was used by Shell
in conjunction with other information,
and that it would not be a defence to an allegation of misuse of confidential
information
even if Shell had used that information merely as a matter of
convenience.
<P>

16	In the alternative it was asserted that the misuse of confidential
information by Shell provided a springboard for the development
of the sites
referred to in paragraph 3.  Thereafter further detailed particulars were given
in relation to various sites and, in
paragraph 8, it was stated that HJPL would
rely on the following additional facts, matters and circumstances to support
the inference
of use by Shell of confidential site selection information
provided to it by HJPL.  A number of particulars were furnished.  In paragraph
9 it was asserted that as to design of restaurants, HJPL contended that the
Court would infer that Shell used confidential information
provided by HJPL in
designing restaurants at Shell sites in various ways particularised in that
paragraph and in paragraph 10.
<P>

17	In paragraphs 11 and 12 it was stated:-
<P>

	<b>"11.	Shell has not served any witness statements of persons involved in the
receipt of architectural and design information from HJPL
and Chester and/or
the design and/or construction of `Hungry Jack's' restaurants at Shell service
station sites.</b>
<P>

<b>	12.	HJPL proposes to supplement its case by interrogatories and subpoenas
to third parties."</b>
<P>

18	On 11 June 1998 the solicitors for Shell asserted that the particulars in
the outline were not meaningful and that any attempt
to administer
interrogatories would constitute "a fishing expedition".  By this stage there
were certain draft interrogatories furnished,
which were opposed globally and
as to certain specific matters.
<P>

19	This led to further disputatious correspondence and, on 19 June 1998, the
matter came before Hunter J when his Honour stood it
over to 26 June 1998 "to
enable the plaintiff to provide the defendant with particulars of the
confidential information the subject
of the alleged misuse by the defendant
...".
<P>

20	This led to a document being furnished setting out particulars of the
confidential information alleged to have been provided
to Shell, which included
in paragraph 1.6, HJPL's assessment of the suitability of the Shell service
station sites in certain locations
in Sydney and, in paragraph 1.7, an
assessment of the suitability of Shell service station sites in certain
localities in Victoria.
 Reference was also made in paragraphs 2 and 3 to
architectural and design information and financial information respectively.
<P>

21	The solicitors for Shell again contended that this was not an adequate
response to the request for particulars and, in an attempt
to break this
impasse, a meeting was arranged between the parties' legal representatives on 9
July 1998.  On that date but after
the meeting, the solicitors for HJPL wrote
to the solicitors for Shell confirming that certain information was agreed to
be provided,
and noting that the question of interrogatories would be deferred
until that further discovery had been given with a view to narrowing
or
refining the interrogatories.  The letter concluded:-
<P>

	<b>"Discussions relating to all further discovery would be deferred for, say,
six weeks at which time all outstanding issues in relation
to your client's
discovery would be addressed with a view to finalising discovery at that
time."</b>
<P>

22	On 10 July 1998 the solicitors for Shell confirmed the arrangement, although
seeking to give discovery in respect of one different
site, and agreed to a
further meeting being held for the purpose of addressing all outstanding
discovery issues "in approximately
six weeks' time".
<P>

23	On 16 October 1998 the solicitors for Shell wrote to the solicitors for HJPL
referring to the Sixth Further Amended Summons and
asserting that it still did
not provide particulars of the alleged use of confidential information by Shell
pleaded in paragraph
104, and requesting them within seven days.  The letter
concluded that unless satisfactory particulars were received within that
time
Shell would be filing a motion seeking an order that unless particulars were
provided within seven days paragraph 104 should
be struck out.
<P>

24	By their response, dated 30 October 1998, the solicitors for HJPL referred
to the particulars previously furnished; suggested
that the orders previously
made did not contemplate that HJPL would provide further particulars "of the
<u>use</u> of that information" by Shell; and that the use of that information
was a matter within Shell's knowledge.
<P>

25	The letter continued by referring to the meeting of 8 July 1998 and certain
matters flowing from it and concluded:-
<P>

	<b>"While our client has been prepared to defer pressing its application to
administer interrogatories to your client, pending further
discovery which may
allow it to narrow the scope of those interrogatories, it cannot do so
indefinitely.  Accordingly, if the outstanding
discovery issues are not
promptly resolved, our client will also press its application for leave to
administer interrogatories to
your client concerning these matters."</b>
<P>

26	On 13 November 1998 the solicitors for HJPL wrote to the solicitors for
Shell seeking a response to the communication of 30 October
1998 and, on 22
December 1998, the solicitors for Shell wrote to the solicitors for HJPL
setting out documents which had been discovered
and seeking "full particulars
of the alleged use of confidential information" alleged in paragraphs 104, 104A
and 104B "pursuant
to the direction made by Mr Justice Hunter on 19 June
1998".
<P>

27	The letter repeated the earlier contention that, in the absence of such
particularisation, an application would be made to strike
out those
paragraphs.
<P>

28	This led to further correspondence and, on 15 February 1999, the solicitors
for HJPL wrote to the solicitors for Shell providing
"the following further and
better particulars of that allegation" i.e. the allegation in paragraph 104.
Under the headings "Site
Selection Information" and "Architectural and Design
Information" numerous particulars were furnished of information allegedly
confidential
to HJPL and used by Shell.  Further the basis upon which such use
was to be inferred was particularised in detail.  It is to be noted
that the
letter made it clear that it was providing "further and better particulars of
the allegation" and it concluded:-
<P>

	<b>"Our client anticipates that it will be in a position to supplement these
particulars following further discovery by your client,
and the provision of
answers to the proposed interrogatories by your client.  Naturally, our client
also reserves the right to supplement
or amend these particulars as further
information becomes available to it."</b>
<P>

<b>The Present Application</b>
<P>

29	The material to which I have referred came from the affidavit of Mr Black
and also the affidavit of Ms A.J. McFadzean, the solicitor
for Shell, sworn 19
February 1999.
<P>

30	In his written Outline of Submissions Mr Hutley submitted that the
interrogatories and further discovery concerned the question
whether Shell had
misused confidential information as pleaded in paragraph 104, and that
documents produced on discovery and other
evidence filed in the proceedings
revealed a number of factual matters in relation to the design of "Hungry
Jack's" restaurants,
which disclosed similarities between the Shell standard
design and HJPL drawings "upon the basis of which an architect to be called
by
HJPL has concluded that the HJPL drawings were used in the course of preparing
the Shell plans".
<P>

31	The submissions relied heavily on the fact that the question of use by Shell
of HJPL's confidential information is wholly within
the knowledge of Shell, and
that the questions asked were in a form which in substance asked what use Shell
made of the confidential
information.  It was submitted this was an appropriate
topic for interrogation based on the decision of <b>Rockwell International
Corporation &amp; Anor v Serck Industries Limited</b> [1988] Fleet Street
Reports 187.
<P>

32	It was further submitted that for the purpose of interrogatories the extent
to which Shell, by its relevant officers, used the
information provided to it
was plainly in issue and that the answers to the proposed interrogatories
"would clearly be relevant within
the test stated in Part 53 rule 1 for
discovery and in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.55</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>".
<P>

33	The submissions continued that the interrogatories were necessary to obtain
evidence which would not otherwise be available to
HJPL and, in particular,
that Shell had not filed any witness statements from a Ms Seymour or from any
other persons responsible
for or having a connection with drafting the Shell
architectural plans.
<P>

34	It was finally submitted that the form of the interrogatories was designed
to follow any flow of confidential information:-
<P>

	<b>".. so that Shell's enquiries can be limited to those persons who did
receive or were likely to have received the information.  Undoubtedly,
if no
use was made of the information, as Shell contends in its Defence, the answers
to the interrogatories are unlikely to be extensive."</b>
<P>

35	In his written Outline of Submissions Mr Sullivan pointed to the fact that
there were 289 interrogatories to be answered within
three weeks, and that the
application for leave to administer interrogatories is oppressive having regard
to the number and timing
of it.  Further he submitted that the vast number of
interrogatories together with the further discovery amounted to fishing
exercises.
 Mr Hutley acknowledged that I could extend the time for
answering.
<P>

36	In support of the submission of oppression he referred to the decisions in
<b>American Flange v Rheem Australia Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20NSWR%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] NSWR 195</a> and
<b>Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Limited v C.E. Heath Insurance Broking (Australia)
Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 703.</a>  From those authorities he submitted that
it was plain that an extensive number of interrogatories may be oppressive in
and of itself
and that, in the present case, many of the questions had the vice
that, depending on the answers to them, the number of responses
required would
multiply.  The first point is undoubtedly correct if the number of
interrogatories can be so  characterised.  However
there is much in those
authorities, which favours the stance of HJPL on the facts of and in the
circumstances concerning this case.
<P>

37	Mr Sullivan placed reliance upon the fact that the limit of thirty
interrogatories without leave contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/index.html#p24" class="autolink_findacts">Part 24</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1</a> recognised the
potential for oppression and was introduced because of the perceived abuses.
He continued that the most cursory perusal
of the proposed interrogatories
revealed their oppressiveness and provided an example based upon interrogatory
14(b)(ii) and subsequent
questions.  I do not agree with that submission.
<P>

38	Mr Sullivan submitted, nextly, that the interrogatories went to an issue,
which has not been properly particularised "until Monday
of this week", "namely
the use alleged to have been made of the alleged confidential information
despite numerous requests by Shell
for particularisation of this issue for
almost twelve months".  I think it is necessary to pause to note that over a
lengthy period,
as I have described, HJPL has been furnishing particulars and
consistently asserting that the question as to the use, if any, Shell
made of
the confidential information was a matter solely within its knowledge.
<P>

39	The submission continued that the application to administer interrogatories
comes at an important time in the chronology of the
litigation as the trial is
only nine weeks away and the proceedings have been on foot for well in excess
of two years.  The submission
continued that HJPL has "only just" served its
evidence in chief on the issue of misuse of confidential information to which
Shell
will need to devote time and resources, and that Shell also needs to
respond "in the limited time remaining prior to trial" to HJPL's
evidence on
quantum, which still has not been served.
<P>

40	From these circumstances Mr Sullivan submitted that it is fundamentally
unfair to impose the burden of answering such interrogatories:
<b>Residues
Treatment v Southern Resources Limited</b> (Supreme Court of South Australia -
22 November 1988 - unreported) and <b>Southern Pacific Hotel Services Inc v
Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation Limited</b> (Supreme Court of New South
Wales - 10 December 1984 - unreported). He continued that it could not "glibly"
be said that Shell has
ample resources to undertake the task, which answering
the interrogatories would require, and he relied upon further written
submissions
in support of that and, in relation to Ms Seymour, he said that it
could not be assumed that it was not intended to call her and
that in fact she
will be called in response to evidence filed on behalf of HJPL.  From this he
submitted that there were a very large
number of interrogatories, which called
for answers from her, and there was no reason why she could not be asked those
questions
in cross-examination.  He wrote:-
<P>

	<b>"Similar comments apply in relation to many other interrogatories .. which
call for responses from Messrs Lannen, McKenzie, Plaistead
and Harris all of
whom it is intended will be called in Shell's case."</b>
<P>

41	The second basis for the submissions was dealt with under the heading
"Fishing".  Mr Sullivan submitted firstly that the interrogatories
must be
assessed by reference to matters in issue between the parties as disclosed by
the pleading as particularised: <b>Ring-Grip Pty Limited v HPM Industries Pty
Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%201%20NSWLR%20798" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 1 NSWLR 798.</a>  He referred to various other authorities
including <b>Southern Pacific Hotel Services Inc</b> and <b>Residues
Treatment</b> and continued that it followed "inexorably" from them "that any
interrogatories sought to be administered must be strictly confined
to HJPL's
case as pleaded and particularised".
<P>

42	From that he submitted that it became necessary to identify with precision
the allegations of HJPL: <b>John Zink Co Limited v Lloyd's Bank and Airoil
Burner Co</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20RPC%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] RPC 385.</a>  He submitted that paragraph 104 amounted to
nothing more than a bald assertion, which was wholly unparticularised, and that
the
letter of 16 February 1999 furnished particulars of misuse "for the first
time", notwithstanding that Shell had been seeking particularisation
for twelve
months.  I think this submission was misconceived for the reasons I have given.
He submitted that there was reference
to only some restaurants and that HJPL
could not rely on more broadly stated or generalised particulars of misuse "in
circumstances
where it is plain that it has no basis for such an
allegation".
<P>

43	As a secondary submission Mr Sullivan stated that the interrogatories were
too wide and should be confined.
<P>

44	I think it is necessary to go back to the basic submissions made on behalf
of HJPL.  It is that it provided confidential information
to Shell and that it
has discerned in certain of the restaurants features, which lead it to the view
that Shell has misused the information
in respect of restaurants not provided
or used by HJPL.  From those two factors HJPL asks the Court to infer that
Shell has used
the confidential information in breach of the Agreement.
However, HJPL's submissions go further.  They are, firstly, that it may
be
purely coincidental that the likenesses between what is provided in the
confidential information and what is observed have occurred
in the sense that
Shell, or those at Shell responsible for the set-up of the restaurants, did not
have access to the confidential
information and did not use it.  HJPL submits
that this is material entirely within the knowledge of Shell and that it is
entitled
to interrogate to  ascertain what, if any, use Shell made of the
information.
<P>

45	The submission further was that because Shell is a large organisation and
HJPL is unaware of how it functions, it is not able
to say that the inference
between the two facts to which I have referred necessarily follows, as it may
well do in the case, for
example, of the confidential information being
furnished to one architect, whose work then appears to make use of it.
<P>

46	My view is that it is that essential element about which Shell is entitled
to interrogate.  My further view is that it is not
correct to say either that
Shell has not provided particulars, which give rise to these allegations, until
February 1999, nor is
it correct to say that Shell is merely seeking to obtain
the information to make good a case, which it has pleaded but cannot prove.
<P>

47	As to the first point I have set out in some detail the history of the
matter, the particulars which have already been furnished
over a wide range of
matters potentially relevant to the misuse of confidential information, and to
the continued assertion by HJPL
that the use to which Shell has put the
information is within its knowledge.  Hunter J obviously accepted that there
would be some
limitation on the particularisation HJPL  could provide.  I think
also that the parties sought to overcome the difficulties by the
meeting on 9
July 1998 and through some of the correspondence thereafter.
<P>

48	There is a recognition in certain of Mr Sullivan's submissions that the
knowledge of Shell of the use to which it put the information
is relevant.
This emerges from his statements that Ms Seymour and Messrs Lannen, McKenzie,
Plaistead and Harris are intended to be
called and that they may be
cross-examined conformably with a number of questions the interrogatories
direct to them. Also certain
of his specific objections to particular
interrogatories were based on the fact that those persons would be called.  I
shall assume
that the witnesses to whom Mr Sullivan has referred in his written
submissions will be called, the consequence of that being that
it will be
necessary for witness statements to be prepared for them.  The consequence of
the necessity to prepare witness statements
is that they will have to be
interviewed about matters relevant to the pleadings and, in this context, to
the allegation in paragraph
104.  I should add that there is not presently
before the Court any application to strike out that paragraph.  Mr Sullivan's
submissions,
in my respectful opinion, accept that these witnesses will all be
relevant to the issue posed by paragraph 104.  In these circumstances
proper
preparation of the case demands that they be asked about those matters and, in
so far as they propose to give evidence either
in chief or in reply about them,
that that evidence be set forth in a written statement.  Accordingly, much of
the ground required
to be covered in answering the interrogatories will, almost
of necessity, have to be traversed in conference.  Even if the decision
is
taken not to lead any evidence from those witnesses about the matters raised in
paragraph 104 it is inconceivable, in my view,
that a proper preparation of the
case would not require that, in the circumstances as they presently exist, viz
the knowledge of
the potential cross-examination, those witnesses will not be
interviewed by the representatives of Shell about such matters.  If
Shell
accepts that they may be cross-examined about them then clearly it would wish
to be aware of what they are likely to say under
such cross-examination and,
certainly, as the issues are formulated, I can see no objection to Shell's
legal representatives obtaining
such information from those intended
witnesses.
<P>

49	At one stage during the submissions Mr Hutley suggested that the matter
could be shortened by Mr Sullivan stating that he would
call in Shell's case
all persons who had access to the confidential information.  He submitted that
if that were to be done then
he would be able to cross-examine each and every
relevant witness as to the use made of it.  Mr Sullivan, as he was entitled to
do,
stated that he would be calling such witnesses as he considered it
appropriate to call in Shell's case, which, as I understand it,
meant the ones
he identified.  That, however, tends to point up the dilemma confronting Mr
Hutley.  Let it be assumed for example
that one of the witnesses called for
Shell stated that he made no use of the confidential information but, without
more, passed it
on to another officer of Shell, who is not called.  In those
circumstances HJPL has no opportunity to cross-examine that witness
although if
the interrogatories are allowed the fact that that officer received the
confidential information and the use that he
or she made of it would appear
from the answers.
<P>

50	There is a further point, which in my view is of particular significance in
a case such as this.  The use to which Shell put
the confidential information
may not only have resulted in Shell's doing something, which is discernible,
but it may also have resulted
in Shell's refraining from doing something, which
is not discernible.  For example Shell may have made use of certain of the
information
furnished to refrain from establishing a restaurant at a certain
site, or it may have used the information to modify or alter its
plans as to
the type or extent of the restaurant it set up at a certain site.  These
matters would not or may well not, in the absence
of interrogatories, be known
to HJPL from its observation of what Shell has done or is doing.  None-the-less
it cannot be suggested
that it would not be relevant, and that is the
appropriate touchstone as I would understand it, to HJPL's complaint about
Shell's
alleged misuse of the confidential information.  This is essentially a
case which depends upon an examination of information solely
within Shell's
knowledge.  In the absence of any undertaking to call all persons to whom the
confidential information went within
Shell cross-examination of such witnesses
as Shell calls will not necessarily disclose all that it knows.  HJPL has made
it clear
at all times that this is a situation it may confront.  I do not
consider that HJPL should be precluded from seeking to make that
case merely
because it cannot particularise each and every action which Shell took or
failed to take in reliance on the confidential
information.  I say this against
the background of the fact that in my opinion HJPL has provided quite fulsome
particulars over a
long period of the type of allegations it is seeking to
make.  
<P>

51	It is now necessary to consider the authorities to which I was referred to
see whether this point of view is supported by them.
 Mr Sullivan submitted
that Mr Hutley had not taken me to the decision in <b>Rockwell
International</b>, notwithstanding that it was annexed to his written
submissions, because it was not a case which, on analysis, favoured them.
<P>

52	The headnote stated:-
<P>

	<b>"In an action for infringement of copyright in manufacturing drawings
relating to plug valves, the defence contained a bare denial
of infringement.
The plaintiffs served interrogatories concerning the design of the valve
complained of.  The Master ordered certain
of the interrogatories to be
answered but disallowed others.  The defendants appealed and the plaintiffs
cross-appealed.</b>
<P>

<b>	Held, allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, </b>
<P>

<b>	(1) the interrogatories sought evidence of the detailed history of the
defendants' design and development of their valve.  In effect,
they were
directed to asking the defendants: `Tell us what you did'.  That was not
allowable.  A plaintiff was entitled to interrogate
a defendant as to facts
which tended to support the plaintiff's case or to impeach the defendant's
case, but not as to facts which
supported the defendant's case.</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>	(2)  The interrogatories were, and were intended to be, fishing.  The
plaintiffs wanted to fish out information in the hope that
it would either
support the plaintiffs' case or enable them to know what part or parts of their
case to abandon.  As such the interrogatories
were not allowable."</b>
<P>

53	Contrary to Mr Sullivan's submission, I consider that the decision in
<b>Rockwell Corporation</b> supports the submissions of Mr Hutley.  At p.195
Falconer J said:-
<P>

	<b>"I would observe that no doubt the plaintiffs could have sought to
interrogate as to whether, in designing a particular part or parts,
it was
derived from the plaintiffs' DB valve; that is to say, whether or not it had
been copied.  But that is not what the interrogatories
have done.  As is
apparent from a consideration of the interrogatories, what they have done is
sought to interrogate the defendants
on the lines simply of: `tell us what you
did'."</b>
<P>

54	At the risk of repetition it is clear to me that HJPL is seeking to
interrogate to ascertain the use to which Shell put the confidential
information both positively and negatively in the senses I have sought to
describe.  That, in my opinion, is directly analogous to
the type of
interrogatory Falconer J considered was permissible.
<P>

55	After a lengthy consideration of the authorities his Lordship continued, at
p.205:-
<P>

	<b>"Finally, without looking at any authorities, I would also refer to the
well-established practice as to interrogatories in patent
actions, whereby
although a plaintiff in such an action may administer interrogatories framed on
parts of the specification and ask
the defendant whether he used the process
described therein in forming part of his invention, taking them step by step,
he may not
go further and ask: if you do not use that process, tell me what you
do use."</b>
<P>

56	In my view the thrust of Mr Hutley's interrogatories is sanctioned by that
which his Lordship considered was permissible.
<P>

57	The unsuccessful party sought leave to appeal, which Slade LJ, in a short
judgment, refused.
<P>

58	Mr Sullivan placed heavy reliance upon the decision in <b>John Zink Company
Limited</b>.  That case was concerned with an application to strike out a
Statement of Claim, which alleged that a former employee of the plaintiff
had
wrongly disclosed trade secrets to the second defendant, which was a trading
competitor.  The former employee denied the allegations
and asked for
particulars, which were not provided.  Prior to the matter coming before
Templeman J, the Court of Appeal had ordered
the plaintiff to provide
particulars before the defendants were required to file a Defence.  The
broadness of the allegations made
in the originating process can be seen from
the portion from the judgment of Russell LJ cited at p.387:-
<P>

	<b>"It will then be known what are the matters which are said to be trade
secrets or confidential matter, and not simply the areas in
which or the
matters in respect of which it is said that the plaintiffs are or were so to
speak proprietors of trade secrets or information
that was confidential ..   In
so far as the plaintiffs' rights have been breached or infringed by the first
defendant .. or by procurement
by the second defendant, presumably the
plaintiffs have at present some ground for their assertions in those regards,
and can add
to particulars if later other such grounds emerge on
discovery."</b>
<P>

59	HJPL is in the position that it does have some particulars to which,
conformably with the statement I have just quoted, it should
be entitled to add
in the circumstances to which his Lordship referred.
<P>

60	There were similar statements by the other Lord Justices of Appeal, which
are quoted at p.387.
<P>

61	Templeman J then turned to consider the sufficiency of the particulars
furnished.  In his consideration of them it is quite clear
that his Lordship
was satisfied that the particulars did not disclose a case.
<P>

62	His Lordship nextly considered whether the Statement of Claim constituted an
abuse of the Court's process, which he concluded
it did.  He said:-
<P>

	<b>"Each case must turn on its own particular facts.  But having read the
pleadings, the Statement of Claim and the particulars, and
the one instance
where some attempt is made to remove the sting that this is a purely
speculative action, I am satisfied in my own
mind that these pleadings are an
abuse of the process of the Court and I propose to strike them out and dismiss
the action."</b>
<P>

63	That case is far removed from the present.  There is no application to
strike out HJPL's present pleadings in relation to confidential
information on
the ground that it does not disclose a cause of action.  Indeed it is accepted
that there is an issue proffered to
which Shell has pleaded and which has been
particularised, although Mr Sullivan does not accept it has been adequately
particularised.
 It is also accepted, as the submissions to which I have
referred make clear, that Shell will be calling witnesses to respond to
that
issue and there may be cross-examination of them on the issue of the use made
of the confidential information.  That is a totally
different situation from
that considered in <b>John Zink</b>.  
<P>

64	In <b>Southern Pacific Hotel Services</b> there was a claim for damages for
breach of contract in which an order had been made for the administering of
interrogatories.  This
led to the defendant filing and serving a Notice to
Answer Interrogatories comprising three volumes totalling 504 pages of
typescript,
which were accompanied by two volumes of similar size containing
copy documents described as annexures to the interrogatories.  This
amounted,
according to his Honour, to some 15,000 separate questions.  His Honour was of
the view by merely surveying the interrogatories
and accompanying documents
that the task involved in answering them "would be enormously taxing and time
consuming".  There was some
reduction in the number, but his Honour took the
view that he did not need to decide between the competing assertions in any
precise
way because it was clear that the relevant persons to be consulted for
the purpose of providing answers were Canadian residents,
and he was satisfied
that the interrogatories could not be answered in time for the commencement of
the trial and, further, that
any attempt at answering them would gravely impede
the plaintiff's preparation for trial having regard to the amount of time that
would be involved.  Finally his Honour was satisfied that the cost would be
vast.
<P>

65	His Honour considered the particular circumstances of that case and, in the
course of so doing, stated, correctly in my respectful
opinion, that a party
cannot plead a case "and then, by an oppressive set of interrogatories, seek to
ascertain whether it can be
made good".  The case to which his Honour was
referring was whether an agreement was a sham.  He was not considering a case
where
an essential element was solely within the knowledge of the party being
interrogated, nor where it was conceded that witnesses called
on behalf of the
defendant could be cross-examined on the matters as to which they were sought
to be interrogated.  His Honour was
also considering a case where there was,
prima facie, great oppression from the very number of interrogatories asked.
<P>

66	In a subsequent judgment in the same matter of 13 December 1984, his Honour
referred to the necessity for the party seeking leave
to administer further
interrogatories to affirmatively satisfy the Court that the interests of
justice in the particular case required
that leave be granted: <b>Goding v
Queensland Newspapers Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1965/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20113%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 113 CLR 170</a> and <b>Wildier Pty Limited
v Lee</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%209%20ACLR%20222" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 9 ACLR 222.</a>  In the present case I am so satisfied that
interrogatories should be permitted because I consider it is in the interests
of justice
that HJPL should be aware of the use, both at a positive and
negative level, which Shell made of the confidential information, that
being
solely a matter within the knowledge of Shell.
<P>

67	His Honour was also of the view that there would be an unnecessary
distraction in the preparation of the case.  That case differs
from the present
case in which, as I have noted, statements are to be prepared from a number of
people, who will be witnesses and
to whom the interrogatories will be directed.
For the reasons I have given it seems to me that Shell, in the proper
preparation of
its case, will seek to ascertain that information in the
preparation of its case.  There is, accordingly, a further reason for not
holding that the answering of the interrogatories would be oppressive.
Further, in my opinion, the number and content of the interrogatories
does not,
of itself, bespeak oppression.  Nor does the time within which they are to be
answered (although I would consider an extension)
in the context of the
preparation for the hearing.
<P>

68	In <b>Coal Cliff Collieries</b> Clarke J considered the practice in the
Commercial List.  He expressed the view that there are a number of cases in the
List in which
interrogatories fulfil a useful purpose and in which it would be
inimicable to the interests of justice to refuse the parties access
to a
procedural device, which could facilitate proof of particular facts, save costs
or cut delays.  In my opinion, the present is
such a case.  He referred, by way
of an example to the facilitation of proof of particular facts, to the
authority of an agent, a
matter closely analogous to if not the same as one
involving information solely within the knowledge of one party.
<P>

69	At p.705 his Honour said that commercial Judges must be astute to ensure
that interrogatories are only ordered in those cases
"in which they are
necessary".  He referred to the proper definition of issues and quoted from the
decision in <b>American Flange</b>, which accepted the general principle that
interrogatories are in the discretion of the Court and will only be allowed
when they
are necessary for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for
saving costs.  It further provided that they must be limited to
facts that will
support the case of the interrogating party or cut down the case of his
opponent.  The present interrogatories satisfy
those criteria.
<P>

70	At p.707 his Honour said:-
<P>

	<b>"As a general rule it will be necessary, for instance, for the applicant to
show that the provision of the answers will, or may, provide
relevant
information (such as admissions of facts and other material such as would
facilitate the just and expeditious disposal of
the proceedings) which the
interrogating party has been able to extract from his opponent.  Because,
however, of pre-trial procedures
in the Court and its requirement that the
parties make all admissions or concessions necessary to focus attention on the
nature of
the real dispute I envisage that an order will be unnecessary in many
cases.  In particular the Court will be unlikely to accede
to a submission that
`pretty nearly anything that is material may be asked'."</b>
<P>

71	In my opinion the general thrust of the interrogatories HJPL seeks to
administer meets these tests.
<P>

72	In <b>Residues Treatment</b> Perry J was confronted with a large number of
interrogatories, which were alleged to be prolix and oppressive.  They occupied
a book
of some 112 pages and there were annexed documents.  His Honour referred
to various authorities, including <b>Coal Cliff Collieries</b>.  He accepted
that that was authority for facilitating proof and said that facilitating proof
did not mean providing a means by which
the plaintiffs may make out their cause
of action, which they otherwise lack.  The present is not such a case.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

73	In my opinion HJPL should be entitled to administer the interrogatories,
which are Exhibit A, subject only to a consideration
of any particular
interrogatories to which particular objection is taken.  I note that
interrogatory 15 is not pressed by Mr Hutley.
Mr Sullivan has handed me a list
of the particular interrogatories to which objection is taken and, if
necessary, I will deal with
those specific objections.  I can summarise the
reasons why, in the exercise of my discretion I consider it is appropriate to
grant
HJPL the leave it seeks.
<P>

74	Firstly, the interrogatories clearly go to a matter in issue.  Secondly, the
interrogatories are framed, in relation to that
issue, in a permissible form.
Thirdly, the interrogatories seek to advance HJPL's case and to derogate from
Shell's case in relation
to matter which is solely within the knowledge of
Shell.  Fourthly, Shell proposes to call a number of witnesses and concedes
that
they may be cross-examined in relation to the matters raised by the
interrogatories.  Implicit in this concession is that such cross-examination
would be relevant to a matter other than credit.  However, Shell has not
undertaken, and I do not say this in any critical way of
it, that it will call
all witnesses relevant to that issue.  Having regard to the nature of the issue
I consider that HJPL is entitled
to ascertain what other witnesses may be
relevant to it.  The interrogatories are accordingly designed not to see
whether HJPL has
a case, but rather to advance the case, which it has pleaded
and particularised in some detail.  Fifthly, in so far as it is said
that it
will be oppressive in the preparation of the case to require these questions to
be answered a number of the witnesses will
have to be interviewed and
statements taken from them.  The effect of the interrogatories will be to
direct their attention to the
precise matters likely to be the subject of the
cross-examination.  On this point the further matter arises that if the
interrogatories
are answered time may well be saved in Court by making
cross-examination, at least in relation to this issue, unnecessary by virtue
of
the tendering of the answers to the interrogatories.  I regard this as an
important matter for consideration provided the interrogatories
otherwise
satisfy the various tests to which I have referred.  For the reasons I have
sought to give I am satisfied they do.
<P>

75	I have published these reasons as expeditiously as possible so that the
parties may be aware of my views.  I do not intend thereby
to preclude Shell
arguing objections to specific interrogatories or HJPL reconsidering either
those objections or the form of other
interrogatories which may, in the light
of what I have said, be modified or refined.  The reason I have adopted this
course, obviously
enough, is so that the parties may proceed with the
preparation of the case on the basis that the interrogatories will, at least
substantially, have to be answered.
<P>

76	I shall stand the Notice of Motion over until Friday, 5 March 1999 and I
propose to reserve the costs of the argument before
me on 19 February 1999,
although my present inclination is that Shell should pay HJPL's costs of that
day.  I grant leave to any
party to apply on two days' or such shorter notice
as a Judge of the Court may allow.
<P>
