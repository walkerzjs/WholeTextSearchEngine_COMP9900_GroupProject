<P>

<b>BERGIN J</b>
<P>

<b>DATE: 22 NOVEMBER 1999</b>
<P>

<b>20875/96 - WALTER VIGNOLI v SYDNEY HARBOUR CASINO PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	This is an assessment of damages arising out of an action
brought by the plaintiff, Walter Vignoli, against the Sydney Harbour
Casino Pty
Limited  (the Casino) for false imprisonment arising out of events which
occurred on Thursday 20 June, l996 at the Casino.
<P>

2   	The matter was commenced by way of Statement of Claim filed
in August 1996 and liability was admitted on 25 October, l999.
 The matter was
heard by me on 10,11 &amp; 12 November, l999 when Mr B W Collins QC leading Mr
T Hughes of counsel appeared for the
plaintiff and Mr F S McAlary QC leading Ms
L McCallum of counsel appeared for the defendant.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff</b>
<P>

3   	The plaintiff came to Australia from Uruguay in August
1972.  After working as a welder and studying English five nights a
week he had
made enough money by 1975 to purchase his first business, a kiosk in the Royal
South Sydney Hospital at Zetland.  He
sold that business in 1980 and acquired a
laundromat in East Sydney.  He also purchased an Italian restaurant, Il
Bolognese, which
he operated with his wife at the same time as operating the
laundromat. 
<P>

4   	In 1983 the plaintiff acquired a chicken shop in the
Lindfield Arcade where he worked six days a week.  By 1985 he was in a
position
to purchase his first home in Turramurra with the assistance of a bank loan.
<P>

5   	In 1988 the plaintiff sold the business in Lindfield and it
was during this year that he also invested in property in Queensland.
 At about
this time his marriage broke up and his wife returned to Uruguay.  In 1990 he
purchased his current business which is a
delicatessen in Willoughby.  In 1994
he met his partner, Mary Bryant, with whom he lives.  Ms Bryant manages the
delicatessen.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff said that from an early age he has always
enjoyed gambling.  He regards it as his only pastime.  He described
it with
warmth indicating that he was proud to become a member of what is known as the
Endeavour Club at the Casino.  The plaintiff
said it was a club for "special
players".  The Endeavour Club provides special benefits to its members
including the capacity to
place larger bets than non-members,  free dining in
the restaurant and free parking in the special car park for Endeavour Club
members.
 The members are able to gamble in the Endeavour Room but are also
able to attend the general area of the Casino should they wish
to gamble in
that area.  
<P>

7   	Other benefits include invitations to special functions at
the Casino and participation in special promotions.  The plaintiff
was advised
by letter of 12 June 1996, sent to his home, of one such special promotion
known as the "Casino Gold Giveaway".  This
letter was from the VIP Service
Director, Mr Keith Lamb, and advised the plaintiff of the method by which he
could have the chance
of winning $25,000 and/or $200,000 in gold bullion.
There was also reference to a recent promotion known as the "BMW Giveaway".
<P>

8   	Prior to 20 June 1996 it was the plaintiff's habit to
gamble at the Casino about four or five times a week.  He had received
his
winnings both in cash and by cheque.  On occasions he had been overpaid and had
repaid amounts when requested.  On one occasion
in December 1995 a Pit Manager
identified only as Ken with badge number 121 informed the plaintiff that he had
been overpaid $2,000.
 
<P>

9   	The plaintiff asked the Pit Manager if he could see the
video and was informed that it was not the policy of the Casino to
show patrons
the videos.  He said that he paid the $2,000 back on that occasion without
pressing to see the video because he was
playing $15,000 at two tables and he
did not want to lose concentration.
<P>

<b>The Events of 20 June 1996</b>
<P>

<b>Late afternoon to 6pm</b>
<P>

10   	In the late afternoon of Thursday 20 June 1996, the
plaintiff was at the office of his solicitor, Mr Stewart Levitt, in Castlereagh
Street Sydney.  Mr Levitt was running a little behind schedule for his
appointments for the day and the plaintiff decided to go to
the Casino rather
than sit and wait in Mr Levitt's waiting room.  
<P>

11   	At the Casino the plaintiff gambled on roulette tables 29
and 30.  These roulette tables were adjacent to each other and the
plaintiff
placed numerous bets on both tables, the wheels of which were spun every few
minutes but not simultaneously.  
<P>

12   	At each table there is a dealer and a supervisor.  A Pit
Manager supervises  the roulette tables and also other tables, including
blackjack, in the designated area.
<P>

13   	After playing the roulette tables for about an hour and
just before 6 pm the plaintiff used his mobile phone to telephone
the
receptionist at Mr Levitt's office to find out how many people were by then
waiting to see Mr Levitt.  He was informed that nobody
else was waiting to see
Mr Levitt at that time so he decided to return to Mr Levitt's office to see
him.  He then placed his final
bets but did not win anything on this final spin
of the wheel.
<P>

<b>The Overpayment</b>
<P>

14   	Prior to moving from the tables to cash in his chips the
plaintiff was approached by a supervisor who informed him that there
had been
an overpayment of $1,250 made to him 20 minutes earlier which had been observed
on video.  He informed the supervisor that
he could not remember how many chips
he had been given 20 minutes earlier but that he was happy to give the $1,250
to the Casino
if he could see the video to confirm the overpayment had
occurred.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff was informed that it was not the policy to
show patrons the video which brought a response from him that if
he was unable
to see the video he was not going to pay the claimed amount to the Casino.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff then moved away from the tables and went to
the cashier and cashed in his chips.  At approximately 6 pm he then
approached
the door leading to the car park.
<P>

<b>Mr Vignoli's first attempt to leave at 6pm</b>
<P>

17   	At the exit door of the Casino a security officer said to
the plaintiff  "Please wait here.  The manager would like to talk
to you."  He
was then approached by the Pit Manager who told him that he had been overpaid
$1,250.  The plaintiff responded  "I have
no idea if I have been overpaid.  I
have been informed by your supervisor about that.  I already told your
supervisor that I will
be very happy to give you your money back if you in fact
show me where the overpayment occurred and how many chips I was paid"
<P>

18   	The Pit Manager informed the plaintiff that it was against
Casino policy to show videos to patrons.  The Pit Manager then
called another
officer of the Casino over to join them. That officer, Mr Toole, who had first
made the plaintiff's acquaintance at
Jupiters Casino some years earlier then
moved with the plaintiff some distance back from the exit doors of the Casino
to an area
in the foyer where there were a number of seats.  A conversation
then ensued in which Mr Toole said to the plaintiff  `Walter we
have known each
other for a long time, I know you from Jupiters, you are an honest man, just
give us the money back".
<P>

19   	The plaintiff responded that it was true that they had
known each other for a long time but he wanted to ascertain if he had
in fact
been overpaid and requested Mr Toole to organise a viewing of the video.  The
plaintiff informed Mr Toole that he had to
leave at that time to attend an
important appointment with his solicitor.  He said that he was at the Casino
almost every day and
that Mr Toole knew who he was and where he was and he said
"please allow me to go".
<P>

20   	Mr Toole declined to show the plaintiff the video and told
him that he should not leave with the money.  The plaintiff said
 "Am I under
arrest here?  Are you keeping me here against my will?" to which Mr Toole
responded  "no, no, you can leave, you are
not under arrest, that is something
I do not want to do".  The plaintiff then started walking towards the exit door
of the Casino.
<P>

<b>Mr Vignoli's second attempt to leave at 6 15 pm</b>
<P>

21   	As the plaintiff walked towards the door no less than six
Casino employees walked parallel to and around him as he approached
and was
stopped by the security officer at the door.  That officer blocked the
plaintiff's path and took what could be reasonably
described as an aggressive
stance in front of him and told him he was not leaving.  The other six
employees then took up positions
in a wide circle around the plaintiff who was
then approached again by Mr Toole and another Casino employee, Mr Vail.
<P>

22   	Mr Toole then escorted the plaintiff back from the exit
door to another man standing back in the foyer.  Mr Toole said "Walter,
this is
our boss, Vince" to which the man responded "I am not your boss, we do not work
for each other, I am the government inspector".
 During the conversation Vince
(apparently Mr Vince Verzi) told the plaintiff that he was the government
inspector and if he wished
to make a complaint he, Mr Verzi, could watch the
video on his behalf.  
<P>

23   	The plaintiff informed Mr Verzi that he wanted to see the
video himself as it was not the first time that he had experienced
problems
with overpayments.  He also informed Mr Verzi that he was late for an important
appointment.  He told him he could watch
the video and tell him another day but
he wanted to leave to keep his appointment. 
<P>

<b>Mr Vignoli taken to the Endeavour Room office at 6.20 pm</b>
<P>

24   	The plaintiff was then taken by Mr Toole and Mr Vail to an
office in the Endeavour Room not far from the area where these
discussions and
manoeuvrings had been taking place.  Mr Vail and Mr Toole left the plaintiff in
the office with Mr Brant Bedwell,
the Casino Manager, and Mr Keith Lamb, the
VIP Service Director, to whom I have already referred.
<P>

25   	Mr Bedwell said "Just give us $1,250 and you can leave
immediately".  The plaintiff informed Mr Bedwell that he was not sure
whether
there had been an overpayment and he wanted to have a look at the video to
confirm that an overpayment had occurred.  Mr
Bedwell informed him that there
was a Casino policy that prohibited the showing of a video to a patron.
<P>

26   	The following conversation then occurred;
<P>

Mr Vignoli		I've got the money in my pocket. Let's find 
<P>

			a solution.  Show me the video.
<P>

Mr Bedwell		I already told you we don't show the video to 					patrons.
<P>

Mr Vignoli		Well you have in fact by now by the manners of your 					bouncers
kept me here against my will. What are you					going
to do next? Are you going
to get two or three 					bouncers hold me by the hands, ...and take the
money from me?
<P>

Mr Bedwell		No the police will do that for us.
<P>

27   	The government inspector then came into the office, handed
the plaintiff his card and signalled to Mr Bedwell to go with him
out of the
office.  The plaintiff and Mr Lamb were then alone in the office.  The
plaintiff gave the following evidence;
<P>

Mr Lamb says to me that he was so sorry, he just arrived at the Casino, that he
wished he would have been there earlier on because
he could see how upset I was
and he apologised for what they have done to me.
<P>

28   	The following conversation then took place;
<P>

Mr Lamb	Look we don't show videos to patrons but if you want me to I 
<P>

		can go and have a look personally.
<P>

Mr Vignoli	Keith this has become a matter of principle now. I have been 
<P>

		held here against my will and I will seek legal advice regarding 
<P>

		this. How can you do this to me? You know the $1,250 is what I 
<P>

		give the girls in tips on a good night. How can you think I can 
<P>

		steal the money?
<P>

Mr Lamb	I know the money isn't an issue, Walter, it is just that we have to 
<P>

		follow rules.
<P>

29   	Mr Bedwell then returned to the office and said;
<P>

Mr Vignoli, this is your last chance before I call the police and the police
will charge you with stealing.
<P>

Mr Vignoli responded;
<P>

How can I be charged with stealing? You have told me that you have made an
error, you have made a mistake, you allege that you overpaid
me money, how can
I be charged with stealing?
<P>

Mr Bedwell said;
<P>

Well the police are going to be called.
<P>

Mr Vignoli said;
<P>

Well, this is getting out of hand. This is really getting out of hand but if
that's the way that you want to proceed call the police,
I've got nothing to
fear, I haven't stolen any money, I haven't put my hand behind the roulette
wheel and taken the chips.
<P>

Mr Bedwell said;
<P>

You are going to be taken to the investigation room and you are going to wait
for the police in there.
<P>

Mr Lamb then said to Mr Bedwell;
<P>

Why don't we wait for the police here.
<P>

30   	The office in which Mr Lamb suggested the plaintiff wait
was larger and more comfortable than the Investigation Room.  However
Mr Lamb's
suggestion was rejected silently by Mr Bedwell who left the room.  Another
Casino employee, Mr Dunn, entered the office
and said to the plaintiff  "You're
coming with us to the Investigation Room".
<P>

<b>Trip to the Investigation Room at 6.55pm</b>
<P>

31   	As the plaintiff left the office he was escorted by Mr
Dunn and two uniformed security officers who were waiting outside the
office
when he emerged.  The first part of the trip required him to walk the full
length of the Endeavour Room which is probably
a little less than the distance
between Phillip Street and Macquarie Street at Queens Square.  The plaintiff
estimated that there
would have be about fifty to sixty people whom he
recognised as regular patrons in the Endeavour Room at this time.
<P>

32   	Mr Dunn walked next to the plaintiff who fairly conceded
in cross examination that the distance between them was "the distance
most
people are when they are walking along together".  The two security officers
walked about five or six feet behind Mr Dunn and
the plaintiff.  This was the
configuration until the plaintiff arrived at the men's toilet near the lifts
and turned right to enter
that room.  
<P>

33   	Although Mr Dunn initially followed the plaintiff into the
men's toilet he emerged fairly quickly to stand in the corridor
immediately
outside the door.  The two uniformed security officers (joined by a third for a
short time) stood opposite Mr Dunn in
the corridor opposite the men's toilet
door.  Whist waiting they began to pace around outside the door and other
patrons had to thread
their way through this group awaiting the plaintiff's
return.
<P>

34   	When the plaintiff emerged the trip continued to the lift
where he objected to the presence of what he called the "bouncers".
 He said
"Why do you have to take me like this?  You are taking me like a criminal.  Why
are you doing this?  I am not going to run
away, why can't you come with me and
leave these other two persons back?" 
<P>

35   	One of the security officers/bouncers told him not to
worry because they were only going as far as the lift and Mr Dunn would
escort
him for the remainder of the trip.  However one of the security officers
travelled with Mr Dunn and the plaintiff in the lift
with another patron who
had been observing the plaintiff's discussion with the security officer.
<P>

36   	Inconsistently with what he had just been told, when the
lift arrived at the lower floor Mr Dunn once again walked with the
plaintiff
the full length of that floor and again with two security officers walking
about five to six feet behind them.  The plaintiff
was then taken into the room
designated as the Investigation Room and the security officers stood in the
corridor outside.
<P>

<b>The Investigation Room </b>
<P>

<b>7 pm to 10pm</b>
<P>

37   	When they reached the Investigation Room at approximately
7 pm Mr Dunn informed the plaintiff that  "the police have just
been called.  I
have no idea when the police will arrive.  Sit down".  The plaintiff complied
and sat down.  He was provided with
a cool soft drink and Mr Dunn asked him for
his Players Card.  He gave his card to Mr Dunn and said  "This has really got
out of
hand hasn't it?" to which Mr Dunn responded  "Yes, it appears so".
<P>

38   	The Investigation Room is a small room.  The dimensions
were described by the plaintiff as two by two/three metres.  It contained
two
chairs but when Mr Dunn sat down on the other chair there was only about two
feet between the two men.  Mr Dunn remained that
close to the plaintiff while
he made a call to his solicitor, Mr Levitt and while he called his partner Ms
Bryant.
<P>

39   	The plaintiff was then "guarded" by various officers of
the Casino either sitting or standing in the room with him.  There
were also
employees standing outside the Investigation Room door.  
<P>

40   	At about 8 pm the plaintiff needed to go to the toilet and
a number of security staff said that they were going to escort
him.  He
objected to this saying "look there's no need for me to be taken to the
bathroom.  I don't want to bolt out.  Please let
me go and I'm not going to
leave this place".  The security officer responded "that's not possible we have
to go with you, but we
are not going to get into the toilet with you, we are
just going to wait outside the door".
<P>

41   	By this stage, 8 pm, the Casino was fairly crowded and it
was necessary to walk the full length of the lower floor to attend
the general
public toilet on that level.  The plaintiff was walked to the bathroom with one
security guard on his right and two others
nearby.  The security guards then
waited outside the door for the plaintiff to return and escorted  him back to
the Investigation
Room.
<P>

42   	At about 8.30 pm two police officers arrived and informed
the plaintiff that they had been called in by the Government Inspector
and an
accusation of stealing had been made against him.  They asked the plaintiff to
sit down whilst they obtained further information
from the Casino staff.
<P>

43   	At this stage the plaintiff telephoned his solicitor again
who asked to speak with the police officers.  
<P>

44   	At about 8.45 pm the police returned to the Investigation
Room and informed the plaintiff that there was an allegation that
he had been
overpaid $1250.  He then informed the police that he had not stolen anything
and that he only wanted to verify what had
happened by looking at the video.
<P>

45   	The plaintiff then telephoned Mr Levitt again and handed
the telephone to one of the police officers who spoke to Mr Levitt.
 At the
conclusion of that conversation the police informed the plaintiff that they
were going to wait until Mr Levitt arrived before
anything further occurred.
<P>

46   	After this conversation the plaintiff again needed to
attend the bathroom.  Once again he was escorted by the security officers.
 On
his return to the Investigation Room Mr Levitt telephoned the plaintiff to
inform him that he was only three minutes from the
Casino and that he would be
there soon.
<P>

47   	Mr Bedwell then came into the Investigation Room and said
to the plaintiff  "this is your last chance before the police charge
you with
stealing.  If you don't give us the money now in addition to that I will ban
you from the Casino for twelve months.  So
I advise you to pay the money
immediately".  He responded "the way you have treated me today I'm not going to
be in a hurry to come
back to the Casino and like I said before, I'm not going
to give you the money back until I can verify your overpayment."  Mr Bedwell
then said "well, you have been informed by us and by the Government Inspector
that an overpayment has occurred."  The plaintiff responded
"I haven't been
informed and I would like to repeat this, I haven't been informed by any
Government Inspector that an overpayment
has occurred".  Mr Bedwell then said
that he would get the Government Inspector to come in immediately.
<P>

48   	A Government Inspector, Mr Stacey Gaviry then attended the
Investigation Room.  After some discussion about the whereabouts
of the
Government Inspector who had spoken to the plaintiff earlier in the evening, Mr
Gaviry said that he would look at the video.
 The plaintiff said "by all means
have a look at the video and tell me".  
<P>

<b>Mr Levitt's arrival at the Casino</b>
<P>

49   	Mr Levitt arrived at the Casino at approximately 9.25 pm.
On his arrival at the Casino he spoke to two people at the front
door of the
Casino who appeared to him to be security guards.  He said "I'm a solicitor.  I
want to see my client who I understand
is being detained and maybe being
interviewed by police.  His name is Mr Vignoli.  Could you show me where he
is?"  The security
officer then appeared to speak on what Mr Levitt described
as a "walkie-talkie" and then said to Mr Levitt "you can't come in until
the
Casino officials have finished talking to him".  
<P>

50   	This understandably precipitated an objection from Mr
Levitt who then informed the security officer that he wrote a column
in an
Eastern Suburbs publication and that he would give the fact that he had been
prevented from seeing his client some publicity.
 The security officer then
"laughed and smirked" and Mr Levitt then said "if you don't think much of the
Messenger how about the
Herald?  I will ensure that this gets all the publicity
it deserves that you denied me access to my client."
<P>

51   	By this stage the plaintiff had been visited by the
Government Inspector again whom he had asked to wait for Mr Levitt's arrival
so
that he could discuss the matter in his presence.  Mr Bedwell and Mr Dunn then
came to the Investigation Room whilst the plaintiff
was on the telephone to Mr
Levitt who had telephoned him to ask him whether he minded him contacting the
Sydney Morning Herald as
he was not being permitted access to see him.  The
plaintiff informed Mr Levitt that it was up to him to do whatever it took to
obtain
access to him.
<P>

52   	The plaintiff mentioned the Sydney Morning Herald whilst
he was on the telephone and it was during this call that the Government
Inspector left the Investigation Room and Mr Dunn and Mr Bedwell also departed.
When the call was finished Mr Dunn came into the
Investigation Room and said to
Mr Vignoli "nobody is stopping your lawyer from coming in here.  He is coming
right now.  He is coming
right now."  At approximately 10 pm Mr Levitt was
permitted access to the plaintiff.  He had waited from approximately 9.25 pm
although
there had been a five minute delay while Mr Levitt was on the
telephone to the SMH journalist.
<P>

<b>Finding an interim solution 10 pm to 12.30 am</b>
<P>

53   	Mr Levitt made offers to the Casino in an attempt to find
an interim solution whilst the dispute was further explored.  They
included an
offer that the money be placed in a joint trust account of Mr Levitt and the
Casino's solicitor and an offer that the
money be placed into a trust account
under the control of the Casino's solicitor.  
<P>

54   	Although the actual discussions did not take a great deal
of time there were "periods of stand offs" which were long intervals.
These
offers were rejected and the Casino staff informed Mr Levitt that once the
money was paid to the Casino it would go back onto
the tables.  
<P>

55   	In cross examination Mr Levitt gave evidence that "all the
propositions were coming from me, so I would put a proposition,
they would come
back" and reject it and "I would have to think of another proposition".  He
said there were delays between him coming
up with a proposition and with
"cooling off periods in between".
<P>

56   	By about midnight it was agreed that the police would hold
the money as "stakeholders" until the dispute about whether there
had been an
overpayment could be settled or finalised in some way.
<P>

<b>Surveillance Video</b>
<P>

57   	The majority of the events involving the plaintiff at the
Casino from 5pm until 10.40 pm on 20 June 1996 were captured on
the
surveillance video. (Ex. C &amp; D)  There was no film of the meeting with
Messrs Lamb and Bedwell in the office in the Endeavour
Room before the
plaintiff was taken to the Investigation Room on the lower floor.  The film
only captured the entry into and exit
from that office.  
<P>

58   	There was no film of the plaintiff being escorted to and
from the men's toilet during the period he was in the Investigation
Room
although the "guarding" of the door at the men's toilet in the Endeavour Room
was captured on film as the group escorted the
plaintiff from the Endeavour
Room to the Investigation Room.
<P>

59   	Although the plaintiff was always "guarded" by at least
one Casino employee either standing or sitting with him his every
action was
filmed as he sat or stood in the small "bland" Investigation Room during the
hours of his false imprisonment.
<P>

60   	At no time on 20 June 1996 was the plaintiff or his
solicitor, Mr Levitt informed that they were being filmed.
<P>

<b>Meeting with Mr Lamb and viewing the overpayment video</b>
<P>

61   	Some days after 20 June 1996 at the plaintiff's request he
had a meeting with Mr Lamb in the Endeavour Room at which time
he informed Mr
Lamb that he was very upset and that he felt that he had been treated unfairly.
Mr Lamb apologised to the plaintiff
and informed him that it was his intention
to resolve the matter as amicably as possible as the plaintiff was a valued
client.  Mr
Lamb informed him that although the Casino wanted the $1250 back it
wanted to keep the plaintiff as a patron.  
<P>

62   	Mr Lamb asked the plaintiff if there was anything he could
do to which he responded that he would like to see the video. 
Mr Lamb advised
him that he would see if he could get "an exception" for him to view the video
from Mr Arbuckle, who held the title
Vice President Table Games, and Mr
Bedwell.  
<P>

63   	After this meeting Mr Lamb organised for the plaintiff  to
view the video and on 27 June 1996 he attended the Casino with
Mr Levitt and
viewed the video.  It took only five minutes to ascertain that an overpayment
had occurred after which the plaintiff
informed the Casino that he would return
the money.
<P>

<b>Apology</b>
<P>

64   	There is no doubt that Mr Lamb apologised to the plaintiff
on 20 June 1996.  He also apologised to him when he went to see
him at the
Endeavour Room some days later.
<P>

65   	On 5 July 1996 Mr Arbuckle wrote the following letter to
the plaintiff;
<P>

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Sydney Harbour Casino today.  As
indicated at the meeting, we wish to make it clear that
we deeply regret the
series of events which occurred on the evening of 20 June.
<P>

There is no doubt that one of our staff made the initial mistake in overpaying
you and for that I apologise.  In the absence of
that mistake, we would not be
where we are today.  However, in a business such as Sydney Harbour Casino where
so many hands are dealt
each day, some mistakes are going to occur.  It is our
job to ensure that mistakes of this type are minimised.  Indeed, it is crucial
that these issues are dealt with promptly, sensitively and with minimum
inconvenience to the customer.
<P>

Whilst we are still investigating the matter and interviewing all staff
involved, I acknowledge your concern about being at the
casino on that evening
for such a long time.  As I understand it, genuine attempts were being made to
find a solution.  There were
a number of people involved, including the police,
who all contributed to the situation in some part.  To the extent that Sydney
Harbour Casino contributed to the delay, I apologise on behalf of the
company.
<P>

Please be assured that it is never the intention of the Sydney Harbour Casino
to cause any of our customers embarrassment for incidents
such as these.  We
believe it is most unfortunate that the matter was not resolved quickly and
amicably, without the involvement
of third parties.  In fact, Sydney Harbour
Casino will be taking steps to ensure that any similar incidents which occur in
the future
are handled in a way which will be satisfactory to both the company
and customer.
<P>

Finally, I would like to thank you for agreeing to the return of the payment in
question and look forward to receiving the final
authorisation form so this
matter can be put behind us.
<P>

Thank you again for your patience in this matter.
<P>

66   	Mr Collins QC submits that the letter is really a piece of
special pleading.  He submits the Casino has chosen its words very
carefully
and has attempted to spread the blame for the length of time the plaintiff was
held at the Casino and that this is really
a "mealy mouthed non-apology".
<P>

67   	Mr McAlary QC on the other hand submitted that this letter
must be taken into account as an apology and one should not be
dissecting it to
see whether the word "sorry" was used as opposed to the word "regret".  Mr
McAlary QC submitted that on a proper
analysis of the letter I would be
satisfied that it is a formal acknowledgment of the expression of regret and
apology that had already
been proffered by Mr Lamb at the meeting with the
plaintiff in the Endeavour Room some days after 20 June 1996.
<P>

<b>Sydney Morning Herald Article </b>
<P>

68   	Although neither the plaintiff nor Mr Levitt were asked in
evidence about the detail of any communications with any journalist
or employee
of the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) Mr Levitt gave evience that he did telephone
the SMH when he was at the front door
of the Casino on 20 June 1996 trying to
obtain access to Mr Vignoli.  It is also apparent that some further
communication occurred
which resulted in an article being published in the SMH
on Saturday 22 June 1996.  That article was entitled  "Casino high-roller
held
in wrangle over roulette" written by journalist Peter Cornford.
<P>

69   	Mr Peter Grimshaw, a Casino employee, who was contacted by
Mr Cornford prior to the publication of the article provided information
to the
SMH in the hope that the Casino's side of the story would be published and that
it would get a "fair go".  Mr Grimshaw read
the article and although he did not
know whether (but could not deny that) he used the words "of course" he
considered the article
to be "in effect" correct.
<P>

70   	The article reported that;
<P>

The casino defends its actions. "He had been overpaid, he was trying to leave
with the money," a spokesman said.  "Of course we
stopped him".
<P>

The casino spokesman said: "An independent authority adjudicated, we were
satisfied the money was ours.  We don't show the video
because it would put
enormous stress on our security system if the resources were frivolously
misused by clients".
<P>

71   	The article also contained quotes attributed to Mr Vignoli
whose photograph also appeared, apparently in his delicatessen,
with the
caption "Mr Vignoli...I was denied natural justice and proof". 
<P>

<b>Conduct up to trial</b>
<P>

72   	On 28 June 1996 Mr Levitt wrote to the General Manager of
the Casino advising him of his client's appreciation of the meeting
the
previous evening to view the videotape of the overpayment.  Mr Levitt referred
to a number of other matters which included a
claim that the plaintiff was
falsely imprisoned.  The letter sought a response from the Casino as to the
"sum you are prepared to
pay by way of out-of-Court settlement, as
compensation" for a variety of matters but including the false imprisonment of
the plaintiff.
<P>

73   	Mr Grimshaw was asked by Mr Bill Brown, another Casino
employee, for his thoughts on how the Casino might "go about resolving"
the
"Vignoli matter".  In an internal Casino memorandum of 4 July 1996 Mr Grimshaw
suggested his "preferred course" was as follows;
<P>

1.	Negotiate - obviously it would be best if we could appease him and get him
to drop all legal action.  Paul Arbuckle and Keith
Lamb would know him best but
I would have thought it would be best if these guys and Wes could have dinner
with him and try to woo
him back to the fold.
<P>

2.	If it appears that he will accept a minor settlement it would probably be in
our interests to give it to him rather than this
drag on.  But I would be
reluctant to offer him much.
<P>

3.	Pressure -  if the negotiations are not working I think we should suggest to
him that we are considering launching a counter
legal action for the damage he
has caused us.  After all, the tape confirmed everything we said... that he was
overpaid.  And he
was the one who did not want the government inspector to
adjudicate.  This resulted in very damaging material in the Herald about
the
casino.
<P>

My own experience is that people are much less inclined to pursue these types
of actions if there is a threat that they may lose
some of their own money.
<P>

And he would be aware that we have the resources to secure a strong legal
team.
<P>

In relation to the media aspects he raises it is amazing that he is upset that
his embarrassment was aggravated by having his photo
in the paper.  HE ACTUALLY
POSED FOR THE PHOTO IN HIS DELI.. THAT'S WHY IT WAS IN THE PAPER. And it was
his solicitor who took the
issue up with the media in the first place.  Only a
very small number of people (those in the PGR at the time) would have known
about
the event if he did not try to get the story in the media. Certainly (the
Casino) never sought any media coverage.
<P>

74   	Another internal memorandum of the Casino dated 11 July
1996 between Bill Brown and other Casino employees including Messrs
Arbuckle
and Lamb dealt with the issue of whether the Casino's "complaint to the police"
should be withdrawn.  Mr Brown expressed
the following view;
<P>

We should hold off on withdrawing the complaint pending:
<P>

(a)	return of the money, as promised by Vignoli; and
<P>

(b)	Vignoli's institution of legal action, or his confirmation that
<P>

he will not do so.
<P>

I think that Mike D'Arcy should make that decision, after consultation with
Paul Arbuckle and then convey (the Casino's) position
on the complaint to the
police.
<P>

75   	On 31 July 1996 the Casino responded to Mr Levitt's 28
June letter in which;
<P>

&#183;	it denied that there was any basis for the allegation made by Mr Levitt
that he and Mr Vignoli's 	movements and conversations
were observed without
their authority or permission;
<P>

&#183;	denied Mr Levitt's allegation that Mr Vignoli was denied legal
representation;
<P>

&#183;	denied Mr Levitt's allegation that efforts were made to prevent him, as
Mr Vignoli's lawyer, from 	entering the casino;
<P>

&#183;	claimed that Mr Vignoli was "treated with courtesy and asked at all
times whether he would	 proceed with staff from one place
to another";
<P>

&#183;	concluded that there was "no basis for any claim that your client was on
the evening concerned 	falsely imprisoned" or "publicly
humiliated" and advised
that if legal proceedings were 		commenced "this letter together with Mr
Arbuckle's letter" of 5 July 1996
"will be produced in 	evidence".
<P>

76   	The plaintiff commenced proceedings for false imprisonment
by way of Statement of Claim filed on 14 August 1996.  On 29 November
1996 the
Casino filed a defence denying each of the allegations pleaded in the Statement
of Claim in respect of the facts and circumstances
forming the basis for the
claim.  The defence also contained the following paragraph: 
<P>

10.	In answer to the whole of the claim for false imprisonment pleaded in
paragraphs 10 to 28 of the Statement of Claim, the First
Defendant says that
any detention of the Plaintiff (which is denied) was lawful because of the
reasonable belief of servants or agents
of the First Defendant that the
Plaintiff was appropriating or attempting to appropriate money owned by the
First Defendant for his
own use contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 117</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a>".
<P>

77   	That defence remained on the record for 3 years until 25
October 1999 when the Casino's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's
solicitors
advising that the Casino was not contesting liability for false
imprisonment.
<P>

<b>Effect on Mr Vignoli </b>
<P>

78   	The plaintiff gave evidence that he had never been placed
in such a situation before in his life.  As he was walking through
the Casino
and as he was being "guarded" as he went to the toilet he "felt that people
were talking about" him and that "they see
something was happening with me,
something was going on with me that I was taken".  He felt that people thought
that he must have
done something terrible to be treated like that.  He said
that he was terribly embarrassed and terribly unhappy in being in such
a
situation.  
<P>

79   	He said that he was "numb" and he just couldn't understand
what had happened to his "pride, my dignity, everything that all
my life I have
worked for has been walked all over".  He said he felt like a criminal.
<P>

80   	The plaintiff's mental anguish, pleaded as " great
anxiety" in the Amended Statement of Claim (par 25), continued for some
months.
In an effort to ease this problem he attended his general practitioner who
prescribed some medication and the problem resolved,
on the plaintiff's
estimate, about 12 months after the incident.
<P>

81   	Although, as I have already said, it was the plaintiff's
habit to attend the Casino four or five times a week he could not
bring himself
to return to the Endeavour Club until late September 1996.  He attended about
three times in that month but did not
attend at all in October.  He attended
five times in November and thereafter was able to resume his usual pattern of
gambling at
the Casino.  I am satisfied that his deep humiliation and feeling
of disgrace was the reason he could not bring himself to attend
his Club at the
Casino until later in 1996.
<P>

82   	Other evidence called on his behalf included evidence from
his partner Mary Bryant.  Ms Bryant told me that on the evening
in the early
morning of 21 June 1996 when the plaintiff returned home she observed him to be
very distressed.  She said that prior
to this incident he was a quietly spoken,
gentle, happy person.  On the night of the incident she observed that he didn't
sleep well
and he was tossing and turning, suffering hot sweats and he appeared
to be very nervous.  
<P>

83   	For some months after the incident she noticed a marked
change in him in that he became short-tempered, moody and snappy.
 She noticed
that he was dealing abruptly with the clientele at the delicatessen and
observed that his whole attitude seemed to have
changed.  He lost weight and
couldn't sleep properly.  She told me that he did not begin to return to his
old self until about nine
months after the incident.
<P>

84   	Further evidence was called from the plaintiff's
stepdaughter Banu Attahan.  She described her stepfather as a funny, happy,
easy going man.  However any time that the incident at the Casino was discussed
she noticed that he became very upset, withdrawn
and distracted.  She described
him as a proud person and said that this incident had caused him a lot of
embarrassment.  She too
spoke of the plaintiff's weight loss and was of the
view that the incident had put a great deal of "stress" upon him and she felt
that it had "aged him".  
<P>

85   	Another witness Isobel Garcia who was employed at the
delicatessen described the plaintiff as a nice, gentle employer.  She
said he
was very polite and happy, very likeable and very courteous.  After the
incident on 20 June 1996 Ms Garcia observed that
the plaintiff was very
distressed and looked very withdrawn.  She observed him to be snappy and he
appeared quite sad.  She observed
that he was "not holding it together" and had
to have some time off a couple of weeks after the incident.
<P>

86   	On arrival at the Investigation Room at approximately 10
pm on 20 June 1996 Mr Levitt observed the plaintiff to be sweating
profusely
and very agitated.  He noticed that he gesticulated a lot and also jumped
around a lot.  He also noticed that he exhibited
twitchy facial movements in
particular around the mouth.  After the interim resolution was reached and they
departed from the Investigation
Room area at 12.30 am he observed that although
he seemed to be relieved to be out of the Investigation Room he also appeared
to
be exhausted and upset.  
<P>

<b>General or Compensatory Damages</b>
<P>

87   	The plaintiff claims general or compensatory damages for
the harm caused to him by the wrongful acts of the defendant in falsely
imprisoning him.  These damages are to compensate him for the injury to liberty
(the loss of time considered primarily from a non-pecuniary
viewpoint) and the
injury to feelings ( the indignity, the mental suffering, disgrace and
humiliation) caused by the false imprisonment.
 <b>Cassell &amp; Co Ltd v
Broome</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) AC 1027</a> at 1124;  <b>McGregor on Damages</b> 15th Ed. par
1619.
<P>

 
<P>

88   	It is important to delineate between circumstances in
which compensatory damages may be increased by the conduct of the defendant
and
circumstances which would justify an award of aggravated damages.  
<P>

89   	In assessing the general or compensatory damages in this
case it is proper "to take into account the whole of the conduct
of the
defendant to the time of verdict".  Matters such as "the indignity, mental
suffering, disgrace and humiliation" are to be
included in the assessment
together with any conduct by the Casino which "had the effect of increasing the
injury" to the plaintiff's
feelings.  This is quite separate from aggravated
damages the pre-requisite for which is proof by the plaintiff of conduct by the
defendant which was not bona fide, or was improper or unjustifiable.  <b>Spautz
v Butterworth </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 1</a>  per Clarke JA at  17G - 18E.
<P>

90   	Mr McAlary QC submitted that in the light of Clarke JA's
judgment in <b>Spautz v Butterworth </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 1</a> it was now
"mandatory" in assessing damages in false imprisonment cases to "have regard"
to other awards of damages "approved by"
the Court for the purpose of reaching
an assessment that ensures that the award will bear a proper relationship to
the injury suffered.
 
<P>

91   	Mr McAlary QC also referred me analagously to <b>s 46A</b>
of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>, </b>as amended, which requires the court in
determining the amount of damages in defamation proceedings to "ensure" that
there is an "appropriate
and rational relationship between the relevant harm
and the amount of damages awarded".  Mr McAlary QC delicately submitted that
it
was the legislature's intention to remove the intrusion of eccentricities of
trial judges and submitted that such an approach
should be adopted in the
assessment of damages for false imprisonment.
<P>

92   	I disagree with the submission that <b>Spautz v
Butterworth</b> is authority for the proposition for which Mr McAlary QC
contends. I am of the view that Clarke JA's focus was on what was "permissible"
(at 13D-G) and there is nothing in his Honour's judgment which I read as
requiring me or, to use an American term, "mandating" me
to compare awards of
damages in false imprisonment cases which have been approved at appellate level
with the circumstances of this
case.
<P>

93   	However I do agree that a proper principle by which I
should be guided is that there should be an appropriate and rational
relationship between the award of damages and the harm suffered by the
plaintiff.  I am also of the view that, although it is not
mandatory, I am
permitted to have regard to awards of damages "approved" by the Court.  By that
I mean awards approved by the Court
of Appeal of this Court.
<P>

94   	Both parties referred me to decisions at first instance of
other courts.  <b>Lackersteen v Jones &amp; Ors </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/NTSC/1988/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">(1988) NTSC 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2092%20FLR%206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 92 FLR 6</a><b>; Rixon
v Sydney Harbour Casino </b>(unreported NSW District Court, Garling DCJ 1
December 1997)<b>  </b>However in line with what I regard Clarke JA to have
said in <b>Spautz v Butterworth </b>I intend only to "have regard to" to those
Court of Appeal cases to which I have been referred on this aspect of the
matter. 
<P>

95   	In addition to <b>Spautz V Butterworth </b>I was referred
to <b>McDonald v Coles Myer Ltd (t/as K-Mart Chatswood) </b>(1995) Aust Torts
Reports 62,682 and <b>Woolley v Phillips </b>(unreported, NSWSC, Court of
Appeal Clarke, Sheller and Cole JJA 26 August 1996).
<P>

96   	In <b>Woolley v Phillips</b> the appellant, Mrs Woolley,
had been falsely imprisoned by the defendant police officers and had been
subjected to assault and battery
by them in her home.  The police mistakenly
believed that a person for whom they were searching was in the appellant's
home.  The
assault and battery consisted of threatening the appellant that she
would be taken to the police station and charged and holding
the appellant by
the wrist and pulling her by the arm.  There was no apology proffered to Mrs
Woolley for the conduct of the defendants.
 The trial judge found the appellant
suffered "post traumatic stress disorder".
<P>

97   	At the trial the appellant abandoned any claim for
aggravated or exemplary damages and the trial judge awarded $30,000 for
general
damages together with interest and other amounts for medical expenses and
future treatment.  Although the appellant challenged
the trial judge's award as
inadequate the Court of Appeal found that it was "within the available
discretionary range".(per Cole
JA at page 5)
<P>

98   	Although the false imprisonment in <b>Woolley v
Phillips</b> was coupled with both assault and battery the length of time that
the appellant's liberty was curtailed appears to have been much
less than in
this case.  However this was a case in which a woman had been falsely
imprisoned in her own home by two aggressive and
apparently violent police
officers.  There was no public nature to the false imprisonment as was the case
here.  Certainly Mr Vignoli
was threatened in a similar fashion - of being
charged - but there was no battery of him.
<P>

99   	In <b>McDonald v Coles Myer Ltd </b>(1995) Aust Torts
Reports 62,682 Mrs McDonald was falsely imprisoned in a very public way,
charged with obtaining goods by false pretences,
and had to endure both a
criminal and civil trial.  
<P>

100   	Mrs McDonald was also subjected to a cross examination
which included a baseless allegation that she had a mental disorder.
The trial
judge was of the view that there should be an award of "significant damages"
and awarded $12,500 plus interest of $1,000.
 The Court of Appeal found that
$12,500 was not "significant" and increased the damages to $27,000.
<P>

101   	Mr Collins QC submitted that the plaintiff's unchallenged
evidence supplemented by the video evidence together with the evidence
of the
three honest, decent and impressive women will convince me that substantial
compensatory damages should be awarded.  In addition
to the lengthy period of
time during which the plaintiff's liberty was curtailed and the consequent
humiliation it was submitted
that the following matters increased the
injury:
<P>

&#183;	The fact that no food was provided to him at all during that period.
<P>

&#183;	The fact that he was confined in a small space sitting on a chair
without the benefit of any 	support.
<P>

&#183;	The fact that he was "guarded" not only in the small space but also as
he travelled to and from 	the toilet although he had
pleaded to be allowed to
go to the toilet without being guarded.
<P>

&#183;	He was told that he had his last chance to pay or the police would be
called and he would be 	charged with stealing.
<P>

&#183;	He was threatened with being banned for 12 months from the Casino.
<P>

102   	These matters need to be assessed in the light of the
evidence that at all times the plaintiff said he was happy to pay the
money to
the Casino if he could verify the alleged overpayment by viewing the video.
<P>

103   	Mr Collins QC submitted that the observations of the
plaintiff during the time that he gave his evidence would persuade me
of the
genuine humiliation and disgrace felt by him.  He submitted that the viewing of
the incident on the video had distressed his
client to the point which caused
him to break down in the witness box.  
<P>

104   	There is no doubt that the plaintiff was indeed
distressed in the witness box and for some period in tears.  It was never
suggested to him, understandably so, that such an occurrence was not genuine
and was a result of the distress caused by reviewing
the events of this
incident on the videos.
<P>

105   	Mr Collins QC submitted that there had been a long, slow,
studied and repeated series of insults to the plaintiff by an almost
faceless
group of Casino employees which led to his deepest humiliation.  He submitted
that I would be satisfied that this was a
searing experience for a person who
had been appropriately described as gentle, polite and urbane.
<P>

106   	The defendant made no real challenge to the evidence of
the distress and humiliation of the plaintiff caused by its conduct.
 There was
no cross examination of any of the three female witnesses to whom I have
already referred who gave evidence of their observations
of the effect this
incident had upon the plaintiff.
<P>

107   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff's false imprisonment
lasted from 6pm until midnight.  Although the Casino's admission of
liability
on the pleadings was to a period of four and one half hours I am of the view
that the extra one and one half hours is proved
on the evidence before me.  
<P>

108   	I am satisfied that this was indeed a searing experience
for the plaintiff and that he felt deep humiliation and disgrace.
 I am also
satisfied that he experienced a deal of mental anguish and discomfort as a
result of this experience.  
<P>

109   	I am also satisfied that the plaintiff felt proud and saw
it as an achievement to become a member of the Endeavour Club at
the Casino.
It was something that had taken a lifetime to achieve with the pastime that he
loved.  The description that he gave of
walking amongst other members of the
Club with a feeling that they were talking about him as if he were a common
criminal portrays
vividly the deep humiliation I accept he experienced.
<P>

110   	I also accept that the injury to his feelings was
heightened by the confinement in the close quarters of the Investigation
Room
with the constant presence of at least one Casino employee either standing or
sitting with him. 
<P>

111   	I also accept that his humiliation was deepened by being
escorted to and from the toilet by as many as three Casino employees
and their
standing "guard" outside the toilet awaiting his return.  I also accept that
the pressure placed upon the plaintiff to
pay the money to the Casino by the
threat of police action and a 12 month ban from the club he loved heightened
the injury and hurt
to his feelings.
<P>

112   	The plaintiff conceded in cross examination that the
casino staff were polite and did not manhandle him at any stage and
I take
these matters into account when assessing these damages.  Mr McAlary QC
submitted that I should also take into account the
fact that the plaintiff was
provided with two cool drinks at his request, that he was permitted to go to
the bathroom when he requested
to do so and that he was able to make and
receive phone calls.  Mr McAlary QC also relied upon the fact that the
plaintiff was given
access to his solicitor, Mr Levitt.
<P>

113   	These are all matters that I have taken into account in
this assessment however I am of the view that they are not very powerful
circumstances in the defendant's favour.  However matters that are more
powerful are Mr Lamb's apologies both on the 20 June 1996
and when the
plaintiff had his subsequent meeting with him in the Endeavour Room and the
defendant's apology in Mr Arbuckle's letter
of 5 July 1996.  I intend to give
these matters appropriate weight in this assessment.
<P>

114   	Mr Collins QC also relied upon a number of matters as a
basis for an award for aggravated damages and I will deal with those
in due
course. However some of the matters upon which he relied are in my view
appropriate to analyse in the assessment of the compensatory
damages.  They
are:
<P>

&#183;	the failure to proffer a proper apology and/or the proffering of "a
mealy mouthed non-apology";
<P>

&#183;	defending its actions by the statements made to the SMH journalist
knowing that in all likelihood 	the statements would be
published;
<P>

&#183;	the pleading of par 10 of the defence and persisting in that defence
when there was no reasonable 	basis for pleading or
maintaining such a
defence;
<P>

115   	Although I was initially attracted by Mr Collins QC's
analysis of the apology on reflection I am of the view that it is not
an
appropriate description of it.  There is a clear statement of regret in the
first paragraph; a clear statement of apology for
the overpayment in the second
paragraph and a clear statement of apology for the "delay" caused by the Casino
in the third paragraph.
 It may have been of more comfort to have received a
letter without reference to the involvement of others and their contribution
to
the delay but I am not satisfied that the terms of this letter warrant an
increase in the compensatory damages to be awarded to
the plaintiff.
<P>

116   	The statements made by the Casino to the SMH reported in
the published article as amounting to the Casino "defending" its
actions were
not dealt with at all in the oral evidence given by the plaintiff.  He did not
suggest that he felt more hurt to his
feelings when he read the article indeed
he did not give evidence that he read the article.  However the plaintiff
brought defamation
proceedings against the defendant and Mr Grimshaw in respect
of the article and some of the evidence in that trial, in which I was
the trial
judge, is evidence before me.  (Ex J)
<P>

117   	There was a claim made in Mr Levitt's letter of 28 June
that the article had "aggravated" an imputation that his client was
a thief and
there was an analysis of this claim in Mr Grimshaw's memo of 4 July 1996.  From
the evidence before me I am satisfied
that the plaintiff read the article and
was distressed by it.
<P>

118   	Additionally the plaintiff gave no evidence at all about
par 10 of the defence.  Although he gave detailed evidence of his
general
distress and humiliation and as I have said earlier broke down in the witness
box he did not specifically mention the matters
of the SMH article and the
defence.  
<P>

119   	In these circumstances Mr McAlary QC submitted that I
could not be satisfied that the plaintiff has proved his case to allow
such
conduct to be taken into account in the assessment of compensatory damages.

<P>

120   	In this regard I am assisted by the approach adopted by
Clarke JA in <b>McDonald v Coles Myer</b> <b>Ltd (t/as K Mart Chatswood)</b>
(1995) Aust Torts Reports 62,682 at 62,687 where His Honour dealt with the
trial judge's failure to take into account as relevant
to the solatium the
hurtful experience of the trial, the persistence of false and hurtful
allegations and overlooked the damage to
the plaintiff's reputation as a result
of the false imprisonment.  His Honour said  "it is no answer to say that the
appellant didn't
specifically mention all of these matters".
<P>

121   	I am satisfied in all the circumstances of the
plaintiff's evidence and in particular his presentation in the witness box
which demonstrated to me the distress he experienced in having to go through
these proceedings that these two matters would be appropriate
to take into
account in the assessment of compensatory damages.  
<P>

122   	However I intend only to take the first of these matters,
the SMH article, into account on this aspect of the assessment
because the
second of them will be taken into account in the assessment of aggravated
damages.  I am of the view that the Casino's
statements made public in the SMH
article were in fact a defence of the false imprisonment of the plaintiff and
should increase the
compensatory damages by two percent.
<P>

123   	In all the circumstances of this case I am of the view
that an appropriate award is $30,000
<P>

<b>Aggravated Damages</b>
<P>

124   	In<b> Cassell &amp; Co Ltd v Broome </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1972%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972 A.C. 1027</a>
at 1124) Lord Diplock referred to what Lord Devlin called "aggravated damages"
as "additional compensation for the injured feelings
of the plaintiff where his
sense of injury resulting from the wrongful physical act is justifiably
heightened by the manner in which
or motive for which the defendant did it".
<P>

125   	Since <b>Spautz v Butterworth  (</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1996%29%2041%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1996) 41 NSWLR 1</a> the
former of these two matters, the manner in which the wrong is perpetrated, is
also taken into account as increasing compensatory
damages, unless of course it
is the basis of a claim that such manner demonstrated a lack of bona fides or
improper or unjustifiable
conduct which as, I have said earlier, is what the
plaintiff has to prove to obtain an award of aggravated damages.
<P>

126   	The plaintiff relied upon a number of matters in his
claim for aggravated damages. They included;
<P>

&#183;	the failure to proffer a proper apology and/or the proffering of "a
mealy mouthed non-apology";
<P>

&#183;	defending its actions publicly by the statements made to the SMH
journalist knowing that in all 	likelihood the statements
would be
published;
<P>

&#183;	the pleading of par 10 of the defence and persisting in that defence
when there was no reasonable 	basis for pleading or
maintaining such a
defence;
<P>

&#183;	persisting in the defence for the purpose of and in the hope that the
plaintiff would be worn down 	or emotionally crushed
and not pursue the
litigation.
<P>

127   	I have dealt with the first and second of these matters
in the assessment of the compensatory damages, accepting the second
as
increasing the damages and rejecting the first.  
<P>

128   	In respect of the other matters relied upon Mr Collins QC
submitted that the plaintiff was entitled to an award of aggravated
damages
because the defendant had persisted in the original "charge" made against the
plaintiff by the filing of the defence for
which, he submitted there was never
a proper basis. <b>Walter v Alltools Limited </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%20171%20TLR%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 171 T.L.R 371</a> and
<b>Myer Stores Ltd &amp; Ors  v Soo </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1991/97.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] VicRp 97</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%202%20VR%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 2 VR 597.</a>
<P>

129   	Mr McAlary QC submitted that I would not be satisfied
that the pre- requisites of an absence of bona fides or improper motive
have
been proved by the plaintiff.  He submitted there was no evidence upon which I
could make such a finding and that the defendant
had admitted liability on 25
October 1999 when Senior Counsel had reviewed the matter.
<P>

130   	The defendant pleaded a blanket denial to paragraphs 12
to 21 of the Statement of Claim putting the plaintiff to proof of
these matters
until its admission of liability on 25 October 1999.  There were similar
denials in the letter to Mr Levitt in July
1996.  The factual matters pleaded
in these paragraphs in the defence were clearly matters for which there was no
proper basis for
a denial.  The majority of them were depicted vividly on the
defendant's video as events which had occurred.
<P>

131   	But the defence went further and pleaded par 10 set out
earlier in this judgment. It denied the detention and alternatively
sought to
justify it.  It then pleaded the reasonable belief in its officers that the
plaintiff was "appropriating or attempting
to appropriate" the defendant's
money contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.
<P>

132   	This pleading had no proper basis at all.  The defendant
made a mistake and gave the plaintiff possession of the $1,250.
 The plaintiff
said he was happy to pay the money to the Casino if they showed him the video
and an overpayment was demonstrated.
 The defendant's officers knew the
plaintiff well enough to form the view as was stated on 20 June 1996 that he
was "an honest man".
 
<P>

133   	How anyone could have contemplated that the plaintiff had
the requisite mens rea for an offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s117</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> is most
puzzling.  If it was a belief it certainly could not have been characterised as
a "reasonable" belief on any of the material
that must have been available to
the defendant at the time it pleaded its defence.
<P>

134   	One of the keys in assessing the bona fides, propriety
and justification of this pleading and its maintenance is an analysis
of the
internal Casino memoranda. (Exs G &amp; H)  From those two documents and in the
absence of any evidence from the defendant,
it having called no evidence in
these proceedings, I have reached the conclusion that there was a lack of bona
fides in the defendant's
pleading and that it was not justified in maintaining
it.
<P>

135   	After the plaintiff was permitted to view the video on 27
June 1996 he agreed that there was an overpayment and that the
police should
give the money back to the Casino.  This much is confirmed in Mr Brown's
memorandum of 11 July 1996. (Ex H).  Mr Brown
suggested that the Casino's
"complaint" to the police should not be withdrawn pending the plaintiff's
"confirmation" that he would
not commence legal proceedings.
<P>

136   	I am of the view that to maintain or to contemplate the
maintenance of a baseless police complaint for the purpose (which
I am of the
view was its purpose) to pressure the plaintiff into a position favourable to
the Casino is conduct that provides a very
good view of the Casino's motive
during this period.
<P>

137   	The other memorandum from Mr Grimshaw (Ex G ) is a little
more complex.  It is relied upon to demonstrate that the defendant
was
considering the pursuit of action that would effectively grind the plaintiff
down to the point where he would no longer have
the fortitude to continue in
his claim against the Casino.
<P>

138   	Mr McAlary QC submitted that there was no such legal
action commenced and I should not be persuaded to take the contents
of this
memo into account to the defendant's disadvantage in this assessment of
damages.  It is true that there was no action of
the kind as mentioned in the
memo commenced by the defendant.  However I observe that to contemplate the
making of such a threat
in the circumstances also gives me a view into the
minds and motives of the defendant in the defence it ultimately adopted.
<P>

139   	The question is whether these memoranda and the
defendant's admission of liability on 25 October 1999 is evidence upon which
I
am able to reach the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that the
defence lacked justification and the defendant was not
acting in a bona fide
manner in filing and maintaining such a defence.  I am of the view that it
is.
<P>

140   	In the circumstances I am satisfied that an award of
aggravated damages should be made in respect of these latter two matters.
 I
award $10,000.
<P>

<b>Exemplary Damages</b>
<P>

141   	Lord Diplock referred to exemplary damages as "punishment
of the defendant for his anti-social behaviour to the plaintiff"
 <b>Cassell
&amp; Co  v Broome </b>(1972) A.C.1027 at1124.  Brennan J, as His Honour then
was, referred to the punishment of the defendant "for conduct showing a
conscious
and contumelious disregard for the plaintiff's rights and to deter
him from committing like conduct again".  His Honour approved
of Lord Diplock's
description in <b>Cassell &amp; Co v Broome </b>of the social purpose to be
served as to "teach a wrong-doer that tort does not pay".  <b>XL Petroleum
(NSW) v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20155%20CLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 155 CLR 448</a> at 471.
<P>

142   	The object of exemplary damages is however not "wholly
punishment and the deterrence which is intended extends beyond the
actual
wrongdoer and the exact nature of his wrongdoing".  It extends beyond the
defendant and other like minded persons "generally
to conduct of the same
reprehensible kind".  <b>Lamb v Cotogno </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 1</a> at 9-10.
<P>

143   	Mr McAlary QC submitted I should not award exemplary
damages because the plaintiff had not proved that the defendant acted
in a
manner that could be categorised as "conscious or contumelious disregard" of
the plaintiff's rights.  He submitted also that
I could not conclude that the
Casino did not know that what it was doing was wrong.  He submitted that there
was no evidence one
way or the other.
<P>

144   	I am of the view that the plaintiff has demonstrated
consciousness in the defendant of its disregard of the plaintiff's rights.
This begins to emerge from the moment, at 6.15 pm, the plaintiff asked Mr Dunn,
"am I under arrest here, are you keeping me here
against my will?" and Mr Dunn
responded "no, no, you can leave you are not under arrest, that is something I
do not want to do".
<P>

145   	There is further evidence from the events between 6.30 pm
and 7pm in the office in the Endeavour Room. Mr Lamb, who it seems
was trying
his best to inject some sensibility into the situation suggested that the
plaintiff could wait in that office.  As I have
said earlier this was a bigger
room and it is obvious from Mr Lamb's approach that he thought it was far more
appropriate for the
plaintiff's comfort.  Mr Lamb also expressed concern that
he had not arrived earlier and sorrow at what had happened thus far to
the
plaintiff.  
<P>

146   	Mr Lamb's attempts were not even given a response. Mr
Bedwell walked out of the room when the suggestion was made and sent
the
security officer in to take the plaintiff on his journey through the Casino to
the small Investigation Room.  
<P>

147   	Further evidence of the consciousness is available in the
unchallenged Mr Dunn was not called to give evidence and no application
for an
adjournment at the end of the plaintiff's case was made to accommodate Mr Dunn
who had been recently injured in a motor vehicle
accident. conversation between
the plaintiff and Mr Dunn when Mr Dunn agreed that the situation had got "out
of hand". 
<P>

148   	There was the delay in letting Mr Levitt have access to
the plaintiff coupled with the additional and timely pressure on
the plaintiff
to take up his "last chance" to pay the money before he was "charged" and
banned for 12 months.  The change in attitude
when the SMH was mentioned is
also telling of consciousness that it knew it was disregarding the plaintiff's
rights.
<P>

149   	In conclusion I am of the view that the defendant's
conduct was consciously in disregard of the plaintiffs rights and I am
also of
the view that such disregard was contumelious and an award of exemplary damages
should be made.
<P>

150   	A further matter arises from what Kirby J said <b>Gray v
Motor Accident Commission </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2073%20ALJR%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 73 ALJR 45</a> at 61 as follows;
<P>

Punishment for deliberate wrongdoing is certainly a consideration in deciding
the applicability of exemplary damages.  But it is
not the sole reason for the
award of such damages.  The more recent cases on the subject, including in this
Court, have accepted
that such damages may be recovered whatever the subjective
intention of the tortfeasor if, objectively, the conduct involved was
high-handed, calling for curial disapprobation addressed not only to the
tortfeasor but to the world. 
<P>

151   	I am firmly convinced that objectively the defendants
conduct was high handed and calls for the curial disapprobation to
which Kirby
J referred.<b>  </b>Such "high handed" or overbearing conduct includes;
<P>

&#183;	the manner in which the plaintiff was confronted at the exit door of the
Casino and prevented from 	leaving after he was
told he was free to leave as
vividly depicted on the video; 
<P>

&#183;	placing the plaintiff is such a small room when a far more reasonable
office was available and 	suggested by Mr Lamb;
<P>

&#183;	the continuous "guarding" of the plaintiff in that small room;
<P>

&#183;	the continuous filming of the plaintiff without his knowledge;
<P>

&#183;	the failure to give the plaintiff any privacy to make phone calls to his
solicitor or his partner and 	the closeness of the
employees of the defendant
to the plaintiff whilst he made or received those 	phone calls;
<P>

&#183;	the refusal to allow the plaintiff to go to the toilet without an escort
of "guard" when he had 	stated that he would not
"bolt" and that he wished to
go without such an escort;
<P>

152   	Even when the plaintiff's solicitor arrived they were not
offered a bigger or more comfortable room.  They had to remain
in that room
until an interim solution could be reached and the filming of them continued
without their knowledge.
<P>

153   	Mr Levitt gave some evidence that suggested that there
was audio surveillance of the plaintiff and himself.  That evidence
was that
when the money was produced for the police to hold as stakeholders it was
placed on the table in various denominations and
the Casino employee looked up
to the "black dome" area above and said "can you see the serial numbers".
<P>

154   	In these circumstances, although this evidence and some
of the actions of some of the employees on the video during the many
hours of
it that I watched may give an impression that there was some audio surveillance
I am not able to make any positive finding
about this on the balance of
probabilities and I do not do so.  If I had been satisfied that audio
surveillance occurred the award
of exemplary damages would have been larger.
<P>

155   	The defendant's conduct vividly depicted on the video was
quite disgraceful.  The number of people "guarding" this honest
plaintiff and
escorting him to and from even the men's room may have been appropriate for a
violent sociopath but this conduct was,
as the plaintiff and an officer of the
defendant said on the night in question, "out of hand".  It had no sense of any
proportion
whatsoever.  
<P>

156   	The only voice of some reason was that of Mr Lamb, the
VIP Service Director.  Of serious concern is that he was but a voice
in the
wilderness.  He was ignored.
<P>

157   	That such conduct can be perpetrated without a proper
understanding that it is so terrible to wrongfully deprive a person
of their
liberty, a liberty which our community values so greatly, is also a basis for
serious concern.
<P>

158   	The only evidence that the Court has of the defendant's
possible action to prevent such a situation occurring in the future
is found in
the letter of apology tendered by the plaintiff.  It reads as follows;
<P>

In fact, Sydney Harbour Casino will be taking steps to ensure that any similar
incidents which occur in the future are handled in
a way which will be
satisfactory to both the company and the customer.
<P>

159   	I do not know what steps, if any, have been taken as no
evidence was called by the defendant.  Indeed, although I was not
persuaded
that this letter was a basis for an increase in compensatory damages, I am
convinced that this letter is evidence that
the Casino did not  recognise the
gravamen of its conduct.  This conclusion is reached from the circumstances of
the Casino writing
about its satisfaction in the future when the sort of
conduct it had just engaged in with this plaintiff should have focused its
mind
firmly on how it could excise from its employees' armoury the disgraceful
tactics engaged in to deprive the plaintiff of his
liberty.
<P>

160   	Mr McAlary QC's emphasis on the polite way in which the
plaintiff was treated needs to be analysed in the light of what I
have just
said.  Politeness is of course preferrable to rudeness.  However it does not
change the conclusion reached that the defendant's
conduct was in contumelious
disregard of the plaintiff's rights and was objectively high-handed.  But it
must be recognised in this
award that the conduct could have been worse if the
"guard" was rude.  This plaintiff was guarded and escorted in a manner that was
quite disgraceful notwithstanding the politeness with which his liberty was
stolen.
<P>

161   	It should never have happened.  This award is to punish
the defendant and to deter such conduct both by this defendant and
by
others.
<P>

162   	I am of the view that an appropriate award of exemplary
damages is $35,000.
<P>

163   	There will be a verdict for the plaintiff.  Judgment will
be entered in due course in the amount of $75,000 together with
interest, which
I am of the view should be awarded, the calculation of which I will hear
submissions upon at the same time as the
submissions as to costs.  The parties
have liberty to restore the matter to the list for such submissions.
