<b>2907/97	DEPUTY COMMISSION OF TAXATION v ANN MAREE BOWEN &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b> - On costs
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	These proceedings were brought by the Deputy Commission of
Taxation to enforce a claim he made to the proceeds of a property
owned by the
first defendant.  The proceedings were fixed for hearing before me yesterday.
They did not proceed.  Some time in the
couple of weeks preceding the date of
the fixture the plaintiff indicated to the defendants that he would not
continue to press the
claim against them.  There was then, as will appear,
negotiation as to the costs of the proceedings.  It is asserted by the
plaintiff,
but denied by the defendants, that as a result of the negotiation a
binding compromise as to the costs was reached, to the effect
that the
plaintiff would pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings in the sum of
$25,000.  After discussion between the Bench
and counsel, orders have been
fashioned which dispose of the proceedings by agreement between the parties.
However, there has been
argument as to what order for costs should be made.
This turned on whether or not the alleged compromise was in fact a binding
agreement,
and on what should be done about the costs that have been incurred
in the proceedings since 12 August 1999, the day up to which the
agreement, if
binding, dealt with the costs of the proceedings.  In relation to the
agreement, two matters have been agitated.  The
first is whether the agreement
is binding at all.  The second is as to whether the agreement, if it is
binding, upon its proper construction
includes in the $25,000 stipulated the
costs under an interlocutory order for costs made by Registrar Berecry, which
still subsists.
<P>

2   	The correspondence leading to the "agreement" as to costs
has been tendered.  The situation  is that the offer which, if accepted,
would
constitute the contract was made by the defendants by fax on 12 August 1999, it
being stipulated that the offer was open only
until noon on the following day.
At 9.14 am the following morning the plaintiff faxed the defendants accepting
the offer.  Despite
the shortness of the time between offer and acceptance, the
defendants alleged that the offer was made in a different factual context
as to
the overall settlement than that which prevailed the following morning when the
plaintiff purported to accept it.  This difference
in context was said to
relate principally to the disposal of a cross claim.  On looking at the nature
of the matter and reading the
correspondence, I am unable to see that the
situation did in reality change between offer and acceptance.  Whilst there has
been
some further working out of the precise orders to be made, and this
working out continued after the fax of acceptance on the morning
of 13 August,
and indeed continued in Court both yesterday and today, it seems to me that the
real and substantial subject matter
of the proposed agreement between the
parties was exactly the same at the time of the offer as at the time of the
acceptance and
has indeed continued to be the same since that time.  Only the
mode of working out has been changed as to mechanics or detail in
the
formulation of the precise orders that I now propose to make.  In those
circumstances, I am of the opinion that there was a binding
contract that the
plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings but that those
costs should be fixed at $25,000.
<P>

3   	It has been suggested on the plaintiff's part by reference
to words in the letter of offer, "Our client would be prepared to
accept the
sum of $25,000 for costs incurred to date in this matter", that the intention
of the parties was that the agreement should
subsume all costs, including any
subsisting interlocutory order for costs.  However, the letter of offer was
written in a context
in which the parties had exchanged their respective
versions of short minutes, each of which contained an order for costs of the
proceedings simpliciter without reference to subsisting interlocutory orders.
Such an unqualified order for costs does not affect
existing interlocutory
orders.  Bearing in mind this context, I do not think that the words "costs
incurred to date in this matter"
on their proper construction subsume the
Registrar's existing order.  That order is not caught by the agreement and, in
my view,
the obligation for costs created by that order will continue to exist,
as well as the order for costs that I propose to make embodying
the agreement
for costs of $25,000.
<P>

4   	However, the words "incurred to date" do have the effect,
in my view, of defining the costs in respect of which the $25,000
is to be paid
as the costs of the proceedings up to and including, but not after, 12 August
1999, the day on which the offer was
made.  In those circumstances, the costs
of the proceedings since that day still fall to be decided.  The defendants
contend that
they ought have those costs, as the plaintiff in effect abandoned
his action.  The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that that
ought not be
so.  His counsel refers me to what was said by McHugh J in <b>Re The Minister
for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of The Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte
Lai Qin </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20186%20CLR%20622" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 186 CLR 622</a> at 625, where his Honour said:
<P>

"If it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and
defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties
continued to be
reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became
futile, the proper exercise of the
cost discretion will usually mean that the
court will make no order as to the cost of the proceedings.  This approach has
been adopted
in a large number of cases.  See, eg, <b>Australian Securities
Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/585.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 585</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2044%20FCR%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 44 FCR 194</a>; <b>Seventh
Mingcourt Pty Ltd v Lawrence</b> (unreported; Federal Court of Australia; 1
August 1996), per Branson J; <b>Coleman v City of Melville</b> (unreported;
Supreme Court of WA; 22 September 1994), per Scott J; <b>Compadres Australia
Pty Ltd v Waterfront Place No 2 Pty Ltd</b> (unreported; Supreme Court of Q; 15
August 1995), per MacKenzie J; <b>Inprint Ltd v K &amp; D Media Pty Ltd</b>
(unreported; Federal Court of Australia; 22 December 1995), per Einfeld J;
<b>Australian Securities Commission v Berona Investments Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2018%20ACSR%20772" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 18
ACSR 772."</a>
<P>

In a sense these proceedings, in the events which have happened, lie somewhere
between the principle that applies in relation to
abandoned proceedings, where
the costs would prima facie fall on the abandoning party, and settled
proceedings, where the principle
stated by McHugh J would apply.  The element
of difference was that, on the one hand, the plaintiff, in the end, did not
press his
claim; on the other hand, the costs of the proceedings were still in
issue and, as the correspondence makes plain, there was an element
of
compromise in the agreement that was come to as to costs.  In addition, there
is another factor in the plaintiff's favour on the
exercise of the Court's
discretion as to the costs after 12 August 1999.  That is, the defendants
denied the existence of the agreement
which I have found to exist and brought
to Court a claim for indemnity costs of the proceedings.  On these matters they
have failed
in two ways.  I have rejected their argument that the agreement was
not binding, and I am also of the view that I should not order
indemnity costs
in any event, and certainly not in respect of the outstanding costs which
remain to be dealt with by the Court. 
Bearing in mind these disparate factors,
in my view the appropriate result is that each party should bear its own costs
of the proceedings
after 12 August 1999, the day up to which they are dealt
with by the agreement.
<P>

5   	Both parties have agreed that, if that were to be my
decision, the simplest way to deal with the situation would be simply
to make
an order that the plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings in the
sum of $25,000 and, in due course, when making
orders in the proceedings I
shall do that.
<P>

6   	In the meantime I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I direct that Mr Karageorge deliver to the plaintiff and to my Associate on
or before 24 August 1999 a form of the second cross
claim which he desires to
file in these proceedings.
<P>

(2)	I stand Mr Karageorge's application for leave to file that cross-claim and
his summons in proceedings 3575/99 over to 26 August
1999 at 9 am before me.
<P>

(3)	I direct the plaintiff to deliver to my Associate and to Mr Karageorge on
or before 24 August 1999 short submissions as to the
power to remove into this
Court the District Court proceedings referred to in Mr Karageorge's summons.
<P>

(4)	These proceedings are also stood over to that time for the making of
orders.
