<b><u>700217/98 - Regina v Hassan Kalache</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1	On 7 May 1997 I directed the jury to acquit the accused Mr Kalache.  These
are my reasons.
<P>

2	The threshold required for such a direction is stated as follows:  In
<i>Doney </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%2d91%29%20171%20CLR%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990-91) 171 CLR 207</a>, 212:
<P>

	"There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct such a verdict if
the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or,
as is commonly said, if there
is no evidence upon which a jury could convict."
<P>

3	The Crown case is to be taken at its highest: <i>R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 74</a>,
81; <i>Doney</i> at 213.
<P>

4	The case against Mr Kalache, as outlined in submissions, was one of
"straightforward joint criminal enterprise" or "common purpose"
as those
expressions are used in the authorities, there being no evidence that it was Mr
Kalache who stabbed the deceased.  
<P>

5	In <i>Tangye</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2092%20A%20Crim%20R%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 92 A Crim R 545</a>, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom McInerney
and Sully JJ agreed) said (at 556-558):
<P>

	"The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only
where - as in the present case - it cannot establish
beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged.
It needs to rely upon the extended
concept of joint criminal enterprise, based
upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the
enterprise
agreed.  This Court has been making that point for years, See, for
example: <i> Regina v Stokes</i> <i>&amp; Difford</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2051%20A%20Crim%20R%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 51 A Crim R 25</a> at
35-37; <i>Regina v Clough</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2028%20NSWLR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 28 NSWLR 396</a> at 400.
<P>

	<b>....</b>
<P>

<center><b>	</b>The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint
criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or
others in
carrying out that enterprise.  The Crown must establish both the existence of
that joint criminal enterprise and the participation
in it by the
accused.</center>
<P>

	<b>....</b>
<P>

<center><b>	</b>A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons
reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between
them
that they will commit a crime.  The understanding or arrangement need not be
express, and its existence may be inferred from
all the circumstances.  It need
not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed.  The
circumstances in which two
or more persons are participating together in the
commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken
understanding
or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then
and there to commit that crime.</center>
<P>

	<b>....</b>
<P>

<center>	A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by
committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at
the time when
the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being
committed) by intentionally assisting
or encouraging another participant in the
joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime.  The presence of that person at
the time
when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is
sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant
in the joint
criminal enterprise to commit the crime.</center>
<P>

	<b>....</b>
<P>

<center><b>	</b>As I have said, common purpose becomes necessary only where
there has been an agreement to carry out a particular crime (some text
books
call it the foundational crime) but some other crime has been committed which
had been within the contemplation of the accused
as a possible incidence in the
execution of their agreed joint criminal enterprise (some text books call it
the incidental crime)
which is said to be within the scope of the common
purpose: <i> Johns v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20143%20CLR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 143 CLR 108</a> at 130-131; <i>Mills v
The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 71</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2068%20ALR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 68 ALR 455</a> at 455; <i>McAuliffe v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183
CLR 108</a>, 113-116.</center>
<P>

6	The test is subjective: <i> McAuliffe</i>, at 114-5.
<P>

7	"Straightforward joint criminal enterprise" requires an agreement to do some
act or acts constituting murder or manslaughter.
 "Common purpose" requires
agreement to commit a "foundational crime", the "incidental crime" being the
crime charged, that is, murder
or the statutory alternative of manslaughter.
<P>

8	The evidence at its highest - according to the Crown Prosecutor's submissions
- was as follows:
<P>

(a)	Mr Kalache arrived at the General Bourke Hotel with others, including Mr
Sleiman.
<P>

(b)	Mr Kalache, with another member of the group, was directly involved in an
altercation with the deceased in the toilets.
<P>

(c)	Mr Kalache was present in the group when Mr Sleiman became involved in an
altercation with the deceased.
<P>

(d)	Mr Kalache approached the deceased and induced the deceased to leave the
hotel with him.
<P>

(e)	Mr Kalache and the deceased were followed by other members of the group,
including Mr Sleiman.
<P>

(f)	Mr Kalache and the deceased walked onto the grassed area in front of the
hotel, followed by others in the group.
<P>

(g)	An incident then occurred which involved the deceased and others moving
over an area on both sides of two trees located in the
grassed area.
<P>

(h)	The deceased was, at some stage during the incident, pushed on the shoulder
by Mr Kalache, assaulted by one or more of the group
(causing contusion and
abrasion injuries to the face, head and hands), and was fatally stabbed in the
chest and upper abdomen.
<P>

(i)	Shortly after the incident, the deceased was asked who did it.  He replied
that it was Mr Kalache.  This was not relied upon
by the Crown as evidence that
Mr Kalache stabbed the deceased.  (That concession by the Crown - if it be a
concession - was rational,
proper and appropriate.  I do not believe the Crown
had the alternative open to it as a practical matter.)  The Crown relied on the
deceased's statement as evidence that Mr Kalalche was present and participated
in the assault on the deceased to a significant degree.
<P>

(j)	Immediately following the incident, Mr Kalache picked up the knife which
had fallen to the ground.
<P>

(k)	Mr Sleiman and Mr Kalache ran from the immediate scene.
<P>

(l)	Mr Sleiman and Mr Kalache (with another or others) entered Mr Sleiman's
motor vehicle, which was parked in the street nearby,
and drove off.
<P>

(m)	When interviewed by the police, Mr Kalache said, untruthfully, that he was
not there at the time and did not know that Mr Sleiman
was there.
<P>

9	Counsel for Mr Kalache submitted that there was no evidence of some of these
factual matters.  I assumed, without deciding that
there was.
<P>

10	On those facts, there was no evidence of agreement (express or implied)
between Mr Kalache and any other or others to injure
the deceased with the
specific intent required to constitute murder or by an unlawful and dangerous
act so as to constitute manslaughter.
 Therefore, there is no evidence of
"straightforward joint criminal enterprise".
<P>

11	As to "common purpose", I assumed, without deciding, that there was evidence
of agreement to commit a "foundational crime", namely
assault.  However, there
was no evidence that Mr Kalache contemplated, as a possible incidence in the
execution of the enterprise
to commit that crime, that the crime of murder or
manslaughter might be committed by one or more of the group in the way that
occurred
or in any cognate manner.
<P>

12	There was no evidence that Mr Kalache knew that anyone in the group had a
knife.  There was no evidence that Mr Kalache would
have contemplated that a
knife might be produced and used.
<P>

13	Adopting the language used in <i>Anderson and Morris</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%202%20QB%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 2 QB 110</a>,
120, "one of (the adventurers) has departed completely from the concerted
action of the common design and has suddenly formed an
intent to kill and has
used a weapon and acted in a way which no party to that common design could
suspect".  Adopting the language
used in <i>Duong, Lu Do</i> &amp;<i> Tran</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2061%20A%20Crim%20R%20140" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 61 A Crim R 140</a>, 148, "the use of the knife ....was entirely outside the
scope of what could be expected to occur ...".
