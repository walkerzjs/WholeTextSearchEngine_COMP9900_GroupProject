<P>

<b>20187/97   -   DAVID ANDREW BRODIE  v  COMMONWEALTH</b>
<P>

<b>			OF AUSTRALIA</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Extension of time - Limitation of Actions </b>
<P>

<b>Act 1958, Victoria)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 10 March 1997 the plaintiff seeks
an extension of time within which to commence proceedings.  The accident
for
which the plaintiff seeks the extension of time occurred on 2 November 1972 at
Bendiana Army Barracks in the State of Victoria.
 The orders sought were
opposed.  The plaintiff relied on his affidavits sworn 26 September 1996 and 2
April 1998 and the affidavits
of his solicitor, David Maurice Stack sworn 15
October 1997 and 11 March, 1999.  The defendant relied on the affidavits of Con
Ktenas
sworn 29 January 1997 and 20 March, 1997.
<P>

2	The plaintiff gave evidence and was cross examined and I formed the opinion
that he was truthful and articulate.  At times when
the plaintiff was
recounting his evidence he became visibly upset.
<P>

3	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 31 July 1951 at Bega.
<P>

(2)	On 5 July 1972 the plaintiff was conscripted into the Australian Regular
Army as a National Serviceman. He was 17 years old.
<P>

(3)	On 2 November 1972 the plaintiff's platoon was sent on a route march.  The
plaintiff was lined up with other members of his
platoon to board an army truck
at Bendiana army barracks which is in the State of Victoria.  There was a seat
running along both
sides of the truck and the soldiers boarded from each side
of the truck.  As each soldier boarded he sat on the rear of the seat
on his
side of the truck facing the next person.  He then extended his right hand and
took the right hand of the person behind to
help him to step up onto the truck.
The person behind placed one foot on the rear bumper bar of the truck which was
about 4 feet
above ground level and then stepped up onto the tray of the truck
which was about 12 inches higher than the bumper bar.
<P>

(4)	As the plaintiff stepped up onto the truck the person in front of him
extended his right hand which the plaintiff gripped with
his right hand.  As
the soldier took the plaintiff's weight he lost his grip on the plaintiff's
wrist and as a result the plaintiff
fell backwards.  The plaintiff fell onto
the rifle of the soldier immediately behind him.  The barrel, the flash
illuminator, the
bayonet boss and the stock of the barrel penetrated the
plaintiff's body between his anus and his backbone.  The plaintiff landed
with
his feet about 12 inches apart and was impaled on the soldier's rifle.  The
plaintiff estimated that the rifle penetrated his
body by 8 inches.  After some
time some soldiers grabbed him, lifted him up and pulled the rifle out.  He
experienced excruciating
pain in his lower back and all the way down his legs
and right up his spine to his head.  He had difficulty breathing and lost
movement
in his arms and legs and was drifting in and out of consciousness.

<P>

(5)	The plaintiff was taken to Wodonga base hospital, was admitted and remained
in hospital for 3 weeks.  The Army medical records
relating to this accident
are available.  He was off work for one month following the accident.  Since
the accident the plaintiff
has never been totally without back pain although
for many years the pain was intermittent and he had difficulties sitting and
standing.
 However he had no psychological concerns nor did he have problems
with his bowel or bladder.  His back condition improved over the
next 12 months
to 2 years.  He was discharged from the Army in 1974.
<P>

(6)	From 1974 to 1976 the plaintiff was employed as a constable in the Police
force.  Due to severe low back pain which also radiated
down both his legs, he
was placed on permanent light duties.  As he did not join the Police force to
become a clerk he resigned.
 He stated in his resignation that he had a bad
back.  The plaintiff's employment records for this period exist.  He did not
have
any psychological concerns.
<P>

(7)	On 12 September 1978 the Repatriation Board advised the plaintiff that it
was unable to relate the injury to his lumbar intervertebral
disc lesion to his
service incapacity.  These records including the reasons for determination are
available.  The plaintiff, although
he could not be sure, said that he may have
seen a solicitor and it may have been on one or two occasions in relation to
this accident
but thinks it may have been when he lodged an appeal against this
determination.  He cannot now recall any advice that he received.
<P>

(8)	Some time between 1976 and 1979 the plaintiff developed urinary problems.
Dr Kidd told the plaintiff that his urinary problems
were a result of a
condition known as prostatitis and were brought on by stress.  The plaintiff
did not attribute the problem to
his lower back as being caused in the
accident.  At this time he was operating a driving school.  His urinary
problems got worse
and caused him much inconvenience. He was obliged to urinate
every few minutes into a bottle and this discomfort together with his
back
problems forced him to leave the business.  
<P>

(9)	In 1980 the plaintiff was employed by African Lion Park at Warragamba.
While the job was boring, he could relieve himself when
he needed to "and the
lions didn't care".  In between 1980 and 1983 the plaintiff was employed by
Glass Containers at Penrith as
a process worker.  He was sacked from this
employment as he had taken too many days off work.
<P>

(10)	In 1980 the plaintiff was referred to Dr Rochford.  It was Dr Rochford who
diagnosed that the plaintiff had a stricture high
in the urethra near the bulb
of the bladder and damage to his bowel as a result of his accident on 2
November 1972 and this was causing
his urinary problems.  When Dr Rochford
admitted the plaintiff to hospital, the plaintiff decided that he could not
live with the
pain any more and if Dr Rochford told him the pain was caused by
stress, it would not get any better and he would not be able to
provide for his
family.  If he could not provide for his family in the future he decided he
would commit suicide.  However if there
was a surgical solution, there would be
a future.  At this time he described himself as having a horrendous depression
and stress
caused by economic problems.  I accept this evidence.  
<P>

(11)	In 1982 Dr Rochford wrote on the plaintiff's behalf to the Department of
Defence claiming compensation as a result of the injury
to his urinary tract.
On 14 March 1983 the Department of Defence wrote to the plaintiff and said that
his claim for compensation
had been determined and liability had been admitted
under the provisions of the Act for a penetration wound of the perianal region
sustained by him on 2 November 1972.  He was disgusted by this letter and felt
it did not come close to compensating him for the
injuries he suffered in the
accident.  He did not receive any payments for compensation but he claimed his
last hospital bills in
relation to this claim.
<P>

(12)	Since 1980 the plaintiff has undergone 22 operations in relation to his
urinary tract.  When he was a younger man he used to
jump out of bed the next
day.  In the latter years the plaintiff is filled with dread if he knows that
he has to have a further operation
as recovery is more difficult.
<P>

(13)	From 1988 to 3 April 1996 the plaintiff was employed by the Attorney
General's Department of New South Wales as a co-ordinator
in the Community
Justice Centre.  In 1993 the plaintiff was instrumental in setting up the
Hunter Community Justice Centre.  He loved
the work and considered himself one
of the best in the world at large scale disputes.  He believed he was a serious
contender for
the position of Director of Community Justice Centres in New
South Wales upon retirement of the then incumbent.
<P>

(14)	In mid 1994 the plaintiff's health began to deteriorate and he began to
suffer chest pains and numbness down the left side
of his body.  The urinary
problems started to become more severe in that his urinary tract slowed down so
that he had trouble urinating
and it started to block up.  The plaintiff knew
that he needed to have another surgical procedure but was finding the prospect
of
yet another operation difficult to face as he dreaded straightening up,
walking around feeling the pain of a half opened pen knife
and not being able
to urinate without screaming.  His back deteriorated to the extent that he had
to get out of bed at 4.00 am, take
a bath at 5.00 am and take a walk in order
to be physically able to get himself to work by 9.00 am.  He began to have
dreams which
were becoming clearer and the images were like collages.  He would
relive the accident occurring, the trip to hospital and wake up
in a sweat with
his heart pounding.  These vivid dreams occurred nightly.  He would wake up and
be scared to go back to sleep.  The
instant his head would hit the pillow these
dreams with collage effect would begin again.  He did not relate these collage
effect
dreams to the accident.  
<P>

(15)	In October 1995 the plaintiff consulted Dr Schmitman.  Dr Schmitman
confirmed that the plaintiff first consulted her on 20
September 1995.  She
diagnosed that the plaintiff was suffering from a chronic post traumatic stress
disorder with associated anxiety
and depression and it was her opinion that the
plaintiff's condition was related to the accident which occurred during his
national
service in 1972.  The plaintiff described being shocked when he was
told of this diagnosis.  Dr Schmitman also says that the plaintiff's
prognosis
in relation to his PTSD is poor, due to the severity of his condition, its long
standing duration and the limited response
to treatment so far.  She said that
it was likely that the plaintiff would remain permanently vulnerable to future
stress and trauma,
with possible exacerbations of his condition when under
pressure.  She believed that it was unlikely that the plaintiff would be
able
to resume working in paid employment in the foreseeable future.
<P>

(16)	On 3 April 1996 the plaintiff was retired from his employment on the
medical grounds of PTSD with major depressive illness.
<P>

(17)	On 24 June 1996 the plaintiff sought legal advice from his current
solicitors.
<P>

(18)	On 23 September 1996 a statement of claim and notice of motion seeking an
extension was filed in this court in proceedings
No 20187/97.  On 10 October
1997 the plaintiff discontinued these proceedings.
<P>

(19)	On 10 March 1997 the plaintiff filed a statement of claim and the notice
of motion seeking an extension of the limitation period.
 
<P>

(20)	The plaintiff's present condition is that he still has intermittent low
back pain but it has deteriorated both in severity
and frequency over the last
couple of years.  Whereas he previously had intermittent pain radiating down
the right leg, he now finds
that he has the pain radiating into that leg on a
daily basis.  He still has the urinary stricture problems which he understands
will continue to require annual minor surgery and each time he has this surgery
he may react more adversely to the anaesthetic which
is becoming more
difficult.  The plaintiff is reliant on daily medication, Aropax to control his
depression and despite the medication
he is frequently in a state of
depression.  He suffers from nightmares on average every second night and has
difficulty in sleeping
and is constantly tired.  He is unable to cope with
stressful situations.  He 
<P>

is short tempered and irritable and is angry and frustrated at his inability to
work and at the loss of opportunity to achieve the
pinnacle of his career which
would have been obtaining the position of State Director, Community Justice
Centres.
<P>

4	The accident occurred at Bendiana army barracks in the state of Victoria. The
parties agreed that the appropriate legislation
was <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions
Act</a></b> 1958 (Victoria) (as amended).  It is my view that the Victorian law is
the applicable law - see <b><u>Miller v McKain</u></b> (1991) 174 CLR and
<b><u>Stevens v Head</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 176 CLR 433.</a>  <b>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/colpa1993301/" class="autolink_findacts">Choice of Law
(Limitation Periods) Act 1993</a></b> was passed in Victoria on 23 November 1993.
Legal argument proceeded on the basis that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/colpa1993301/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 5(1A)</a>, (1B) and (1C) and 23A in
the current form of that Act applied.  However, the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions
Act</a></b> 1958 (Vic) has been significantly amended since 1958 namely in 1972,
1983 and 1989.  This matter was heard on 12 March 1999.  On
31 March 1999 the
matter was relisted and it was drawn to the parties attention that the
applicable legislation appeared to be <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1A)</a>, (1B) and (1C) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23A(1)</a> as it
appears in the 1972 Act and to give the parties an opportunity to be heard on
this point.  The parties agreed that the above
was the applicable legislation
and if they wished to draw my attention to any relevant 1989 amendments they
should do so by 23 April
1999. No submissions were received.
<P>

5	Section 5(6) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions Act</a></b> 1958 provided:
<P>

<b>"(6)	No action for damages for negligence nuisance  or breach or duty
(whether the duty exists by virtue or a contract or of provision
made by or
under a statute or independently of any contract or any such provision), where
the damages claimed by the plaintiff consists
of or include damages in respect
of personal injuries to any person, shall be brought after the expiration of
three years after the
cause of action accrued."</b>
<P>

6	By virtue of the 1972 amendment (Act No 8300 of 1972) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23A</a> (the "old <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23A")</a>
was introduced.  It relevantly provided:
<P>

<b>"Personal Injuries</b>
<P>

<b>23A(1)This section applies to a cause of action in respect of personal
injuries whether or not the cause of action accrued or is claimed
to have
accrued before the commencement of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/loaia1972415/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions (Personal
Injuries) Act</i> 1972</a>.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Where on an application to a court by or on behalf of a person (in this
section called "the claimant") claiming to have a cause
of action for damages
for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue
of a contract or of a provision
made by or under a statute or independently of
any contract or any such provision) the damages claimed by the claimant consist
of
or include damages in respect of personal injuries to any person and it
appears to the court that -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	any of the material facts relating to the cause of action -</b>
<P>

<b> (i)	was not known to the claimant;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	would not have been known to the claimant if he had taken all
reasonable steps in the circumstances of the case to ascertain
all the material
facts -</b>
<P>

<b>until a date later than two years after the cause of action accrued or is
claimed to have accrued or, if the claimant was under a
disability when the
cause of action accrued or is claimed to have accrued, two years after the
claimant ceased to be under the disability,
whichever last occurred;
and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	there is evidence to establish the cause of action apart from any
defence founded on the expiration of the period of three years
after the cause
of action accrued-</b>
<P>

<b>the court may in its discretion order that the period within which an action
on the cause of action may be brought be extended so
that it expires at the end
of one year after the date referred to in paragraph (a) or, provided that
application was made to a court
before the expiration of one year after that
date, on such late date, if any, as is specified in the order.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	For the purposes of sub-section (2) "material facts" in relation to a
cause of action include -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the fact of the occurrence of negligence, nuisance or breach of duty on
which the cause of action is founded;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the nature of the wrongful act, neglect or default that constituted the
negligence, nuisance or breach of duty;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the identity of the person whose wrongful act, neglect or default
constituted the negligence nuisance or breach of duty;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	the identity of the person against whom the cause of action lies;</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	the fact that the negligence, nuisance or breach of duty caused personal
injury;</b>
<P>

<b>(f)	the nature of the personal injury so caused;</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	the extent of the personal injury so caused;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(h)	the extent to which the personal injury was caused by the negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty."</b>
<P>

7	This <b>Act</b> (No 8300 of 1972) came into operation on 1 January 1973 and
would appear to be the applicable legislation governing this case where
the
cause of action accrued in 1972.
<P>

8	However ss 5 and 23 were further amended in 1983.  Section (1A) was inserted
and s 5(6) was repleaded by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/loaica1983460/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions (Personal Injury
Claims) Act</a></b> 1983 (Act No 9884 of 1983) which came into operation on 11 May
1983.
<P>

9	The transitional provision, section 11 of <b>Act (No 9884 of 1983)</b>
provided:
<P>

<b>"11.	(1)	The Acts amended by this Act shall apply as amended by this Act
-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	to a cause of action arising not more than six years before the date of
commencement of this Act;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	to a cause of action arising on or after the date of commencement of
this Act.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	The Acts amended by this Act shall apply as in force immediately before
the commencement of this Act to a cause of action arising
more than six years
before the date of commencement of this Act."</b>
<P>

10	By virtue of s 11, these new provisions apply to causes of action not more
than 6 years before 11 May 1983 ie., causes of action
arising from 11 May 1977
onwards.  The old provisions apply to causes of action arising before 11 May
1977.  However, s 5(1B) and
s 5(1C) were introduced in this <b>Act</b>.
<P>

11	Sections 5(1A), (1B) and (1C) provide:
<P>

	<b>"5(1A)[Negligence, nuisance, breach of duty]</b>
<P>

<b>	 An action for damages for negligence nuisance or breach of duty (whether
the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of provision
made by or under a
statute or independently of any contract or any such provision) where the
damages claimed by the plaintiff consist
of or include damages in respect of
personal injuries consisting of a disease or disorder contracted by any person
may be brought
not more than six years from, and the cause of action shall be
taken to have accrued on, the date on which the person first knows
-</b>
<P>

<b>	(a)	that he has suffered those personal injuries;  and</b>
<P>

<b>	(b)	that those personal injuries were caused by the act or omission of some
person.</b>
<P>

<b>	5(1B) [Application of sec 1A]</b>
<P>

<b>	Sub-section (1a) as amended by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/loaa1989306/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions (Amendment) Act
1989</a></i> applies to each case where the date on which a person first knew the
matters specified in paragraph (a) and (b) of that sub-section
is within six
years before the commencement of that Act.</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>5(1C) [Other law excluded]</b>
<P>

<b>	Sub-sections (1A) and (1B) apply despite anything to the contrary in this
or any other Act."</b>
<P>

12	The 1989 Act added in s 5(1A) the words "the cause of action shall be taken
to have accrued on".  Section 5(1A) in its current
form "deems" the cause of
action to have accrued on the date of the knowledge - see <b><u>Hickey v
Women's and Children's Health Care Network</u></b> (unreported, 11 June 1998,
Supreme Court of Victoria).  The result of these legislative changes is that
the provisions of s 5(1A)
are applicable.  If the case falls outside s 5(1A)
and if an extension of the limitation period is required, the old s 23A
applies.
 This was the approach taken by Hedigan J in <b><u>Hickey</u></b> .
Section 5(1A) provides that certain actions for damages can be brought within 6
years from the date on which the person who contracted
the disease or disorder
first knows that he or she has suffered those personal injuries and that they
were caused by the act or omission
of some person - see <b><u>Mason v
Mason</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%201%20VR%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 VR 325.</a>  
<P>

13	The plaintiff submitted that firstly he does not have to apply for an
extension of time, secondly he does not have to apply for
an extension of time
in respect of the psychiatric injury as the plaintiff was unaware of this
injury until 1995 and finally that
once a new case is permitted to be started
it can include the previous injuries without an extension of time.  The
plaintiff suffered
injuries from the accident, physical injuries namely to the
back, bladder and urinary tract and two psychiatric conditions namely
PTSD and
major depression.  They are discrete injuries and should be treated separately.
However, the plaintiff submitted that even
an extension of time is not required
should I make such an order.  
<P>

14	I firstly turn to s 5(1A). After the plaintiff was discharged from the Army
in 1974 he suffered from low back pain which also
radiated down both his legs
but did not have any psychological concerns.  While employed in the Police
service between 1974 and 1976
the plaintiff suffered severe lower back pain and
was placed on light duties.  In 1976 he resigned from the Police force citing
problems
with his back as the reason.  However in 1978 the plaintiff lodged a
claim for compensation with the defendant in relation to his
lumbar
intervertebral disc lesion.  Hence it is my view that in 1978 the plaintiff was
aware that he had a back injury which was
caused by the defendant.  In 1978 he
first had the knowledge that satisfied s 5 (1A)(a) and (b) in relation to his
back and an action
should have been brought by 1984.  In any event, it is
unclear whether a back injury falls within the definition of disorder.  It
would not seem to be a disease.  As the plaintiff's claim was filed on 10 March
1997 his claim in relation to his back falls outside
the provisions of s
5(1A).
<P>

15	Some time between 1976 and 1979 the plaintiff developed urinary problems and
was diagnosed with a condition called prostatitis
and though that this was
caused by stress.  In 1980 Dr Rochford diagnosed the plaintiff with a stricture
high in the urethra near
the bulb of the bladder and damage to his bowel as a
result of his accident and this was causing his urinary problems.  Dr Rochford
wrote on the plaintiff's behalf to the Department of Defence claiming
compensation as a result of the injury.  The plaintiff then
sought compensation
for his urinary tract problems and on 14 March 1983 the Department of Defence
wrote to him stating that his claim
for compensation had been determined and
liability had been admitted under the provisions of the Act for a penetration
wound of the
perianal region sustained by him on 2 November 1972.  By 1983 the
plaintiff knew that his urinary tract problems were serious and
this injury was
related to the accident and he had until 1989 to bring an action for this
injury.  The plaintiff's claim for injury
to his bladder and bowel falls
outside the provisions of s 5(1A).  Again, it is unclear as to whether a
stricture is a disorder.
 It would not seem to be a disease.
<P>

16	In 1980 the plaintiff admitted that he suffered from horrendous depression
and stress caused by economic problems and not being
able to provide for his
family.  He was having nightmares.  I accept that prior to 1994 the plaintiff
attributed his depression (which
occurred mainly in 1980) to his inability to
get work.  By mid 1994 the plaintiff was aware that his health was beginning to
deteriorate
and he was suffering chest pains and numbness down the left side of
his body.  His urinary problems started to become more severe.
 His urinary
flow was slowing and it was difficult for him to pass urine without screaming
due to the pain.  He knew he needed to
have another surgical procedure but
found the prospect of that difficult to face.  He began to have dreams which
became clear and
the images were like a collage effect.  He was reliving the
accident, the trip to hospital and was waking up in a sweat with his
heart
pounding.  These vivid dreams occurred nightly  He was waking up scared and
unable to go back to sleep.  
<P>

17	In October 1995 at his consultation with Dr Schmitman the plaintiff became
aware that he was suffering from PTSD with associated
anxiety and depression
which were likely to have been a result of his accident.  This diagnosis came
as a shock to the plaintiff.
 By April 1996 the plaintiff was aware that he
suffered from PTSD with major depressive illness (t 22) and it was so severe
that
he would not be able to continue in employment.  On 3 April 1996 the
plaintiff was medically retired from his employment on the basis
of PTSD with
major depressive illness.  I accept that in October 1995 the plaintiff first
knew that he suffered from PTSD and major
depression and that these conditions
were related to the accident.  As the plaintiff's statement of claim and notice
of motion were
filed on 10 March 1997, the plaintiff's claim in relation to
PTSD and major depression falls within s 5(1A).  The plaintiff's cause
of
action in relation to PTSD and major depression are deemed to have accrued in
October 1995.  The plaintiff had 6 years from October
1995 to bring an action.
The statement of claim and motion were filed on 10 July 1997.  The action has
been brought within the period
stipulated in s 5(1A).  
<P>

18	Lest I be wrong in relation to the applicability of s 5(1A) I turn to
consider s 23A in relation to the back and bladder injuries.
 This version of s
23A requires the plaintiff has to establish that pursuant to subsection 2(a)(i)
and subsection 2(a)(ii) first
that for more than 2 years after the accrual of
the causes of action he wished to pursue, any of the material facts relating to
the
cause of action were not known to him and secondly that any such fact would
not have been known to him had he taken all reasonable
steps in the
circumstances to ascertain the material facts.  Once he has knowledge of the
material facts he had to make an application
to the court within one year for
an extension of the limitation period.  The accident occurred on 5 July 1972.
The limitation period
expired on 5 July 1975.  Any knowledge must have been
acquired after 5 July 1977.  The plaintiff had to show that after 10 March
1996
(a date one year before he filed his notice of motion) a material fact relating
to the cause of action was not known to him
or would not have been known to him
had he taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ascertain all the
material facts. 
The notice of motion and statement of claim were filed on 10
March 1997.  To be within the time period stipulated by s 23A the latest
that
the plaintiff could have commenced action was October 1996.  This material fact
falls outside the period stipulated by s 23A
and the plaintiff's claim fails.
As I have previously stated by 1978 the plaintiff knew that he had suffered
physical injury to his
back and that it was caused by the accident because he
had lodged a compensation claim against the defendant which linked the back
injury to the accident.  He knew the nature and extent of his back injury in
1978.  The plaintiff also knew the nature and extent
of his urinary and bowel
problems and that they were caused by the accident by 1983.  The material fact
relied upon was that he did
not know that he was suffering a psychiatric
condition of PTSD and major depression until October 1995.  These claims all
fall outside
the threshold period stipulated by s 23A and must fail.  It is not
necessary that s 23A should be considered in light of <b><u>Brisbane South
Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a> (see
<b><u>Hickey</u></b>).
<P>

19	The defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff has a real cause of
action.  It is my view that the appropriate order for costs
is that costs be
costs in the cause.
<P>

20	The court declares that:
<P>

(1)	By reason of s 5(1A) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions Act</a></b> 1958 (as
amended) the plaintiff's claim for PTSD and depression which arose from an
accident which occurred on 2 November 1972 are
not statute barred.
<P>

21	The court orders that:
<P>

(1)	Costs be costs in the cause.
