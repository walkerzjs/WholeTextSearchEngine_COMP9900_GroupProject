<b>	1752/99 - C T DUNCAN PTY LTD -V- WELDWORKS 		ENGINEERING 	PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>	JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	MASTER:  This is an application  to set aside a statutory
demand.  The statutory demand was served by the defendant on the
plaintiff and
dated 23 February 1999.  The amount claimed is $29,133.  It is conceded that
there is a dispute in respect of the sum
of $1338.  Accordingly the demand is
sought to be supported in the sum of $27,800.  There is now, although there was
earlier no dispute
as to the applications being made within time.  
<P>

2   	The plaintiff is a builder and the defendant is a
subcontractor doing works for it on a site.  The dispute concerns the
contractual
arrangements between them.  In determining whether there is a
genuine dispute it is necessary to bear in mind that this Court cannot
in this
application determine the question of the dispute between the parties about the
contractual arrangements.   The Court's task
under the section of the
Corporations Law is to determine whether in fact there is a genuine dispute
about that matter.  
<P>

3   	In this regard in determining whether there is a genuine
dispute the most recent summation of the law is that given by McLelland
CJ in
Equity in <b>Eyota Pty Ltd v. Hanave Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 669.</a>  At p
671 his Honour made the following comments in respect of the expression
"Genuine dispute".
<P>

"It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression 'genuine
dispute' where it occurs in s 459H.  In my opinion
that expression connotes a
plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of
considerations as the 'serious
question to be tried' criterion which arises on
an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal
of
a caveat. This does not mean that the Court must accept uncritically as
giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an affidavit
'however
equivocal, lacing in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary
documents or other statements by the same deponent,
or inherently improbable in
itself, it may be' not having 'sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit
further investigation as
to (its) truth' (cf <b>Eng Mee Yong v. Letchumanan</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC 331</a> at 341) or 'a patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of
facts unsupported by evidence' (cf <b>South Australia v. Wall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2023%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 23
SASR 189</a> at 194.)
<P>

But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a Court required to
determine whether there is a genuine dispute should not
embark upon an inquiry
as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute.  There
is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining wehther there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute.  In <b>Mibor
Investments</b> (at ACLC  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1066%20ACSR%20366%2d7" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1066; ACSR 366-7)</a> Hayne J said, after referring to the
state of the law prior to the enactment of Division 3 of Part 5.4 of the
Corporations Law, and
to the terms of Divisions 3:
<P>

	'These matters, taken in combination,
<P>

	suggest that at least in most cases, it
<P>

	is not expected that the Court will embark
<P>

	upon any extended inquiry in order to
<P>

	determine whether there is a genuine dispute
<P>

	between the parties and certainly will not
<P>

	attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute.
<P>

	All that the legislation requires is that
<P>

	the Court conclude that there is a dispute
<P>

	and that it is a genuine dispute.'
<P>

In <b>Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20919" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 919</a> at 922;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 602</a> at 605 Thomas J said:
<P>

				'There is little doubt that Division 3 ...
<P>

	prescribes a formula that requires the
<P>

	Court to assess the position between the
<P>

	parties, and preserve demands where it
<P>

	can be seen that there is no genuine
<P>

	dispute and no sufficient genuine off-
<P>

	setting claim.  That is not to say that
<P>

	the Court will examine the merits or
<P>

	settle the dispute. The specified limits
<P>

	of the Court's examination are the
<P>

	ascertainment of whether there is a "genuine
<P>

	dispute" and whether there is a "genuine
<P>

	claim."
<P>

	It is often possible to discern the
<P>

	spurious, and to identify mere bluster
<P>

	or assertion.  But beyond a perception
<P>

	of genuineness (or the lack of it) the
<P>

	Court has no function.  It is not helpful
<P>

	to perceive that one party is more likely
<P>

	than the other to succeed, or that the
<P>

	eventual state of the account between
<P>

	the parties is more likely to be one result
<P>

	than another.
<P>

	The essential task is relatively simple - to
<P>

	identify the genuine level of a claim (not
<P>

	the likely result of it) and to identify the
<P>

	genuine level of an offsetting claim (not
<P>

	the likely result of it).'
<P>

4   	I respectfully agree with those statements."
<P>

5   	The dispute is said to centre around the arrangements for
work that was to be done by the defendant for the plaintiff.  It
seems clear
that there was an initial quotation for $30,000 given verbally by the defendant
to the plaintiff.  That followed upon
Mr Holsworth for the defendant being
given two plans so that he could peruse them and see the amount of work
involved.  There is
evidence on behalf of the plaintiff that he was given plans
S01 and S02.  However that is disputed by Mr Holsworth who says that
he only
had plan SO2.  
<P>

6   	What is clear is that after the oral quotation was given
that a fax was sent by Mr Holsworth to the plaintiff.  That fax referred
to the
fact that there had been an oral quotation for $30,000 and indicated that
having only had one plan in respect of the site,
the job would cost more and a
total price of $57,800 was quoted and that thirty per cent was required before
commencement, that being
$17,340.
<P>

7   	The matter has been dealt with in affidavits both by Mr
Duncan and also by Mr Holsworth, Mr Duncan on behalf of the plaintiff
and Mr
Holsworth on behalf of the defendant.   Clearly they are at issue about what
happened after the giving of the initial oral
quotation for $30,000.  In par
7.2 Mr Duncan swears to the effect that after he received the written quotation
he rang up Mr Holsworth
and taxed him about it and said:
<P>

"The quote was for $30,000, the extras can only be treated as a variation and
had to be approved by the Building Consultancy Centre.
 You would have to be
able to justify the claim."
<P>

8   	The substance of that paragraph is not dealt with except to
the extent that Mr Holsworth said that he telephoned Mr Duncan
and he said he
agreed to revise the price.  Clearly there is an issue between the parties as
to what happened in that telephone conversation.
 
<P>

9   	Thereafter there was obviously a delivery of the quotation
by Mr Holsworth to Mr Duncan in the meeting of 10 September.  Apparently
there
was taken at least initially an invoice which was numbered 003091 claiming a
progressive payment of $17,340, a figure which
had been mentioned in the fax.
That however obviously was not paid because a further one which was the next
invoice in sequence No
3092 was delivered showing an amount of $15,000.  
<P>

10   	Mr Holsworth gave evidence that the plaintiff was unable
to pay $17,340 which led to the change.  However Mr Duncan denies
that he was
unable to pay.  Clearly there was some discussion about a change and there is a
note which was signed by or in the handwriting
of Mr Duncan which refers to
invoice 3092 in which the first claim for $15,000 was authorised.  There is
also a note "Get original
invoice".  That might be an explanation for the
second invoice coming before payment was made.  Clearly what has been
authorised
is 3092 and that on its face does not say whether or not the
contract was per the written quotation or whether in fact it might have
been
pursuant to whatever was the discussion between Mr Duncan and Mr Holsworth
after the faxed quote.
<P>

11   	Subsequently the matter proceeded and it is also notable
that at the time when the later payment of $15,000 was made there
was submitted
from the defendant an invoice which referred to the total contract being
$57,800 and making a claim for $18,600.  Those
comments about the nature of the
original quotation have been crossed out and initialled with $15,000 written in
as $15,000 paid.
 Accordingly the changes to the invoice would support the view
that the plaintiff put forward about the variation.   It is clear
that the
question of variation was raised and the defendants asked to submit details.
They started to and ultimately the parties
fell out.  The defendant was
replaced on the works and the works were completed by the plaintiff.
<P>

12   	More recent evidence shows that given what information has
been supplied by the defendants the Building Consultancy Centre
has approved an
additional sum by way of variation of $10,107.17.  The other matter about which
there is evidence is the fact that
Mr Duncan has sworn that the work that the
company has done to complete the works after that became necessary was
$6612.90.  There
is some suggestion in correspondence that some of the amounts
were a little higher but that has not been sworn to.  It seems clear
to me
given that the question of whether or not there was an oral agreement on which
the parties embarked is one in which there is
a genuine dispute.  It could well
be that if Mr Duncan were accepted the documentation would be seen as having
more impact on his
position.  No doubt if Mr Holsworth were accepted on a final
hearing then the written quotation would be probably what governed the
parties'
rights.  That would run into the terms of the subsequent documents.
<P>

13   	It seems to me, therefore, that there is a genuine dispute
but the defendant should be credited with $10,017.17, an amount
which I am
prepared to accept on the basis of the evidence already having been sworn.
There is by way of counter claim an amount
of $6612.90.   That leaves a balance
due by the plaintiff to the defendant of $3404.27.  An amount close to that has
been paid into
the solicitor's trust account pending the final determination of
these proceedings.
<P>

14   	Accordingly I order that the demand dated 23 February 1999
served on the plaintiff by the defendant be varied by reducing
the amount to
$3404.27.
<P>

15   	I have heard further argument on costs.  The plaintiff has
been substantially successful but not totally.  It had also made
an offer once
the proceedings were started and it is somewhat difficult to assess that in
terms of the impact on the costs order.
 In the result I make an order that the
defendant pay the plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis.
