<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>SMART AJ</b> :    Noel McDonnell  applies pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act, 1989</a> for an order determining a minimum term and an additional
term for the life sentence imposed upon him on 6 April 1978 by this Court
for
the murder of Kenneth Joseph Minall at Albury on 10 September 1977.
<P>

2	The application has some unusual features in that the applicant was released
on licence to be at large pursuant to section 463
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> on 22
June 1983 and remained at large in the community until his arrest on 20 August
1998, his licence having been revoked by the
Parole Board on 30 July 1998. The
catalyst for the Board's action was his conviction for assault in the Albury
Local Court on 25
June 1998, the order that he perform 150 hours community
service and his breach of that order.  The ground on which the licence was
cancelled was breach of condition 3 that the offender should be of good
behaviour during the term of the Licence.   
<P>

3	The licence issued followed the standard form and contained the deficiencies
which were discussed in <b>R v Boylan</b>, unreported CCA, 21 February 1995.
It should have made it clear that it was for the unexpired portion of the life
sentence in accordance
with s.463 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act, 1900</a>.  It stated that it
was to commence on the date of release (22 June 1983) and terminate on 21 June
1988.  What was meant was that
the applicant would report fortnightly, or as
otherwise required and accept Departmental supervision for five years.  He had
to keep
the Department advised of his residential address and employment and
not change them without the consent of his Probation and Parole
Officer.   The
conditions as to good behaviour and not associating with persons of bad
character lasted throughout the licence.
<P>

4	It was the practice of the Department to supervise licensees for five years
and then treat the licensee as being no longer subject
to supervision.  On 22
June 1998 the Probation and Parole Officer at Albury wrote to the applicant in
these terms:
<P>

<i>"This is to notify you that you are no longer required to report to the
Probation and Parole Service in accordance with your licence.</i>
<P>

<i>The expiry date of your Licence is 21st June 1988.</i>
<P>

<i>Good luck for the future."</i>
<P>

5	The officer records that on 22 June 1988 he spoke to the applicant at the
Department's office.  He explained that the licence
expired on 21 June 1988
after five years of supervision.  The officer noted that the applicant planned
to travel with his wife and
three children to Queensland.  The applicant told
the officer that he would make every effort to remain offence free.  What the
officer
stated was not the whole position. The applicant believed he had
completed his sentence and was no longer subject to the conditions
of the
licence.  The applicant's ability to read and write was very limited.  He would
not have understood the licence as has been
explained by the Court of Criminal
Appeal.  The licence is expressed in confusing verbiage and on its face it
appears to be a licence
for five years.
<P>

6	During the five year period the applicant received warning letters  from the
Release on Licence Board dated 29 November 1985,
19 February 1987 and 22
December 1987.  There were some relatively minor offences and, on occasions, he
drank too much.  He was amenable
to supervision and co-operative.  He accepted
the advice of his Probation and Parole Officers and was guided back to
acceptable behaviour.
 He experienced difficulty in obtaining continuing
employment and that probably contributed to his drinking.
<P>

7	The applicant was released on licence consequent upon this recommendation of
the Indeterminate Sentence Committee (ISC):
<P>

<i>"... in terms of the Crimes (Homicide) Amendment Act 1982 McDonnell's case
is analogous to that of R v Slater - Fuller and that a
determinate sentence
would have been given if he was convicted since May, 1982.  As McDonnell has
now completed 5 years eight months
the Committee considers that he should be
released at this time."</i>
<P>

8	In <b>R v Slater</b> and <b>R v Fuller</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%206%20A%20Crim%20R%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 6 A Crim R 424)</a> the
appellants had been convicted of murder.  The directions as to intoxication and
common purpose were erroneous.  Verdicts of manslaughter
were substituted.  The
facts in <b>Slater</b> and <b>Fuller</b> bear some resemblance to those in the
present case.  A young man was punched, knocked to the ground and kicked,
suffering multiple
fractures of the skull.  The report does not disclose the
sentence imposed for manslaughter but it may have been in the order of
that
which the applicant had served.   In <b>Slater</b> and <b>Fuller</b> there was
a joint attack and the injuries inflicted were more extensive.  The reasoning
of the ISC appears to have been based on
a factual analogy and does not seem to
have taken into account the differences between a conviction for murder and a
conviction for
manslaughter.  The  facts were regarded as all important. The
ISC thought that the applicant should be dealt with in substantially
the same
way as <b>Slater</b> and <b>Fuller</b>.
<P>

9	In 1983 there was a policy, even for serious crimes, of the early release of
young offenders who had made good progress in prison,
were substantially
rehabilitated, were unlikely to re-offend and had served a considerable period
(over 5 years, it seems) in gaol.
  In 1985 there was a major attack in the
media on this policy, with reference being made  to the cases of some of those
who had
been released.  This made the applicant anxious.   The important point
is that the applicant was released.  The release over 15 years
ago a result of
defective reasoning is not of moment after such a lapse of time.
<P>

10	I turn now to the facts of the murder.  On 10 September 1977 Mr and Mrs
Minall had spent the day drinking at home and in hotels.
 A blood sample from
the deceased taken during the post mortem examination some 14 hours after his
death revealed a blood alcohol
reading of 0.365.  On their way home they
stopped at a bottle shop near their home and Mrs Minall purchased some bottles
of beer.
 On resuming their journey she was in front carrying the beer and he
abused her in obscene terms.  At this point the applicant came
on the scene
(eating some chips) and remonstrated with Mr Minall for swearing at the lady.
While his wife continued towards her home
Mr Minall swung a punch at the
applicant which hit him on the shoulder.  In his record of interview (Q &amp; A
81) the applicant
stated that this made him <i> "wild</i>".  He had intended to
walk away from Mr Minall until he hit him.  In his record of interview this
passage appears:
<P>

<i>"Q47	Will you explain that fight to me?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He swung at me, so I hit him.</i>
<P>

<i>Q48	Can you tell me why he swung at you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He must have thought I was cheeky.</i>
<P>

<i>Q49	Is there any reason why he would think you were cheeky?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I told him to stop swearing.</i>
<P>

<i>Q50	Why did you tell him to stop swearing?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because there was a lady walking in front of him.</i>
<P>

<i>Q51	After you told him to stop swearing what actually took place?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I put my chips down, went to pick them up because he was too old and
thats when he swung at me and then I hit with one and then
the other and he
went down.</i>
<P>

<i>Q52	Can you tell me how he went down?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He just fell down, I think it might have been face down.</i>
<P>

<i>Q53	Will you tell me what you hit him with?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Me fist.</i>
<P>

<i>Q54	How many time did you hit him?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Twice.</i>
<P>

<i>Q55	Where did you hit him?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In the face.</i>
<P>

<i>Q56	What happened after he fell?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He didn't move."</i>
<P>

11	The applicant said that after this he ran away.  The applicant thought that
Mr Minall was about 45 and looked pretty drunk.
<P>

12	The applicant has at all times denied kicking Mr Minall.  However two eye
witnesses from different vantage points observed a
young man kicking an object
on the ground at the scene;  one observed "<i>about five kicks</i>" and used
the words "<i>vicious and hard</i>" to describe the kicks.  The other observed
"<i>about half a dozen kicks</i>".  Both eye witnesses independently went to
the scene and saw the body of the deceased lying, face upwards and a lot of
blood on
and around his face.
<P>

13	The applicant still does not believe that he kicked the deceased but he
accepts that this Court must proceed on the basis that
he did so.  This does
not reflect any lack of contrition.  The applicant is unable to believe that he
could have so kicked the deceased.
 His manner in the witness box was that of a
man who was very sorry for what had happened, his actions and their
consequences.
<P>

14	The causes of death were a fracture at the base of the skull, bruising to
the posterior of the brain with haemorrhage and brain
damage.  A strong
external force was applied.
<P>

15	The applicant made this statement to the jury:
<P>

<i>"Your Honour and gentlemen of the jury I am not guilty of this charge.  What
I have told the police in my interview is absolutely
the truth.   I did not
know this man and the only reason I spoke to him was because he was swearing
and I only hit him when he hit
me.  I did not kick him and all I done was in
self defence.</i>
<P>

<i>That day between12:00 and 6:00 pm.  I had had about six cans of beer,
quarter of a bottle of bourbon and about a quarter of a bottle
of ouzo and I
was pretty full when this happened.</i>
<P>

<i>I did not intend to hurt him or to kill him and I want you to please believe
me and find me `Not Guilty'."</i>
<P>

16	In his record of interview the applicant said that he went to a hotel and
had a couple of drinks and thence to the tattooist
where he played snooker and
drank beer, bourbon and ouzo.  He said that at the time of the incident he was
affected by liquor but
"<i>it wasn't that bad</i>".  Subsequent events have
shown that the applicant underestimates the effect of liquor upon him and the
extent to which he is affected.
<P>

17	The applicant told the police that after he ran away he hid for a period in
a stormwater drain and then went and saw some friends
at the tattoo shop.  The
applicant says that in truth he went to the house of some friends immediately
after the fight.  He did not
want them to become involved.  It appears that he
discussed the matter with some friends and that about 6 hours after the
incident
occurred he went to Albury Police Station and gave himself up having
heard of the death of the deceased.  Whether he would have been
identified if
he had not done this is not clear.
<P>

18	Upon the jury returning with a verdict of guilty of murder the applicant was
called up for sentence.  Immediately thereafter,
the trial judge said:
<P>

<i> "For the crime of which you have been convicted the law imposes but one
sentence and that is penal servitude for life.  That is the
sentence I impose."
</i>
<P>

The judge was not provided with the applicant's antecedents as the sentence was
mandatory.  There was no occasion for the judge
to say anything more. 
<P>

19	In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Street CJ, with whom Collins and Lusher JJ
agreed, described the attack as one characterised
by vicious kicking and the
Crown case as a strong one.  The principal issue at the trial was whether the
applicant kicked the deceased
and that was resolved in the Crown's favour.
<P>

20	I am satisfied that the applicant's response to the obscene abuse was
unplanned and spontaneous.  There were no weapons and he
was not looking for a
fight.  I am also satisfied that he had no intent to kill and that his intent
was limited to inflicting grievous
bodily harm.  This latter intent was
probably formed sometime after the fight started.  The viciousness lay in the
kicking.  He went
"<i>wild</i>" after the deceased punched him.  The deceased
would have been virtually helpless having regard to the liquor he had consumed.
 The
applicant who was just 19, was not fully in control of himself due to the
liquor he had consumed and had a gross over reaction.
<P>

21	The gravity of the offence is the paramount consideration.  This murder was
a little below the middle of the range of murders
and towards the lower end of
the range but not at the bottom of the range.  The applicant had just turned 19
at the time of the offence
and thus his rehabilitation was an important but a
subsidiary factor.
<P>

22	The applicant's record prior to the murder was as follows:-

24	The matters of 24 October 1986 and 23 November 1987 were the subject of
warnings from the Release on Licence Board.  Some time
after the 5 years
expired in June 1988 the applicant, his wife and their family went to South
Australia and matters went well.  They
returned to the Albury district.  The
applicant obtained employment from time to time but there were difficulties in
obtaining constant
employment.  Periods of unemployment led to a shortage of
money in the family and consequent friction.  He told Dr Wilcox that his
wife
had joined a Christian church or cult and that Church members had told her that
he was possessed of the devil.  He did not like
her behaviour or her "<i>doing
silly things</i>".  All this put a strain on the marriage and there were many
arguments.  The applicant drank to excess and committed offences.
<P>

25	The convictions of 1 March 1994 and 3 April 1996 involved assaults on the
applicant's wife and the convictions for breaches of
apprehended violence
orders also involved his wife. The conviction for assault on 25 June 1998
involved his wife as the victim. He
became angry when he found his eldest
daughter was not at school and his wife in bed. The breach of the Community
Service Order involved
the applicant leaving assigned work at the Culcairn Golf
Club without permission.  He contended that the machine which he was asked
to
operate was not safe as it did not have a roll bar.  There was, apparently, no
other community service work  available in Culcairn.

<P>

26	The applicant did not receive a warning after the 1992 or 1994 offences or
at any later time that his licence could be revoked.
 Nor was he told this
prior to revocation of the licence or in 1988 when the five year period
expired.
<P>

27	The applicant's family has four children, aged 16 to 10.  He does not know
whether it will be possible for him to have a relationship
with his wife.  They
separated on 25 June 1998.  He wishes to maintain contact with his children and
participate in rearing them.
 There has been no marriage counselling.  During
his current time in custody he has had weekly telephone contact with his
children
and 2 visits.  They live in the country.  His wife was present at the
hearing and was obviously concerned about him.
<P>

28	The Quarries Manager, Boral Group, in his reference of 28 August 1998 has
written:
<P>

<i>"During the time Noel was employed at the Culcairn Quarry he was always
punctual, reliable and hardworking.  Noel always related well
to all other
staff members and carried out all work related requests enthusiastically and
diligently.  Noel finished at Culcairn
Quarry due to shortage of work.</i>
<P>

<i>Since I have been at Teven Quarry, one month, Noel has made the 7km walk
once a week to personally enquire about employment and has
also rang the Quarry
regularly during this time.  I was more than happy to reinstate Noel for
further employment as our work load
increased in the near future. "</i>
<P>

29	In his reference of 14 April 1999 he wrote:
<P>

<i>"In regards to Noel McDonald as you may not be aware that when Noel was
staying in Ballina before he was imprisoned Noel was two days
off starting work
at Borals Teven Quarry.  In the past I have had Noel working for me as a fixed
plant operator, and later as a lab
technician, in the role as a technician a
lot of Noels work was done off site and unsupervised.  Noel didn't have any
difficulties
in performing any task that was set for him.</i>
<P>

<i>My personal and professional opinion of Noel is that he is hard working
reliable and honest.  If you need further reference regarding
Noel please don't
hesitate to contact me.  Phone 026687881 at home or work on 026687360."</i>
<P>

30	The applicant has been trained for the work mentioned and was anxious to
embark upon that work as soon as possible.  He believes
there is still a
position for him.  He is prepared to move from quarry to quarry with Boral to
retain employment.
<P>

31	In her interview of almost 2 hours on 24 April 1999 Dr Rosalie Wilcox, a
psychiatrist, obtained some of his history.  That has
proved helpful.  I have
incorporated some of it earlier in these reasons.
<P>

32	As to his alcohol problem, the applicant does not appear to have had any
physical symptoms but it has given rise to significant
social problems.  The
doctor stated that the applicant was quite resistant to accepting that he had a
problem with alcohol and tended
to blame others rather than take
responsibilities for his own actions.  He told the doctor that he would not be
keen on being told
that he had to give up alcohol but that if he was required
to do so he would stop drinking.
<P>

33	Dr Wilcox concluded:
<P>

<i>"Mr McDonell is not by nature a violent or anti-social man.  However, under
the influence of alcohol he becomes argumentative, his
ability to control his
temper is reduced and he can act in an aggressive manner.  In addition he has
minimal insight into the relationship
between his level of intoxication and his
offending behaviour.</i>
<P>

<i>Although Mr McDonell can be impulsive he has also shown that he can be
reliable and take direction.  The majority of his parole reports
in the first
five years following his release were favourable.  Most of his charges have
been associated with marital conflict. 
However it is my opinion that while Mr
McDonell continues to abuse alcohol he will pose a possible future risk to the
community,
in particular, his wife.</i>
<P>

<i>If Mr McDonell is able to become abstinent from alcohol and has the
opportunity to have ongoing support and supervision in relation
to his alcohol
abuse, then the future risk to the community and his wife should be
significantly reduced.  Although he has made a
decision to separate from his
wife, I believe it would be still beneficial for them to have marital
counselling in order to improve
their communication as he is going to continue
to have some form of contact with his wife due to his desire to maintain his
relationship
with his children."</i>
<P>

34	I think that the future relationship between the applicant and his wife is
unresolved.  I would not be prepared to say what is
likely to happen.
<P>

35	In his evidence the applicant said that he was not going to drink in the
future and that although he has known for years that
when he drinks alcohol he
gets into trouble he had not faced up to this.
<P>

36	I think that by the time the applicant reached the witness box he believed
that he had to agree to give up consuming alcoholic
drinks to have a good
chance  of being released at a relatively early date.  Previously he gave up
drinking alcoholic substances
for about three years when that was required.
Such is the desire of the applicant to leave prison, he will abstain from
drinking
alcohol if that is a condition of his release and remaining at
large.
<P>

37	The applicant is not an easy person from whom to obtain information.  This
is not due to any lack of frankness or untruthfulness
but to his defensiveness
and his inability to express him adequately.  It is necessary to speak to him
at a level which he understands.
 Even now he reads, writes and comprehends
with difficulty.  During the hearing he had to be helped to sort out the few
papers which
he had.  I would not expect him to be able to tell either his
legal advisers or a doctor all relevant factors.  He needs to be directed
to
particular subjects.  He does not appreciate what was and is important in a
legal context.  I found that it was possible, by the
appropriate manner and
language to establish a rapport with him but he still does not do himself
justice when speaking. This was
a case in which seeing and hearing the
applicant was of considerable assistance.
<P>

38	Section 13A(4A) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> requires the Court to have regard to
all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was
imposed, and all
offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been
convicted at any time. I have also had regard to the matters specified
in s
13A(9).  If I had been dealing with this matter on the basis that the applicant
had remained in full time custody then taking
into account the seriousness of
the offence, but given his good performance in gaol and his age of 19 at the
time of commission of
the crime I would probably have imposed a minimum term of
11 years and an additional term of 7 years.
<P>

<b>39	Reading</b>, CCA Unreported, 30 June 1998 makes it clear that the
sentence imposed runs while the applicant was on licence and living in the
community.  Sheller JA said at 24:
<P>

<i>"... the Court must, when setting a minimum term, and an additional term in
place of a life sentence, take account of any period during
which the applicant
was at large under licence and to be taken to have been or be serving the
sentence of life imprisonment."</i>
<P>

At 29-30 Sheller JA continued:
<P>

<i>"... there is a significant difference, in terms of the principles of
sentencing, between a person serving a sentence in custody and
a person serving
part of the sentence on parole.  However, during the period of licence the
appellant was subjected to what Yeldham
J in <b>Haley v Commissioner of
Corrective Services</b> at 120 described as stringent restrictions upon his
movements and conduct, greater during the five year period for which the
licence
was originally granted, but stringent even so, during the balance.  For
example, if the view expressed by Smart J in <b>Boylan</b> is right, the
appellant was prohibited from leaving the State of New South Wales.  On any
view, a citizen at large only because of
and subject to an executive licence is
not free.  Such a regime infringes to a considerable extent personal liberty.
In my opinion,
when coming to set a sentence pursuant to s 13A(4) the period of
licence must be treated as part of the sentence served with due
recognition of
the fact that it is not the equivalent of full time custody."</i>
<P>

40	Section 463 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> requires the licence to specify the limits
within which the applicant is to be at large.  Those limits may be extended, as
they were
in this case.
<P>

41	To allow for the fact that being at large under licence is not as onerous as
full time custody, the courts have extended the
minimum and additional terms to
ensure that the applicant spends sufficiently long in full time custody: see
<b>R v L.M. King</b>, CCA, Unreported, 24 February 1998 and <b>R v D.B.
Irving</b>, Wood CJ at CL, Unreported 10 June 1998.
<P>

42	The applicant was in custody from 11 September 1977 to 22 June 1983, a
period of 5 years 9 months and 11 days.  He has been in
custody from 21 August
1998 to 11 May 1999, a period of 8 months 20 days, a total of 6 years 6 months.
I have to allow for the period
of 5 years when he was under the close
supervision of the Probation and Parole Service (i.e. 22 June 1983 to 21 June
1988).  From
that date until 20 August 1998 the applicant has been on licence
subject to the condition of good behaviour, and liable to have his
licence
revoked although he did not realise this until the revocation occurred, nobody
having told him and the licence being on its
face for 5 years.  If the
applicant had realised that he could be returned to prison after the expiration
of the five years he would
have been more careful and taken more steps to
ensure that he did nothing which would lead to his return to prison.  While
there
have been a number of lesser offences there has been no major offence.
<P>

43	My approach has been to take the six and one half years that the applicant
has spent in prison and to make a significant allowance
of five years for the
time spent on licence when he was under the close supervision of the Probation
and Parole Service and a lesser
allowance for the next years spent on licence.
I have also taken into account the confusing terms of the licence that on its
face
it appeared to be for five years and that the applicant was given to
understand that after he completed his five year supervision
period he was at
large without restrictions.
<P>

44	I do not think that I should ignore that the Executive assessed that 5 years
9 months 11 days was a sufficient period for the
applicant to spend in prison.
I have to fix the minimum term which the applicant must serve in prison prior
to becoming eligible
for release on parole.  I do not think that he is required
to spend any more time in prison.  The time of his release on parole is
a
matter for the Parole Board.
<P>

45	The applicant will need supervision after his release from prison to ensure
that he does not drink alcoholic liquors.  A term
to this effect should be
incorporated into his release documents.
<P>

46	The sentence must date from the day on which the applicant was first taken
into custody.  The correct sentence is one comprising
a minimum term of 16
years and an additional term of 10 years.  These unusual figures allow for the
special facts and the exigencies
of this case.
<P>

47	In lieu of the life sentence I sentence Noel McDonnell to penal servitude
comprising a minimum term of 16 years commencing on
11 September 1977, and
ending on 10 September1993 and an additional term of 12 years commencing on 11
September 1993. I regard about
4 years 3 months as being a sufficient period of
supervision once the applicant is released.  It is to be hoped that he will be
able
to procure a job at the Quarry.
