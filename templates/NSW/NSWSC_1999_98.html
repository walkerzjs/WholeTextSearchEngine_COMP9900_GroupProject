<P>

<center><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: These Reasons are concerned with two motions - one by the
Second Defendant filed on 24 September 1998 seeking:-
<P>

1. 	A declaration that on 11 September 1996 the Plaintiff and the Second
Defendant agreed to compromise the proceedings commenced
by the Plaintiff
against, inter alia, the Second Defendant on terms:
<P>

1.1 	that the Second Defendant would without admission of liability pay to the
Plaintiff the sum of $5,000 in respect of its costs;
<P>

1.2 	the Plaintiff would take such steps as it were required (sic) to
discontinue the proceedings.
<P>

2. 	An order that the Plaintiff specifically perform the agreement referred to
in paragraph 1.
<P>

3. 	An order that the Plaintiff have leave to discontinue these proceedings.
<P>

4. 	An order that the Plaintiff or its Attorneys or the registrar of this Court
sign the Notice of Discontinuance annexed hereto
and marked "A" or that the
Plaintiff take such steps as are necessary to move the Court for leave to
discontinue the proceedings
pursuant to Part 21 of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

5. 	Such further or other order as this Court sees fit.
<P>

2	The second was filed by the Plaintiff on 3 July 1998 and seeks, inter
alia:-
<P>

	"1.  A declaration that any agreement between the Plaintiff and the Second
Defendant did not constitute an enforceable settlement
because there was not
finality of agreement and is void ab initio; and
<P>

	2.  In the alternative, if (which is denied) the Court finds that there is a
binding agreement between the Plaintiff and the Second
Defendant, a declaration
that the Agreement is void and unenforceable pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review
Act 1980</a>."
<P>

3	No objection was taken to either application proceeding by Notice of
Motion.
<P>

4	The proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 20 May 1991.
In that document the Plaintiff claims damages under
the Compensation to
Relatives Act consequent on what is said to have been negligence on the part of
one or both of the Defendants
causing the death in November 1989 of her
husband, said to have been an employee of the First Defendant.  Defences and a
Cross-Claim
by the First Defendant against the Second Defendant were filed in
1991.  An amended Cross-Claim was filed in December 1996.  On 3
June 1991 an
award in the sum of $167,000 was made in the Plaintiff's favour in the
Compensation Court.
<P>

5	Proceedings in this Court moved at a slow pace.  Although I do not suggest
the fault was all on one side, Mr Mason, the Plaintiff's
solicitor deposed that
"The Plaintiff's reticence in providing instructions to me caused undue delay
in the prosecution of the proceedings".
 Some time before 6 June 1994 Mr Mason
served on the Defendants a draft Amended Statement of Claim seeking to include
a claim for
nervous shock suffered by the Plaintiff and seeking consent to its'
filing.  A second copy seems to have been served in August 1994
and, despite a
reminder on 19 January 1995, no response other than a complaint that it had not
been filed seems to have been received.
 There was correspondence, including
complaints about delay, concerning the Part 33 Rule 8A particulars.  On 16 May
1996 Mr Mason
received a Notice of Motion filed by the Second Defendant seeking
orders that the Plaintiff file those particulars.  Mr Mason wrote
to the
Plaintiff on 21 May and 4 June seeking instructions.
<P>

6	The Plaintiff deposed that she has no recollection of receiving the letter of
4 June or of reading its contents.  She said:-
<P>

	"I am not sure whether I opened it.  Although I am told by my solicitors that
subsequent to that letter I telephoned Mr Mason shortly
thereafter and
instructed him to discontinue the proceedings. (sic) I do not have a clear
recollection of the conversations I had
with my solicitor, although I do have a
feeling that I did discuss with him the fact of the proceedings and expressed a
desire not
to be in court again.  I am really not sure."
<P>

7	The following communications between the Plaintiff's solicitors, Messrs
Phillips Fox and the solicitors for the Second Defendant
then occurred.  A
letter of 7 June 1996 written by Mr Mason referred to an application which had
been before the Court and adjourned
and continued:-
<P>

	"We would observe that it is our view that the Plaintiff would if she
proceeded recover substantial amounts in respect of general
damages for nervous
shock as well as economic loss arising out of the death of her husband... 
<P>

	The nervous shock issue in our view is quite significant and appears to have
deteriorated over the years...  Our client is considering
her position so far
as proceeding with the proceedings and without prejudice should she decide to
withdraw them, this would be on
the basis that there is some agreement by one
or both Respondents to pay her costs incurred and on each Defendant releasing
her from
any right of recovery in respect of moneys paid or received.
<P>

	In the alternative we suggest she should proceed.  We will write to you again
shortly when we have the benefit of instructions
and in the meantime we would
ask you to obtain some instructions on this proposition generally and perhaps
to discuss with the other
Defendant the question of recovery and whether they
would if there was any agreement on this point release our client from any
obligation
to reimburse moneys already received." 
<P>

8	On 19 June Phillips Fox wrote to Mr Mason.  So far as is relevant for present
purposes, the letter said:-
<P>

	"We are instructed, on a without prejudice basis, to offer a verdict in favour
of our client on the basis that our client pay its
own costs.  Our client is
not prepared to pay your client's costs.
<P>

	In our opinion, your client is unlikely to recover damages exceeding the
workers compensation amount of $167,000..."
<P>

9	Nothing on the topic of settlement seems to have occurred until 4 September
apart from conversations in which Mr Mason informed
Mr Glascott of Phillips Fox
that he was having difficulty obtaining instructions.  On 4 September there was
discussion between the
two.  Mr Glascott's file note of the conversation is in
these terms:-
<P>

	"- we can offer $5,000 costs (final offer).
<P>

	- Pl to discontinue.
<P>

	- he is concerned Vanderfords (w/comp insurer's sol.) will get $.
<P>

	- I don't think so - it's for costs, not damages.
<P>

	-  He'll contact client and get back to me."
<P>

10	Mr Glascott's recollection of the conversation, with which Mr Mason
concurred was:-
<P>

	Glascott:	"I can offer $5,000 by way of costs for your client to discontinue
the claim against our client.  It is a final offer.
<P>

	Mason:	Won't the workers compensation insurer be entitled to that amount?
<P>

	Glascott:	I don't think so, it's for your costs, not damages."
<P>

11	On the following day, there was a further conversation in which Mr Mason
said:-
<P>

	"I am prepared to accept $7,500 to our costs. (sic)"
<P>

12	On the following day Mr Mason wrote referring to his telephone discussions
with Mr Glascott and saying:-
<P>

	"We confirm that in relation to the offer of resolution of this matter by
payment of our costs, we have taken instructions from
our client and are
instructed to advise you that upon payment of our costs in the sum of $7,500.00
the proceedings will be discontinued.
 Should your client be in agreement, we
will take the necessary steps to discontinue this action."
<P>

13	On 11 September there was a further conversation between Mr Mason and Mr
Glascott and it is on this that the Second Defendant
relies in its claim that
there was an agreement to compromise.  Mr Glascott's note is in these
terms:-
<P>

	"5.00 p.m. att. Bill Mason (tel).
<P>

	- We offer $5,000 costs to 
<P>

	-                discontinue; 
<P>

	- He accepts.
<P>

	- I say don't think $5,000 costs creates liability in Pl. to 1st def (w/comp.
Insurer).
<P>

	- We to prepare Notice of Discontinuance/Terms of Settlement."
<P>

14	Mr Glascott's account of the conversation, with which there was no
disagreement and on which he was not challenged, was in similar
terms.
<P>

15	Nothing seems then to have happened until a letter of 17 October 1996 from
Mr Mason.  In it he wrote:-
<P>

	"We refer to previous correspondence and our telephone discussions with Simon
Glascott and agreement reached that this matter would
be settled on the basis
of your client paying the costs of this firm in the sum of $5,000.
<P>

	You will appreciate that Part 21 of the Rules allow discontinuance only by
consent of the Defendants with the leave of the Court.
 We envisage that it may
be necessary to move the Court as the First Defendant may not consent to the
withdrawal of the matter.
<P>

	There would also appear to be a difficulty in the Court giving leave on terms
in accordance with Part 21 Rule 4 in that a Plaintiff
cannot apply to
discontinue with an order for costs against the Defendant.
<P>

	We would therefore appreciate your advice as to this matter.  We will forward
a Notice of Discontinuance to the First Defendant
to see if they will consent
or whether an application for leave needs to be made."
<P>

16	On 14 November Mr Glascott responded:-
<P>

	"We refer to your letter of 17 October 1996.  We confirm settlement of your
client's claim on the basis that your client discontinue
the proceedings on the
basis that our client pays costs in the sum of $5,000.
<P>

	As you are aware, the First Defendant has advised that it does not consent to
the proceedings being discontinued.  That would not
disentitle our respective
clients finalising their differences as agreed. 
<P>

	We look forward to receipt of your application for discontinuance of your
client's claim." 
<P>

17	On 22 November there was a further conversation:-
<P>

	"<b>Mr Mason</b>:	I am concerned whether we can obtain leave ot discontinue if
Vandervords won't consent.  The court probably can't order costs in
our favour
if we are discontinuing.
<P>

	<b>Me</b>:		I don't think there is any problem for the court to allow costs to
your client if it is aware your client does not want to continue.
 The Court
can make any costs order it likes on a discontinuance especially if it is by
consent.  The Other Defendant can still run
its Cross Claim against us.
<P>

	<b>Mr Mason</b>:	Alright, I'll prepare the Notice of Motion."
<P>

18	It is unnecessary to detail the subsequent argumentative correspondence.
<P>

19	It would seem that during the time Mr Mason was negotiating with Mr
Glascott, there was no communication with the solicitors
for the First
Defendant.  On 17 October 1996 Mr Mason wrote to the solicitors for the First
Defendant.  In terms which were not calculated
to enhance his bargaining
position Mr Mason advised that "(the Plaintiff) has determined that she wishes
this matter to be discontinued"
and asked Vandervords to "seek instructions as
to whether you would be prepared to pay the balance of our costs in this matter
in
the further sum of $5,000 and consent to the discontinuance in order that
our client might put this matter behind her."  Vandervords
replied that their
client did not consent.  In the proceedings before me its counsel pointed out
that it had taken no part in the
negotiations and submitted that at best, so
far as the First Defendant is concerned, granting the Second Defendant's
application
should be on terms that all of the First Defendant's costs were
paid and, at worst, there would be no order as to the First Defendant's
costs.
As an exercise of discretion by the Court will or may be involved, it should be
recorded that the First Defendant limited
its submissions and did not argue
that the orders sought by the Second Defendant, having the effect that the
proceedings were discontinued
against both Defendants, should not be made.
<P>

20	I turn then to the situation of the Plaintiff herself.  She was examined in
August 1993 by a psychiatrist, Dr Shand.  In a report
in evidence before me Dr
Shand records a history that the Plaintiff:-
<P>

	"has pathological anxiety and issues the usual instructions and safety
precautions.  She gets shaky with panic and diarrhoea, e.g.
if her husband is
late home by half an hour.  When driving she has blank periods and can't recall
phases of a trip which make her
feel dangerous on the road.  To a question she
said that depression suddenly comes about every six months and lasting up to a
month.
 She wants to cry and gets bitchy and irritable.  She wants to do
nothing and sometimes gives up."
<P>

21	Dr Shand diagnosed the Plaintiff as:-
<P>

	"still suffering from a bereavement reaction with neurotic features.  She is
unable to let go of her dead husband and does not
want to.  In a somewhat
extraordinary fashion she has managed to combine this with a second
satisfactory marriage and she is trying
to get pregnant. ... Symptoms include
pathological anxiety with particular focus on her current husband and
intermittent depression
with tension and irritability.  She consults a
counsellor now and then but has no need of any other treatment.  Residual
disorder
is fairly mild and she is getting on with her life in a satisfactory
fashion.  In keeping with this she showed no signs of clinical
nervous disorder
at interview even if she was tearful on occasions about losing her husband.  I
would regard the symptoms she still
has as attributable to the death of her
first husband."
<P>

22	A letter from Phillips Fox of 6 June 1994 records that a copy of this report
had been served on that firm. 
<P>

23	The Plaintiff was also examined by Dr Westmore on 11 June 1988.  He prepared
a lengthy and then two supplementary reports and
was called before me.  His
evidence includes:-
<P>

	"Mrs Watson is suffering from a pathological grief reaction which is
characterised by a number of different features including
anxiety and
depression. ... I think her condition is such that she would have great
difficulty in providing you with instructions,
mainly because she is so
avoidant in terms of addressing communications from your office.
<P>

	Mrs Watson suffers pathological avoidance with regard to the issues relating
to the death of her first husband and the subsequent
legal matters.  She has
anxiety and depression when these issues are raised, this affects her capacity
to attend and concentrate,
to remember relevant details and subsequently to be
able to instruct her solicitors in and appropriate way. ... While there is no
indication that this woman cannot manage her affairs in a general sense, it is
my view that she cannot manage her affairs in relation
to the current
proceedings."
<P>

24	Dr Westmore's supplementary report of 7 July 1998 should be set out in
full:-
<P>

	"Following our further conversation on 7 July 1998, I note in your original
letter of referral, on page 3 at point 3, you asked
me my opinion as to whether
Mrs Watson had the capacity to provide instructions to settle the matter after
receipt of your letter
in June 1996.
<P>

	It is very difficult to make specific comments about a particular day or month
so long ago, however, it is my view that this woman
has suffered a pathological
grief reaction which commenced from the time of her husband's death and remains
in place today.
<P>

	She is not able at this time, in my view, to provide you with instructions due
to her psychiatric incapacity and on the balance
of probability she was not
able to provide you with instructions in June 1996.  It is most unlikely she
would have been any different
at that time than she is today, indeed, she is
likely to have been worse."
<P>

25	In oral evidence he said that the Plaintiff if provided with proper advice
was able to make a decision in the litigation but
"I think the concern
psychiatrically is whether ... the death of her first husband... influences in
an inappropriate way decisions
that she might make regarding a legal case
associated with the death of her first husband" and "I think she has a
pathological avoidance
of this issue and evidence in her lifestyle that she has
avoided dealing with the death of her first husband."
<P>

26	Asked to explain his use of the term "pathological", Dr Westmore said "I
mean not normal, not usual.  A better way is probably
not healthy.  I think the
history from her is that for example she still has her first husband's clothing
after some 10 years after
his death and that psychiatrically and
psychologically is fairly disturbing behaviour."  He said the Plaintiff was
dealing with the
death of her first husband in a pathological, unhealthy
abnormal way.  He said he had a concern "whether she can really, at the moment
as she is, apply her mind in a sensible way to the issues relating to the death
of her first husband" and "she might wish to prematurely
close her case and
that would be a classic behaviour associated with this condition, wanting to
get rid of it, lock it away, get
it out of her life, and not really deal with
the difficulty of the litigation, difficulty of having to deal with the memory
of her
husband, circumstances of his death, memory of her experience at and
around the time he died, because that's the way she is dealing
with it, she has
pushed it out of her level of consciousness and from a psychological
perspective one of the dangers is that she
will want to preclude,
inappropriately, prematurely, simply to get rid of pain or avoid dealing with
pain associated with the memory."
<P>

27	Except insofar as Dr Westmore's remarks seem to constitute an expression of
opinion on the Plaintiff's legal capacity - a matter
which involves legal tests
which I am not satisfied Dr Westmore correctly understands - I accept his
evidence.
<P>

28	The Plaintiff herself gave evidence.  There was no attempt to have her
repeat the history given to either of the psychiatrists
but in the
circumstances of the case, I draw no inference adverse to her from this.  In
light of Section 60 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, I am satisfied there is a sufficient
foundation for me to accept the conclusions drawn by those doctors.  Reference
may however
usefully be made to one passage in the Plaintiff's affidavit which
I am disposed to accept.  The Plaintiff said:- 
<P>

	"On the occasions that I had contact with my solicitor Mr Mason on the
telephone or if he would ring or leave a message for me
to call, it would cause
great emotional disturbance and bring back many memories and I would have great
difficulty in returning his
telephone calls and would sometimes take up to a
week to build up to telephoning my solicitor or would not telephone him.  If my
solicitor sent me a letter on many occasions I would not open the letter for
two or three days because of my distress, or sometimes
never open it.  On each
of these occasions I would become extremely emotional, have bouts of crying and
it would make it all as if
it was happening over and over again."
<P>

29	Giving evidence was obviously difficult for the Plaintiff.  I accept her
when she said that she "just wanted it all over and
done with" because it was
just too upsetting.  I understand the "it" to have been the litigation.  I
accept also that this was because
dealing with it brought back memories of when
her first husband was killed and that this used to make her sick, at times for
days.
 
<P>

30	I accept also her solicitor's evidence to the effect that he had
considerable difficulty in obtaining information or instructions
from the
Plaintiff.  I accept his evidence that in conversation on 7 June 1996 he
informed the Plaintiff that the Second Defendant
was asserting the Plaintiff
would not recover if she proceeded more than had been recovered in the
Compensation Court proceedings,
that his view she stood to recover
substantially more and would advise her to continue and that the Plaintiff said
to him she was
afraid of giving evidence again, she didn't know what to do but
knew she did not want to go back to court.  I also accept that he
raised the
possibility of the case being settled for a moderate amount representing costs
and on terms of receiving indemnities in
respect of payments previously
received.  He asked the Plaintiff whether she wished such a letter written and
was told "Yes, I'll
leave it to you."
<P>

31	Mr Mason's evidence that he told the Plaintiff that she would recover
substantially more is supported by a file note and, as
I have said, I accept
it.  It should be recorded however that on 21 May 1996 he had written to the
Plaintiff in terms:-
<P>

	"... on our instructions it would appear that there will be substantial
difficulty on quantum of damages and a likelihood the amount
recovered in
common law proceedings in the Supreme Court would be less than that obtained
before the Workers Compensation Court.
<P>

	... In those circumstances it must be now decided whether the proceedings
continue and perhaps the best method of resolution of
the matter would be to
put an offer of settlement to Amcor Limited solicitors Phillips Fox that the
matter be settled on the basis
of costs only thereby relieving any liability
you have to us in respect of costs and finalising the matter once and for
all."
<P>

32	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/index.html#p21" class="autolink_findacts">Part 21</a> of the Rules relevantly provides that a Plaintiff may discontinue
with the consent of all other parties or with the leave of the
court.  Between
June and 25 October 1996, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4</a> of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/index.html#p21" class="autolink_findacts">Part 21</a> which was repealed on 25 October
provided that the Court could give leave on terms.
<P>

33	The first question with which it is appropriate to deal is whether the
communications between the solicitors for the Plaintiff
and the First Defendant
were calculated to constitute a contract between those parties compromising the
dispute between them.
<P>

34	In my view they were.  Although in the letter of 7 June, Mr Mason indicated
clearly that any compromise he was contemplating
would involve all three
parties.  The subsequent correspondence and discussions between Mr Mason and
Phillips Fox are in terms indicative
of a two, and not three, party agreement.
The number of instances of this is sufficient to prevent one concluding that
these negotiations
were all under the aegis of the letter of 7 June and that
any agreement reached was conditional on the third party to the litigation
concurring.  In particular do the references to the possibility of any moneys
paid by Phillips Fox's client being payable by the
Plaintiff to the First
Defendant lead to this conclusion.  Whatever the First Defendant's rights in
this regard arising under the
terms of the Workers Compensation legislation,
those rights were, as is obvious to anyone practising in personal injury claims
in
this Court, susceptible of variation or defeat by a suitably arranged
settlement of the proceedings in this Court and the terms of
the conversations
of 4 and 11 September are only consistent with there being no agreement with
the First Defendant concerning the
matter.
<P>

35	It was urged on behalf of the Plaintiff that any agreement with the Second
Defendant was conditional upon the First Defendant
becoming a party to it or
the Plaintiff making some other arrangement with the First Defendant.  However,
in light of the terms of
the correspondence and discussions which I have set
out above, this argument is untenable.
<P>

36	Although the reference to indemnities in Mr Mason's remarks just prior to
the Plaintiff saying "Yes, I'll leave it to you" referred
to in paragraph 30
above make it doubtful whether he had the Plaintiff's actual authority to make
a two party agreement with the
Second Defendant, there can be no doubt that,
subject to any matters flowing from any incapacity the Plaintiff may have had,
he had
ostensible authority from the Plaintiff to effect the agreement he
did.
<P>

37	The test for capacity to contract is "the capacity to understand the nature
of the transaction when it is explained" - <b>Gibbons v Wright</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%2d1954%29%2091%20CLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953-1954)
91 CLR 423</a> at 438.  This seems to me to be an appropriate test by which to
judge the Plaintiff's capacity to instruct Mr Mason, at least so
far as
entering into the transaction in issue in these proceedings.  Notwithstanding
the evidence of Dr Westmore I remain unpersuaded
that the Plaintiff lacked that
capacity in 1996.  Indeed, I think the probabilities are that she had the
requisite capacity to understand.
<P>

38	In any event there is no evidence to suggest any incapacity which the
Plaintiff had to contract was known to Phillips Fox or
the Second Defendant.
Such knowledge is essential if the contract is to be regarded as unenforceable
under the general law - <b>Gibbons v Wright</b> (supra).
<P>

39	On behalf of the Plaintiff it was also submitted that if a contract did come
into existence it was unjust and should be set aside
pursuant to the terms of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act, 1980</a> (NSW).  It was submitted that I should conclude
that the Second Defendant was aware of the potential value of the claim and,
implicitly,
that it was worth considerably more than the Plaintiff received - a
factor regarded as important in, for example, <b>Baltic Shipping Company v
Dillon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 1.</a>  However there was no attempt made to have, as it
were, a preliminary run of the Compensation to Relatives claim nor to establish
by evidence that the Plaintiff is likely, or may well, recover more than would
be repayable to the First Defendant.  Nor is there
any evidence of what medical
or other information the Second Defendant or its solicitors had concerning the
Plaintiff's condition
beyond the report of Dr Shand.  The terms of that report
by no means make it certain that the Plaintiff would recover a substantial
verdict in the nervous shock claim she desired to pursue and thus I am not
prepared to conclude that the Second Defendant probably
believed that the
settlement arrived at was unduly favourable to it and unfavourable to the
Plaintiff.  In those circumstances, and
given the limits of the evidence which
was before me, it is unnecessary and I think not appropriate that I attempt to
value the Plaintiff's
claim.
<P>

40	In determining whether a contract is unjust, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act</a> requires the Court to have regard to all the circumstances of the
case and to a number of specific matters referred to in sub-section
9(2).
Among the circumstances which are relevant is the desirability of parties being
held to agreements into which they have voluntarily
entered.  Furthermore, the
compromise of litigation is something which the courts encourage and there are
significant disadvantages
not only for a party whose compromise may be set
aside but for the public if such compromises come to be treated as but
provisional.
 The continuation of litigation has disadvantages for all
litigants including the Plaintiff and the fact that the contract I have
held to
exist was entered into with the benefit of legal advice operates against any
suggestion that the contract was unjust.
<P>

41	Most of the matters to which sub-section 9(2) of Act requires that the court
have regard do not argue in favour of the Plaintiff's
claim under that Act.
However, two do.  In light of Dr Westmore's reports and evidence and my
assessment of the Plaintiff, I am satisfied
that notwithstanding the Plaintiff
was being advised by her solicitor, there was a material, and I would say
substantial, inequality
in bargaining power between the Plaintiff and the
Second Defendant.  On the same grounds I am also satisfied that the Plaintiff
was
not reasonably able to protect her own interests.
<P>

42	I would also conclude that the Second Defendant through Phillips Fox had
some notice of the first of these matters.  They had
notice of the matters
referred to in the report of Dr Shand, including the diagnosis of pathological
anxiety and neurotic features
although there is nothing in the report to
suggest that the Plaintiff suffered disability in her response to, or conduct
of, the
litigation.  The letter of 7 June from Mr Mason is not as clearly
expressed as it might have been but the statement that "the nervous
shock issue
... is quite significant and appears to have deteriorated" and was "very
evident" is a statement that the Plaintiff's
condition was worse.  When
attention is also had to Mr Mason's expressed view that the Plaintiff would, if
she proceeded, recover
substantial amounts and to the observation that
(nevertheless) the Plaintiff was considering withdrawing, in effect, with only
her
costs paid, it seems to me that the letter gave notice to the Second
Defendant that there was some weakness in the Plaintiff's bargaining
power (not
attributable to weakness in her case) and ability to protect her own
interests.
<P>

43	One factor that merits specific mention is the fact that the agreement
reached directed no attention to the position of the First
Defendant.  In light
of the terms of the letter of 7 June and, one may add, the logic of any desire
the Plaintiff may have had to
be out of the litigation, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that the making of an agreement with only the Second
Defendant
was a mistake.  It left the Plaintiff exposed either to continue the
action (which rather defeated the object of the negotiations)
or at the mercy
of the First Defendant or the Court so far as the First Defendant's costs were
concerned.  It is, I think, clearly
to be inferred that this was never intended
by the Plaintiff or her solicitor.
<P>

44	Although I suspect Mr Glascott must have been pleasantly surprised that Mr
Mason did not complicate the settlement discussions
by insisting on the
involvement of the First Defendant, on the question of whether the contract was
unjust, I am not disposed to
give the matter referred to in the preceding
paragraph any weight.
<P>

45	However the two matters to which I have referred earlier can not be so
regarded.  Their weight is such that in my view, notwithstanding
the factors
which argue to the contrary and, in particular, that there was no conduct on
the part of the First Defendant which can
be criticised, the contract of
compromise was unjust.  I am also of the view that, for the purpose of avoiding
as far as practical
an unjust result, I should make an order declaring the
contract void. 
<P>

46	In this regard, although I do not need to rely on the matter, it is also
appropriate to record that that, subject to one qualification,
setting aside
the contract but restores the parties to rights and obligations which they had
prior to the compromise being entered
into and which were laid down by law as
presumably a fair consequence of the death of the Plaintiff's husband and
subsequent events.
 The qualification is that since the compromise, any right
the Plaintiff had to pursue a claim for nervous shock has presumably become
barred by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> unless the Plaintiff succeeds in obtaining orders
from the Court which may avoid this result.  (The question of whether the
Plaintiff
should be allowed to amend her Statement of Claim was raised during
the hearing before me but stood over.)
<P>

47	As an alternative basis for the relief she sought, it was urged on the
Plaintiff's behalf that, quite independently of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a>, the
Court had a discretion whether to hold the Plaintiff to any contract of
compromise found.  Reliance was placed on the decision
of Finlay J in <b>Lewis
v Combell Constructions Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 528.</a>  Whether the Court's
discretion is as wide as some of the remarks in that case suggest is something
I do not need to decide.  In
<b>Harvey v Phillips</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2095%20CLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 95 CLR 235</a> at
242-3 it was said that "...where the assistance of the court is sought or
invoked to carry a compromise into effect which otherwise
could not be enforced
by the party relying on it ... the assistance may be refused on grounds not
necessarily sufficient to invalidate
a simple contract" and those words are
wide enough to allow the court to refuse the Second Defendant at least much of
the relief
it seeks here.  However, in light of the conclusion at which I have
arrived concerning the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a> it is unnecessary to pursue this
aspect further.
<P>

48	Although the Second Defendant has established the existence of the agreement
referred to in the first prayer of its Notice of
Motion, it follows from what I
have said that there is no utility in making a declaration to that effect.  The
appropriate orders
to be made on the Notices of Motion are:-
<P>

(a) 	Dismiss the Notice of Motion of the Second Defendant filed on
<P>

24 September 1998.
<P>

(b) 	Declare void the contract of compromise made between the Plaintiff and the
Second Defendant by their solicitors on or about
11 September 1996.
<P>

51	The question of costs was not argued.  The cause for the issues which have
arisen argues that the Plaintiff should pay at least
the Second Defendant's
costs.  On the other hand the ultimate decision was one the Second Defendant
fought and lost.  I will afford
the parties an opportunity to debate the
matter.
<P>

52	As indicated above, there remains for consideration the question of the
amendment which the Plaintiff seeks to make to the Statement
of Claim.  Having
regard to the history of the proceedings, they should not be allowed to resume
their leisurely pace.  I will hear
argument on the question of amendment in the
near future.
