Thursday 30 September 1999
<P>

<b><u>70076/98   -   REGINA    v    IRENA HATFIELD</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT - On application for a permanent stay of proceedings</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b>   Irena Hatfield (the accused) has
been committed for trial on a charge of murder.  The victim was her husband
Christopher who died
of gunshot wounds received on the night of 19-20 April
1985.  An inquest into his death was held at Glebe Coroner's Court on 17 June
1986.  The charge against the accused was preferred on 13 June 1997.  
<P>

2   	The accused seeks an order for permanent stay of
proceedings.  In March 1999, 8th November next was scheduled as the commencing
date of the trial and I was allocated as trial judge.  Mr Barker QC who
appeared with Mr Stanton for the accused and Mr Ellis for
the Crown indicated
at the beginning of this application that they were agreed that that hearing
date should be vacated.  I declined
to make any order to that effect and
indicated that the question of it should await the outcome of the present
matter.  I record
that I deal exclusively with the application and I am not as
trial judge, making pre trial rulings.
<P>

3   	To give context to the application, some circumstances and
anticipated ingredients of the Crown case need to be sketched.
<P>

4   	Shortly after midnight on 19-20 April the accused
telephoned police and reported that she had just tried to awaken her husband
whom she then observed had been shot.  She thought he was dead.  Police and
ambulance were despatched to the matrimonial home at
47 Chester Avenue,
Maroubra.  Inspection revealed the body lying on a lounge covered by a blanket
to the chest.  A small hole was
visible in the blanket surrounded by apparent
bloodstains.  Three wounds were visible on the head of the deceased. 
<P>

5   	Investigation demonstrated that the deceased had been shot
with .22 calibre ammunition.  One projectile had entered the chest
area.
Wounds had been sustained to the head.  Later weighing of fragments led to an
estimate that four projectiles had entered the
head even though observations
had noted three wounds.  Four cartridge cases were located in the lounge room.
No weapon was found
in the vicinity.  In due course police took possession of
the clothing of the deceased and also that worn by the accused at the time
of
their arrival.
<P>

6   	On the morning of 20 April 1985 a recreational diver
entered the water near a boat ramp at Long Bay.  He noticed a rifle floating
stock upwards and a metal object later found to be a silencer lying on the
seabed nearby.  He attended to his own business of collecting
fish for a couple
of hours and then retrieved the rifle and silencer which he delivered to
Maroubra Police.  Later police divers
searched the area and a magazine was
recovered.  The rifle was a .22 calibre Brno brand weapon.  It required a bolt
for operation
but none was located.  At the hearing of this application the
Crown accepted that it cannot prove that the Brno rifle was the weapon
used to
kill Christoper Hatfield.  At the highest, it can adduce evidence that
examination of material recovered at the scene and
at post mortem had been
subjected to comparison and nothing was found which was inconsistent with the
Brno rifle having being the
murder weapon.
<P>

7   	Items submitted by police for examination included a glass
found in the lounge room and the accused's dressing gown.  A forensic
biologist
(Ms Clancy) certified that human blood was detected on the glass and that
presumptive tests for blood on undefined areas
of the dressing gown had given a
positive result.
<P>

8   	In a statement dated 19 December 1997 Det Senior Constable
Allison asserted:
<P>

"3.	A number of inquiries have been made in an effort to locate the following
exhibits:
<P>

(a)	Brno brand .22 calibre firearm, silencer and magazine.
<P>

(c)	Clothing worn by the accused.
<P>

(d)	Clothing worn by the deceased.
<P>

	4.	None of these exhibits have been found and I am unaware of their present
location.
<P>

	5.	I spoke to a number of Police Officers who were involved in the original
investigation.  They could not assist in anyway whatsoever
regarding those
exhibit's whereabouts. 
<P>

	6.	The rifle, silencer, magazine and white T-shirt (worn by the deceased) were
tendered at the Coronial Inquest into Christopher
HATFIELD's death conducted at
Glebe Coroners Court on 17 June, 1986.
<P>

	7.	I am aware that clothing worn by the accused was conveyed to the Division
of Forensic Medicine Glebe by Constable L. BRIDGE
on 24 May 1985."
<P>

The statement contains no paragraph numbered 3(b).
<P>

9   	I understand it to be common ground that the glass examined
by Ms Clancy is also missing but that the magazine retrieved from
the sea has
been located.  It has been kept with projectile fragments and cartridge cases
which remain available.  The holed woollen
blanket which had partly covered the
deceased should also be included in the schedule of missing items. 
<P>

10   	Some cards recording movements of police exhibits were
produced at the committal hearing.  They were retrieved from the Ballistics
Unit.  One of them (which is undated) appears to show relevant items of
clothing and the rifle being received by a Detective Long
from Detective
Ransome.  Detective Ransome is a ballistics officer and currently remains a
member of the Police Service.  Detective
Long is no longer in that service.
Detective Ransome testified at committal that the last record he believed he
had would relate
to producing the items to the Coroner.  He acknowledged that
the usual practice was for the Coroner's exhibits to be returned to
the officer
in charge of the investigation and that in this case it would be either
Detective Long or Detective Ralston.  He had
not spoken to Detective Ralston
about the matter. 
<P>

11   	The accused was interviewed by police in 1985 and (as she
continued to do in later interviews) asserted her innocence.  The
arrest in
1997 followed renewed inquiries provoked by reports to police by one Atticus
Busby that in conversation with her she had
allegedly confessed her guilt.
Certain material was gathered by the use of listening devices.  At times there
was a relationship
between the accused and Mr Busby.  Whilst they have since
expressed different perceptions of the nature of that relationship it did
involve sexual intimacy.  At the committal hearing there was also called a
witness named Lourdes Pereira.  She and the accused had
encountered each other
in 1991 or 1992 at Elcho Island in the Northern Territory.  Ms Pereira was
secretary of the Galiwinku Aboriginal
Council and the accused was engaged in
setting up and running an art centre.  Ms Pereira gave evidence of an alleged
confession to
her by the accused.  
<P>

12   	Mr Barker expressly acknowledged that it was not being
asserted that there was no prima facie case.  He submitted that the
strength
and weaknesses of the prosecution case were immaterial for the purposes of the
application for a stay unless I took a view
that there was so overwhelmingly
strong a prosecution case that nothing the defence could do could possibly be
effective.  I do not
take such a view.
<P>

13   	The essence of Mr Barker's submission was that a fair
trial cannot be had because the accused has been denied a real chance
of
establishing her innocence by reason of the loss of physical exhibits and some
records of counselling sessions involving Mr Busby
to which I will make later
reference. 
<P>

14   	In support of the application the accused relied upon
affidavits exhibiting reports from Mr Barber, a forensic ballistics
examiner;
Dr Ellis a pathologist; Mr Ross, a forensic scientist with special expertise in
gunshot residue detection and an affidavit
by her solicitor exhibiting the
police brief served at the committal proceedings and certain transcript of
those proceedings including
transcript of evidence concerning the non
production of the counselling records.  
<P>

15   	Substantial parts of the expert reports relate to theories
pertinent to the discharge of a firearm.  As I have said, the Crown
is not in a
position to allege that the Brno rifle was the murder weapon although I do not
overlook Mr Barker's contention that its
absence prevents it being proved that
it was not.  The prosecution case (so far as material presently before me
shows) is centrally
dependent upon the alleged confessions.  The defence is not
obliged to determine or disclose at this stage whether evidence about
the
finding of the Brno rifle is objected to or whether it is desired to have it
admitted.  It is conceivable that the defence may
wish to demonstrate handicaps
arising from its loss along the lines discussed by the experts in their
respective reports.  It lies
within the power of a trial judge to maintain
fairness at trial not only by directions to the jury but by exclusion of
evidence sought
to be tendered by the Crown.  
<P>

16   	It should be mentioned that there is inconsistency between
witnesses concerning some observations at the scene.  Dr Kariks
who performed
the post mortem noted that "the bullet wounds in the right fronto-temporal area
were surrounded by gun powder spray
measuring 5.5cm x 4 cm in area".  Detective
Ransome said he saw no such gun powder spray.  That contradiction would not be
removed
by the presence of the missing exhibits.  Detective Ransome did claim
to see marks which could have been gun shot residue on the
blanket.  It is now
missing but it was not, as I understand it, subjected to appropriate tests then
nor, of course, can it now be
so subjected. 
<P>

17   	It is also the case that the clothing of the accused was
neither tested for gunshot residue at the time nor can it be now.

<P>

18   	The absence of fairness in these regards is said to be
perceived in the prevention of the accused from proving that the killer
must
have fired the weapon from close range (or contact) and that predictably
gunshot residue and/or blood spray would have been
deposited on the person of
the killer and his or her clothes.  Providing the clothing had been
appropriately packaged and stored
there should be, according to Mr Ross little
disturbance of gunshot residue or blood.  The accused is therefore prevented
from positively
proving that there was none on her clothing.  
<P>

19   	I comment in passing that, given the production at the
inquest where the items were last reported it would seem unlikely that
Mr
Ross's pre-condition of appropriate packaging and storage would be met in any
event.  The complaint is that there is no positive
proof of the absence of
gunshot residue or blood spray. There is in fact no suggestion in the Crown
case to the contrary.
<P>

20   	The absence of ability to offer positive proof is said to
work unfairness against the accused in a particular respect because
she must
face opinion evidence from Detective Ransome based upon proximity tests done
with the Brno rifle and a "foreign" bolt that
the muzzle must have been in
excess of three, or two to three feet away from the point of contact of the
projectile with the body.
 Again if it be demonstrated that the admission of
such evidence from Detective Ransome was unfairly prejudicial there is
jurisdiction
to cure the matter.
<P>

21   	Support for the proposition that the accused could
positively prove her innocence was sought to be drawn from the opinion
of Mr
Barber but in my view the submission seeks to attribute to the potential
scientific evidence a capacity which it does not possess.
 The presence of the
physical exhibits may have enabled demonstration but only in the negative sense
that the accused cannot be shown
to have used the Brno rifle and that there was
no evidence of a scientific nature that she discharged that or any other weapon
at
the relevant time.  Mr Barber's own outline recognizes that this cannot be
conclusive.
<P>

22   	It suffices to observe the considerable qualifications
which he stated:
<P>

"It is acknowledged that blood groups and DNA in blood will deteriorate with
time, however, visual detection of blood on cloth will
still be possible.
<P>

<b>Gunshot Residues</b>
<P>

Gunshot residues, on the other hand do not have the adhesive properties of
(wet) blood.  Thus, gunshot residue particles which deposit
on clothing as a
result of the discharge of a firearm will move and/or be dislodged from their
original location as a result of activity
and time after shooting.  Testing of
garments to establish how long gunshot residues persist on clothing has
indicated that, in general,
it may be found on the clothing of someone who has
fired a gun as much as eight hours after shooting.  These findings are subject
to many variables, in particular to the nature of the activity after
shooting.
<P>

&#183;	washing the clothing will probably remove all trace of gunshot residues;
whilst
<P>

&#183;	removing the clothing soon after shooting and leaving it on the floor is
likely to preserve gunshot residues on the clothing.
<P>

Occasionally, gunshot residues are preserved on a garment through adhesion to
blood which has been deposited on the clothing.
<P>

Although the detection of gunshot residues on a garment indicates that the
wearer may have discharged a firearm (or had in some
way come into contact with
a firearm or other gunshot residue contaminated object) a nil finding does not
exclude the wearer from
having fired a gun.  A nil finding will result
where:
<P>

&#183;	the person did not discharge the firearm or was not near a firearm when
it was discharged;
<P>

&#183;	gunshot residues were on the garment but have not been detected;
<P>

&#183;	gunshot residues were on the garment immediately after the shooting but
have been lost in the time between discharge and
sampling; and
<P>

&#183;	the firearm ejected the residues in such a way that none deposited on
the clothing of the shooter."
<P>

23   	I did not understand it to be alleged that the loss of a
blood stained glass from the room where the shooting took place presented
the
accused with any particular obstacle but the circumstance was raised as part of
the general complaint that the accused was unable
to survey the prosecution
case as a properly complete entity.
<P>

24   	The statement by Ms Clancy that the garment tested
presumptively for blood is not relied upon by the accused as potentially
inhibitive of proof of her innocence.  Insofar as evidence along the lines of
her statement would be unfairly prejudicial I repeat
that appropriate remedy
lies within the jurisdiction of a trial judge.
<P>

25   	The other category of missing evidence related to records
of consultation by Atticus Busby with a counsellor at the Southern
Cross
University where Mr Busby was enrolled. He gave evidence that he first
consulted this counsellor (Shumyam Peinecke) on the
day after the accused
allegedly told him about the murder.  He was asked at the committal proceedings
whether he commenced counselling
at the suggestion of the accused and said "it
was a mixture of things.  I commenced counselling because of what Irena had
told me.
 She had been suggesting counselling for some time." 
<P>

26   	There is detail of how the records of such counselling
sessions were supposed to be kept in the copy affidavit of Annie Burrett
(Exhibit A).  What are missing are the notes relating to the first thirteen of
a longer series of consultations with Mr Busby.  Mr
Peinecke has no explanation
for the absence of these records other than suggesting that he might
inadvertently have included them
with other material which was destined for
destruction.  Mr Peinecke was called in relation to the non compliance with a
subpoena
to produce this material.  He testified that he engaged in something
in the order of one thousand consultations a year with students
and that he had
no independent recollection of the content of the discussions with Mr Busby
pertaining to which the notes were missing.
 Mr Busby acknowledged that he had
written a letter seeking that the subpoena to produce those records be
challenged and he admitted
that he opposed the production of them.  This has
apparently heightened the suspicions of the accused and her representatives
concerning
what the records might reveal.
<P>

27   	It was submitted that it was obvious that what Mr Busby
said (to Mr Peinecke) may bear directly upon his real view of  conversations
with the accused (assuming it is different from his testimony); whether he is
confused as to occasion and whether he has now attributed
significance to
anything the accused has said which he did not previously.  Of course it can be
guessed that such matters may have
been discussed but I do not agree that it is
obvious that they were.  
<P>

28   	It was claimed that the defence cannot "test the issue".
Even if the records were available the Crown would not be expected
to seek to
call Mr Peinecke in the trial to say what Mr Busby told him.  Mr Busby is an
essential Crown witness and what is desired
in truth is the opportunity to
inspect records (and provoke a revival of memory on the part of Mr Peinecke)
for the purpose of cross
examination (and, if necessary, contradiction) of Mr
Busby directed to the credibility of his allegation that the accused had
confessed
to him or had seriously confessed to him.  I am unpersuaded that the
absence of these records which may or may not provide a resource
for challenge
to Mr Busby has the effect of making if unfair that the accused should stand
trial at all.
<P>

29   	There was no debate about the applicable law and Mr Barker
accepted that it was necessary that it be demonstrated on the part
of the
accused that this was an exceptional case.  There is ample authority:
<b>Barton v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1980%20147%20CLR%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1980 147 CLR 75</a>; <b>Jago v District Court of New
South Wales</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1989%20168%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1989 168 CLR 23</a>; <b>R v Glennon</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1992%20173%20CLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1992 173 CLR 592.</a> 
<P>

30   	It has been said that the power to order a permanent stay
should be exercised sparingly and that the circumstances will usually
have to
be extreme for relief to be given.  In <b>R v Tolmie </b>unreported CCA 7
December 1994 Hunt CJ at CL said:
<P>

"... to justify such a stay, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to
the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing
which the trial judge could
do in the conduct of the trial could relieve the applicant against its unfair
consequences."
<P>

31   	"What a judge can do" is not limited to jury direction but
includes the exercise of discretion to exclude evidence. See now
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s137</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  
<P>

32   	Counsel drew attention to cl 7 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms namely:
<P>

"7.	Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the
right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance
with the principles of
fundamental justice."
<P>

33   	I agree with the contention that the rights of a citizen
protected by the common law are no less than those proclaimed in
that clause,
however this exotic reference was given to found an invitation to consider two
decisions of the Canadian Supreme Court
relating to the Charter right and
missing prosecution evidence: one case where a tape was simply lost: <b>R v
La</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20SCR%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 SCR 680</a>; the other, where material had been deliberately
destroyed by a third party:  <b>R v Carosella</b>  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1997/1997scr1-80/1997scr1-80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 1 SCR 80.</a>  In
<b>La</b> the majority held that what was expressed as a duty to disclose
(which seems to comprehend production as well as revelation) was
not breached
if there was a reasonable explanation by the prosecution for the loss.  By
analogy Mr Barker has argued that there is
no reasonable explanation in the
present case, it being no more than mere assertion that the material last seen
at the inquest cannot
be located and that the counselling records must have
been misfiled and/or possibly destroyed. In <b>La</b> the majority stated:
<P>

"Here, the Crown's explanation was satisfactory.  The tape recording was not
made in the course of the criminal investigation and
the police officer did not
fail to take reasonable steps to preserve the tape.
<P>

No abuse of process occurred.  Conduct amounting to abuse of process includes
the deliberate destruction of material by the police
or other officers of the
Crown for the purpose of defeating the Crown's obligation to disclose and, even
absent proof of improper
motive, an unacceptable degree of negligent
conduct."
<P>

34   	In that case, so far as I can deduce from the published
judgments, the explanation did not establish how the particular tape
came to be
missing although a system obviously failed and one could readily postulate that
the officer who lost the tape was negligent.
 That would not seem to have
elevated the negligence into the "unacceptable" category.  In my view the same
can be said here.  In
respect of both the physical evidence items and the
counselling records, it could be readily postulated that the respective keepers
did not meet the standards requisite for a person exercising due care in
discharging a responsibility but there is no aspect that
I would assess as
elevating the circumstances into the range of unacceptable negligence.
<P>

35   	The information concerning the missing physical items was
for present purposes derived from the statements in the police brief.
 No
objection was taken to this nor was there complaint that the prosecution was
deliberately delaying cross examination of, for
example, Detective Allison.  Mr
Barker did submit that, although he said in written submission that they were
lost, it was "putting
the case too favourably for the Crown.  The police say
they cannot produce them.  How this has come about, we don't know because
nobody has offered an explanation."  He adverted to the signature receipt by
former Detective Long and the absence of any statement
from Detective Ralston.
The concept of loss frequently inheres the absence of knowledge of precisely
what has happened.  If such
knowledge were possessed materials could, unless
destroyed , probably be retrieved.  The statement of Detective Allison shows
the
negative result of his inquiries and I do not think that I should apply a
presumption of mala fides in the circumstances.  If it
is being speculated that
there may have been some sinister reason for the absence of the police exhibits
then the matter can be tested
at trial, if necessary on voir dire or
<b>Basha</b> inquiry.  The evidence does not persuade me that the loss of the
physical exhibits was other than accidental and, although I infer
that this was
the result of neglect, I do not assess the occurrence as manifesting such a
degree of negligence that trial should
be prevented as inevitably unfair.   
<P>

36   	<b>Carosella </b>was a case where a sexual assault crisis
centre followed a policy of deliberately shredding files with police
involvement before being
served (with order for production) in criminal
proceedings.  However the majority noted that:
<P>

"There was abundant evidence before the trial judge to enable him to conclude
that there was a reasonable possibility that the information
contained in the
notes that were destroyed was logically probative to an issue at the trial as
to the credibility of the complainant."
<P>

37   	I perceive no such abundant evidence of likely probative
material in the present case.  Even assuming that the trigger for
Mr Busby's
attendance was shock at the alleged revelation of murder it is entirely
speculative whether the counsellor was told any
detail which might be probative
in the sense that it would touch upon Mr Busby's evidence or its credibility.
I note some general
observations in the minority judgment in that case - which
I do not perceive to be different from the view in principle of the majority
although in the application of principle the court divided five to four.  The
minority judgment contained:
<P>

"While the production of every relevant piece of evidence might be an ideal
goal from the accused's point of view, it is inaccurate
to elevate this
objective to a right, the non-performance of which leads instantaneously to an
unfair trial.  Where evidence is unavailable,
the accused must demonstrate that
a fair trial, and not a perfect one, cannot be had as a result of the loss.  He
must establish
a real likelihood of prejudice to his defence;  it is not enough
to speculate that there is the potential for harm.  Materials can
be easily
lost and setting too low a threshold for finding a breach of the right to full
answer and defence would bring the justice
system to a halt.  While it is true
that, with regard to certain rights, a court can infer the necessary degree of
prejudice, this
is not uniformly so." 
<P>

The "necessary degree of prejudice" is incapacity for a fair trial to be
held.
<P>

38   	It is not without interest that those remarks have the
colour of those of Gleeson CJ in <b>R v McCarthy</b> unreported CCA 12 August
1994:
<P>

"Time and time again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a
variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as
important by one side or
the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents.  If the
result of that were that
nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings
had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the
problems
of delay in the criminal lists in this State.  However, the position
is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind
does not of
itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need
to be stayed."
<P>

39   	I should record that counsel also relied upon approach and
application to the question of staying proceedings manifest in
a series of
cases at first instance in South Australia: <b>Crawford v Bitar</b> 7 August
1987; <b>Duncombe-Wall v Police</b> 2 July 1998; <b>Commonwealth Service
Delivery Agency v Bourke</b> 16 April 1999. 
<P>

40   	Mention was made of the evidence concerning the movement
of the body and the absence of precise observations by crime scene
specialists
concerning matters such as the pattern of spent shell ejection and the
directions in which they lay.  If these be deficiencies
they are not situations
which could ever be altered and it remains speculative whether such knowledge
would be probative of anything.
<P>

41   	In summary the following observations can be made.  The
clothing of the deceased (including his blanket) and the clothing
of the
accused might demonstrate that although muzzle and target were close at the
time of discharge and therefore gunshot residue
would be expected on the person
and clothes of the firer, scientific testing demonstrated no such residue on
the clothing of the
accused.  Testing is not conclusive and it is not part of
the Crown case that there was such residue.  The Brno rifle offers something
of
a distraction.  I recognize the importance to investigators of the
circumstances and time of its finding but, in the event it
cannot be proved
that it was the murder weapon.  It is complained that the accused cannot prove
that it was not the murder weapon.
 If she did, the consequence would be
rejection of evidence concerning it.  The identical consequence is within the
jurisdiction
of a trial judge to grant.
<P>

42   	The presumptive test result on the nightgown is, I
suggest, highly vulnerable to rejection if objection is taken.  The potential
probative value of the bloodstained glass is obscure.
<P>

43   	It is not necessary to recapitulate my view about the
missing counselling records.
<P>

44   	It should be remarked that the jurisdiction to stay must
necessarily be exercised with foresight and it is requisite to foresee
that a
fair trial cannot be had.  This is quite different from appellate review where
assessment is made whether anything has happened
to render a trial that has
taken place unfair.  The protections inherent in the latter process are not
lost and remain constant.
<P>

45   	It is self evidently a matter for regret that the physical
exhibits and the records are not available and nothing I have said
should be
taken as treating the matter as insignificant.  I am, however, unpersuaded to
the conclusion that the circumstances, singly
or in combination, are such that
it can be determined that a fair trial cannot be had.
<P>

46   	The application for permanent stay of proceedings is
refused.
