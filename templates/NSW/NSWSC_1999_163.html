<b>JUDGMENT (Plaintiff's application to be informed of defendant's
subpoenas)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   A curious matter has arisen in relation to subpoenas. There is
no secret that leave was granted by me to the defendant
to issue a subpoena and
serve it upon the New South Wales Police Service. 
<P>

2	It has been my understanding in fact that in the conduct of litigation there
is no right in one party to know the identity of
recipients of subpoenas issued
by the other. I myself have no practical acquaintance nor any recollection of
having acquaintance
with what I will call Registry practice in relation to the
filing and issuing of subpoenas. 
<P>

3	Insofar as a request has been made by the plaintiff that the defendant
disclose to the plaintiff not only the identity of the
recipient of the
subpoena but also the schedule to the subpoena, I decline to do so until I am
persuaded that either as a matter
of law or as a matter of practice there is an
entitlement in the plaintiff (and of course in the defendant vis-a-vis the
plaintiff),
to that information.
<P>

4	I appreciate that a situation can arise where compliance with a subpoena by a
stranger to the litigation may provoke some application
by a party based upon
perceived rights flowing from access granted by the Court to the material
produced. I appreciate that one way
to obviate that procedural difficulty would
be the disclosure of the schedule to a subpoena issued by the other side. But
on the
basis of my experience and in the absence of any principle or authority
or rule to which my attention has been directed, I decline
to give the
direction at this stage.
<P>

5	There may be areas of Registry practice governed by particular rules, or
indeed regulations that relate to inspection of the Court
file; clearly there
are, because the parties prima facie have a right to inspect the Court file.
Whether the parties have the right
to inspect anything else in the Court
Registry or office in connection with the file I do not know.
<P>

6	As I understand it, it is the practice of the Court to keep together
documents produced on subpoena. Whether a facility is available
to the legal
representatives of the parties to ascertain any information in regard to
documents delivered to the Court in answer
to subpoenas will be a matter for
the parties to explore.
