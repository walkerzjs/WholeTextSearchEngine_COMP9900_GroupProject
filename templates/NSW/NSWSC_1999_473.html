COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 21 MAY 1999
<P>

<u>12827/1998</u>	<u>THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF WOLLONGONG v DENNIS
SMITH</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	The defendant is a consulting surveyor and a member of the Institute of
Surveyors New South Wales (Incorporated).  Spaceline Engineering
Pty Ltd (the
client) was his client in relation to Development Applications made to the
plaintiff.  The Development Applications
were made in the name of the
defendant.  The applications were approved subject to the imposition of a
condition.  The condition
was unacceptable and it was decided to appeal to the
Land and Environment Court.  The defendant was instructed to act as
applicant/agent
in the making of the applications to that Court.
<P>

2	The applications were made by the defendant as applicant.  The appeal was
successful.
<P>

3	The practice of that Court in relation to such applications is for each party
to pay its own costs.  Costs are awarded only in
exceptional circumstances.  An
application was made by the applicant for costs on the basis that exceptional
circumstances existed
in this case.  The Court found that the Council had acted
so as to impose an ad hoc condition, an opportunistic condition and an
inconsistent condition and that those findings constituted exceptional
circumstances.  An order was made that the respondent (the
plaintiff) pay the
costs of the applicant.  The effect of this order was that costs were payable
on a party and party basis.
<P>

4	The defendant prepared Bills of Costs which claimed inter alia fees
(calculated at an hourly rate) charged to the client in respect
of the
defendant's conduct of the application before the Land and Environment Court.
Fees for work done on behalf of the client fall
within items 1 to 105 of the
bill.  Items 106 and 107 related to disbursements (filing fees and
miscellaneous). Item 108 relates
to a disbursement for the preparation of the
Bill of Costs.  ($1055.87).
<P>

5	The defendant applied to this Court for an assessment of those costs.  This
was an application for assessment of party/party costs
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s202.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 202</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).    I should observe at this stage
that this assessment process has application only to costs payable in respect
of legal
services (which means work done or business transacted in the capacity
of a barrister or solicitor).  The application was referred
to a  Costs
Assessor (Mr Fitzsimons ).  He received a notice of objections and responses
from the parties.  On 29 September 1998,
he issued a Certificate as to
Determination of Costs.  The application determined the amount of costs to be
paid by the plaintiff
as being in the sum of $11,183.48.
<P>

6	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 26 October 1998.  The
Summons brings an appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> of the Act.
<P>

7	The hearing took place on 14 May 1999.  The plaintiff was represented by
counsel.  The defendant appeared in person.
<P>

8	The Court had before it an affidavit sworn by the defendant and inter alia
material placed before the Costs Assessor (including
the Bill of Costs).
<P>

9	The plaintiff does not dispute that the defendant is entitled to recover the
disbursements claimed in items 106 and 107 (the total
of these two items is
$995).  It contends that there was error in law on the part of the Costs
Assessor in allowing items 1 - 105
and 108.
<P>

10	In opposing the appeal, the defendant stresses that his role was that of
agent acting on behalf of a client.  The Land and Environment
Court does allow
parties to be represented by an agent.  Unfortunately for the defendant and his
client, because of the manner in
which the proceedings were constituted, he
could not be said to be an agent representing a party.  As I have said, the
application
for development consent was made in his name.  He was the applicant
in the Land and Environment Court proceedings.  The client was
not a party.
The order for costs was made in favour of the applicant (the defendant) and not
the client.
<P>

11	The case for the plaintiff is a simple one.  Unfortunately for the defendant
and his client, the principal thrust of the appeal
is also irrefutable.  The
Court has no option but to grant relief to the plaintiff.  The Court has great
sympathy for the plight
of the defendant and his client.  The order for costs
had been made in the light of the findings of exceptional circumstances (the
plaintiff had inter alia sought to impose an "opportunistic" condition).  The
applicant had been forced to bring an appeal to the
Land and Environment Court
and the client incurred his professional costs in the conduct of that appeal.
It could be expected that
the intended object of the costs order was to provide
compensation for that expense.  At the time, minds may not have been directed
to the potential problems and the object has largely failed.  The result may
have been different (at least to some extent) if the
client had been a party to
the proceedings (certain additional disbursements may have been
recoverable).
<P>

12	It was common ground that the defendant did not have the qualifications to
provide legal services.  He was providing services
as a surveyor.  In becoming
the party to the proceedings he placed himself in the position of a litigant in
person.  This Court is
bound by <u>Cachia v Hanes &amp; Anor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR
403</a> at 409-413.  As the law presently stands, a litigant who is not a lawyer
cannot recover compensation for time spent in the preparing
and conducting of
his case.  Costs are confined to money paid or liabilities incurred for
professional legal services.  (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a>).  The
litigant in person is entitled to be reimbursed only for costs paid out of his
pocket.  Costs recoverable under the order
for party and party costs do not
include profit costs incurred for the providing of professional services by a
surveyor.  This means
that most, if not all, of the costs claimed in the bill
are not recoverable under the order.  The Court was not taken to the detail
of
the items claimed and it may be possible that at least some areas could give
rise to a claim in the nature of a disbursement.
<P>

13	I should add that in fact the defendant was not seeking to recover costs in
respect of which he had a liability but the costs
incurred by the client.
However, I put this consideration aside as it was not canvassed before me (and
may not have been canvassed
in the submissions and objections with the Costs
Assessor).
<P>

14	The plaintiff says that item 108 was unnecessary.  This item was the subject
of limited argument.  At the very least, the quantum
of the item cannot be
sustained. Perhaps, there remains a possibility of some entitlement to a part
of the amount claimed.
<P>

15	The plaintiff did rely on an alternative ground of appeal that there was a
breach of section 48E of the Act.  This provision
prohibits the doing of any
general legal work for a fee unless the person is a barrister or solicitor.
The ground was not fully argued
and it is not necessary to give it further
consideration in this case.
<P>

16	In the circumstances, the Court is unable to affirm the Costs Assessor's
decision.  The Certificate as to Determination is set
aside.  Unless the
parties can reach agreement, the application is remitted back to the Costs
Assessor for re-determination.
<P>

17	Finally, I turn to the remaining question of the costs of these proceedings.
Costs are in the discretion of the Court.  However,
the rules provide that
costs should follow the event, except where it appears that some other order
should be made <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">(rule 11).</a>  This is a case in which the Court has great sympathy
for the plight of the defendant and his client.  However, in the circumstances
of this case, I do not feel that the interests of justice would be best served
if the Court was to make some other order.  The plaintiff
has been
substantially successful in the appeal.  Accordingly, the defendant is to pay
the costs of the Summons.
