AUSTIN J
<P>

MONDAY 22 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>4217/99 - RE SUMMIT DESIGN &amp; CONSTRUCTION PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore;  revised on 23 November 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This matter began with the filing of a summons and
notice of motion on 6 October 1999.  The summons seeks an order
for the winding
up of Summit Design &amp; Construction Pty Limited, and the appointment of a
liquidator of the company, and the notice
of motion sought the appointment of a
provisional liquidator.  A provisional liquidator was duly appointed on that
day.
<P>

2  	By notice of motion filed on 9 November 1999 Wagstaff Piling Pty
Limited seeks an order granting leave to it to commence proceedings
against the
company under s 471B of the Corporations Law.  This is the application before
the Court today.
<P>

3  	The provisional liquidator of the company has appeared at today's
hearing in order to make submissions to assist the Court to
deal with the
application.  In effect, the provisional liquidator has drawn the Court's
attention to matters which imply that the
application should be denied.
<P>

4  	The applicant is a manufacturer and supplier of piles used in
construction.  It is a subcontractor to the company. The company
was appointed
by another company called Sydney Park Development Pty Limited (the developer)
to carry out building work on a development
project in Alexandria, Sydney. The
company defaulted in the payment of three invoices for work carried out by the
applicant on this
project.  The first invoice, which the applicant rendered to
the company on 31 July 1999, was in the sum of $249,469.  The second
invoice,
rendered on 31 August 1999, was for an additional $110,574.  The third invoice,
rendered 30 September 1999, was for an additional
$192,146.  The company made
claims on the developer in respect of these amounts, but has not paid the
applicant.
<P>

5  	The developer has paid the company with respect to the matters
covered by the first two invoices.  The applicant concedes that
in respect of
its claims against the company for those amounts it is an unsecured creditor
not entitled to any particular priority.
 However, the developer has not yet
paid the company with respect to the amount claimed in the third invoice, in
the sum of $192,146.
 The applicant seeks leave under s 471B to bring
proceedings against the company for recovery of this amount.
<P>

6  	There is evidence before me of the financial state of the
company.  It appears that the assets and undertaking of the company
are the
subject of a charge in favour of National Australia Bank Ltd.  Further, the
financial statements of the company for the year
ended 30 June 1999 show a
deficiency of net assets and shareholders' equity of $6,075,761.
<P>

7  	In these circumstances, the applicant seeks leave to  proceed in
order to take advantage of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contractors Debts Act 1997</a> (NSW).  The
effect of the Act is to allow a person who has carried out work (typically, a
subcontractor) and is owed money by a defaulting
contractor (typically, a
builder) to obtain payment from the person who engaged the defaulting
contractor (the principal, typically
the proprietor), to the extent that money
is still payable by the principal to the defaulting contractor: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5.</a>  In the
present case the applicant's objective is to obtain payment of the amount
claimed in the third invoice directly from the
developer.  As the applicant
frankly conceded, this would give it an advantage over other unsecured
creditors tantamount to an absolute
priority.
<P>

8  	The scheme of the Act is as follows.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> gives the unpaid
subcontractor the statutory right to obtain payment from the principal in the
circumstances which I have described.
 An important limitation is that payment
can be obtained by the subcontractor only out of money `that is payable or
becomes payable
to the defaulting contractor'.  Hence, the Act is not available
to the extent that the developer has paid the company with respect
to work done
by the applicant in this case.
<P>

9  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> establishes the procedure for obtaining payment
pursuant to the statutory right.  It requires that a debt certificate must have
been
issued for the money owed, and that the unpaid subcontractor must serve a
notice of claim on the principal together with the copy
of the debt
certificate.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> sets up the procedure for issue of a debt certificate.
A debt certificate may be issued after judgment has been given in proceedings
relating to the recovery of money by the subcontractor against the defaulting
contractor.  The certificate is issued by the Court
in which the proceedings
have been brought, and it appears on the face of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> that the Court has a
measure of discretion.  If, for example, proceedings for recovery of debt were
brought by the present applicant
against the company those proceedings may well
be instituted in the District Court.  I note that the District Court is not a
Court
for the purposes of the<b> </b>Corporations Law<b> </b>and is, therefore,
not in a position to exercise relevant discretions under the<b>
</b>Corporations Law, including the discretion to grant leave under s 471B.
<P>

10  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8</a> states that service of a notice of claim on the
principal operates to assign to the subcontractor, the obligation of the
principal
to pay money owed under the contract to the defaulting contractor
(see <i>Costain Australia Ltd v Superior Pipe Installations Pty Ltd (Receiver
Appointed) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NSWLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 NSWLR 491</a> at 499).  The assignment is limited to the
amount of the subcontractor's certified debt. Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> the subcontractor has
a right of recovery if the principal fails to pay pursuant to the notice.
<P>

11  	If, therefore, leave were granted by this Court under s 471B of
the<b> </b>Corporations Law, the applicant would be permitted to take
proceedings to recover the amount stated in the third invoice, against
the
company as defendant.  If the applicant obtained judgment in those proceedings
it would then apply to the Court in which judgment
had been entered for a debt
certificate.  Upon the applicant serving the debt certificate and a notice of
claim upon the developer,
the developer would be obliged to pay the applicant
the money owed under its contract with the company, up to the amount stated in
the third invoice.
<P>

12  	In the present case the building contract between the developer
and the company is in evidence.  The developer has given notice
to the builder
under clauses 12.01 and 12.02 of the building contract.  The consequences of
those steps are spelled out in clause
12.05 and, in particular, in clause
12.05.04.  According to that provision, until completion of the building works,
the developer
is not bound to make any further payment to the company, but
after completion the developer's representative is to ascertain the
costs
properly incurred by the developer and its loss or damage caused (in effect) by
the company's default, and clause 12.05.04
makes provision for an accounting
which sets off the amount so calculated against money owing by the developer to
the company.  If
the applicant in the present case obtains a statutory
assignment under the Act, what is assigned is a chose in action limited by
those provisions, which may reduce the amount stated in the third invoice or
even eliminate it.  There is no evidence before me as
to whether that would be
so.
<P>

13  	In these circumstances the applicant contends that it is proper
to exercise the Court's discretion to permit proceedings even
though the
practical effect of doing so may be (if the other steps which I have set out
come to pass) that it will obtain payment
from the developer, possibly of the
full amount of the third invoice, in priority to other creditors including
other subcontractors.
<P>

14  	It appears to me that I ought not to exercise my discretion to
grant substantial leave, notwithstanding the very able and forceful
arguments
which have been put to me on behalf of the applicant.  If one reviews the
foundational provisions of Chapter 5 of the Corporations
Law dealing with
external administration, one identifies an important public policy.  The public
policy is to ensure that once a
step has been taken which causes the company to
be in external administration, individual creditors are no longer able to
recover
their debts from the company separately but must abide by a system of
rateable distribution out of the assets of the company in accordance
with the
principles of the Law.  Thus s 555 states that except otherwise provided by the
law (not, one notes, by other legislation
such as the Act), all debts and
claims proved in a winding up rank equally and, if the property of the company
is insufficient to
meet them in full, they should be paid proportionately.
Section 556 ordains the order of priority of payment in a winding up.  Section
559 states that the debts of a class referred to in any of the paragraphs in s
556(1) rank equally between themselves and are to
be paid in full, unless the
property of the company is insufficient to meet them, in which case they are to
be paid proportionately.
 One of the events which commences this regime is the
appointment of a provisional liquidator under s 472 of the Law.  
<P>

15  	The applicant referred me to cases dealing with the exercise of
the Court's discretion under s 471B.  He placed particular
reliance on some
observations by McPherson J in<b> </b><i>Ogilvie-Grant v East</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%207%20ACLR%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983)
7 ACLR 669</a>, 671-2, where his Honour said:
<P>

`The precise purpose and function of provisions similar to s 230(3) [then the
equivalent of s 471B] have seldom been explained.
 From time to time the
suggestion had been made that the prohibition exists in order to effectuate the
statutory policy of ensuring
that corporate assets are distributed rateably
among all creditors so that none of them will gain an advantage over others:
See eg.
<i>Re Sydney Formworks Pty Limited</i>... But in Australia at least it
is not often that the institution of proceedings or even the recovery of
judgment operates to confer
a priority or advantage on a litigating creditor.
A more convincing explanation is that, without the relevant restriction, a
company
in liquidation would be subjected to a multiplicity of actions which
would be both expensive and time consuming well as in some cases
as
unnecessary.  This explanation has been accepted in a number of Canadian cases
and appears also to have been adopted by Street
J in Re A J Benjamin
Limited.'
<P>

16  	That passage was cited with approval by the full Federal Court
in<b> </b><i>Vagramd Pty Limited (in liq) v Fielding &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2010%20ACSR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 10
ACSR 373</a> and by Rolfe J in<b> </b><i>Bell Coal Pty Limited v UB Minerals Inc
(in liq)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSWSC%203O1" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 3O1</a> (7 April 1999).  The passage establishes that it
is open to the Court in the exercise of its discretion to grant leave under s
471B
even in a case where the effect of doing so is to give the applicant for
leave an advantage over other unsecured creditors.  McPherson
J's observations
show that it is relevant to take into account such other matters as the need to
avoid multiplicity of actions which
would be expensive and time consuming, and
possibly unnecessary.  But that is not to say that the fundamental principle of
rateable
distribution in an external administration is to be disregarded by the
Court when it deals with an application for leave under s
471B.  McPherson J's
point was only that the fundamental principle is not <i>necessarily</i>
relevant to an application under s 471B because the institution of proceedings
is not itself an event which in the normal case confers
priority or advantage
on the litigating creditor. But in the present case, the granting of leave will
set in motion a chain of events
which could and probably would give the
applicant an advantage over other creditors, though the quantification of that
advantage
is unclear in view of the terms of the contract which I have
mentioned.  That being so, it is relevant in this case to take into
account the
fundamental principle with respect to rateable distribution in deciding whether
to grant leave.
<P>

17  	The applicant says that the principle with respect to rateable
distribution is given full rein with respect to the first two
invoices, since
the Act cannot assist the applicant because the developer has paid the relevant
amount to the company in respect
of those two invoices.  The applicant
acknowledges that in respect of those amounts, it is merely an unsecured
creditor whose rights
are limited to rateable distribution in the normal
fashion.  But the applicant asserts the principle of rateable distribution
should
not be applied to the third invoice amount.
<P>

18  	The applicant's counsel draws an ingenious analogy with the
<i>Quistclose</i> trust (<i>Barclays Bank Ltd v Quitclose Investments Ltd
</i>[1970] AC 567).  There is more than a whiff of similarity between the
position of the claimant in that case and the applicant's position
here.  But a
whiff of similarity is no substitute for precise legal analysis.  It is not
suggested that any proprietary claim arises
in the applicant  with respect to
any money in the hands of the developer.  The<i> Quistclose</i> case applies
only where it is proper as a matter of law to determine that a trust has
arisen, and that is not so here.  There being
no trust or other proprietary
claim in the application, it is inescapable, in my view, that the applicant
must be subjected to the
principle of rateable distribution, painful though it
undoubtedly is in such a case as this.
<P>

19  	There are other considerations which lead me to the view that
leave ought not to be granted here.  I do not wish it to be inferred
that in my
view an application under s 471B based on the<b> </b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contractors Debts
Act</a></i> can never succeed.  The other considerations in the present case
include the presence of a secured creditor and the absence of any
evidence that
this creditor, and other subcontractors (if there are any) have been given
notice of the present application.  
<P>

20  	Reflection about the position of other subcontractors reinforces
the conclusion that I ought not to grant leave in the present
case.  One can
imagine that if leave were granted now, there would be further applications for
leave in the event that there are
other subcontractors in the same position as
the applicant with respect to its third invoice.  The race, that is the race to
have
access to funds in the developer's hands which otherwise would be paid to
the company, would be won by the swiftest.  Under the Act
the victor, the
subcontractor who is first to serve a notice of claim and debt certificate on
the developer, receives payment to
the potential exclusion of the
subcontractors who are not quite as quick.  I cannot see the justice of that
result.
<P>

21  	At today's hearing there was contention as to whether the
liquidator would be prejudiced if I were to grant leave. It is likely
that
orders could be drafted so as to protect the position of the liquidator
completely or substantially.  Under s 471B the Court
may grant leave on terms,
and the applicant has suggested, plausibly enough, that those terms could
include limiting the leave to
the specific amount of the third invoice,
preventing the enforcement of the judgment against the company in liquidation,
and also
preventing the applicant from making any claim for costs against the
liquidator.
<P>

22  	There is a provision in the Act for an attachment order to be
made <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 14).</a>  I accept the applicant's submission that I could protect the
liquidator from the risk of any such order by imposing a term which
would
prevent the applicant from seeking to employ that remedy.  And so I am not
persuaded that arguments about risks and expense
to the liquidator carry very
much weight in a case such as this.
<P>

23  	As to the risks and prejudice of the applicant, my attention was
drawn to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17</a> of the Act, under which proceedings in respect of a debt cannot
be taken under an Act more than 12 months after the debt becomes
payable. In
the present case the company is only in provisional liquidation.  It may be
that some events may occur which will bring
the provisional liquidation to an
end. It would be unfair to the applicant, if that were to occur, that the time
taken for the working
out of the provisional  liquidation meant that it had
become statute-barred under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17.</a>
<P>

24  	The best way of dealing with that problem is to grant leave
under s 471B to a strictly limited extent, to permit proceedings
in respect of
the third invoice to be taken on terms that no further steps be embarked upon
once the proceedings have been commenced.
 Nothing further should be permitted
to be done by the applicant than what is necessary to avoid the limitation
period in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cda1997201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17.</a>
<P>

25  	Finally, I want to say something about the relationship between
the<b> </b>Corporations Law and the Act.  I have taken the view that the
availability of remedies under the Act is a matter which the Court may
properly
take into account in the exercise of its discretion under s 471B.  However, the
Act should not be construed so as to prevail
over any provisions of the<b>
</b>Corporations Law - for example, so as to extinguish or qualify those
sections of the<b> </b>Law which add up to the fundamental principle about
rateable distribution.
<P>

26  	The Act does not in terms refer to the liquidation of the
defaulting contractor.  Section 19 states that the Act does not affect
certain
other remedies, but there is no mention of the<b> </b>Corporations Law.  In
these circumstances the correct principle of construction is to be found in s 5
of the Corporations (New South
Wales) Act 1989 (NSW).  That section states that
a later enactment of the Parliament of New South Wales is not to be interpreted
as to amending or repealing or otherwise altering the effect of the
Corporations Law of New South Wales, expect so far as the later
enactment
provides expressly that it is to have effect despite applicable provisions of
the<b> </b>Corporations Law.  There is no such express provision in the Act.
Therefore, as a matter of construction the Act should not be taken
to qualify
the provisions and principles of the Corporations Law.  In the result the
availability of relief under the Act is relevant,
but not determinative in an
application under s 471B.
<P>

27  	I therefore hold that the notice of motion succeeds only to the
very limited extent that the applicant be granted leave to
commence proceedings
against the company under s 471B of the<b> </b>Corporations Law, on terms that
no steps be taken by the applicant to prosecute those proceedings except by
leave of this Court. 
I grant liberty to apply before me on 48 hours' notice.
I order that the applicant pay the respondent liquidator's costs, since the
application has substantially failed.  I stand the application for winding up
over to the Corporations Judge on Monday 7 February
2000.
