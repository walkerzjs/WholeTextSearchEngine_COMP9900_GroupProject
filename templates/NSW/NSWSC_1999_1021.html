<P>


<P>

<b>The proceedings</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff, by summons under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51A</a> Rule 4 of
the Supreme Court Rules, in the Administrative Division of this court, sought,
inter alia, that certain orders made by
the first defendant be set aside and
that it be ordered that the third to 527th defendants (the debtors), whose
names are listed
in a schedule to the summons, be liable to pay the whole of
the credit charges under loan contracts with the plaintiff.
<P>

2  	Alternatively it was sought, that the debtors be declared liable
to pay the whole of the credit charges but that the plaintiff,
pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s86b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act 1984</a>, pay into the financial counselling trust fund
maintained under that Act, an amount deemed by the court to be appropriate.
<P>

3  	Ancillary and consequential orders are also sought.
<P>

4  	The application is brought by way of appeal from a decision of
the first defendant in respect of an application by the plaintiff,
a credit
provider under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>, for relief to the first defendant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.85</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">86</a> of that Act from the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.42</a>, by reason of which, in consequence
of certain contraventions of the Act, the plaintiff was deprived of its credit
charges on loan
contracts with the debtors regulated under that Act.  The
tribunal had made an order having the effect of restoring some 82% of the
credit charges and requiring the plaintiff to refund or credit the 18% balance
of their individual credit charge to each debtor.
 The plaintiff was ordered to
pay the costs.
<P>

<b>The statutory scheme</b>
<P>

5  	The scheme of the Act and the kind of application made here are
conveniently described by Cole, AJA. in <b>ANZ Banking Group Limited v.
Director-General Department of Fair Trading &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/278.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 278.
(His</a> Honour's references to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s86a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.86A</a> are not of immediate reference):-
<P>

"A regulated loan contract is one relating to a loan of $20,000 or less [Credit
Act 1984, s.30].  Section 85(1) provides:-
<P>

'85(1)	Where, by reason of a contravention of or a failure to comply with this
Act ... by a credit provider, a debtor is not liable
to pay to the credit
provider under a regulated contract an amount that, but for the contravention
or failure, he would have been
liable to pay under the contract, the credit
provider may apply to the Tribunal for an order increasing the liability of the
debtor
to the credit provider.'
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a> provides, relevantly:-
<P>

'42(1)	Subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.85</a>, where:-
<P>

	...
<P>

	(b)	a loan contract is not in writing signed by the debtor or is not in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.36</a>, ...
<P>

the debtor is not liable to pay to the credit provider the credit charge under
the contract.'
<P>

Thus, if there was a contravention or failure to comply with s.36 of the Act,
the Bank was deprived of its credit charge, and to
avoid that consequence
sought relief pursuant to ss.85, 86 and 86A.
<P>

Section 85 addresses the circumstance where a credit provider seeks relief
against a single debtor from the discharge conferred
by s.42 of the obligation
to pay the credit charge.  Section 86 addresses the circumstance where the
contravention or failure to
comply affects two or more regulated contracts.
Where application is made pursuant to s.86, the Tribunal:-
<P>

'(a)	may make a determination under s.86 in relation to one or more specified
regulated contracts, and
<P>

(b)	may make a determination under s.85 in relation to all regulated contracts
entered into by the credit provider during a specified
period, and
<P>

(c)	may make a determination under s.85 in relation to all regulated contracts
of a specified class entered into by the credit provider
during a specified
period (for example, all regulated contracts entered into during a specified
period which are affected by a specified
contravention or failure).'
<P>

Where an application is made under s.86, affected debtors need not be
identified in the application unless the Tribunal requires
such identification
[s.86(2)].  The Tribunal may authorise notice of the application to be given by
newspaper advertisement which,
on compliance with certain provision, is
regarded as effective notice to each debtor [s.86(3), (4) and (5)].
<P>

... 
<P>

It is apparent that the combined effect of s.36, s.42 and ss.85, 86 and
86A(2)(b) is that any relief from the consequence of s.42
for a contravention
or failure to comply with the provisions of s.36 granted pursuant to s.85 in
consequence of the application of
ss.86 and 86A relate only to the
contravention or failure to comply which is the subject of the application by
the credit provider.
 The reason why that is so is also plain:  there may be
one or more known contraventions or failures to comply which might be the
subject of an application by the credit provider for relief, but there may
exist, unknown at that time, other contraventions or failures
to comply which,
unexcused, may result in consequence of s.42 in the debtor being relieved of
the obligation to pay the credit charge.
 That Act thus gives to the credit
provider the facility to make multiple applications at various times in respect
of known and established
contraventions or failures to comply.  The Act does
not impose on the credit provider the obligation to make an application for
relief
pursuant to ss.85, 86 and 86A, nor does it impose an obligation to bring
an application in respect of all contraventions or failures
to comply known at
the time of bringing a particular application.  The Act does not, at least
explicitly, address the circumstance
of the credit provider being aware of two
or more contraventions or failures to comply yet bringing an application only
in respect
of one.  Presumably, that is because the credit provider is not
obliged to bring any application at all in respect of a known contravention
or
failure to comply.  The credit provider is given the option of not seeking
relief.  It could accept that the credit charge is
not payable, but if it
wishes to recover the credit charge, an application pursuant to ss.85, 86 and
86A would be necessary.
<P>

The debtor is placed in an invidious situation in reality.  If the debtor
becomes aware of a contravention or failure to comply
with, for example, s.36,
he has no right to bring an application for a declaration to that effect.
Presumably, his course of action
is either to continue to pay instalments as
required by the loan agreement until all payments have been made excluding that
which
relates to the amount of the credit charge, and then decline to pay that
sum.  If sued, he could plead s.42 as a defence.  Bearing
in mind that the sum
involved is less than $20,000, the reality of a debtor becoming so aware and
adopting the course I have suggested,
must be remote.  Indeed, the prospect of
a debtor in truth becoming aware of any application for relief, where
application is made
pursuant to s.86 and notification being by newspaper
advertisement, must be equally remote.  Be that as it may, it seems clear that
the intent of ss.85, 86 and 86A is to confer upon the Tribunal, after actual
notice to the debtor, deemed notice to the debtor, or
notice to the Director
General of the Department of Fair Trading (formerly the Commissioner), who
intervenes in the applications
in the public interest pursuant to s.43(1) of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1984226/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Administration) Act 1984</a>, mechanism whereby a credit provider who
has departed from or contravened certain provisions of the Act may seek relief
from the
consequences of those departures which result from the operation of
s.42.
<P>

The subject application to the Tribunal did not admit a contravention or
failure to comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>, but rather posed for determination the
question whether certain circumstances constituted a contravention or failure
to comply with
the Act, thus conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal to
consider the matter of relief under ss.85, 86 or 86A."
<P>

6  	Other relevant provisions of the Act need to be referred to.
Section 31 provides as follows:-
<P>

"(1)	Subject to subsection (2), a credit provider shall not enter into a credit
sale contract or a loan contract that is not in
writing signed by the
debtor.
<P>

Penalty:  10 penalty units.
<P>

(2)	Subsection (1) is not contravened if a credit sale contract or a loan
contract is made by the acceptance of an offer in writing
signed by the debtor
to the credit provider to enter into the contract."
<P>

7  	Section 32 requires that a credit provider or the agent of a
credit provider authorised to receive an offer to enter into a
loan contract
shall not give to a person a document for signature by that person as an offer
in writing to enter into a loan contract
unless it includes the relevant
prescribed notice and in addition, before the person signs the document, there
is given to that person
a true copy of the document certified by the provider
or agent.  By subsection (5), where a person signs a document and thereby
offers
to enter into a loan contract, any subsequent alteration of or addition
to the terms and conditions of the contract has no force
or effect unless,
after the alteration or addition has been made, the person has, opposite the
alteration or addition, signed or
initialled the margin of the original
document or the copy.  Subsection (6) expressly prohibits the provider or the
provider's agent
from altering or adding to the terms and conditions specified
in the document with intent to deceive.  The section defines "offer
in writing"
by subsection (7) as including a document that, if signed by or on behalf of
the credit  provider and the debtor, would
be a loan contract.
<P>

8  	Section 33 requires a copy of the accepted offer to be provided
to the debtor and by s.34, in addition, the prescribed statement
is to be
provided both within 14 days, subject to certain limited exceptions.
<P>

9  	Section 36 provides for the contents of the loan contract.  It
requires that such a contract shall include the date on which
the offer was
signed by the debtor;  the amount financed;   the credit charge;  the total of
the credit charged and the amount finances;
 the annual percentage rate;  the
person to whom and the place at which payments are to be made;  a statement as
to whether payments
are to be made by instalments, and if so, a statement of
such of the following as are known or can be calculated at the relevant
date
(s.36(1)(g)):-
<P>

"(i)	where each instalment is the same amount, that amount;
<P>

(ii)	where each instalment except the last is the same amount, that amount and
the amount of the last instalment;
<P>

(iii)	where neither subparagraph (i) or subparagraph (ii) applies, the amount
of each instalment;
<P>

(iv)	the number of instalments;  and
<P>

(v)	the time for the payment of each instalment or the time for the payment of
the first instalment and the interval between each
instalment and the
subsequent instalment."
<P>

10  	By subsection (4):-
<P>

"In this section, 'relevant date' means the date on which the loan contract is
entered into or, if the loan contract is entered
into by the acceptance by the
credit provider of an offer made by the debtor, the date on which the offer is
made."
<P>

11  	In addition to the Act providing for the automatic civil penalty
under s.42, there is also provided, under s.43 that:-
<P>

"A credit provider shall not enter into a credit sale contract, or a loan
contract, that is in writing but is otherwise not in accordance
with this
Division.
<P>

Penalty:  10 penalty units."
<P>

12  	Thus, failure to comply with s.31 may also attract a criminal
penalty.  Contracting out is both prohibited and a criminal offence,
pursuant
to s.157.
<P>

13  	The history and philosophy of the Act and its context of the
reform of Australia's credit laws are set out in the judgment
of Kirby, P.,
with whom both Priestley and Meagher, JJA. agreed, in <b>Canham</b> <b>&amp;
Ors v. Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited &amp; Anor</b> (1992-93) 31
NSWLR 246 at 252-254.  His Honour described:-
<P>

"... disclosure and truth in lending was the very linchpin of the new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit
Act</a>.  To discourage non-disclosure, whether deliberate or accidental, drastic
consequences were provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.42."</a> 
<P>

14  	At 254 his Honour said:-
<P>

"The ultimate theory behind the philosophy of truth in lending in our credit
legislation is that disclosure of critical elements
in the consumer contract
will help to ensure honesty and integrity in the relationship (where  one party
is normally disadvantaged
or even vulnerable);  promote informed choices by
consumers;  and allow the market for financial services to operate effectively.
This philosophy can be seen in the Rogerson Report, the Molomby Report, the Law
reform Commission Report and in the legislation which
has followed, including
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>.  The policy behind the philosophy must be kept in mind in
approaching the application of particular provisions in the Act to particular
facts.  The modern approach to the interpretation of legislation is, so far as
the language of the legislation permits, to ensure
that to give effect to, and
does not frustrate the achievement of, the apparent purposes of parliament as
disclosed in the language:
 see generally, <b>Kingston v. Keprose Pty.
Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 404</a> at 423 and cases there cited.
<P>

In <b>Anderson v. HCF Financial Services Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1988/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] VicRp 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20VR%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] VR 251</a> at 255, the
Victorian Full Court emphasised that the Victorian counterpart legislation to
that which is here under consideration
is 'primarily intended to protect
borrowers [and] it should be given an interpretation beneficial to borrowers'.
I agree with this
approach."
<P>

<b>The parties</b>
<P>

15  	The first defendant, the successor to the Commissioner of
Consumer Affairs, pursuant to s.43 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1984226/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Administration) Act 1984</a>,
with the consent of the Minister, intervened before the Tribunal in the public
interest and before me, has appeared to the summons
and has submitted to such
orders the court might make, save as to costs.  The second defendant, the
Director General, Department
of Fair Trading, appropriately in the light of the
decision in <b>Lyall Offe v. The Residential Tenancies Tribunal of New South
Wales &amp; Ors</b> (Court of Appeal, unreported 29 October 1997) in the role
of contravener, appeared in opposition to the plaintiff.
<P>

16  	Both before the Tribunal, in accordance with the Act, and in
this court by Dunford, J., orders were made for notification to
the debtors and
providing for notice in lieu of service.  Compliance was established by
affidavits, in particular that of Stephen
Tudjman sworn 16 June 1997, and also
that of Edmond Bishara sworn 17 June 1997.
<P>

17  	The limited response to that notification both in this court and
below is also relied upon by the plaintiff in respect of such
orders as should
be made or should have been made, in particular in relation to the tribunal's
orders to refund, as being inappropriate.
<P>

<b>Statutory appeal provisions</b>
<P>

18  	The appeal is pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act
1984</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> relevantly provides:-
<P>

"(1)	A reference or appeal under this section shall be made in accordance with
rules of the Supreme Court.
<P>

...
<P>

(3)	Where, in proceedings before the Tribunal, a question arises with respect
to a matter of law, the presiding Chairman or Deputy
Chairman may decide the
question or may refer it to the Supreme Court for decision.
<P>

(4)	Where a question with respect to a matter of law is referred to the Supreme
Court under subsection (3):-
<P>

	(a)	the Tribunal shall not make an order or decision to which the question is
relevant until the Supreme Court has decided the
question,
<P>

	(b)	upon deciding the question, the Supreme Court shall remit its decision to
the Tribunal, and
<P>

	(c)	the Tribunal shall not proceed in a manner, or make an order or decision,
that is inconsistent with the decision of the Supreme
Court.
<P>

(5)	Where, in proceedings before the Tribunal, the Chairman or a Deputy
Chairman decides a question with respect to a matter of
law, a party to the
proceedings who is dissatisfied with the decision may appeal to the Supreme
Court against the decision of the
Chairman or Deputy Chairman.
<P>

(6)	After deciding the question the subject of an appeal under subsection (5),
the Supreme Court may, unless it affirms the decision
of the Chairman or Deputy
Chairman on the question:-
<P>

	(a)	make such order in relation to the proceedings in which the question arose
as, in its opinion, should have been made by the
Tribunal, or
<P>

	(b)	remit its decision on the question to the Tribunal and order a re-hearing
of the proceedings before the Tribunal.
<P>

(7)	Where a re-hearing is held pursuant to an order under subsection (6)(b),
the Tribunal shall not proceed in a manner, or make
an order or decision, that
is inconsistent with the decision of the Supreme Court remitted to the
Tribunal.
<P>

...
<P>

(10)	For the purposes of this section, a reference to a matter of law includes
a reference to a matter relating to the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal and a
matter as to the admission or rejection of evidence."
<P>

19  	Uninstructed by the case law, one might have considered because
of the similar drafting, that subsection (5) dealt with matters
akin to those
to which subsection (3) refers, that is, only those identified questions which
raised a matter of law determined by
the chairman or deputy chairman and
material to the Tribunal's decision.  Without there appearing to be any
detailed discussion on
the difference between the effect of such a provision as
that in subsection (5) and the common form provision providing for an appeal
for error of law, it appears to have been assumed that this provision simply
creates a similar appeal.  This may not be right.  But
on any view, no appeal
would be available under such a provision on mere matters of fact or assessment
of weight in the exercise
of discretion.  However, I will turn to consider in
detail the ambit of any appeal later.
<P>

<b>The Tribunal</b>
<P>

<P>

<b>The Tribunal's decision</b>
<P>

25  	The Tribunal, after extensive hearings and submissions and
considering voluminous evidentiary material, made the orders already
referred
to and provided a 49 page statement of reasons.  The Tribunal noted that it was
concerned with the second further amended
application of the plaintiff filed in
the Tribunal on 12 July 1996, which application sought orders and
determinations in respect
of "each and every such possible error or
contravention applicable to the respondent's contract".  Such a "blanket"
application is
hardly conducive to the employment of precision and focus before
the Tribunal nor to enabling a debtor satisfactorily to decide what
course he
or she might take in respect of any particular contraventions in respect of any
particular contract.
<P>

26  	The present application descended, however, to a degree of
particularity and annexed a schedule of some 17 pages identifying
some 289
contracts (two of which were re-financed) and eight classes of possible error,
identified in the schedule by reference to
columns, including a primary error,
which in its legal effect meant that certain of the contracts might not have
been in writing,
as required by s.31 of the Act and in the facts and
circumstances set out in the application.  In summary, those circumstances were
that the due dates for payment of the first instalment and/or for payment of
any other instalment, did not appear in the document
at the time the respondent
signed the document, but were later inserted, and that the applicant did not,
by its authorised officer,
sign the memorandum of acceptance until after the
due date for payment for the first instalment shown in the document.  In
neither
case had the respondent relevantly signed a payment book as provided at
the appropriate time.
<P>

27  	Further and as a consequence, the contracts might not have been
"in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.36"</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a> because the due date did not appear
in the contract at the time at which the respondent signed the contract and for
non-compliance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.36(1)(b)</a>, (d), (e), (g), (h) of that Act in the
circumstances set forth in the application.
<P>

28  	The Tribunal identified the relevant possible contraventions and
the general nature of the loan arrangements as follows:-
<P>

"The main possible contravention ('the primary error') is that the contracts
were not in writing signed by the debtor.  The remaining
possible
contraventions included misstatements in relation to undated contracts, the
annual percentage rate, details of instalments,
commission charges and the
statement the total of the credit charged and the amount financed.  The
contracts related to the purchase
of time share interests ('the time share
agreements') in a number of New South Wales holiday resorts.  The time share
agreements
were entered into at the same time the debtors were to have signed
the contracts.
<P>

The relief sought also includes any contract which in the relevant period
re-financed or was part of a series of contracts ('re-financing
contracts')
which re-financed a prior regulated contract of the kind referred to above
where the re-financing contract failed to
include a statement of the amount
financed pursuant to s.36(1)(b) of the Act.  There are two re-financing
contracts."
<P>

29  	The Tribunal accepted that loan contracts between the plaintiff
and the debtors, who had been introduced to the plaintiff through
Mr. John
Leaver Throwden ("Mr. Throwden") and who had introduced the debtors to time
share interests and contracts in a number of
holiday resorts in New South Wales
and other parts of Australia, which the loans from the plaintiff financed, did
contain the primary
error and the other errors particularised.  It did so, not
only on the basis of the extensive affidavit evidence, but also on the
basis of
the statement of agreed facts of some 14 pages which had been by consent
provided to the Tribunal.  That statement was not
intended to operate to
replace the primary evidence, but to summarise it and to provide for such
adverse inferences to the applicant
as the parties were agreed should be drawn.
The Tribunal accepted that document as adequately and fairly representing the
facts relevant
to the application.  It thus accepted that the errors had
occurred and the necessary prerequisite to the obtaining of the relief
sought
had been established.
<P>

30  	The Tribunal noted that the errors had come to light not only in
New South Wales.  Proceedings of a similar kind under this
Australia wide
legislation had been instituted by the plaintiff as a consequence of the
detection of these errors in other States
and the ACT as well.
<P>

31  	The Tribunal therefore considered the primary error and the
consequential "column two" error together in finding the basic
facts and the
surrounding circumstances.  It held as follows:-
<P>

"There are 289 contracts with both the primary and the column 2 errors.  These
errors involved debtors signing the contract before
the full details of
instalments were provided on the contracts.  In isolated incidents the contract
was also left blank or was inaccurate
insofar as it related to details of the
amount financed, the commission charge, the credit charge and/or the annual
percentage rate.
<P>

The contracts relevantly contained, inter alia, at p.2 the following:-
<P>

'Part E	Payment of Amount Financed and Credit Charge by Instalments
<P>

E.1	Amount of each instalment
<P>

	(other than the final instalment)	_____
<P>

E.2	Amount of final instalment		_____
<P>

E.3	Number of instalments			_____
<P>

E.4	The first instalment			_____
<P>

E.5	Instalments are then payable on the 	_____
<P>

	day of every month.
<P>

					Important
<P>

You can withdraw this offer any time before the credit provider accepts it.
When the credit provider does accept it, you are bound
by it.'
<P>

The primary and the column 2 errors involved omitting the first and subsequent
instalment dates ('E4' and 'E5') on the contract
at the time the debtor signed
the contract.  Sometime later these details were inserted by the applicant onto
the contracts.  The
contracts were not resigned or redated by the debtors.  It
is, therefore, for these reasons that it is possible the contracts were
not in
writing signed by the debtors.
<P>

In respect of two contracts, those of Messrs. R.J. Johnson and M.E. O'Malley,
the memorandum of acceptance on the contract ('the
memorandum') was signed by
the applicant only after the due date for payment of the first instalment had
passed.
<P>

It was the intention of the applicant that once the contract was completed and
signed by the debtor it was to constitute an offer
by the debtor to borrow from
the applicant.  In these circumstances, the debtor was intended to be the
offeror.  In reality, what
occurred in respect of both the primary and column 2
errors was that the contracts failed to include details of E4 and E5 when the
debtor first signed the contract.  Consequently when the applicant inserted
these details later, it became the offeror and the debtor
the offeree.  At no
time after the insertion of the instalment details by the applicant were the
contracts resigned by the debtors.
<P>

The applicant intended that Mr. Throwden would be present when someone (other
than Mr. Throwden) completed the contract.  However,
it would appear that soon
after the Act commenced this process was undertaken either in Mr. Throwden's
absence or by sales staff
at Port Pacific and later by staff described by Mr.
Throwden as Port Pacific 'finance officers'.  It was intended that the
contracts
be checked by Mr. Throwden's staff and the application forms ('the
applicant form/s') and the contracts would then be forwarded to
the
applicant.
<P>

If an application form was approved by the applicant an officer of the
applicant would sign the memorandum and the loan monies would
be dispatched.
Sometime after the applicant signed the memorandum the applicant would forward
a copy of the contract and a repayment
instalment book which included, amongst
other things, the instalment dates.
<P>

For at least 18 months after the introduction of the Act the majority of the
contracts were processed through the applicant's Taree
branch.  By all accounts
it was a small branch staffed by only three people.  In or about 1986 or early
1987 the Taree branch changed
its duties so that it became a sales office of
the applicant's Newcastle branch.  Sometime during 1987 the Taree branch
closed. 
From that time onwards the contracts were processed through the
Newcastle branch.
<P>

The applicant's training check lists (annexed to the Brady and Coogan
affidavits) indicate that the applicant's practice required
that all details,
including the instalment dates were to be completed before the debtor signed
the contract.  If an introducer was
the source of the contract, then the
introducer was required to be present:  see also the first Buxton affidavit.
At some unknown
time it was noticed that E4 and E5 details were being omitted
at the time the debtor signed the contract and before the applicant
signed the
memorandum.  When the applicant received the contract one of its officers would
insert the instalment dates and then sign
the memorandum.  A copy of the
contract together with a repayment instalment book would then be dispatched to
the debtor."
<P>

32  	It referred to the evidence from Mr. Buxton that the omission
was due to an intended delay mechanism to ensure the first instalment
date did
not fall due before the debtor received the benefit of the loan monies.  It was
Mr. Buxton's understanding, the Tribunal
found, that such a procedure developed
in response to the seven day "cooling-off period" contained within the time
share agreement,
the benefit of which the debtor would be denied if the
information was included at the time the debtor signed the contract.  It noted
other evidence as to the actual practices of individual officers and
offices.
<P>

33  	In the light of the evidence that one of the main objectives of
the plaintiff's training programme was to ensure that the introducer
completed
both the application form and the contract, that the introducer not only needed
to be present at the time of signature,
but was also required to personally
complete both the application form and the contract, the Tribunal accepted that
the omission
of the relevant details was "directly contract to the practice"
which should have been followed.
<P>

34  	The Tribunal held:-
<P>

"Despite the fact that the applicant undertook to have in place training and
development sessions which were designed to set appropriate
and acceptable
standards for processing of application forms and contracts, what actually
occurred was quite different."
<P>

"There was no dispute between the parties that the primary error did not
constitute a contravention under s.36.  The Tribunal concurs
with this view.
However, counsels (sic) for both the Director-General and the applicant are in
dispute as to the significance and
the extent of the consequences to which this
gives rise."
<P>

<b>The primary and the consequential error</b>
<P>

35  	In order to examine the issue of compliance with the statute,
the Tribunal applied the analysis to similar circumstances of
the Full Court of
the Supreme Court of Victoria in <b>Custom Credit Corporation v. Gray</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1992/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] VicRp 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%201%20VR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 1 VR 540.  (Although</a> that decision, it was held in <b>ANZ Banking Group
Limited v. Director General, Department of Fair Trading &amp; Ors</b> (supra),
should not in one respect be followed in New South Wales, it is accepted by
both parties that the decision still stands
good in this respect.)
<P>

36  	Following that approach, the Tribunal held that the original
omission of the instalment dates was not cured by later insertion
and that
those dates being essential, the proper conclusion was that the credit provider
had made a counter-offer by sending to the
debtor a copy of the documentation
and the instalment repayment book, both of which then included the inserted
instalment details.
 The debtor accepted the counter-offer by conduct, in,
amongst other things, paying the relevant instalments.  As a consequence,
the
contract so made was not a contract in writing, as required by s.42.
Consequently, there was no compliance with s.31(1), in that
the date on which
the contract or the offer to enter into the contract was signed by the debtor
was not included because the contract
was not as required by s.42.
<P>

<b>Further errors</b>
<P>

37  	In respect of 61 contracts, the Tribunal held that there was a
failure correctly to describe the insurer and thus a consequential
breach of
s.36(1)(b), but concluded that such a contravention, whilst a matter to be
considered in the ultimate determination, was
not of itself serious.
<P>

38  	In respect of six contracts, the Tribunal accepted that they
contained an incorrect statement of a total amount financed and
the credit
charge by reason of miscalculation of the two amounts, most likely caused by
human error.  Thus there was a consequential
breach of s.36(1)(d).
<P>

39  	In this context, the Tribunal noted the consistent evidence
before it that, for the most part, debtors, because of aggressive
sales
pressure tactics designed to gag any line of enquiry or questioning, were
hardly given the opportunity to enquire into any
details of their contract nor
did they have time to check calculations.  Thus, the Tribunal concluded that
the majority of the respondents
were not fully apprised of the information they
were entitled to under the Act, notwithstanding the applicant's responsibility
to
ensure correct calculations.
<P>

40  	To define the legal significance of the errors, the Tribunal
adverted to the extensive case law concerning strict compliance
with s.36 and
the philosophy underlying the legislation designed to promote honesty and
integrity in the relationship by requiring
precise and accurate disclosure of
critical elements in the contract.
<P>

41  	In the case of one contract, the Tribunal concluded that it did
not contain a statement of the annual percentage rate and thus
there was a
consequential breach of s.36(1)(e).  Again it would appear that the omission
occurred as a result of human error.  The
Tribunal noted the essential nature
of the requirement to specify the annual percentage rate so as to provide an
opportunity to a
borrower to make an informed, cost-conscious loan decision.
<P>

42  	The Tribunal also noted in the case of one contract the failure
to include the amount of a final instalment and number of instalments,
occasioning a breach of s.36(1)(g) and in the case of two contracts, the
failure to disclose by or to whom a commission charge was
payable thus leading
to a breach of s.36(1)(h).
<P>

<b>Effect of the primary error</b>
<P>

43  	The Tribunal noted the thrust of the submissions of both counsel
in relation to the primary and column two errors.  For the
Director-General it
was put:-
<P>

"That debtors at a certain point in time must have found themselves bound by
their contracts when they were not fully apprised of
all the relevant
information to which they were entitled.  As a consequence, the potential for
loss or damage suffered by the debtors
was that, had they wished to withdraw
from the contract, they did not believe they could and made no attempt to do
so."
<P>

44  	The applicant submitted that in consequence of what had occurred
whilst the technical legal position was in accord with the
analysis in
<b>Gray</b> (supra), nonetheless, at the time that the debtors, by their
conduct, entered into the contract they individually knew all the relevant
terms and that therefore with the one exception of the Allport contract, there
was no actual loss or damage nor potential for this
to occur.
<P>

45  	The Tribunal, however, when examining the relevant circumstances
and indeed when looking at the individual errors which it
accepted, had
adverted to the necessity for the requirements of the Act to be complied with
strictly or at least to the extent so
that disclosure occurred sufficiently to
fully inform relevant debtors of compliance with the Act.
<P>

46  	The Tribunal adverted to the observations of Kirby, P. in
<b>Canham </b>(supra) and the view consistently taken in the case law that
defects in compliance with s.36 may be the subject of applications under
ss.85,
86 and 86A to preclude injustice arising from the forfeiture of credit charges.
Thus, the Act is properly to be construed
as requiring strict compliance with
its requirements.
<P>

47  	The Tribunal noted that the number of contracts affected by the
primary and column two errors and held:-
<P>

"The Tribunal is of the opinion that the errors came about as a result of a
number of aberrant practices and procedures which gradually
emerged contrary to
those intended by the applicant.  One of the major practices which emerged
involved omitting certain details
of the contracts, that is the first and
subsequent instalment dates.  These contracts were subsequently 'amended' or
'adjusted' to
include the omitted details by officers of the applicant, resort
staff or employees of Throwden's.  As indicated earlier in these
reasons when
these amendments or adjustments were made the contract which resulted amounted
to a counter-offer by the applicant which
was then accepted by the debtor.
<P>

The Tribunal considers that the errors, the subject of the present application,
were peculiar in that they related to a specific
geographical location within
NSW, Port Pacific, and were confined to a particular class of regulated loan
contract being contracts
associated with time-share interests, where the
applicant was introduced to the debtor by Mr. Throwden.  It has been
established
that a single error should be regarded as only one error although
an error extending over a lengthy period could be considered important
to an
issue of compliance:  <b>Westpac v. Various Respondents (No. 4)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20ASC%2056%2d187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) ASC
56-187</a> at 57,907:-
<P>

'... the Tribunal has to consider whether such a single error repeated in many
contracts should be regarded as one error only or
should be treated more
seriously than single errors because of the repetition of the error in many
contracts.
<P>

The Tribunal's view is that while such errors should not normally be treated as
seriously as a like number of discrete errors would
be they should be treated
more seriously than a single error.  The Tribunal recognises that the systemic
error situation would not
usually be expected to reveal the same level off
(sic) incompetence as would be disclosed in the case of a multitude of discrete
errors.  However, weight has to be given to the fact that a greater number of
contracts are affected by systemic error than would
be the case in a 'one-off'
error situation.'
<P>

The Tribunal concurs with this view.
<P>

The Tribunal is of the view that the primary and column two errors fall into
this type of error:  see also <b>Bing Lee Pty. Limited v. Various
Respondents</b> (1994) ("Bing Lee") ASC 56-267 at 58,808.
<P>

The primary and the column two errors and the circumstances which gave rise to
them are considered serious.  This is considered
together with the fact that
they continued for seven years with the knowledge of senior management."
<P>

48  	In considering the significance of the error, the Tribunal had
earlier held:-
<P>

"There was no dispute between the parties that the primary error did not
constitute a contravention under s.36.  The Tribunal concurs
with this view.
However, counsels for both the Director-General and the applicant are in
dispute as to the significance and the extent
of the consequences to which this
gives rise.
<P>

In order for the Tribunal to assess the circumstances surrounding the primary
and the column two errors it is necessary for it to
address the question of
whether the contracts constitute an offer from or to the applicant, how they
were accepted and whether, if
accepted, the agreement which then resulted
contained terms which were so uncertain as to lead it to the conclusion that no
contracts
could have been formed.
<P>

Despite the fact that the applicant undertook to have in place training and
development sessions which were designed to set appropriate
and acceptable
standards for processing of application forms and contracts, what actually
occurred was quite different."
<P>

49  	The Tribunal noted the Director-General's submission drawing its
attention to the inclusion in these contracts of the following
(at p.802 of the
appeal books):-
<P>

<center>"Important.</center>
<P>


<P>

*	you can withdraw this offer at any time before the credit provider accepts
it.  When the credit provider does accept it, you are
bound by it."
<P>

50  	In general, the Tribunal accepted the Director-General's
submission that as a consequence of the primary error, once the contract
was
signed by the applicant, the debtor would believe that it was binding,
particularly since there was, by that stage, a binding
time share agreement
that the loan would finance.  In most cases the funds would already have been
advanced and some debtors would
have received their repayment instalment books
after the first payment was due.  Thus the availability of the right to
withdraw,
a most valuable right, would have been concealed.
<P>

51  	The Tribunal, however, also accepted that notwithstanding the
reality of the situation was that many debtors were in fact in
varying degrees
of confusion, there was nonetheless merit in the plaintiff's submission that
the debtors were relevantly aware of
the nature of the terms.  In one case to
which I have already referred, the Tribunal noted the prospect of actual loss
or damage,
ie. the Allport contract.  These were persons who did, in fact, seek
to withdraw, apparently unsuccessfully.
<P>

52  	It was submitted for the applicant that the Tribunal erred in
concluding debtors may have believed themselves bound and thus
suffered
potential harm and the Tribunal should have confined itself to dealing with the
application on the face of the documents,
ie. the submission was that the
errors were technical and not substantial.  The Tribunal did not agree.
<P>

53  	The Tribunal, in addition, for the purpose of defining the ambit
and nature of the errors and thus the circumstances to set
the culpability,
made findings concerning the background to the making of the errors.  In doing
so, as will be seen, it is alleged
to have fallen into error by embarking on an
enquiry wider than authorised by the Act and by taking into account, as a
result, irrelevant
matters.
<P>

<b>Applicant's practices as background to the errors</b>
<P>

54  	The Tribunal subjected the evidence concerning the practices of
the applicant to some detailed analysis.  It concluded that
the relevant branch
manager had displayed a casual, if not careless, attitude to the applicant's
compliance procedures, particularly
when the refusal of that manager to allow
the Allports to withdraw from the contract, even though he knew the applicant
had not signed
the relevant memorandum, was taken into account.  The Tribunal
concluded that the supervisory and monitoring duties were discharged
with
little regard to the applicant's practices or procedures, such as they were,
that the approach of branch managers was careless;
 that a set of practices had
been allowed to develop which, on any view, must have been suspect,
particularly given the hard sell
tactics of the time share resorts;  that one
of the senior managers abrogated his responsibility as it related to giving
assistance
and support to branch management, in particular as to overseeing
training and development in the Act's requirements and monitoring
contracts;
that a member of the senior staff only saw fit, the Tribunal held, to raise
concerns about circumstances associated with
the primary error, not because it
was required as a matter of procedure, but because he was "concerned" about
"aggressive sales tactics"
exercised by time share staff.  The Tribunal
held:-
<P>

"The recognition of such tactics should have prompted any manager to have been
ever more diligent in applying appropriate procedures
and practice."
<P>

55  	The Tribunal found that the evidence of that supervisory or
senior staff member and the relevant branch manager to be, for
the most part,
unreliable and that they had played a central role in what occurred in the
circumstances leading to the primary and
column two errors.  The "details
relating to the form and content of the training and development sessions" of
the applicant's programmes
in relation to education on the requirements of the
Act was starkly absent.
<P>

56  	The Tribunal held that "while the applicant had worthy
intentions in developing appropriate procedures and practices in its
preparation for the Act's introduction, their methods for doing so proved to be
either insufficient or ineffective".  It concluded
that monitoring of contracts
by branch management was only cursory;  there was no effective or objective
compliance review system;
 there was informal set of practices and procedures
which became entrenched, giving rise to the primary error;  there was no
evidence
to indicate the existence of a practice or procedures manual to define
best practice and on the evidence, with some exceptions, it
appeared that
managers displayed little if any commitment to proper practice and procedure
and an unwillingness to be involved in
rectifying suspect practices.  The
applicant was found to be culpable "in that it had no final point of
accountability or system
of review to resolve any questions or problems as and
when they arose".  The Tribunal was particularly concerned as to the
unstructured
training of those persons retained by the applicant to introduce
persons to the applicant as a credit provider, not only in relation
to time
share products, but more generally.
<P>

57  	In conclusion, when dealing with the circumstances surrounding
the errors, the Tribunal held that:-
<P>

"The practices and procedures which actually developed were in fact a response
to facilitate a foot hole in the lucrative market
of prime share interests.
Effective practice and procedure took second place to this.  The interests and
concerns of the debtors
were subsumed to this central objective.  In such an
environment and in the absence of any effective compliance review system, the
potential for the development of the circumstances which gave rise to the
primary and column two errors became greater.  The Tribunal
considers these
factors to be of major significance in its consideration of the relevant
circumstances."
<P>

58  	The Tribunal noted that the applicant moved promptly following
detection of the relevant errors.  It also found, as a matter
of fact, that the
delays in detection extended over seven years, albeit the relevant branch
manager was aware of the circumstances
which gave rise to the primary error but
did not think to raise these with his superiors.
<P>

59  	In the applicant's favour the Tribunal noted that, albeit for
reasons unassociated with the application, the applicant had
ceased executing
contracts associated with purchase of time share interests and thus it need not
consider whether there was any risk
of future non-compliance.
<P>

<b>Potential damage</b>
<P>

60  	Apropos the question of exposure of the debtors to potential
damage, the Tribunal accepted that except in the case of the Allport
and Reeves
matters, there was no actual loss or damage.  The Allports were denied the
opportunity to withdraw and the Mr. Reeves
was denied his right of "shopping
around" for the best possible loan.  The Tribunal concluded that debtors were
not always fully
apprised of the relevant information and that this would lead
to their belief that they were bound.  They would not have been concerned
to
seek to exercise their lawful rights, therefore, in the light of the statements
made on the contracts that they were bound by
it and the subsequent receipt of
the repayment instalment book and copies of the contract.  Thus, although the
weight of affidavit
evidence did not specify other actual loss or damage, the
Tribunal held that it did not follow from the absence of such evidence
that
some such similar loss or damage to that suffered under the Allport and Reeves
contracts was not a possible, or even likely,
consequence of any of the
contraventions.  Indeed, the Tribunal concluded:-
<P>

"In the light of these circumstances, the potential for loss or damage to the
respondents is considered to be a possibility."
<P>

61  	The Tribunal took into account the applicant's estimated
expenses associated with the application of approximately "$250,000".
 It
concluded there should be no penalty in respect of the two re-financing
contracts on the basis that any contravention there involved
of s.36(2)(c)
would be no more than a consequence of the contravention under s.36(1) in the
prior contract.
<P>

<b>The extent of the penalty</b>
<P>

62  	In determining that the credit charge might be restored to the
extent of 82%, the Tribunal first held that the circumstances
were sufficiently
serious to warrant a penalty and the effect of the order which it proposed to
make would be that for any debtor
who had discharged his or her contract ahead
of time, his or her liability in respect of the credit charge can be no greater
than
the amount of the "accrued credit charge" within the meaning of that
expression under the Act.  It had regard to its view that the
task of the
Tribunal was to impose an appropriate sanction, not only in respect of past
conduct, but designed to secure appropriate
conduct on the part of the credit
provider in the future, citing <b>Bing Lee </b>and referring to the concepts of
punishment, deterrence (specific and general) and rehabilitation.
<P>

63  	It concluded, in the light of the applicant having ceased
executing time share agreements, and having been placed in voluntary
liquidation, that no portion of the sanction be directed towards the
applicant's future rehabilitation.  In the absence of evidence
that costs
associated with possible refunds under the contract would cause administrative
difficulties, it concluded that it would
not be unreasonable to require the
applicant to adjust individual accounts to provide refunds.
<P>

64  	Before me there was evidence of the consequence of the
Tribunal's order.:-
<P>

"10.	The plaintiff estimated that the accrued credit charges as at the date of
the hearing of the application before the first defendant
under the affected
contracts in respect of which relief was sought in the application totalled
$930,965.46.  The plaintiff is currently
unable, however, to estimate the
quantum of the 'penalty' imposed by the first defendant as that is dependent
upon the question of
the proper construction of the order made by the first
defendant.  If the intention of the order is to require the plaintiff to
recalculate
the credit charge payable under each contract at the reduced rate
and on the assumption that all payments by the relevant borrower
 under his or
her contract are made on the day and in the amounts as agreed, this calculation
will take some time but the plaintiff
expects that it will be an amount which
will be in excess of $140,000."  (Affidavit of Ronald Edward Buxton, sworn 24
January 1996)
<P>

65  	That evidence was, of course, not before the Tribunal but it may
be accepted that the Tribunal's order might have been expected
to produce a
consequence that could have been calculated on what was before the Tribunal as
in that range.
<P>

66  	It is the perceived loss of that sum or the proper proportion of
it and the attendant costs of defining it which has generated
this appeal.
<P>

<b>Grounds of appeal</b>
<P>

67  	The plaintiff has brought the appeal on nine grounds each of
which is asserted to involve the erroneous decision of questions
with respect
to matters of law decided by the chairman in the proceedings before the
Tribunal, the decision of the Tribunal on such
a matter being the decision of
the chairman:-
<P>

(1)	in making the same form of order with respect to each of the borrower's
contracts without attempting to distinguish between
contracts involving
different contraventions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>;
<P>

(2)	making orders relieving the plaintiff in part from the consequences of
contraventions of the same nature but on the basis of
increasing the amount of
credit charged by applying an annual percentage rate the equivalent of 82% of
the rate stated in the contract,
so that, so it is contended, the quantum of
the penalty varies in an individual case according to the amount of the credit
charge
and the time of the contract, which are not material to the relevant
contraventions.
<P>

68  	It is further contended that the order is uncertain in operation
and effect and does not constitute a proper or lawful exercise
of the power
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.85</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>, in that:-
<P>

(1)	The penalty was not tailored to fit the particular case;
<P>

(2)	the penalty was not duly proportionate to the relevant conduct of the
plaintiff;
<P>

(3)	the tribunal did not give weight or any sufficient weight to the fact that
there was no evidence any borrowers sustained loss
or damage or was likely to
or could have suffered loss or damage by reason of the contraventions;
<P>

(4)	did not limit its consideration to circumstances to relevant circumstances
and, in particular, had regard to conduct, possible
loss and damage which did
not arise or result from the contraventions;
<P>

(5)	did not limit itself or give appropriate weight to the considerations
courts had ordinarily treated as relevant in such circumstances;
<P>

(6)	erred in holding that a belief on a part of the borrowers that they were
bound to their contracts would lead to possible or
likely loss or damage as a
consequence of the contravention and that there was possible or likely damage
as a consequence of the
contravention;
<P>

(7)	further, that the first defendant erred in determining it would not be
unreasonable to require the plaintiff to adjust the accounts
of the borrowers
or to refund and failed to take into account the difficulties experienced by
the plaintiff in locating and serving
the borrowers such that it would be
futile to attempt to adjust the accounts and make refunds to borrowers whose
whereabouts can't
be located.
<P>

69  	At the hearing, the parties relied upon extensive written
submissions.  In an attempt to relate its arguments to the grounds,
the
plaintiff filed a concordance of contended errors of law to its written
submissions.  It reduced the contended errors to four
categories which were not
mutually exclusive.  Those categories are set out as follows.  I take their
definition from the plaintiff's
written submissions:-
<P>

"<b>Class 1</b>	Incorrect definition of the question of fact to be answered in
accordance with the law  governing the controversy;  misapprehending
the matter
of which the Tribunal had to be satisfied in reaching its decision.
<P>

<b>Class 2</b>	Making findings of fact which entirely lack a foundation in the
evidence.
<P>

<b>Class 3</b>	Taking into account irrelevant considerations, in the face of
the statutory requirement to consider <b>relevant circumstances</b>.
<P>

<b>Class 4</b>	Miscarriage of discretion on question of penalty which embraces
(a) misjudgment of the culpability or seriousness of the contravention
and of
the precise extent by which there has been deviation from the obligations
imposed by the Act;  (b) ignoring differences and
fixing a common rule;  (c)
imposing a penalty manifestly excessive;  (d) not tailoring the penalty to fit
the requirements of the
particular case;  and (e) failing to appreciate that
the circumstances enlivened s.86B."
<P>

70  	The generality and overlapping nature of the propositions put
did not produce a clarity of argument.
<P>

<b>Further evidence on inconsistency</b>
<P>

71  	During the extensive oral submission that occurred at the
hearing of this matter, the plaintiff sought to file and rely upon
the
affidavit of Stephen Tudjman sworn 30 June 1998, which affidavit referred to
applications having been brought in Victoria, the
ACT and Queensland in respect
to contracts affected by similar contraventions and in respect of which similar
legislation to the
New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act</a>
existed as part of the a nationwide legislative scheme.  The affidavit referred
to the orders made in respect of those contraventions
in each such State and
Territory and it was submitted that although this evidence had, in part, not
been before the Commercial Tribunal,
the material was admissible in this court,
at least so far as it might be useful in helping to define an appropriate range
of penalty
and in order to illustrate as to those decisions that preceded the
determination of the Tribunal that the Tribunal had erred by failing
to have
regard to them by using its power to inform itself under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19(9)</a> or by failing
to adopt a relevant decision or judgment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.24(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial
Tribunal Act</a>.
<P>

72  	The whole of the material was said to be admissible on various
bases including the principles of comity and to enable a comparison
to be made
to ascertain whether the penalty imposed in the present case is so out of
reasonable proportion as to be disparate or
to be in legal error in itself.
<P>

73  	In arguing against the admissibility of the material, reliance
was placed by the second defendant upon the judgment of Lockhart,
J. in
<b>Attorney-General (Northern Territory) v. Minister for Aboriginal Affairs</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/159.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 159</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2023%20FCR%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 23 FCR 536</a> at 539-540 for the proposition that on an appeal for error of
law, as here under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5)</a>, the trend of judicial opinion would confine the
evidence before the court to that before the decision maker.
<P>

74  	The extensive written submission on the question refers to
significant differences between the present decision of the Tribunal
and the
decisions of the other Tribunals, noting, in particular in detail, different
findings including findings as to gravity by
the New South Wales Tribunal from
those made by the Credit Tribunal of Victoria.  It was also noted that the ACT
and Queensland decisions
arose in a substantially different context as the ACT
decision was in fact a consent order made after the New South Wales Tribunal
had reserved its judgment, and was not brought by the plaintiff to the New
South Wales Tribunal's attention and the Queensland order
was made long after
the New South Wales Tribunal published its decision.  Further, the application
in Queensland was made on the
basis the contraventions were minor errors and
that was on an entirely different legal basis to that made in the present
proceedings.
<P>

75  	It is contended that the reliance on the parity or unreasonable
disproportion principle, therefore as and between these decisions
and that in
the instant case, is mistaken;  that the principle does not support the
proposition that a comparison can be made between
those other decisions and
this.  But to so conclude, requires my consideration of the material.
<P>

76  	In my view, I may refer to the material for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the relevant decision is so out of conformity
with some
established range or context as to be in legal error.  It is material which,
had it been available, the Tribunal might
have referred, and might have, had it
wished to do so, adopted in whole or in part (s.24).
<P>

77  	The affidavit of Mr. Tudjman provides evidence of that material.
Rather than consider the materials as evidence in the strict
sense, I consider
that it is proper to have regard to these decisions in examining the conformity
of this decision to some general
pattern particularly because of the role
required of the Tribunal in the administration of a national legislative scheme
which required
it, in the exercise of its discretion in furtherance of the
objects of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a> and its functions under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act</a>,
to have regard to and conform with matters of general policy and guidelines of
national application:  see Kirby, P. in <b>Canham </b>(supra) and Cole, AJA. in
<b>ANZ Banking Group Limited v. Director General of the Department of Fair
Trading &amp; Anor</b> (supra).
<P>

78  	Spigelman, CJ. in <b>Regina v. Henry, Barber, Tran, Silver,
Tsoukatos, Kyroglou &amp; Jenkins</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/111.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 111</a> at paras.49-85, in the
particular context of a statutory restriction on an appellate court receiving
evidence that had not been available
below, examined the utility on appeal of
material analogous to that sought to be relied on here in the analogous case of
ascertaining
the appropriate range of sentence for particular crimes.  Legal
error in the exercise of discretion was there also the contended
foundation for
the appeal.
<P>

<b>Manifestly excessive penalty</b>
<P>

79  	Similarly, I am of the view that I might have regard to this
material in order to ascertain whether, considered in the context
of the
policies applied by the Tribunal appropriately and considering the approaches
and orders made by the interstate Tribunals,
the decision in the instant case
can be said to be outside the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion:
see <b>House v. The King</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55 CLR 499</a>, insofar as the approach in the
instant case can be seen in the light of those materials to be so
disproportionate or disparate from
the approaches taken by the other tribunals
that error can be inferred.
<P>

80  	The argument that is put is that these materials will show that
the ultimate decisions was unreasonable in the <b>Wednesbury</b> sense as
showing there was an "unreasonable disproportion":  see <b>Regina v. Geddes</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1936/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] NSWStRp 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2036%20SR%28NSW%29%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 36 SR(NSW) 554</a> at 556.  It was submitted that the parity principle as
applied in sentencing is to be and has been applied in the context of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a> in <b>Canham </b>(supra) at 267 where Kirby, P. cited the
observations of Mason, J. in <b>Lowe v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 606</a> at
610.
<P>

81  	I emphasise at this point that although I am having regard to
the material contained therein for the purpose of evaluating
the submissions as
to unreasonableness, disproportion or disparity, I am cognisant of the
differences between the present case and
those referred to in the materials
referred to in paragraphs 3-12 of the Director General's further submission in
reply and of the
submissions contained therein as to the nature of the appeal
in these proceedings to which I will turn later.  I am particularly
aware of
the submissions contained in paragraph 12, that in any event these decisions do
not show such disparity or unreasonableness
as to amount to error in the
exercise of the discretion.
<P>

82  	It is not the case that a mere disparity will show an error of
law.  Further, it is not the case that a mere difference in
result will show a
disparity.  Much less is it the case that a difference in result capable of
being explained in the way the second
defendant has referred to in its written
submissions here, will show any error of law in the exercise of discretion to
which, on
appeal, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5)</a> would apply or any unreasonableness, disparity or
disproportion such that an implicit error of law may be said to underlie the
result.
 Whilst I am of the view that I may have regard to the material, as
will be seen, I do not consider that the materials make out any
legal error as
contended for.  I am strongly of this view when I have regard to what the Court
of Appeal judgments in <b>Canham</b> (supra) held concerning the 25% penalty
for the common error there discussed and the examination of background
circumstances as underlying
the gravity of the contravention.
<P>

<b>The nature of the appeal</b>
<P>

83  	I turn then to the nature of the appeal to this court.  I have
earlier referred to the difficulties I have with the form of
the statutory
appeal provision.  It has been held that the appeal is limited to questions of
pure law:  see amongst other cases <b>Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v.
Murphy &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20ASC%2055%2d703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) ASC  55-703</a> at 58,349;  <b>Australian
Societies Group Financial Services (NSW) Limited v. Bogan &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20ASC%2055%2d938" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989)
ASC  55-938</a> at p.58,558 and <b>Canham &amp; Ors v. Australian Guarantee
Corporation Limited &amp; Ors, Pearce &amp; Anor v. Australian Guarantee
Corporation Limited
&amp; Ors, Porter v. Australian Guarantee Corporation
Limited &amp; Anor</b> (1990) ASC  55-984 at pp.58,924, 58,926 and
58,927.
<P>

84  	In reliance on these decisions and what was said by the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <b>Custom Credit Corporation
Limited v. Gray </b>(supra), it was submitted that the Tribunal in various
respects had erred in law in matters which, whilst not expressly decided, had
in the reasons for decision raised questions with respect to matters of law by
necessary implication and that was, in the light of
the case law, sufficient
for the statutory right of appeal to apply.
<P>

85  	In <b>Custom Credit Corporation Limited v. Commercial Tribunal
of New South Wales &amp; Ors</b> (1993) 32 NSWLR 489, albeit the court was
concerned more directly with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(3)</a>, Gleeson, CJ. at 492, pointed out:-
<P>

"3.	On of the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20</a> is to allocate decision-making functions.  Where
a chairman or deputy chairman sits with two lay members, it is the chairman or
deputy
chairman who alone has the capacity to decide questions of procedure and
questions of law.  It may or may not be appropriate or convenient
to decide
questions of law specifically and separately.  Sometimes decisions of such
questions may merely be implicit in the final
decision of the Tribunal.
However, it is clearly within the power of a chairman or deputy chairman, at
any stage of proceedings,
to identify a question of law and either decide it or
refer it to the Supreme Court."
<P>

86  	In that passage, his Honour has referred to matters of law
implicit in the decision and matters of law identified by the presiding
chairman or deputy chairman for reference to the Supreme Court for decision.
Appeal only lies against the decision of a question
with respect to a matter of
law by the chairman or deputy chairman.
<P>

87  	Under subsection (3), where a question arises, the chairman or
deputy chairman may decide the question or refer it.  Subsection
(5) appears to
relate to the case where the chairman or deputy chairman decides the question
and it is only in respect of that decision
that appeal to this court lies, not
in respect of the result in the proceedings as a whole.  Carruthers, J. in
<b>Canham </b>(supra) at 58,923, following the decision of Hunt, J. in
<b>Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v. Murphy &amp; Anor </b>(supra) which
adverted to similar doubts as to the ambit of the appeal provision as those
which affect me and his Honour's observations
in that regard, which were,
however, obiter, held that the section was intended only to embrace a pure
question of law, that it did
not include any question which merely contains
some legal element and that the provision is not broad enough to cover mixed
questions
of law and fact.
<P>

88  	His Honour, following the decision of Campbell, J. in
<b>Australian Societies Group Financial Services (NSW) Limited v. Bogan &amp;
Anor</b> (supra) held that the necessary decision need not necessarily appear
from an express ruling butt may be implied from the Tribunal's
reasons.  His
Honour said:-
<P>

"It would, of course, be desirable (if circumstances permitted) that where the
chairman or deputy chairman decides a question arising
with respect to a matter
of law, such decision be recorded.  However, although my mind has wavered on
the matter, where no such specific
record has been made, it is open to this
court to infer from the wording of the Tribunal's joint judgment, the question
or questions
with respect to a matter of law which were decided by the chairman
or deputy chairman."
<P>

89  	His Honour agreed that it was not a practical or sensible
interpretation of the provisions to require the chairman or deputy
chairman to
set out separate judgments on all questions of law as might be involved in a
matter by way of individual decisions separating
them out from questions of
fact and held:-
<P>

"It is, I think, appropriate that I express my views upon the meaning of the
phrase 'a question with respect to a matter of law'.
 Despite arguments both by
the plaintiffs and AGC to the contrary, it is my view the draftsman intended
this phrase to encompass
nothing more than a pure question of law.  I think it
was the legislature's intention that apart from vesting the chairman or deputy
chairman with the right and obligation either to decide a question of law
himself or to refer it to the Supreme Court, no distinction
was to be drawn
between the powers and functions of the respective members of the Tribunal.
Thus it could not have been the intention
of the legislature that the chairman
or deputy chairman solely decide other than pure questions of law.  Further, I
am confident
that the legislature would not have intended that the chairman or
deputy chairman have the right to refer anything other than a pure
question of
law to the Supreme Court for decision.  It would be quite inconsistent with
well established practice, as well as the
function of this court, for a mixed
question of fact and law to be referred to it for decision."
<P>

90  	The authorities therefore establish that it is with matters of
law only that this court is concerned.  The issue is not whether
there has been
a factual error in deciding on jurisdiction or whether there has been a factual
error in the exercise of the discretion
but whether, in proceedings before the
Tribunal, the chairman or a deputy chairman who has decided a question with
respect to a matter
of law, has fallen into legal error.  It is only that
question which the Supreme Court may deal with when deciding the question the
subject of an appeal under subsection (5).  The identification of that question
was the task from which Hunt, J. (as he then was)
was relieved in <b>Esanda
Finance Corporation Limited v. Murphy</b> (supra) by the availability of quasi
prerogative relief.  It is that decision of the Chairman on such a question
which may be affirmed
or not.  It is only in consequence of a decision to
affirm or not that the court may make such order in relation to the proceedings
as in its opinion should have been made by the Tribunal, ie., as consequential
upon a decision as to the correctness of the decision
of the chairman or deputy
chairman or to remit its decision on the question to the Tribunal and ordering
a re-hearing (see subsection
(6)).
<P>

91  	Thus, on such a re-hearing, subsection (7) requires that the
question with respect to the matter of law be clearly identified
to enable the
Tribunal to proceed in a manner not inconsistent with the decision of the
Supreme Court.
<P>

92  	It is contended here there have been factual errors of such a
character as to show error of law but to avail itself of this
right of appeal
rather than quasi-prerogative review, it is necessary for the plaintiff to
identify the error of law so as to give
this court's decision the precision
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20</a> requires.  To do this it is necessary to examine the nature of the
relevant Tribunal and what powers Parliament has conferred on
it.  In this case
an enquiry into the nature of the Tribunal is assisted by examining the nature
of the appeal.

<b>Difference from other appeal provisions</b>
<P>

93  	The provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20</a> have their counterpart in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/rta207/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.106</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/rta207/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">107</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/rta207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act</a>.  They are unlike almost any form of "appeal"
generally known.  They plainly are to be distinguished from provisions which
permit
of an appeal in the <b>Warren v. Coombs</b> sense as under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</a>, or an appeal on law as under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act</a>.  The
analogy is much closer with the reservation of a point of law under s.72 of the
Judiciary Act or the submission of questions
of law under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s5ae.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5AE</a> and s.<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s5a.html" class="autolink_findacts">5A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a>.  An appeal under such provisions requires the
identification of the legal matter for decision and assistance, if necessary,
to do
that from the parties during the hearing below.  It would permit the
parties and the chairman or deputy chairman presiding at the
Tribunal to have
regard to the materiality of the decision on a question of law for such
questions as might be the subject of an
appeal, ie., as might be in dispute
below, to be adequately defined for the purposes of appeal.  It would permit,
on appeal, the
grounds of appeal to be considered on their face and in the
light of the decision below as to whether they raised a pure question
of law
suitable for the decision of this court.  It would allow the exposure of
questions of fact and mixed fact and law and the
consideration in a particular
case of whether a question with respect to a matter of law might include such a
matter of fact or mixed
fact from which the relevant question of law could
profitably be winnowed out.
<P>

94  	The language employed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5)</a> is in marked contrast to
familiar provisions conferring a right of appeal on law and particularly having
regard to that contrast,
I am not satisfied that there is provided some form of
generalised administrative review by this court of the ultimate decision in
some general context of examining the legal principles applied expressly or
implicitly.  I consider it will at least be necessary
for a party to avail
itself of the appeal right afforded by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5)</a> to articulate a precise question
relating to a matter of law, to show how the decision of it, whether express or
implicit, was integral
to the conclusion and why that decision was wrong.
Usually, one would expect such a question to be raised and argued before the
Tribunal.
 The questions raised on this appeal by the asserted grounds of
appeal lack these qualities.
<P>

<b>Errors of jurisdictional fact and errors of law</b>
<P>

95  	Certain of the grounds appear to assert error of law by way of
jurisdictional error.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20(10)</a> provides:-
<P>

"For the purposes of this section, a reference to a matter of law includes a
reference to a matter relating to the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal and a matter
as to the admission or rejection of evidence."
<P>

96  	Thus, if although the full effect of such a provision is at the
least a matter for speculation, a question with respect to
a matter relating to
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal would be capable of founding an appeal under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20.</a>  In shorthand it could be said that error in respect of jurisdictional
matters is here error of law .
<P>

97  	Usually errors as to jurisdiction are also relevantly errors of
law.  Case law defines such errors.  In <b>Craig v. South Australia</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d95%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-95) 184 CLR 163</a>, the High Court, in discussing jurisdictional error in
the context of the examination of the applicability of certiorari to the
decision
of a subordinate court, referred to the well known passage in Lord
Reed's speech in <b>Anisminic Limited v. Foreign Compensation Commission</b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20AC%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 AC 147</a> at 171 in which in Lord Reed's catalogue of errors are included
a decision in bad faith, a decision which the Tribunal had no power
to make, a
failure to comply with the requirements of natural justice, a misconstruction
of the provisions giving power to act, so
as failing to deal with the question
remitted or deciding some question not remitted, refusal to take into account
something which
was required to be taken into account or basing the decision on
some matter which, under the provisions setting up the Tribunal,
it had no
right to take into account.  The High Court continued (at p.179):-
<P>

"If such an administrative tribunal falls into an error of law which causes it
to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong
question, to ignore relevant
material, to rely on irrelevant material, or, at least in some circumstances,
to make an erroneous finding
or to reach a mistaken conclusion, and the
Tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected, it
exceeds its
authority or powers."
<P>

98  	In <b>Lovell v. Lovell</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1950/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2081%20CLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 81 CLR 513</a>, in the
consideration by the justices of the High Court of the ambit of appeal legally
permissible from a discretionary judgment,
Kitto, J. drew the distinction
between such errors as might found an appeal from the exercise of discretion
and mistakes of law (at
532), referring at 533 to the speech of Lord Atkin in
<b>Evans v. Bartlam</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%20AC%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] AC 473</a> at 481.  That decision re-emphasised the
respect due to an original exercise of discretion in the absence of error:  see
<b>House</b> (supra at 504-505).
<P>

99  	It is on the error of law rather than what consequent errors are
caused that it is necessary to focus to apply <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5).</a>
<P>

100  	To detect what jurisdictional matters may be important the
general law should be shortly considered.
<P>

101  	It is unusual for a tribunal to have conferred on it authority
either to determine authoritatively questions of law or to
make an order or
decision otherwise than in accordance with the law:  see <b>Craig</b> (supra at
179).  However, a presumption that a Tribunal does not have that power must
yield to the language of the Parliament and
the terms of the legislation under
which the Tribunal is set up:  see <b>Craig</b> (supra at 179).
<P>

102  	Where, as here, an appeal is provided for by the statute and
that appeal is limited as has so far been held, to an appeal
on a pure question
of law and, in my view, to a pure question of law the decision of which affects
the result below materially, which
question, whether expressly or implicitly
was decided below, then it would appear that Parliament has conferred upon the
Tribunal
the authority to decide questions of law as well as questions of fact
involved in matters which it has jurisdiction to determine:
 see <b>Craig</b>
(supra at 179-180).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20(10)</a> clearly evidences that this is such a
Tribunal.  In such a case, the observations of the High Court at 180 are of
significance:-
<P>

"Demonstrable mistake in the identification of such issues or the formulation
of such questions will commonly involve error of law
which may, if an appeal is
available and is pursued, be corrected by an appellate court ..."
<P>

103  	These remarks are applicable to an appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20.</a>
<P>

104  	But in the absence of such an error, appeal by this means will
be unavailable.
<P>

105  	Although the Director-General accepts the plaintiff's
submissions as to the nature of the appeal right conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(5)</a> in
respect of the various errors contended for, it submits either that the
Tribunal did not fall into error or that the relevant
error was not an error of
law.  It contends that no error of law arises if the Tribunal, absent
jurisdictional error merely made
a wrong finding of fact or wrongly found some
immaterial matter (<b>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v. Bond</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170
CLR 321</a> at 355-356 per Mason, CJ.) or if it applied a reasonably appropriate
matter of opinion or policy, particularly as identified as a
guide to serve the
object of the discretion as on appeal as in, eg., <b>Canham</b> (supra).  (See
the discussion of the application of appropriate policy as defined as relevant
to the exercise of discretion in the
analogous context of sentencing by
Spigelman, CJ. in <b>Henry &amp; Ors</b> (supra) at paras.13 and following.)
<P>

106  	So much may be accepted.  Within the limits set by the Act, and
the decided authorities, it will be for the Tribunal to identify
and apply
appropriate policy, to decide what is relevant and what is irrelevant, to
evaluate and weigh the circumstances and consider
them in context.  There is
confided in the Tribunal a jurisdiction that involves the exercise of a
normative judgment.  Within the
ambit of the functions it is required to
perform and the requirements imposed upon it by the Act, the making of such a
judgment is
for it.  <b>Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v.
Teo</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2057%20FCR%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 57 FCR 194</a> at 199G, 201B.  The jurisdiction is wide and includes
the finding of jurisdictional facts.  Here, the relevant body is not a court
but a specialist Tribunal to which the legislature has confided a statutorily
unrestricted discretion which therefore is limited
only by the implications
necessary from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the legislation (in
this case the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act</a>).  For the limits on
the court's power to intervene, see the discussion by Mason, J. (as he then
was) in <b>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v. Peko Wallsend Limited</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%2d87%29%20162%20CLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986-87) 162 CLR 24</a> at 39-42, in particular at 40:-
<P>

"(d)	The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative
discretion must constantly be borne in mind.  It is
not the function of the
court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by
exercising a discretion which the legislature
has vested in the administrator.
Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision
made within those boundaries
cannot be impugned:  <b>Wednesbury Corporation</b>
[1948] 1 KB at 228."
<P>

107  	The appeal here is from a Tribunal which is entrusted with the
task of ensuring stringent compliance with legislation as part
of a national
scheme and which legislation involves the regulation of a substantial portion
of the economic life of the nation. 
In that regard it will be open to the
Tribunal to have regard to matters of policy and to take into account matters
which will peculiarly
fall within the knowledge it might acquire appropriately
and have regard to under the provisions of the Act and in the administration
and decision of the matters coming before it.  To a very great extent,
Parliament has confided in the Tribunal the task of itself
defining the ambit
of relevance in a given case.  It is particularly entrusted with the task of
assessing the gravity of any contravention
in the context of the role the
Tribunal plays in the administration of the national credit regulating scheme.
It will be for the
Tribunal to consider such facts as are necessary and to
decide what factors it will consider amongst those which it is permissible
but
not obligatory to consider (<b>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v. Peko Wallsend
Limited</b> (supra) at 39-42).  The necessary matters are stipulated by the Act
or essential properly to comply with it.  The permissible matters
are those
within the proper ambit of what might reasonably be considered conducive to the
achievement of the statutory object.
<P>

108  	I conclude that error of law would only be for jurisdictional
error from decisions turning on a wrongful decision as to the
first class of
those matters.  Discretionary judgment would not involve error of law unless
there is error of law as defined in the
well-known passage from <b>House</b>
(supra) at 504-505.  Further, it appears to me that under the legislation, it
is important to discriminate between matters which
might have founded an appeal
against the exercise of a discretionary judgment to an appellate court
entrusted with a wide appellate
jurisdiction not limited to appeals on pure
questions of law and those matters which would permit appeals on questions
arising with
respect to matters of law in the proceedings.  Thus here, I am not
concerned with any submission of breach of natural justice or
jurisdictional
error in the sense referred to in <b>Anisminic Limited</b> (supra) or in
<b>Craig</b> (supra) unless also that error amounts to an erroneous decision
with respect to a matter of law arising in the proceedings within
the ambit
covered by s.20(5) and s.20(10).  Given that the decision may be implicit
rather than express and isolated, and that it
must be taken to be the decision
of the chairman or deputy chairman, albeit it will underlie the decision of the
Tribunal, nonetheless,
any error of this kind must be capable of being clearly
identified as a legal error for the reasons which I have given.
<P>

109  	Many of the plaintiff's contentions as to error in this appeal
rely upon implicit or inferred errors not identified before
the Tribunal, or
indeed as far as can be seen from the three volumes of appeal papers, often not
identified in argument or in the
decision as questions of law before the
presiding deputy chairman or the Tribunal as a whole.  As to a great many of
the submissions
now made by the plaintiff as to errors to which it is contended
s.20(5) would go, it is notable upon analysis that those errors are
either not
in respect of pure matters of law or before me those errors were not so defined
as to isolate the relevant question of
law for decision.
<P>

110  	This, as I have demonstrated, is of some considerable
importance and not only since it is necessary to be able to ascertain
what
decision should have been made by the Tribunal on the relevant question in the
opinion of this court so that an appropriate
order might be made under s.6(a)
or alternatively so that the decision on the question might be remitted to the
Tribunal for a re-hearing
of the proceedings.  But also since it would be
necessary at the least that the decision of law in question be material to the
conclusion.
 The section is not so wide as to permit a re-agitation of all
legal questions that might have been before the Tribunal on the basis
that the
plaintiff is aggrieved with the ultimate decision.  
<P>

111  	Nonetheless, and having regard to the submissions of the
parties, whilst I might have been of the view, unassisted by authority,
that it
was necessary for the decision of the relevant question below to be identified
below or at least clearly before me,.  I will
accept at least until this
question has been otherwise examined and the court assisted by full argument,
that it is open to the plaintiff
to proceed on the basis that implicit
questions of law have been erroneously decided against it.  If, however, I am
unable with the
assistance of the submissions of the parties, sufficiently to
isolate the questions of law from matters of fact so as to be able
to detect
error, if it existed, in the decision of the pure question of law, it would, as
I understand the authorities, be incumbent
upon me to reject the suggested
submission of error.
<P>

<b>The suggested errors</b>
<P>

112  	In the light of that discussion, I can deal shortly with some
of the grounds of appeal.  Certain of the grounds may be dealt
with together,
in particular those grounds I refer to in paragraphs 67 and 68 above, insofar
as they refer to the Tribunal making
the same form of order in relation to each
contract, the fixing of a penalty at a percentage rate, as is contends the
penalty was
not tailored to the particular case, not duly proportionate to the
relevant conduct and inappropriately reflective of an actual or
possible loss
and damage held to flow from the contravention.  Except for the issue relating
to the appropriate resort to an alternative
to refund as provided by s.86B,
these embrace the matters referred to as within class four in the
concordance.
<P>

113  	That last matter does not appear to have been raised below in
some such form as would satisfactorily enable the review of
the determination
of the Tribunal.  The Tribunal determined that the applicant did not present
any evidence that costs associated
with possible refunds would cause
difficulty.  On that basis, it considered that it would not be unreasonable to
require the adjustment
of individual accounts.  No doubt for that reason, but
in any event, it did not express any finding of fact sufficient to enliven
its
power to give a direction under s.86B(3), and the finding of fact it did make
would speak against its being satisfied of the
necessary matters.
<P>

114  	It is only in the rarest case that an error of law might arise
where the statute confides in a Tribunal a power conditioned
upon it reaching
satisfaction as to a state of fact and where neither that fact has been found
nor the facts necessary for such satisfaction.
 Here, it is simply not open to
seek to isolate a decision on a question with respect to a matter of law on
which the plaintiff might
succeed.  I am satisfied there is no substance in
this ground.
<P>

115  	As to the grounds that challenge the form of order to which I
have earlier referred, for the reasons I have given in relation
to the
admission of the additional material and in discussing the parity question, I
do not consider that it is open to argue that
here in the circumstances found,
the resultant penalty remaining after the increase of the debtor's liabilities
was manifestly excessive
or disparate.  I do not consider the adopting of a
percentage basis for penalty as legal error.  Such a mode of fixing penalty has
been referred to often in the case law without criticism.  There is nothing
inherently objectionable about it.
<P>

116  	For the reasons given by Mathews, J. which I will turn to
discuss shortly and those given by Kirby, P. in <b>Canham</b> (supra), in
particular which, in this respect amplify the principles applied, albeit
without detailed consideration in a number of
the cases, I consider that it is
clear that the surrounding circumstances as well as the precise contravention
need to be considered
for the purpose of ascertaining to what extent the
liability of the debtors should be increased and the concomitant penalty on the
credit provider reduced. 
<P>

117  	Submissions were made to me not unlike those put to Mathews, J.
and considered by her in <b>Walter Pugh v. Commissioner of Consumer Affairs</b>
(1988) 13 NSWLR 420 at 427 where her Honour condensed the individual
submissions there summarised and said as follows:-
<P>

"The essence of the plaintiff's complaint about these matters is that the
Tribunal took into account, in reaching its determination,
matters which were
not properly relevant to the exercise of its discretion under s.85.  To this
extent it says that the Tribunal
misconceived the nature and extent of its
discretion under that section (that being ground 3 in the Part 51A statement).
This resulted,
it says, from the Tribunal's erroneous construction of s.85
(that being ground 2(a)).  The matters complained of in para.2(b) represent
particular findings of the Tribunal, arising from its consideration of the
relevant provisions, which the plaintiff says were wrong
in law.
<P>

Thus it is that all these grounds of appeal can readily be encapsulated in the
single complaint that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation
of s.85 in that
it construed the section as requiring or authorising it to take account of
matters which were not properly relevant
to its discretion.  As a result of
this error, the plaintiff says that the Tribunal relied in its judgment upon
material which should
not properly have been considered by it.
<P>

The plaintiff's substantial complaint is that the Tribunal took account of the
interest rate invariably charged by the plaintiff,
and used this as a basis for
finding that the plaintiff should not be entitled to the relief which it
sought.  In the process it
considered mush irrelevant material, including the
debtors' understanding of the interest rate under the contracts, the practice
of other moneylenders, and even the statutory ceiling for interest rates in
Victoria.  All of this, the plaintiff says, was outside
the ambit of matters
which should properly have been considered under s.85.
<P>

As a necessary basis for the success of this argument, Mr. McDougall has urged
that the 'relevant circumstances' to be considered
by the Tribunal under
s.85(2) should be confined to matters relating to the contravention itself.  In
the circumstances of this case,
the Tribunal was perfectly entitled to explore
the plaintiff's conduct leading up to the contravention, and the effect of the
contravention
upon the affected debtors.  But it should not have paid any
regard to the interest rates charged under the contracts, that being
entirely
irrelevant to the contravention in question."
<P>

118  	After her Honour turned to consideration of the way in which
the contention had been put, she rejected it having analysed
it and concluding
at 429:-
<P>

"For his fundamental argument is that the Tribunal, in making its determination
under s.85(2)(c), is entitled only to consider matters
directly relating to the
contravention."
<P>

119  	In relation to contraventions or failures to comply with the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1984226/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Administration) Act 1984</a> in contrast to the consequences of a
contribution under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>, her Honour noted that the former provides
for a civil penalty whereby the debtor is not liable to pay either the
principal (amount
financed) or the credit charge and thus on an enquiry under
that Act the issue whether the contravention "ought reasonably to be
excused"
is relevant only to whether the debtor's liability to pay the amount financed
should be reinstated.  She assumes that on
such an enquiry there should be a
restricted ambit to considerations relating to the circumstances and
consequences of the contravention
itself and upon that assumption her Honour
describes a scheme which she descries under s.85(2)(a) and (b):-
<P>

"Having satisfied itself that there has been a contravention or failure to
comply with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca1984226/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit (Administration) Act</a>, the Tribunal must then determine
whether it ought reasonably to be excused.  This will involve a consideration
of matters directly
relating to the breach.  If it is satisfied that the
contravention ought reasonably to be excused, then it is bound to re-establish
the debtor's liability to pay the principal amount financed under the contract.
It still, however, retains a full discretion to make
orders in relation to the
credit charges.  To use the same discretion by that conferred by sub-clause (c)
in relation to contracts
which contravene the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act</a>.  It must follow from
this analysis that far from restricting the considerations available to the
Tribunal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.85(2)(c)</a>, the scheme the legislation requires the Tribunal
when determining whether to reinstate the whole or any part of the credit
charge,
to consider matters which go beyond the circumstances relating to the
breach itself.  For even if the breach is one which 'ought
reasonably to be
excused', nevertheless the Tribunal retains, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.85(2)(a)(i)</a>, (b)(i)  an
unfettered discretion to reinstate the whole or any part of the credit
charge."
<P>

120  	That case involved what her Honour held to be many
contraventions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.36</a> which were regarded by the Tribunal quite rightly, in
her view, in a very serious light.  There were said to be constant breaches
caused by the failure of the plaintiff's staff to appreciate the omission or
the significance of the omission of relevant material
from being included on
the standard form of contract asserted to have been by reason of a lack of
space arising from a printer's
error.  The breaches were said, in turn, to have
resulted from inadequate staff training as to the obligations imposed upon
credit
providers and revealing a blatant disregard of the importance of
attention to obligations under the Act.  Her Honour concluded that
the
appreciation by the Tribunal of these matters was entirely appropriate, fair
and reasonable and that in the circumstances, the
increase of the liability of
the debtors from nil to 29% where small, short term loans such as those
provided by the plaintiff were
commonly subject to interest rates of between
19% and 35% was, in a sense, generous to the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

121  	Considering the principles enunciated by her Honour and those
enunciated in <b>Canham</b> (supra) to which I have referred, in my view it was
plainly open to and correct for the Tribunal to find the facts and nature of
the contravention, the surrounding circumstances, the practices of the
plaintiff and to characterise the errors of the plaintiff
as appropriately seen
by the Tribunal in the context of its application of the legislation and its
underlying policies.  To do so
was not to ask the wrong question, to consider
irrelevant matters or to misapprehend what necessary matters should be
considered.
<P>

122  	It was open, in my view, for the Tribunal to conclude that the
plaintiff's errors were serious, that in some respects the
contraventions
continued for seven years with the knowledge of members of senior management,
that the errors occurred because of
inappropriate practices and that it became
apparent that the plaintiff either fundamentally misunderstood or disregarded
its responsibilities
under the Act.  These were matters that the plaintiff
contended were irrelevant.  It was not only open to the Tribunal to consider
that they were relevant but, in my view, these were matters of fact and not
jurisdictional fact.  It was also open to the Tribunal
in performing its
evaluative function to conclude that the errors were serious in the light of
what it identified as the errors.
 The plaintiff came to the Tribunal on an "in
globo" approach seeking that such errors as the Tribunal identified should be
the subject
of relief.  The Tribunal then identified the errors available on
the evidence.  It made in that respect findings of fact.
<P>

123  	Similarly, it was open to the Tribunal to conclude, putting
aside the matter of Allport, there was in each case involving
the primary
error, potential or possible loss or damage, ie., that those who might have
come to deal with the plaintiff would have
been exposed by its practices to
potential loss or damage against which the legislation had set its face.
Clearly, the effect of
the omission of E4 and E5 in the contract was
significant both in the causal chain which led to the relevant error occurring
and
in the prejudice that those omissions occasioned to debtors.  Potential
loss or damage is clearly relevant:  see <b>Walter Pugh</b> (supra) at 427C.
<P>

124  	The attribution to the practices of the plaintiff and the
various errors identified of potential loss or cause is a matter
of fact as are
most matters of causation:  see <b>Royall v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172 CLR 378</a>
and <b>March v. E. &amp; M.H. Stramere Pty. Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506.</a>
<P>

125  	The suggestion that the Tribunal has failed to penalise the
true error and instead penalised other conduct, is to ignore the
way in which
the application was put before the Tribunal, the evidence before the Tribunal
and the ambit required of an enquiry by
the Tribunal under the Act.  The
finding that the potential loss or damage lay in the acceptance of the contract
by conduct so that
a debtors might not have availed themselves of their
contractual or statutory rights to withdraw, is a finding that the parties
sought
to be protected by the legislation had been, by the practices of the
plaintiff, deprived of that protection.
<P>

126  	As was submitted on behalf of the second defendant, the primary
error was a failure to have the entire contract between the
plaintiff and the
relevant debtor signed in writing by that debtor.  It was not a failure on the
part of the plaintiff to have the
borrower re-sign.  Such a course would merely
be an attempt to rectify the basic error.  The Tribunal was entitled to find
what were
the contraventions and act on its findings.  It found the fault to be
as the second defendant submitted.  That does not evidence
any legal error.
<P>

127  	It is not necessary for me to examine precisely the accuracy
and correctness of the Tribunal's other challenged findings of
fact.  For the
reasons I have given, the Tribunal was entitled to regard those matters as
relevant.  They have not been demonstrated
to me to be irrelevant.  Where such
findings of fact could not give rise to legal error, the Tribunal is entitled
to make those findings
free from factual review for correctness.  The
discussion I undertook above shows that in finding so there was no erroneous
decision
of an identifiable question with respect to a matter of law.  The
Tribunal has confided in it the task of dealing with matters of
fact.  It is
only decisions on questions with respect to matters of law that may be reviewed
under the appeal provisions here in
question.  Unless those findings showed
legal error, they must stand.
<P>

128  	Notwithstanding my reading of the voluminous material, I found
no support in it for the assertions the Tribunal lacked evidentiary
support for
its findings or mistook the evidence.
<P>

129  	I consider the Tribunal is not limited in the imposition of
penalty to the consideration only of matters comprising contravention
which
enlivened the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  It is not only entitled but bound
within the policy and for the object and purposes
of the Act to consider those
matters to which Mathews, J. in <b>Walter Pugh</b> (supra) and Carruthers, J.
in <b>Canham</b> (supra, at first instance) and Kirby, P. on appeal, adverted.
None of the matters to which the plaintiff has referred are in my view
illustrative of some underlying error of law in the sense of being wrongly
decided jurisdictional facts, materially irrelevant or
otherwise indicative of
error of law in the <b>Craig</b> sense or to which s.20(10) applies.
<P>

130  	I find no error in the Tribunal's appreciation of the ambit of
its fact finding function, so far as might enable me to detect
any identifiable
legal error, nor do I find error in its findings as to matters of fact so far
as they have been challenged on this
appeal.  The Tribunal, in my view, did not
err either as to relevance, weight or the finding of any particular matter of
fact nor
did it misapprehend a matter of which it had to be satisfied or take
into account any irrelevant circumstance.  I do not consider
that the resultant
penalty imposed upon the plaintiff by reason of the partial relief afforded to
it by the Tribunal involved any
misjudgment of the culpability or seriousness
of the plaintiff's contraventions or was otherwise in error except in one
respect.
<P>

<b>One error</b>
<P>

131  	As I have said earlier, the Tribunal not only found the primary
error, but in addition, the further errors to which I have
already referred.
The Tribunal concluded there should be no penalty in respect of the two
re-financing contracts on the basis that
any such error in the re-financing was
merely consequential upon the earlier error.  However, when one turns to the
Tribunal's assessment
of penalty, the Tribunal does not discriminate between
contracts affected by the primary error alone and those affected by the further
errors to which I have referred.  It says:-
<P>

"It is the Tribunal's opinion that the contraventions and the relevant
circumstances in which they arose in terms of ss.85 and 86
are sufficiently
serious to warrant penalty.  It is the Tribunal's view that the liability of
the respondents should be increased
by the amount of the credit charge under
his or her contract determined by applying an annual percentage rate which is
equivalent
to 82% of the rate stated in the particular contract to the amount
financed on the contract over a period for which the amount of
finance or any
part thereof, remained owing and the Tribunal proposes to make orders
accordingly."
<P>

132  	The reference to no "penalty" in respect of the two
re-financing contracts would seem to indicate that the Tribunal, by this
blanket order, intended to deal with all other contracts and all other
contraventions or errors in such a fashion that it was not
intending to
disregard the contraventions and errors which occurred in addition to the
primary error.  This would seem to indicate
that the Tribunal would have
applied penalties to contracts unaffected by the additional contraventions and
errors of the same order
as that applied to contracts so affected.  The
Tribunal had held that the additional contraventions "will form part of the
Tribunal's
consideration of relevant circumstances" and particular held in
relation to six of the contracts which had the error of incorrect
addition of
the amount financed, that that error would be taken into account.  It is
submitted that the Tribunal thereby erred with
respect to a question of law,
that is, that the penalty should reflect the circumstances of each individual
contract at least insofar
as the contraventions differed from one contract or
class of contract to the other.
<P>

133  	I return to the decision of the Court of Appeal in
<b>Canham</b> (supra) in which appeals and summonses challenging determinations
by the Commercial Tribunal, being appeals pursuant to s.20(5),
similar to that
brought here had been dismissed at first instance by Carruthers, J.
<P>

134  	The relevant contraventions included a common contravention by
way of breach of s.36(1)(e) of the Act which required that
a loan contract
should include a statement of the annual percentage rate in accordance with
s.38.  As to such a contravention, similar
to the contraventions here found,
his Honour Kirby, P. said (at 249):-
<P>

"Pursuant to s.42 of the Act, such a failure to comply with s.36 resulted
(subject to s.85 of the Act) in relief to the debtor.
 By virtue of s.42, he or
she was 'not liable to pay to the credit provider the credit charge under the
contract'.  This relief was
the sanction devised by parliament to instil in
credit providers, such as AGC, stringent conformity with the obligations
imposed
by the Act including, relevantly, the obligation of disclosure under
s.36(1)(e).
<P>

Section 85 of the Act, however, permits the credit provider to apply to the
Tribunal for an order 'increasing the liability of the
debtor to the credit
provider'.  Section 86 permits the Tribunal, in a determination under s.85, to
make various determinations in
respect of specified regulated contracts,
including of a specified class, entered for a specified time.  Obviously, this
provision
was enacted out of recognition of the fact (as reflected in the
circumstances of this case) that common errors are likely to replicate
themselves in credit contracts until they come to notice and occasion
applications for relief against what would otherwise be the
drastic operation
of s.42.
<P>

It was for such an application for relief that AGC approached the Tribunal.  It
conceded the common error.  It proved various steps
which had been introduced
by way of training and instruction to avoid repetition.  The Tribunal, in all
of the cases made common
orders increasing the amount of the credit charge to
be paid by the various debtors to the equivalent of 75 per cent of the
percentage
rate disclosed in the contract.  It also ordered AGC to pay the
costs of the debtors, as taxed on the special scale of the District
Court.
<P>

If this had been all, Carruthers, J. and this court would not have been
troubled by the case.  Overall, the Tribunal's decision
appears a sensible
implementation of the policy of the Act.  AGC has brought to notice, on its own
initiative, the error which had
occurred.  It has sought relief.  It has been
provided with relief which effectively reinstated the contracts with the 298
debtors.
 But it was penalised as to 25 per cent of its charges by way of a
civil penalty designed to bring home to it the obligation to conform
strictly
with the requirements of the Act.  Doubtless this sanction, and a fear to avoid
its repetition, triggered the improvement
of procedures adopted by AGC as
described in the evidence."
<P>

135  	However, that case went on to deal with the problem that arose
where certain of the contraventions occasioned consequential
contraventions and
contraventions different in kind and additional to the common errors to which
his Honour had referred.  The complaints
of those errors had either been
dismissed as not constituting in law a contravention or, although accepted and
acknowledged as an
additional and different contravention, did not attract
different and additional penalties.
<P>

136  	In addition as to the consequential or "flow on"
contraventions, the Tribunal simply made an order similar to that which it
had
made for the common errors by adopting (with certain exceptions said not to be
relevant to those proceedings) a single determination
at the same rate.  
<P>

137  	Whilst his Honour noted that (at 265F):-
<P>

"The only limitation imposed by the Act upon the discretion conferred on the
Tribunal is that contained in s.85(3) of the Act."
<P>

138  	And that in circumstances where no particular losses were
found, s.85 invoked a very broad jurisdiction, he continued:-
<P>

"And s.86 contemplated that a general order could be made in respect of a
number of contracts where contravention of the Act had
been proved.  This was
no more than a recognition by the legislature of the likely commonality of
errors of practice, once they occur,
creeping into a large number of
transactions.
<P>

All of the foregoing matters may be conceded.  But it remains to be said that
the discretion provided by s.85 and s.86 is limited
by the general rule that it
must be exercised for the purpose for which power has been provided by
parliament to the donee of that
power.  It is to relieve a credit provider from
the prima facie rule established by s.42 of the Act.  That rule, in turn,
relieves
the debtor from the liability to pay the credit provider the credit
charge under the contract where, relevantly, the contract is
not in accordance
with s.36 of the Act.  This may be called a 'windfall' to the debtor by some.
But, viewed in another light, it
is a peculiar and special sanction which
parliament has designed for the high purposes which the reform of credit
legislation in
this country set out to achieve.  In my view it is a mistake to
draw a sharp distinction between 'windfalls' to the borrower and
'penalties'
upon the credit provider.  The former is but the means of achieving the latter.
No doubt it was hoped that, by this procedure,
borrowers would be educated in
their rights and provided with a stimulus to assert them.  Creditors, to avoid
such 'windfalls', would
be stimulated into strict compliance with the Act.  To
that extent, some windfall benefit to borrowers (if the effect of s.42 is
properly to be so described) is inevitable in penalties upon credit providers.
The one goes with the other.
<P>

Given that each individual contract is one governed by, and subject to, the Act
and may be subject to an application to the Tribunal,
it is not immediately
apparent why, where different defaults in compliance with the Act are
demonstrated, it is a proper exercise
of the discretion to relieve the credit
provider as s.85 and s.86 allow to ignore the differences and fix a common
rule.  Such common
rules are generally the business of legislators, not of
tribunals exercising quasi judicial powers. ...  Some of the matters required
by s.36(1) to be included in a credit sale contract are relatively
insignificant.  Thus a failure, in accordance with s.35(1)(a),
to insert the
date in the contract would appear trivial in at least most cases.  But the
failure to state the credit charge and the
amount finances (under s.35(1)(e))
is arguably more serious.  More serious still, as it seems to me, is the
failure to disclose that
a commission charge is payable (s.35(1)(i)).  There is
a multitude of matters that must be covered.  They are not all equally
important.
 Default in respect of them is not equally serious.  To ignore the
variety of defaults and to fix upon a common penalty whatever
the circumstances
of each contract is not prima facie acceptable, given the relief which s.42 of
the Act affords."
<P>

139  	His Honour went on to hold that (at 266):-
<P>

"That would undermine the scheme of providing for sanctions by way of civil
penalties and the self-evident gradation in the seriousness
of departures from
the requirements of the Act which calls for the calculus of penalty under s.85
and s.86 which is sensitive to
the actual defaults proved."
<P>

140  	Then (at 267):-
<P>

"Particularly if the discretion is one conferred by statute it is essential
that the decision-maker should exercise it in a way
that will achieve the
purposes of the statute.  Here, those purposes include the reflection, at least
in a general way, in the orders
made, relevant to the particular contracts
which will otherwise have the consequences for which s.42 of the Act provides,
viz, of
relieving orders that take into account the departures from the Act
shown in the particular cases."
<P>

141  	His Honour was of the view that manifest error would constitute
an error of law and that such orders as were there and are
here in question
"cannot fulfil the purposes for which the relieving power under s85 and s.86 of
the Act were afforded to the Tribunal
by parliament" (at p.268).  The other
members of the Court of Appeal shared those views.  I am bound by that decision
and consonant
with it conclude that here, too there has been error.
<P>

142  	I am therefore of the view that the Tribunal did fall into
legal error.  It would appear that at least insofar as the contracts
which only
contained the primary error were concerned, there has been decided a question
with respect to a matter of law erroneously
for the fixing of the appropriate
extent of relief.  It is not, however, possible to say in the absence of the
exposure of the Tribunal's
reasoning in more detail what the effect of the
error may have been.
<P>

143  	In the circumstances, the appropriate course I should take is
to remit the matter, ordering a re-hearing at least to the extent
that the
Tribunal should refix the penalty in accordance with what was laid down in
<b>Canham</b> (supra).  It is not appropriate that this court should itself
vary the penalty by making an order under s.20(6)(a) since the legislature
has
confided to the Tribunal the particular application of matters of policy and
normative judgment to which I have earlier referred.
<P>

144  	I therefore consider I should make the orders 1 and 5 sought in
the summons but, subject to hearing the parties, with such
appropriate
qualification as would be necessary to require the Tribunal to correct the
error.  I consider that the appeal should
be upheld to that extent and to that
extent only.  Although it has been unsuccessful on almost all the issues
involved in the proceedings,
the appellant in that respect succeeded.  A
question may arise as to costs and as to the form of appropriate orders.  If
so, I will
hear the parties on those matters in the event that agreement cannot
be reached.
