12322/98	<b>EXTERIOR HOME IMPROVEMENTS PTY LIMITED   v   BRUCE STANGER</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : This is an appeal by way of stated case from a decision of the
Local Court at Newcastle.  The respondent, Bruce Stanger,
took proceedings in
that court against the appellant, Exterior Home Improvements Pty Limited, after
the appellant had carried out
certain building work for him.  It appears from
the facts found by the learned magistrate as recorded in the stated case that
this
work involved the fixing of cladding to a residence at Merewether.  Hot
dipped galvanised nails were used by the appellant to secure
the cladding in
position, but in due course these nails rusted causing discolouration of the
cladding.  The respondent sued the appellant
seeking damages for breach of
contract, and in the alternative, he relied upon ss 52 and 53 of the <i>Trade
Practices Act</i> and ss 42 and 44 of the <i>Fair Trading Act</i>.  The
respondent was successful in the claim brought pursuant to s 52 of the <i>Trade
Practices Act</i> and the learned magistrate assessed damages in the sum of
$20,410.  He also awarded costs in favour of the respondent.
<P>

2	By reason of the operation of s 69 of the <i>Local Courts (Civil Claims)
Act</i>, 1970 and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i> appeal lies to this court in
these proceedings to correct error of law.
<P>

3	I have drawn upon the stated case already merely to outline the nature of the
claim that was before the Local Court, but I now
record in their entirety the
facts found by the learned magistrate as set out in that stated case:
<P>

	<i>"(i)	On 13 February 1991, the parties entered into a written
contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The relevant site of the contract is Merewether New South Wales,
adjacent to the Pacific Ocean.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	On 1 April 1991, the parties entered into a further contract for
additional work.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	On 17 April 1991, the Appellants wrote to the Respondent claiming a
cost for those Variations.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The Respondent abandoned the use of silicon bronze or Monell stainless
steel nails as they were too soft for the intended purpose.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The parties agreed to use hot dipped galvanised nails.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The parties discussed the use of hot dipped galvanised nails.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The evidence of the Respondent and of the Appellant's Agent was at
variance as to what was intended between the parties. 
I found as a fact that
the Respondent relied on the representation of the Appellant's servant or agent
that the hot dipped galvanised
nails were suitable for the purpose, in that
they would be long lasting and unaffected by rusting.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	A substantial number of those nails have rusted about the
heads.</i>
<P>

<i>	(x)	The decomposition of the nails is causing discolouration of the
cladding.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xi)	The decomposition of the nails is in part attributable to the
proximity of the Contract site to the Pacific Ocean."</i>
<P>

4	The magistrate stated the grounds of his decision as follows:
<P>

	<i>"(i)	The Respondent asserted that he had a conversation with the
Appellant's agent concerning the hot dipped galvanised nails in which
the
Appellant's agent said, `They [the Company] had never had a hassle with the hot
galvanised nails, they used them on their Nuline
range and fitted them all
around the water, they were made for softwood and were the best you can get'.
The Appellant's agent essentially
agreed with this conversation, but explained
that, `The best you can get' meant that they were `the highest quality
Australian made
nails available', owing to the amount of `gal used in the
manufacture process'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	I found as a fact that the Respondent wanted to use the best quality
fixing medium available.  I found as a fact that the Respondent
was assured by
the Appellant's agent that the hot dipped galvanised nails were quite
satisfactory for the job and that owing to this
representation by the
Appellant's agent to the Respondent, the Respondent abandoned any further
search or enquiry for an alternate
fixing medium.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	I found as a fact that the Respondent relied upon the representation
of the Appellant's agent in that they would be:-</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Suitable for the purpose;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Long lasting;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	Unaffected by rusting.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	I found as a fact, that a substantial number of those nails have
rusted about the head and that this has caused a loss to the
Respondent.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	I found as a fact that the representation was reckless or without due
care for the likely foreseeable consequences and was therefore
a false,
misleading and deceptive representation, and that it was conduct that brings
the matter within Section 52 of the Trade Practices
Act.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The Respondent contended, and I agreed with his contention, that the
only reasonable course to adopt would be to remove all
exterior cladding and
nails and to replace them with new cladding and new nails, such nails to be
stainless steel.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The Appellant contends that the Respondent has derived a benefit from
the quantum assessment by myself.  The Appellant contends
that the appropriate
quantum is:-</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	The cost of $3,500.00 to remove and replace the galvanised nails
or;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The sum of $9,247.00 which is the consideration paid by the Respondent
to the Appellant for the original contract."</i>
<P>

5	The issues posed for the determination of this Court were expressed in para 5
of the stated case as being four in number, namely
whether:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	In taking into account on a limited basis, matters not given in
evidence but to which I applied my knowledge as a citizen, homeowner,
part-time
renovator and maintenance person, this evidences a denial of natural justice to
the Appellant;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	It was open to me on the evidence to find as a fact that the
Appellant's conduct fell within Section 52 of the Trade Practices
Act
(Clth);</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	I have given judgement in the matter according to law;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	I have determined any quantum according to Authorities."</i>
<P>

6	Ms Winters, who appeared for the appellant before this Court, presented very
thoughtful written submissions and addressed the
Court on those submissions.
<P>

7	Ms Winters asked the Court to refer to the judgment of the magistrate for the
purposes of the appeal and Mr Montgomery expressed
no opposition to that
course.  Indeed, he referred to that judgment also.
<P>

8	Ms Winters succinctly argued three grounds on the appeal and I propose to
identify and to address those grounds in the order in
which they were raised by
counsel:
<P>

(i)	that the magistrate erred in law in the conclusion reached under the
<i>Trade Practices Act</i> (this is essentially the issue raised in para 5(b)
of the stated case);
<P>

(ii)	that the magistrate denied natural justice to the appellant by taking into
account his personal knowledge acquired otherwise
than from evidence introduced
at the hearing (this is essentially the issue raised in para 5(a) of the stated
case);
<P>

(iii)	that the magistrate erred in law in the assessment of damages (the issue
addressed in para 5(d).
<P>

	<b>Ground 1</b>
<P>

9	In arguing this ground Ms Winters took me to the text of the magistrate's
judgment at pp 4-5:
<P>

	<i>"The plaintiff says he had a conversation with Laughton, and Laughton
agrees, about using hot dipped galvanised nails.  There is a
difference between
the conversations each relates - the plaintiff says that Laughton's words to
him were that they'd never had a
hassle with hot dipped galvanised nails, they
used them on their Nuline range and fitted them all around the water, they were
made
for softwood and were the best you could get.  The plaintiff took this as
an implication that they were the best you could get for
the job at hand.
Laughton agrees basically with the conversation, but he says that what he said
was that the nails which they used
are the best you could get, meaning that
they were the highest quality Australian made nails available.  There is of
course a substantial
difference between the two meanings or
understandings."</i>
<P>

10	Ms Winters submitted that what the magistrate there stated could not be
treated as being <i>"misleading or deceptive"</i> or <i>"likely to mislead or
deceive"</i> for the purposes of s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>.  I was
referred to the decision of Smithers J in the Federal Court in <i>McWilliam's
Wines Pty Ltd v McDonald's System of Australia Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1980/159.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] FCA 159</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2049%20FLR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 49 FLR 455.</a>
That case concerned an advertisement used by the well known wine producer,
which advertisement displayed three two litre wine bottles
and a wine author
who said <i>"I call it the `Big Mac'"</i>.  The fast food retailer claimed that
this use of the words "<i>Big Mac"</i> contravened s 52 of the <i>Trade
Practices Act</i>.  It was held that it did not.  In this case Smithers J, with
whom the other members of the court agreed, whilst also expressing
their own
further reasons, said at 465:
<P>

	<i>"But were it not for the notion that there would be something improper in
the use of the words by any trader other than McDonald's,
or that in whatever
context they were used they could only refer to McDonald's hamburger, or for
some such notion in the mind of
a reader, the advertisement would not convey to
anybody the idea that it referred to or had anything to do with the hamburger.
Any
such initial impression would be destroyed by the context.  At most, all
that might occur would be surprise that McWilliam's were
using the same name
for its product as McDonald's was using for its.  At the most some people might
wonder whether McDonald's and
McWilliam's were acting together.  But even so
they would not be misled.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is a question therefore whether any misapprehension which has arisen is
a consequence of McWilliam's conduct or of other factors,
namely that the
advertisement was read and interpreted by reference to erroneous concepts and
assumptions.  And the further and critical
question is whether conduct
otherwise neither misleading nor deceptive acquires deceptive quality because
persons under the influence
of erroneous ideas draw erroneous inferences
concerning it."</i>
<P>

11	Ms Winters submitted, drawing on the above dicta, that in this case the
magistrate fell into error in not addressing <i>"the further and critical
question"</i> identified by Smithers J.
<P>

12	Nowhere, Ms Winters submitted, did the magistrate find that Mr Laughton, who
it appears was the appellant's works manager, expressly
stated that the hot
dipped galvanised nails were the best for the job at hand.
<P>

13	Ms Winters drew attention to later passages in the judgment which it was
submitted showed that the magistrate further misstated
the evidence.  The
following passage appears at pp 7-8:
<P>

	<i>"While the plaintiff abandoned the use of silicon bronze or monell
stainless steel nails largely as a result of his own inquiries
and experiments,
the evidence is that he was assured by Laughton that hot dipped galvanised
nails were quite satisfactory for the
job and as a result of that
representation the plaintiff abandoned any further search or inquiry that he,
the plaintiff, might have
made for a fixing medium made from any other
material."</i>
<P>

14	Then later at p 8 the magistrate referred to <i>"best nails for the job"</i>
in this passage:
<P>

	<i>"The fact is, as is proved by the evidence, that a substantial number of
these so called `best nails for the job' have rusted about
the heads..."</i>
<P>

15	Ms Winters submitted that in the above passages the assertion that Mr
Laughton had given an assurance that the nails were quite
satisfactory for the
job was not supported by evidence.  The further assertion that the nails were
the <i>"best nails for the job"</i> was not an assertion made by Mr Laughton in
those words.
<P>

16	Finally, on the first ground Ms Winters submitted that in the conclusion
expressed at the foot of p 8 the magistrate misdirected
himself as to the
language of s 52:
<P>

	<i>"I find as fact that the representation upon which the plaintiff ultimately
relied was made by the defendant's servant or agent either
recklessly or
without due care for the likely and foreseeable consequences, and was therefore
a false, misleading and deceptive representation,
and that as such it was
conduct which brings it within s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and the mirror
sections of the Fair Trading
Act."</i>
<P>

17	It was submitted for the appellant that the magistrate, having misconstrued
his primary findings of fact, went on to say in the
ultimate finding expressed
in the above passage <i>"that the representation upon which the plaintiff
ultimately relied was made by the defendant's servant or agent"</i>, and that
this revealed error of law.  Reference was made to <i>Azzopardi v Tasman UEB
Industries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 139</a> and in particular to the judgment of
Glass JA at 156.
<P>

18	I do not consider that the arguments advanced by Ms Winters on Ground 1 are
persuasive.  In the first place there is the obvious
difficulty for the
appellant that no appeal lies to this Court on issues of fact and this Court is
in essence being asked to review
the magistrate's findings of fact.
<P>

19	Further, it is plain from the judgment of the magistrate to which I have
been taken by both counsel that Mr Laughton's representations
were made in the
context of a contract involving the use of nails in an environment where the
building was exposed to salty air and
in which the respondent was known by the
appellant to be concerned about the hazard of rust.  That concern plainly fixed
upon the
type of nails to be used and the magistrate found that the appellant,
through Mr Laughton, recommended the use of the nails that
were used.
<P>

20	Whilst the test for s 52 as to whether conduct is misleading or deceptive is
an objective test (see <i>Taco Co. v Taco Bell Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1982/136.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] FCA 136</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20ATPR%2040%2d303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) ATPR
40-303)</a>, evidence that the respondent was misled was relevant and admissible,
so that it was appropriate, as the magistrate did, to record
the respondent's
perception of Mr Laughton's representation.  However it does not follow that
the magistrate did not make an objective
assessment of the relevant evidence
reflecting that assessment in his express findings.  In making his own
objective assessment it
was relevant for the magistrate to take account of the
whole of the conduct of the appellant and a reading of the judgment
demonstrates
that the magistrate did this.  The dicta of Gibbs CJ in
<i>Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Limited v Puxu Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%2d82%29%20149%20CLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981-82)
149 CLR 191</a> at 199 are in point:
<P>

	<i>"The conduct of a defendant must be viewed as a whole.  It would be wrong
to select some words or act, which, alone, would be likely
to mislead if those
words or acts, when viewed in their context, were not capable of misleading.
It is obvious that where the conduct
complained of consists of words it would
not be right to select some words only and to ignore others which provided the
context which
gave meaning to the particular words.  The same is true of
acts."</i>
<P>

21	It seems to me that on the findings of fact which the magistrate made he was
entitled to conclude as he did that the appellant's
conduct offended s 52 of
the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>.  The findings of fact afforded ample
justification for the finding that was ultimately expressed that the
appellant's behaviour
offended s 52.  The expressed finding of a
misrepresentation was a finding of a material element in an offence under s 52:
see <i>Taco Co</i> (supra) per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ at 43-751.
<P>

22	It may be that the findings of the magistrate would also establish a breach
of s 53 of the <i>Trade Practices Act, </i>but it does not seem to me having
regard to those findings made by the magistrate that the manner in which he
expressed his conclusion
that the appellant had breached s 52 warrants the
remission of the case to the Local Court for reconsideration.
<P>

	<b>Ground 2</b>
<P>

23	This ground refers to two passages in the judgment.  The first of these
appears at pp 6-7:
<P>

	<i>"While there was no evidence of it adduced in this matter, I am aware that
builders have methods of ensuring that thin nails do not
bend when driven into
hard timber which, while it slows down the speed of the job, is not as labour
intensive or slow as predrilling."</i>
<P>

24	The second passage is at p 9 of the judgment:
<P>

	<i>"One thing that I think it is appropriate to say at this stage is that the
defendant tried to mount a defence upon the ground that
the plaintiff had
failed to properly maintain the house in that he did not regularly wash the
walls with water, especially in those
areas where the rain did not reach.  I
know that many home owners do from time to time wash the walls of their houses,
particularly
in a salty or dusty atmosphere, but this as I understand it is
directed more to maintaining the aesthetic beauty of the finish than
as a
maintenance regime.  Apart from the fact that the plaintiff claims to have been
unaware of any requirement to so wash the walls,
I myself, in all the years I
have been a house owner, part time renovator, and maintenance man, have never
heard any suggestion that
any regular washing regime is necessary for the
proper maintenance of any wall built from any material whatsoever.  I accept,
however,
that this perceived need was related more to the maintenance of the
nails than the cladding itself.  I am aware that I have already
imported into
this matter information known to me from my experience as a person who has had
some involvement in building matters,
something which perhaps could be frowned
upon as it was not evidence given in the cause, but I cannot leave that
knowledge behind
and `act dumb' and ignore reality when I come onto the
Bench."</i>
<P>

25	Ms Winters very properly acknowledged that the first of the above passages
contained matter that did not impinge directly upon
the facts relevant to the
findings which the magistrate reached.  Nevertheless the complaint is made that
the appellant was deprived
of the opportunity of dealing with a matter that may
have affected the magistrate's assessment of the appellant's competence as a
builder.
<P>

26	The second matter, concerning washing the exterior, does not seem to have
had any relevance to the issues even though the magistrate
referred to the
defendant trying to mount a particular defence.  Ms Winters submitted that it
may have been relevant to mitigation
of damage, but mitigation was not pleaded
nor, Mr Montgomery assured this Court, was it an issue in the Local Court.
<P>

27	The circumstances in which the magistrate adverted to his own knowledge,
derived independently of the evidence in this case,
do not appear to have
impacted upon the decision ultimately reached.
<P>

28	Mr Montgomery referred to a number of decisions concerning the application
of personal knowledge by a tribunal.  In <i>Wetherall v Harrison</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20QB%20773" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1
QB 773</a> the decision at first instance was by a bench of three justices, one of
whom was a medical practitioner.  That member of the bench
expressed his
opinion on a medical issue that had arisen at the hearing and in relation to
which medical evidence had been given
before the court.  The opinion by the
member of the bench was expressed when the justices were deliberating.  It was
held by the
Court of Appeal that it was not improper for this to have been
done.  Lord Widgery CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed,
said
at 778:
<P>

	<i>"So I start with the proposition that it is not improper for a justice who
has special knowledge of the circumstances forming the
background to a
particular case to draw on that special knowledge in interpretation of the
evidence which he has heard.  I stress
that last sentence, because it would be
quite wrong if the justice went on, as it were, to give evidence to himself in
contradiction
of that which has been heard in court.  He is not there to give
evidence to himself, still more is he not there to give evidence
to other
justices; but that he can employ his basic knowledge in considering, weighing
up and assessing the evidence given before
the court is I think beyond
doubt.</i>
<P>

<i>	Furthermore, I do not see why he should not, certainly if requested to by
his fellow justices, tell his fellow justices the way in
which his specialised
knowledge has caused him to look at the evidence."</i>
<P>

29	In <i>Burns v Lipman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=132%20CLR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">132 CLR 157</a> the plaintiff's case involved a motor
vehicle accident that had taken place on a Tasmanian road.  In dismissing the
action the trial
judge drew on his knowledge that it was not usual on Tasmanian
roads for a warning device to be sounded by an overtaking vehicle
(the
plaintiff was driving a vehicle with which the defendant's vehicle collided as
the latter was overtaking).  In reversing the
decision of the Full Court of the
Supreme Court of Tasmania and in restoring the decision of the trial judge, the
High Court held
that it was appropriate for the trial judge to use his
knowledge in addressing the question of what the plaintiff was entitled to
expect of an overtaking motorist in the circumstances (see the joint judgment
of Barwick CJ, Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ at 161).
<P>

30	Mr Montgomery also referred to <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v
Maher</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d88%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-88) 164 CLR 387</a> at 435 where Deane J referred to the well
settled practice of assuming knowledge in the court of procedures in
conveyancing transactions:
<P>

	<i>"It has long been the practice of courts administering equity in New South
Wales, as it was in Chancery in England, to assume, in
matters relating to
dealings with land, the existence of a basic knowledge of the ordinary practice
of conveyancers."</i>
<P>

31	The above authorities to which Mr Montgomery referred the Court indicate
that there is no general rule prohibiting a tribunal
from utilising knowledge
acquired independently of the evidence in a particular case.  In my opinion a
tribunal should nevertheless
be very careful in its use of knowledge of a
specialised nature when it derives that knowledge from a source independent of
the evidence
introduced in the case it has to determine.  If, for instance,
such knowledge was used without notice to the parties to reject unchallenged
expert evidence for a reason that was not addressed in the evidence, this would
be inappropriate because justice requires that a
party be given the opportunity
to address any such reason, and to endeavour to persuade the tribunal against
its application.
<P>

32	It is however undesirable that I endeavour to define principles of general
application for the purposes of deciding the present
case.  Since it does not
seem to me that the expressions of personal knowledge which the magistrate made
bear upon the outcome of
the case, I am satisfied that such expressions
involved no denial of natural justice.  Ground 2 therefore fails.
<P>

	<b>Ground 3</b>
<P>

33	The damages assessed by the magistrate were awarded upon the basis that they
represented the cost of replacement of the cladding
and the nails, using
stainless steel nails.
<P>

34	The magistrate referred to <i>Bellgrove v Eldridge</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%2d54%29%2090%20CLR%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953-54) 90 CLR 613</a>,
a case in which it was held that demolition of a building and rebuilding was
reasonable and necessary to provide a building that
conformed with the contract
which had been breached.
<P>

35	Ms Winters submitted that the approach taken by the magistrate in this case
by reference to <i>Bellgrove</i> was wrong.  Firstly it was submitted that
whilst in <i>Bellgrove</i> the builder had departed from the specification, in
the present case the respondent had the work done in accordance with the
contract,
because the parties had agreed to hot dipped galvanised nails.
Moreover, damages in the present case were to be assessed for breach
of s 52 of
the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>, not for breach of contract.  It was further
submitted that the damages awarded did not take account of the fact that the
contract
work had been done six years previously and that the cladding would
have required painting regardless of rust discolouration.
<P>

36	Whilst <i>Bellgrove</i> was distinguishable, the decision of the magistrate
discloses that he directed himself to determine what was <i>"necessary and
reasonable"</i> to address the harm occasioned by the nails used (p 12 of
judgment).  The magistrate then reviewed the expert evidence in point.
 The
appellant's expert posed two alternatives, the first and more conservative
approach being to remove only certain of the nails
and the cladding boards to
which those nails were affixed.  The second approach however was to remove all
the cladding and nails
and to replace these items, but using stainless steel
nails.  One of the respondent's experts adopted the more extensive option posed
by the appellant's expert.  At the same time, the respondent's expert posed an
alternative more conservative approach but the judgment
indicates that the
expert did this with reservations.
<P>

37	The magistrate concluded that anything short of total replacement at the
time of assessment would <i>"constitute but a doubtful remedy"</i> and that
<P>

	<i>"not only [was] it necessary that total replacement be undertaken to
produce conformity with that for which the parties contracted,
it [was] also,
having regard to the circumstances, the only reasonable course to
adopt."</i>
<P>

38	It was submitted by Mr Montgomery that in the particular circumstances of
this case the approach to the assessment of damages
which the magistrate took
was correct.  Mr Montgomery's argument was as follows:  the misrepresentation
attracting liability was
made at a time when the appellant and the respondent
had previously agreed to a contract that contemplated the use of nails that
would not rust; the misrepresentation led to the variation of the contract by
the introduction of the nails that did rust; to compensate
the respondent by
placing him in the position he would have been in had s 52 not been breached
involved putting the respondent where
he was before the misrepresentation, that
is to say by restoring him to the advantages of the contract entered into
originally.
<P>

39	Upon reflection I consider Mr Montgomery's submission is correct.
<P>

40	Furthermore, it seems to me that where one of the respondent's experts and
the appellant's expert agreed on the approach ultimately
adopted by the
magistrate as an available method of addressing the rust problem, it was open
to the magistrate to conclude that it
was reasonable to adopt that approach in
order to compensate the plaintiff.
<P>

41	It has not been established that the assessment of damages involved relevant
error of law.
<P>

42	The challenge to the judgment in the Local Court therefore fails.
<P>

	<b>Formal orders</b>
<P>

43	The summons seeks determination of the issues raised in paragraph 5 of the
stated case.  I now answer the questions in the order
in which they were raised
in that paragraph:
<P>

5 (a)	No
<P>

5 (b)	Yes
<P>

5 (c)	Yes
<P>

5 (d)	Yes
<P>

I order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings in this
Court.
