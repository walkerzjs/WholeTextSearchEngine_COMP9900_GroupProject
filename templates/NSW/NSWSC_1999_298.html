<b>6244/91	SUSAN ELIZABETH VIAL   -v-   ANTONIO STEFANO COSSA</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>On 12 February 1999 I heard an application
by the plaintiff, Susan Elizabeth Vial, for summary judgment pursuant to Part
13 rule 2
of the Supreme Court Rules.  After a contested hearing of that
application for summary judgment, I delivered my reasons for judgment
and made
the following orders: 
<P>

1.	I direct that on or after 22 February 1999 judgment be entered for the
plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $147,850,
together with interest
upon such sum from 28 June 1996 at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

2.	I reserve to the defendant liberty to apply to me on twenty-four hours'
notice on or before 19 February 1999 for an order varying
the sum of $147,850
referred to in Order 1 hereof.
<P>

2   	I made consequential and other orders in the matter.  The
reason for Order 2 was that it appeared that, as disclosed in my
reasons for
judgment, there was a dispute in the evidence as to the precise amount which
had been paid by the defendant of the total
amount of his indebtedness to the
plaintiff under a deed, in the sum of $400,000. 
<P>

3   	I said in my reasons for judgment that, in proposing to
reserve to the defendant liberty to apply for a variation of the amount
asserted by the plaintiff in her affidavit evidence, I would expect that the
parties would be able to perform a calculation as to
how much had actually been
paid. 
<P>

4   	Pursuant to the liberty reserved by me, the defendant, on
19 February 1999, filed a Notice of Motion seeking an order varying
the sum of
$147,850 as the amount of the judgment in favour of the plaintiff.  The Notice
of Motion did not specify the amount to
which the defendant sought the summary
judgment should be varied. 
<P>

5   	The hope which I had expressed in my reasons for judgment
on 12 February 1999, that the parties would be able to perform some
calculation
as to how much had actually been paid by the defendant has not been
fulfilled.
<P>

6   	In his affidavit sworn 30 March 1999 the defendant, in
paragraphs 7, 8 and 9, refers to payments made by him and says that
of the
total amount of $400,000 which, under the deed, he was liable to pay, there is
presently outstanding an amount of $87,075.50.
 
<P>

7   	He calculates that amount by setting forth a schedule of
payments as annexure A to that affidavit.  That schedule of payments
totals
$306,300.  To that schedule he also adds certain infringement fines and
penalties totalling $7942 in respect of which he says,
in paragraph 7, that the
plaintiff is, under the terms of the deed, liable to indemnify him, and that
that figure should be added
to the amount of $306,300.
<P>

8   	He also claims an amount of $182.50 for an unpaid bill for
a meal for three persons, consumed allegedly by the plaintiff and
two other
persons at a restaurant conducted by the defendant.  It is quite clear that in
the present proceedings I am not embarking
upon some form of general accounting
of all financial relationships between the parties.  I am dealing only with the
liability of
the defendant to the plaintiff under the terms of the deed.
Accordingly, any amount which the plaintiff might have incurred for meals
at
the defendant's restaurant is certainly not something which is the subject of
the present proceedings.
<P>

9   	The amount which the defendant asserts should be brought to
his credit under the terms of the deed in respect to the infringement
notices
and liabilities incurred by the plaintiff in relation to the motor vehicle,
being a sum of $7942, now appears to include
a fine of $800 imposed upon the
defendant himself at the Waverley Court on 13 November 1990.  That sum can in
no way be regarded
as the plaintiff's responsibility.
<P>

10   	The reference in clause 9 of the deed is to the plaintiff
indemnifying the defendant in respect of any claims arising from
the
plaintiff's use of the motor vehicle, such claims to include the traffic
infringements notices incurred personally by the plaintiff.
 Accordingly, the
figure of $7942, which the defendant in his affidavit seeks should be credited
to him, must be reduced to $7142,
in order to take account of the fine
personally imposed upon him.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff disputes that the defendant has paid to her
the totality of $306,600 as set forth in the schedule, which is
annexure A to
the defendant's affidavit of 30 March 1999.  The payments in that schedule
accord with the bank records of the defendant
and, in particular, accord with
cheque butts of the defendant.  The plaintiff, however, asserts in respect to a
number of those payments
that she has no recollection of having received the
cheque.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff, however, was not able to place before the
Court at today's hearing any documentary material which would support
her
assertion of not having a recollection of receiving cheques which are included
amongst the payments which the defendant, in annexure
A to his affidavit, says
that he has made to her.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff is presently residing in the United States
of America.  She returned to Sydney only a week ago.  She said that
she had
placed in storage at Mascot documentary records which she had had at an earlier
stage in these proceedings and that since
her return to Sydney a week ago she
had made search for three days at the storage facilities for those records, but
to no avail.
<P>

14   	The situation in which the Court is placed is that there
is documentary evidence supporting the assertion of the defendant
that he has
paid to the plaintiff amounts totalling $306,300.
<P>

15   	There is only the oral evidence of the plaintiff, based
upon her recollection and not supported by any documentary material,
that the
amounts which she received from the defendant total considerably less than
$306,300.  It was upon the basis of the evidence
given by the plaintiff in her
affidavit of 12 March 1998 in support of the application for summary judgment
that the defendant had
paid to her only a total of $252,150 that the Court
directed entry of summary judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of
$147,850.
<P>

16   	It seems to me that, when confronted by the oral testimony
of the plaintiff, based upon her present recollection of payments
received by
her throughout a period from December 1990 until July 1994, and evidence given
by the defendant, supported by a very
considerable quantity of statements from
his bank and of cheque butts, that the Court must accept the evidence which is
supported
by the documentary material.
<P>

17   	In those circumstances, therefore, I am satisfied, on the
balance of probabilities, that I should accept the evidence of the
defendant
that he has made payments totalling $306,300.  In addition, he should also be
given credit for an amount of $7142 in respect
to the various traffic
infringement notices incurred whilst the motor vehicle was in the possession of
and under the control of the
plaintiff.
<P>

18   	However, among the payments made by the defendant to the
plaintiff, was a cheque for $2000, being cheque number 48, in an
amount of
$2000 dated 19 June 1991, payment of which cheque was stopped by the defendant.
  Accordingly, the amount of $306,300 will
be reduced to $304,300. 
<P>

19   	I do not accept the submission made on behalf of the
plaintiff that, because the motor vehicle was registered in the name
of the
defendant, the plaintiff should, thereby, be absolved from the liability in
respect of penalties under infringement notices
which that motor vehicle
attracted whilst used by her and allowed to remain by her on a public street
whilst unregistered.
<P>

20   	It follows, therefore, that the amount which the defendant
has paid, $304,300, and the amount for which he should be credited
in respect
of the traffic infringement notices and penalties of $7142, being in a total
amount of $311,442, should be deducted from
the total liability of the
defendant under the deed in the sum of $400,000, leaving an outstanding balance
of $88,558, which is the
amount which the defendant is presently liable to pay
to the plaintiff and is the amount to which the amount of the summary judgment
will be varied.  
<P>

21   	I propose to order that the amount of the summary judgment
to which the plaintiff is entitled should be varied to the amount
of $88,558.

<P>

22   	(Counsel addressed on costs.)
<P>

23   	The defendant has been substantially successful on the
present Notice of Motion.  I consider that he is entitled to have his
costs of
that motion.  I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the sum of $147,850 referred to in order 1 made on 12 February
1999 be varied by substituting therefor the sum of
$88,558.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant of the Notice of
Motion filed by the defendant on 19 February 1999
(marked A for
identification).
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
