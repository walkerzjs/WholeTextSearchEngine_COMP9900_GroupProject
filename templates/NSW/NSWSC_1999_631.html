<b>Remarks on Sentence</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner, Brian Morgan Hall, has
been found guilty by a jury of a number of serious charges arising from
an
incident in Roseby Street, Drummoyne on Sunday 15 December 1996.  Those charges
are the murder of Brooke Webber, maliciously wounding
Marc Webber with intent
to do grievous bodily harm, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon
Marc Webber with intent to do
grievous bodily harm and maliciously inflicting
grievous bodily harm upon Wayne Piper with intent to do grievous bodily
harm.
<P>

<b>Facts </b>
<P>

2    	In the early evening of that Sunday, the prisoner
arrived at Birkenhead Point after an outing on a boat.  He and a friend,
John
Sternbeck, went to the Birkenhead Tavern in Roseby Street, where they remained
until the establishment closed at about 10pm.
 A number of patrons at the
tavern left at the same time as they did.  Among them were Marc Webber, his
sister, Brooke Webber and
their friend, Wayne Piper.  By this time the prisoner
had had far too much to drink. 
<P>

3    	He and Mr Sternbeck went to the prisoner's car, which
was parked at a multi-storey car park next to the tavern.  He drove
the car
over a low barrier separating the car park from the footpath, across the
footpath and onto the road.  This led to some derisory
remarks by patrons of
the tavern who were in the vicinity, to which the prisoner responded with
insults of some kind.  Marc Webber
invited him to repeat those insults outside
the car.  The prisoner alighted, and there was a violent exchange between him
and Marc
Webber.  Marc Webber got the better of the prisoner, the two men were
separated and the prisoner got back into the car.  Marc Webber
punched him
through the driver's window and somebody, possibly Marc Webber himself, kicked
the car.  The prisoner drove off, shouting
words which could be construed as
threats to people in the area.
<P>

4    	He drove in the direction of Victoria Road, but at
the next intersection in Roseby Street he did a U-turn and drove back towards
the spot where the altercation had taken place.  The car struck Marc Webber and
Wayne Piper, who were standing together towards the
middle of the roadway.
This gave rise to the charges of maliciously wounding Marc Webber with intent
to do grievous bodily harm and
maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon
Wayne Piper with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  He then continued on to
the
bottom of Roseby Street, which formed a cul-de-sac. 
<P>

5    	Some people went to the aid of Wayne Piper, who had
been thrown some metres by the impact, and removed him to the side of
the road.
Marc Webber was also thrown into the air by the impact, falling to the ground
roughly where he had been standing.  His
sister, Brooke Webber went to his aid,
as did Paul Allen, who did not know either of them.  Mr Allen began to lift
Marc Webber in
an attempt to remove him from the middle of the road.
<P>

6    	In the meantime, the prisoner had reached the bottom
of Roseby Street, where he turned and drove back up the street.  On this
occasion the vehicle struck Brooke Webber, Paul Allen and, for a second time,
Marc Webber.  Fortunately, Mr Allen was not seriously
injured.  However, Brooke
Webber was thrown to the side of the roadway and suffered injuries from which
she died a week later in
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  This second impact gave
rise to the charges of the murder of Brooke Webber and of maliciously
inflicting
grievous bodily harm upon Marc Webber with intent to do grievous
bodily harm.
<P>

7    	The jury acquitted the prisoner of charges of
wounding Marc Webber with intent to murder, and causing him grievous bodily
harm with intent to murder, arising from both impacts, and causing grievous
bodily harm to Wayne Piper with intent to murder, arising
from the first
impact.  Clearly, then, they found that his intention at the time of both
impacts was to cause grievous bodily harm
to someone.  This, of course, was
sufficient to establish the charge of murder. 
<P>

8    	It was not necessary for the jury to find that his
intent was directed specifically at Brooke Webber, Marc Webber, Wayne Piper,
or
any of them.  I do not think that it was.  I think it more likely that he drove
his car towards people at random, motivated by
feelings of anger and
humiliation engendered by what he saw as the behaviour of the group as a whole
or, at least, the men among
them.  In an electronically recorded interview with
police some hours after the event, it appears to have been his recollection
that
he had been set upon by a number of men (Q21 &amp; Q51).  Asked why he did
a U-turn and drove back to the scene of the altercation,
he answered, "I
suppose it was out of anger just 'cause I had the shit kicked out of me and I
just wanted to get 'em back, I suppose."
(Q150) 
<P>

9    	In the interview the prisoner said that he had slowed
down "a little bit" before the second impact (Q41 &amp; Q77).  This
is
consistent with the observation of a number of eye witnesses that he appeared
to apply his brakes immediately before the impact,
and it tends to confirm the
view I have expressed about his intention.  His anger would have been directed
at the males in the group
and it may well be that he attempted, albeit far too
late, to avoid hitting Brooke Webber.  Of course, that would in no way absolve
him of responsibility for the murder, as an intention at that time to inflict
grievous bodily harm upon anyone is sufficient.
<P>

10    	None of this is to deny the gravity of this criminal
conduct.  A young woman is dead and two young men have been seriously
injured.
I received in evidence a Victim Impact Statement by Mrs Carol Webber, the
mother of Brooke and Marc, which speaks movingly
of the effect upon her and
other members of the family of this tragic incident.  The Court is conscious of
the serious and enduring
effects of the premature and senseless death of a
loved one, and expresses its sympathy to Mrs Webber and the family in their
tragic
loss.  It is important that the members of the family have the
opportunity to express their feelings in these sentence proceedings,
although
it is well established that it is inappropriate for me to have regard to Mrs
Webber's statement in determining the sentence
to be passed: <i>R v
Previtera</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20CrimR%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A CrimR 76</a> at 84ff.  
<P>

11    	Equally, the Court acknowledges the seriousness of
the injuries suffered by Marc Webber and Wayne Piper.  From the first
impact
Marc Webber sustained lacerations to his face and other parts of his body,
which have left him with permanent scarring.  From
the second impact he
suffered serious abdominal injuries, which required surgery.  Wayne Piper's
injuries were primarily to his knees,
requiring a number of surgical
procedures.  He still has to undergo physiotherapy and is significantly
restricted in his activities,
both at work and at leisure.  He has set out the
effect of his injuries in a Victim Impact Statement, which I have considered,
but
it is unnecessary to look beyond the evidence at the trial to assess the
gravity of the crime perpetrated against him. 
<P>

12    	As I have said, the prisoner was well affected by
liquor.  A breath analysis reading later obtained by police was interpreted
by
Dr Judith Perl, pharmacologist, as establishing that his blood alcohol level at
the relevant time was in the order of 0.170. 
I have referred to his
electronically recorded interview with police, during which there appear to
have been significant gaps in
his memory of what occurred.  In the sentence
proceedings he gave evidence, which I accept, that what he told police then was
his
best recollection and that it has not improved since.  That, of course, is
not inconsistent with the jury's finding about his state
of mind at the time he
was driving, but it is another pointer to his level of intoxication.  That
intoxication in no way excuses
his behaviour, but it does provide some
explanation for conduct which, on the evidence, is entirely uncharacteristic of
him: <i>R v Coleman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2047%20A%20CrimR%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 47 A CrimR 306</a> at 327.
<P>

13    	His patchy memory is significant for another reason.
I accept that he has no clear recall of what was going through his mind
when he
was driving, other than that he was feeling angry.  It is understandable, then,
that he pleaded not guilty to the charges
involving a mental element, so as to
put the Crown to proof of that element.  The only other matter that was not
conceded was whether
Marc Webber had suffered grievous bodily harm as a result
of the first impact, which led to his pleading not guilty to an alternative
charge of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm arising from that
impact.  No issue was taken with any other matter
which the Crown had to prove.
As a result the trial was conducted very responsibly by counsel on both sides,
focussing on the prisoner's
intent or state of mind.  This must have reduced
the distress which the trial would inevitably have caused to the surviving
victims,
their families and the large number of eyewitnesses who gave evidence.
The prisoner expressed his remorse in evidence before me,
as he had to Dr
William Lucas, psychiatrist, whose report I received in the sentence
proceedings.  I accept it as genuine and, in
the circumstances, its sincerity
is not undermined by the fact that the matter went to trial.  It is consistent
with his demeanour
throughout the trial.  He sat through the entire proceedings
with his head bowed, raising it only when I had occasion to address
him.  
<P>

<b>Subjective case</b>
<P>

14    	The prisoner is a single man who was twenty-two
years old at the time of the incident, and is now twenty-four.  He had the
benefit of a sound upbringing and his family remains supportive of him.  He was
educated to Year 10 standard, and acquired a creditable
work record as a panel
beater thereafter.  Although he drank heavily at times and used illicit drugs
on occasions, Dr Lucas did not
detect in his history any significant pattern of
drug or alcohol abuse.
<P>

15    	Character evidence was called in his case at the
trial.  In addition, in the sentence proceedings I received into evidence
a
large number of testimonials from people who could attest to his character and
his reliability as a worker.  Like the witnesses
in the trial, many of the
authors of these testimonials are mature people who have known the prisoner
since he was a child.  The
effect of this material is that he has been held in
the highest regard.  He is described as well-behaved, courteous, generous,
industrious
and trustworthy.  In particular, he is said to be a gentle person
who, despite his considerable size, has never been observed to
act
aggressively.
<P>

16    	One can but wonder, then, how a young man of his
character could  have embarked upon such a dreadful criminal enterprise.
 Dr
Lucas did not find him to have been suffering from any psychiatric illness or
personality disorder.  No doubt, the altercation
which triggered the incident
angered him, but this uncharacteristic behaviour must be attributed primarily
to the disinhibiting effects
of alcohol.  This was the view of Dr Lucas, which
I share. 
<P>

<b>Sentence</b>
<P>

17    	After his arrest on 15 December 1996 the prisoner
remained in custody for a little over a month, when he was released on
bail.
The bail conditions, which he observed for over two years thereafter, were
quite onerous, involving a curfew, twice daily reporting
to police, and
embargoes upon driving a car and entering licensed premises.  His counsel
submitted that, for that reason, I should
date his sentence from the day of his
arrest but, given the length of time he was on bail, I do not think that that
is appropriate.
 I shall recognise the period he spent in custody and the
restrictions on his liberty while on bail by deducting six months from
the
minimum term which I propose. 
<P>

18    	I think it appropriate that I should reflect the
whole of the prisoner's criminality in the sentence for the murder, passing
concurrent sentences for the other offences.  I consider this to be in
conformity with the principles enunciated in <i>Pearce v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
72 ALJR 1416</a>, and the difficulty with which the High Court was dealing in that
case does not arise here.  I approach the matter on the basis that
this
incident would have taken no more than a matter of minutes, although the fact
remains that the prisoner drove his car into people
on the roadway not once,
but twice. 
<P>

19    	Counsel for the prisoner submitted that I should
find special circumstances, so as to depart from the normal proportion between
minimum and additional terms.  For the reasons I have given, I do propose to
deduct six months from the minimum term.  However, I
do not consider that any
purpose would be served by a greater departure from the statutory ratio.  The
global sentence I have in
mind is necessarily lengthy, and the additional term
produced by the application of that ratio will be more than sufficient to
encourage
the prisoner's rehabilitation. 
<P>

20    	Sentencing a young man for crimes as serious as this
is never an easy task, and I have found this a particularly difficult
exercise.
The sentence I impose must reflect the gravity of the prisoner's criminal
conduct and the need for deterrence, while recognising
his youth, his general
good character and the community's interest in his rehabilitation.  He has
asked that I take into account
on a Form 1 three summary offences arising from
the same incident: driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol,
unlicensed
driving and failing to stop after an accident. 
<P>

21    	I have determined that the total sentence must be
penal servitude for twenty years, comprising a minimum term of fifteen
years
and an additional term of five years.  Six months will be deducted from that
minimum term.  All sentences will date from the
day of the verdicts, 16 June
1999, when the prisoner was returned to custody.
<P>

22    	Brian Morgan Hall, on the charge of murder, and
taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are sentenced to penal
servitude for nineteen years and six months.  That sentence will comprise a
minimum term of fourteen years and six months, commencing
on 16 June 1999 and
expiring on 15 December 2013, and an additional term of five years, commencing
on 16 December 2013 and expiring
on 15 December 2018.  On the charge of
maliciously wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and on each of the
charges of
maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do
grievous bodily harm, you are sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of
penal
servitude for ten years, each commencing on 16 June 1999.
<P>

23    	You will be eligible for release on parole on 16
December 2013.  Of course, the question of your release on parole is a matter
for the Parole Board, not for me.  Your sentence will expire in its entirety on
15 December 2018.
