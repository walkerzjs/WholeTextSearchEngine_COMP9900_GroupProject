<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	HER HONOUR:  The plaintiff, Hudson Resources Ltd, has sued
Richard John Sandner and Reef Mining NL in relation to the alleged
publication
of a document dated 3 May 1999 in the following terms:
<P>

 
<P>

"Dear Shareholder
<P>

 
<P>

SPECIAL GENERAL MEETING
<P>

 
<P>

I am writing to advise the outcome of the Special General Meeting that had been
called by Reef Mining N.L.'s largest shareholder,
Hudson Resources Limited to
consider a resolution proposed by them to remove me as Managing Director.
<P>

 
<P>

At the meeting held on Thursday, 29 April 1999 a total of 649 proxies were
received of which, 637 accounting for 51% of the total
shares on issue, voted
against the resolution and accordingly the resolution failed.
<P>

 
<P>

You will be aware that on Monday, 26 April 1999 Hudson Resources Limited
announced another takeover offer for Reef Mining N.L.
<P>

 
<P>

The announcement reads as follows:
<P>

 
<P>

"The Company (Hudson Resources) proposes to make a takeover bid or procure that
one of its Subsidiaries make a takeover bid for
Reef at 7 cents per share
subject to no prescribed occurrences occurring after the date of this
announcement and before the end of
the offer period.'
<P>

 
<P>

Some facts about Hudson Resources!
<P>

 
<P>

As at 31 September 1998
<P>

 
<P>

* Bank Liability	$726,000
<P>

 
<P>

* Profit 	$ 58,000
<P>

 
<P>

* Cash on hand	$ 96,000
<P>

 
<P>

Hudson Resources is clearly in need to (sic) cash and because Reef Mining NL
has cash it is an attractive target.
<P>

 
<P>

As you would be aware Reef Mining N.L. is currently  undertaking a major
drilling program at the Tarnagulla mine to prove whether
the geological theory
developed for Reef Mining N.L. by Brian Cuffley and Joseph Krokowski works.
Preliminary results are encouraging
and assays are awaited with interest.  I
will of course keep you informed of progress on the drilling program.
<P>

 
<P>

You will also be pleased to know that Doug Derham has rejoined the Board.
<P>

 
<P>

May I also take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for your support and
for allowing me the opportunity to continue as Managing
Director and to further
develop the Reef Mining N.L. program.
<P>

 
<P>

Yours faithfully
<P>

 
<P>

REEF MINING N.L.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

DICK SANDNER
<P>

Managing Director."
<P>

2   	The plaintiff alleges that four imputations are conveyed by
the matter complained of.  They are as follows:
<P>

(a) the plaintiff is insolvent;
<P>

 
<P>

(b) the plaintiff had so incompetently managed its business as to cause it to
have a substantial cash deficiency;
<P>

 
<P>

(c) the plaintiff was a dishonourable company prepared to make an unfair take
over offer for the purpose of remedying its cash deficiencies;
<P>

(d) the plaintiff had made a take over offer for the second defendant for the
purpose of stripping the second defendant of its assets
including cash.
<P>

3   	Both defendants claim that the imputations are incapable of
being conveyed and, in relation to at least one of the imputations,
that even
if it is conveyed, it is incapable of being defamatory.
<P>

4   	As noted, the letter appears to have been written in
response to a proposed take-over offer for Reef Mining NL by the plaintiff
company and is properly construed as an advice to shareholders not to accept
the offer, if it eventuated.  Of significance  in the
letter, which is fairly
short, is the paragraph commencing, "Some facts about Hudson Resources!" Set
out thereunder is a short statement
purporting to report the plaintiff's
financial position as at 31 December 1998.  Only three figures are given.  One
is a figure representing
the bank liability of the plaintiff at $726,000, the
other two representing profit of $58,000 and cash on hand of $96,000.  It is
entirely possible that, properly read, there is some overlap between the two
figures given for profit and cash on hand, but I think
that is immaterial for
present purposes.  What followed those figures was the statement:
<P>

"Hudson Resources is clearly in need to (sic) cash and  because Reef Mining NL
has cash it is an attractive target."
<P>

5   	The first imputation pleaded is that the plaintiff is
insolvent.  The defendants argue that on the extracted material it is
not
possible to discern an assertion of insolvency.
<P>

6   	Arguments were advanced as to what constitutes insolvency
and I was reminded that, technically, insolvency means the inability
to pay
debts as and when they fall due and it was put that, properly construed, this
paragraph could not convey that meaning.
<P>

7   	Construed in terms of legal technicalities, I think that is
correct.  But this is not an Act of Parliament or a legal document
and the test
is not what may properly be construed in those circumstances, but what may be
conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader,
receiving the matter complained
of.
<P>

8   	In my opinion, the letter has been drafted as it has in
such a way, whether this was its purpose or not, as to convey a message
that
the plaintiff is in financial difficulties and I am of the opinion that it is
capable of conveying the imputation pleaded as
(a).
<P>

9   	The second imputation to some extent rests upon the first
imputation but adds the assertion that the company had reached that
position by
reason of incompetent management.  On behalf of the plaintiff it was put that
companies only find themselves in financial
difficulties because of incompetent
management.  I do not accept that proposition.  The ordinary reasonable reader
would know that
companies can find themselves in financial difficulties for all
sorts of reasons that do not necessarily include incompetent management.
 Other
than by inference derived from imputation (a) there is nothing in the letter
that could convey any suggestion of incompetence
in the management of the
plaintiff and I accordingly strike out imputation (b).
<P>

10   	The third imputation contains a number of epithets,
including the word "dishonourable", "unfair take-over" and a reference
to the
plaintiff's alleged purpose in its take-over, as being to remedy its cash
deficiencies.  It was put that the word "unfair"
in relation to a take-over
offer is often used, although what is intended is to suggest that the offer is
inadequate for the value
of the target company.  That simply means that the use
of the word "unfair" is, strictly speaking, inaccurate.
<P>

11   	In my opinion, while the letter is capable of suggesting
that the offer proposed by the plaintiff is inadequate having regard
to the
value of Reef Mining NL, it is not capable of conveying an imputation, either
that the proposed offer is unfair in the ordinary
sense of that word, or that
the plaintiff was acting dishonorably in making that offer, and accordingly I
strike out imputation (c).

<P>

12   	The final imputation concerns an allegation of asset
stripping.  It is this imputation which has caused me the greatest difficulty.
The material is capable of conveying the imputation that the plaintiff's
purpose in making the take-over offer was for the purpose
colloquially known as
"stripping".  It is not entirely clear that asset stripping in the take-over
industry is something deserving
of criticism or condemnation, but on balance it
seems to me that an ordinary reasonable reader might, in the context of this
letter,
so understand the assertion, that is that the conduct asserted against
the plaintiff was worthy of condemnation.  I decline to strike
out imputation
(d).
<P>

13   	In the light of what I have said, the plaintiff has leave
to file an amended statement of claim.
<P>

14   	I order each party pay his or its own costs.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff is to file any amended Statement of Claim by
17 September and thereafter the matter can be placed in a Holding
List for
determination by a jury for the matters relevant for jury determination, and
thereafter for whatever directions the trial
judge might consider appropriate,
if there is anything. 
<P>
