<b>HULME J</b>
<P>

<center><b><u>Hrair Ray ARMAGHANIAN v JOHN FAIRFAX &amp; SONS
LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  In these proceedings the Plaintiff claimed damages from
his former employer alleging that he suffered injury in the course of his
employment in consequence of negligence on the part of the Defendant.  Bruce J
found in favour of the Plaintiff and, on 2 April 1996,
directed the entry of
Judgment.  In large part His Honour's reasons were delivered on 5 March 1996
and in those he found the Plaintiff
entitled to damages under most of the heads
commonly used in actions such as this.
<P>

2	The Defendant appealed from His Honour's decision and on 27 August 1996 the
Court of Appeal:-
<P>

	"Set aside so much of the Judgment for damages of Bruce J of 2 April 1996 as
awarded the following damages:
<P>

	Damages for past economic loss since the Plaintiff ceased employment:
$99,044.00 and interest thereon;
<P>

	(a)  Damages for future economic loss: $168,493.00;
<P>

	(b)  Remit the matter to the Common Law Division for a new trial limited to
the assessment of (damages under those two heads)."
<P>

3	It is those two issues with which these Reasons are concerned.  It was common
ground between the parties that a number of findings
of Bruce J were relevant
to the task before me.  It is convenient to record those parts of Bruce J's
Reasons as do or may fall within
this category:-
<P>

	"... the Plaintiff is entitled to succeed against the defendant and there
should be no deduction for any contributory negligence.
<P>

	The Plaintiff resigned on the grounds of ill-health on 11 May 1989.  He has
not worked since.  The effect of his resignation on
this basis was to obtain a
larger pay out from his employer's superannuation fund.
<P>

	Over the years the Plaintiff has had various medical procedures carried out on
the basis that he has sustained an organic injury
to his back...
<P>

	On 1 July 1993 the Plaintiff was awarded $70.00 per week compensation by
Commissioner Hopkins in the Compensation Court on the
basis of his partial
incapacity.
<P>

	... There does not appear to be any evidence of any significant organic injury
to the Plaintiff's back which could account for
the symptoms which he
exhibits... No significant organic caused has been found in spite of there
having been a number of CT and MRI
scans carried out on the Plaintiff.  ....
<P>

	In my view the Plaintiff has not established that he is totally incapacitated
from work as a result of the injury which he sustained
in the course of his
employment.  A commissioner in the Compensation Court determined that he
suffered a partial incapacity.  But
ignoring that determination there is simply
no material before me upon which such a conclusion could properly be reached.

<P>

	The medical evidence overwhelmingly establishes that the Plaintiff has been
capable of carrying out work during the greater part
of the time but that for
some reason he has taken the view that he is unable to work at all.  He
indicated that he sought employment
up until 1992 but thereafter has not done
so... I am of the view that the Plaintiff had some earning capacity which he
elected not
to seek to use after 1992...
<P>

	The Plaintiff has no significant organic injuries.  He has, he says, some pain
and also occasional episodes of severe pain which
requires bed rest.  These
episodes are at infrequent intervals.  In my view the pain will resolve with
the passage of time...
<P>

	<b>(b)  	Loss of Earnings Since Employment Ceased </b>
<P>

	In my view the Plaintiff has not been totally incapacitated from work.  He
sustained an injury and exhibits behaviour which is
totally out of proportion
to the injury which he sustained.  There is no evidence, apart from his
evidence, that he is in fact incapacitated
to the extent he says he is.  I am
not satisfied on an assessment of the Plaintiff in giving his evidence that he
is not capable
of performing a significant amount of work for virtually all of
the time.  
<P>

	The Plaintiff is not and will not be capable of performing his pre-accident
work but nevertheless he is capable of working in some
form of remunerative
employment.  <u>There is no evidence of his likely earnings in such employment
but doing the best I can I estimate that since his employment ceased
he has had
an earning capacity of in the order of $250.00 per week</u>.
<P>

	I am prepared to accept Mr Bowes as the comparable employee to the Plaintiff
in assessing the Plaintiff's loss as Mr Bowes' income
most closely approximated
the Plaintiff's income during the year in respect of which comparable figures
have been provided...  
<P>

	6.	<b>Future Loss of Earnings </b>
<P>

<b>	</b>In my view the Plaintiff has lost the difference between the sum of
$626.00 which Mr Bowes' net average weekly earnings at the time
of trial and
<u>the sum of $250.00 which I have assessed as the Plaintiff's residual earning
capacity namely, $376.00 per week</u>."
<P>

4	It has been convenient to include in the above extracts from Bruce J's
Reasons the passages I have underlined but having done
so I record that they
form an exception to my description of the passage quoted from His Honour's
Reasons.  The Court of Appeal found
that there was no evidence to justify His
Honour's acceptance of the sum of $250.00 per week and that he had erred also
in not providing
reasons has to how he arrived at that figure.
<P>

5	The only witnesses called before me were the Plaintiff and a Mr Damp, the
Human Resources Manager of the Defendant.  In addition
there were tendered a
number of medical reports, not all of which were before Bruce J, documents
bearing on the issue of comparable
earnings and a folder of letters to and from
organisations to which the Plaintiff has applied for employment.  There was a
chronology,
the accuracy of which was deposed to by the Plaintiff and a few
other documents.  The medical reports were voluminous.  Apart from
reports from
four psychiatrists, there were reports from some ten other medical
practitioners.  None of these was called and accordingly,
my decisions as to
what parts of this evidence to accept must be based upon my assessment of its
content, perhaps the standing of
its author, and my assessment of the
Plaintiff.
<P>

6	There seems no dispute that the Plaintiff, who prior to his accident, had
been employed by the Defendant for some 9 years, displayed
no symptoms of back
problems or unreliability in his work attendance prior to the date of the
accident with which these proceedings
are concerned viz. 13 April 1987.  Dr
Sarian who had known the Plaintiff since 1975 indicated that the Plaintiff had
never suffered
from back pain prior to his accident on 13 April 1987.  However
the evidence bearing on the extent of the Plaintiff's incapacity
subsequent to
the accident is pregnant with controversy.  The Plaintiff's case is that he is
totally disabled.  The tenure of his
evidence is that he has pain virtually
every day, that this is commonly disabling and the frequency and extent of it
is such that
he has no hope of working with any degree of reliability.  The
Plaintiff's evidence was that he would not be able to sit at a bench
or operate
a computer terminal for long periods and half an hour's activity of this nature
would be productive of pain.  He said
that he experiences aching pain in his
back if he stands for 15 minutes or so.  He can drive short distances for 15 or
25 minutes
but lifting anything weighing more than 2&#189; kgs is productive of
pain.  He is unable to bend at all.  
<P>

7	The pain, according to the Plaintiff, falls into three categories.  Stage 1,
as he described it, is aching pain in his back, hip,
buttock, thigh or leg.  It
is unusual for this not to be present every day.  Stage 2 pain is experienced
between 2 and 4 times a
month for 3-4 days at a time.  It is intermittent
during these 3-4 days but when present causes the Plaintiff difficulty with
walking
or standing.  It is exacerbated by spinal movements involved in sitting
or standing or by not resting.  Digesics tend to alleviate
this pain.  Before
Bruce J the Plaintiff had said that the stage 2 pain was presently nearly every
day.  Before me he said that was
not an accurate picture.
<P>

8	The worst pain - that described as stage 3 - occurs 2 or 3 times a year.  It
commences with agonising pain.  The Plaintiff is
bed ridden from 8-11 days at a
time and during the first 2-3 days of this he is virtually unable to move at
all.  Initially he said
all he could do during this period was gaze at the
ceiling.  Later he said he was unable to life his legs even 1 or 2 degrees
during
this period and to urinate, he rolled over and used a jug brought by his
wife.  He has no bowel movement during this initial period.
 The first of these
occasions was in September 1988 when the Plaintiff went to hospital overnight
but he has not been hospitalised
on this account since.  He has had no
specialist medical treatment since 1993.
<P>

9	The Plaintiff said that the pain from which he suffers and has suffered has
led to anxiety and depression which is affecting his
whole immune system.  He
now suffers from spasms in his shoulders, arm and wrist and shortness of
breath.  He feels sad and that
he has no future.  His concentration is reduced.
In cross examination the Plaintiff accepted that on two occasions he had been
prescribed
Sinequam.  He said that he took this for about 10 days on each
occasion but the medication made no difference.
<P>

10	Asked who washed up the dishes in the morning, the Plaintiff replied
"Sometimes I try to help my wife and I do some sort of washing,
sir".  Later he
said "My wife does everything at home, sir, but I do want to help sometimes.  I
do small things, sir.  Picking up
a few clothes from the lines, or washing or
rinsing a few dishes".  Later I asked "What stopped you doing all the washing
up?" and
his reply was:-
<P>

	"The pain when I do, even when I do the washing up I know I will have pain but
I feel guilty.  I try to do something to help my
wife but when I do it
continuously I have increased pain." 
<P>

11	The Plaintiff did acknowledge that he picks his children up from school on
occasions and visits the TAB between 2 and 4 times
a week, spending between 1
minute and 2 hours there.  I was left uncertain whether attendance at the TAB
was ultimately of monetary
benefit to the Plaintiff.  He said that he went
there because it helped his days go more quickly not because he enjoyed
himself.
<P>

12	A major inspiration for the issue as to the extent of the Plaintiff's
incapacity and its cause lies in the extent of the Plaintiff's
complaints and
apparent inconsistencies in his actions and between some of his complaints and
medical opinion.  The fact of such
inconsistencies could not and was not
challenged by counsel appearing for the Plaintiff, although he took issue with
the suggestion
that they might be so great that no weight whatsoever could be
placed on what the Plaintiff said as to his symptoms.  The nature
of the
problem is presented starkly in the report of Dr Morris whose report contains
the following:-
<P>

	"This man gives a history of onset of low back pain 2 years ago.  He maintains
it has never disappeared since then and he does
have some minor degenerative
bulging in the lower 2 lumbar discs which might account for the pain.  However
I find quite a number
of unsatisfactory aspects to today's presentation.  The
first is the claim that the pain has not settled since which is intrinsically
improbable given the rather minor nature of the changes on x-ray.
<P>

	The second point is that the localisation of pain today is not in the lumbar
region at all but in the sacrum and one can only describe
his responses to
palpation of this are as exaggerated.  It's inconceivable that he could have
pain in the sacrum due to a problem
in his lumber discs, and certainly I can't
accept that he has any degree of tenderness despite his claims to the
contrary.
<P>

	Furthermore, I note his refusal to flex or extend the lumbar spine despite the
fact that he subsequently demonstrated that he is
able to flex the spine."
<P>

13	A feature of the Plaintiff's presentation to doctors was his refusal to move
his back and legs upon the stated ground that to
do so was to risk severe or
extremes of pain.  Yet he was observed to participate in movements apparently
inconsistent with this
attitude and suggested fear.  It is fair to say that I
cannot recall a case where inconsistency of action has been so remarked upon
in
medical reports.
<P>

14	I turn to the medical reports in more detail.  It is not necessary that I
refer to all that they contain.  I have read and re-read
them and, because of
the concerns they create, discussed most at considerable length with counsel
for the Plaintiff.
<P>

15	It is not in dispute that some radiological and the like examinations of the
Plaintiff's back made subsequent to the accident
revealed bulging of the discs
as L4/5 and L5/S1.  On the other hand a report of Dr Larbalestier of 8
September 1992 recorded that:-
<P>

	"The posterior convexity of this (L4/5) disc is considered to be anatomical;
the disc is not protruded and there are <u>NO</u> other noteworthy features"
and there are <u>NO</u> pathological features at this level in the
(lumbo-sacral) disc, intra spinal content or facet joints" and "<u>NO</u>
fracture seen or joint displacement either in the cervical or lumbar areas nor
is there any overt disc protrusion."
<P>

16	In his report of 1 October 1993, Dr Evans agreed with Dr Larbalestier's
report.  In a report of 20 December 1993, Dr Selby-Brown
carries out an
extensive review of the radiological examination of the Plaintiff.  Other
doctors also refer to the topic.  In light
of the conclusions reached by the
various doctors to whom I shall refer, it is not necessary that I resolve or
reconcile the evidence
as to the radiological findings.
<P>

17	<b>Dr Sarian</b>
<P>

Dr Sarian was the Plaintiff's general practitioner.  In a report of November
1990 to the Plaintiff's solicitors, he assessed the
Plaintiff as unfit for his
pre-accident position but fit for light duties not exceeding 4 hours per day.
In May 1992, he opined that
the Plaintiff had some functional overlay but said
he had certified the Plaintiff fit for light duties.  In this and the preceding
report, Dr Sarian assessed the Plaintiff's loss of total body function at 15 to
20%.  In November 1993 he recorded that because the
Plaintiff was petrified
that bending his spine would lead to "locking it", proper examination was
impossible.  He went on to say
that in his view the Plaintiff's incapacity was
a direct result of his injury.  In December 1994 he recorded that the
Plaintiff's
"symptoms have remarkably been constant; namely low back pain with
limitations of spinal movements with radiation of pain and paraesthesia
down
his left lower limb", and that whenever the Plaintiff attended the surgery he
walked with a left sided limp.  In this and the
preceding report, Dr Sarian
assessed the Plaintiff's loss of spinal function at 50%.  In April 1998 he
recorded that he had known
the patient since July 1975 and the latter had never
suffered from back pain or depression until his accident in April 1987.  Dr
Sarian also recorded that extension and flexion were reduced by 85% and lateral
rotation by 50% and that he "could not do other examination
or movements
because (the Plaintiff) was worried about aggravation of the pain".
<P>

18	<b>Dr Maniam</b>
<P>

In a report to the Plaintiff's solicitors of December 1990, Dr Maniam recorded
that at his last examination the Plaintiff experienced
difficulty in sitting
and straightening up and assuming the supine position and movement limitation
continued to be restricted at
around 50% of normal.  Dr Maniam referred to a
rehabilitation program wherein the Plaintiff undertook vocational guidance and
psychiatric
pain management.  In his report of February 1995, Dr Maniam
recorded that the Plaintiff was reluctant to move and stated that movements
induced pain.  "However, he was able to sit and straighten up with minimal
discomfort and was also able to supine with minimal difficulty...
 This man's
painful symptoms are excessive for the condition that has been diagnosed...  I
feel his preconception of these symptoms
are compacted by his anxiety
depression...  I will agree that he has become de-conditioned and the chances
of him re-entering the
work force is minimal."  Dr Maniam quantified the
Plaintiff's permanent percentage loss of use of the back at "17/5%" - I infer
17&#189;%.
<P>

19	<b>Dr Morris</b>
<P>

In a report of 16 October 1989 to the Defendant's solicitors, Dr Morris
expressed the view that the Plaintiff was fully fit for
work subject to the
proviso that he should avoid stooping, bending or heavy lifting.  He said that
any limitation as to the Plaintiff's
lifting ability was not due to anything
that happened at work but the result of a mild idiopathic disc degeneration
involving the
4/5 and 5/1 discs.  Any future pain would be a consequence of
underlying degenerative condition in the spine.  Some other comments
by Dr
Morris are set out above.
<P>

20	<b>Dr Rushworth</b>
<P>

In a report to the Defendant's solicitors of 6 September 1989 Dr Rushworth, a
consultant neuro-surgeon, recorded that the Plaintiff's
symptoms were difficult
to analyse, that when the Plaintiff removed a corset he was "literally unable
to move his back in any direction"
and appeared to be very tender over the
lumbo-sacral spine.  He referred to an MRI and CT scan showing degeneration of
the L4/5 disc.
 His opinion was that the Plaintiff's symptoms had persisted far
longer than one would expect if they had been due to a soft tissue
or
ligamentous injury and he did not believe that the symptoms were related to an
organic spinal disorder.  In a report of 31 July
1991 he said his opinion was
unchanged.  His report of 22 September 1992 was to similar effect, recording
that the Plaintiff "refused
to bend his spine at all".
<P>

21	A report of 27 October 1993 records that Dr Rushworth re-examined the
Plaintiff on the previous day.  He refers to a report of
x-rays carried out in
September 1992 saying:-
<P>

	"essentially it does not show any abnormality that would explain his
symptoms."
<P>

22	Dr Rushworth said the Plaintiff's lumbar spine was held completely rigid and
-
<P>

	"this examination adds nothing to what has been previously described.  No
organic basis for his symptoms has ever been established.
 They are not due to
a disc lesion or disc lesions and are totally out of proportion to the
relatively minor degenerative changes
which are noted radiologically...
<P>

	... His present rate of progress suggests that (his symptoms) will go on
indefinitely.  He is totally unfit for any form of heavy
work and probably
unemployable in any capacity."
<P>

23	In a report of 17 January 1995, Dr Rushworth recorded that the Plaintiff was
unable or unwilling to bend his lower back at all.
 He said:-
<P>

	 "this patient must be categorised as having chronic back pain of undetermined
origin.  I remain unconvinced that the disc abnormality
reported in previous
x-rays can be considered to be responsible for these symptoms.  However,
insofar as his symptoms and their onset
follow the incident at work referred to
above, the incident must be considered as being responsible..."
<P>

	"The present position is that he has continuing chronic incapacitating low
back pain and occasional left leg pain.  As these symptoms
have been present
more or less unchanged for nearly 8 years the indications are that they will
continue indefinitely."
<P>

24	Dr Rushworth assessed the Plaintiff's permanent percentage loss of efficient
use of his lower back at 5-10%.
<P>

25	<b>Dr Grant</b>
<P>

In a report of 15 December 1993 to the Plaintiff's solicitors, Dr Grant
said:-
<P>

	"Clinical examination (in June of this year) did not define any localising
neurological abnormalities, he did however tend to avoid
movements of his spine
particularly such as flexion.
<P>

	The x-ray and CT scans showed evidence of changes of the L4/5 and L5/S1
levels.
<P>

	In view of this I think the overall picture does indicate someone who has
episodes of low back pain but I would feel there is a
very marked over reaction
to this... and I doubt whether he would return to any work that required
bending or lifting."
<P>

26	
<P>

<b>Dr Selby-Brown</b>
<P>

In a report of 20 December 1993 to the Plaintiff's Solicitors, Dr Selby-Brown
recorded that the Plaintiff was observed to walk with
a "somewhat variable
limp" and had a "rather varying degree of freedom" in his movements.  The
report continues:-
<P>

	"(The Plaintiff) states that he cannot forward flex his lumbar spine and was
not prepared to do so when I formally examined him
standing up but he was noted
to be able to sit comfortably in a chair whilst I took his history and to sit
comfortably on the edge
of my examination couch during part of my physical
examination of him. ... Lumbar spinal motion was noted to be somewhat
restricted
but this degree of restriction was associated with a moderate degree
of voluntary muscle guarding.  Straight leg raising was also
variable
restricted on repeated assessment and was also associated with a moderate
degree of voluntary muscle guarding."
<P>

27	Dr Selby-Brown's opinion was that:-
<P>

	"(the Plaintiff) may have sustained a disc injury" and "it is possible that
this pathology (i.e. some bulging of the L4-5 and L5-S1
discs) is the
underlying basis for his ... present complaints.  (There is) a considerable
degree of emotional reaction.  It is possible
that he does have some
restriction on ... activities requiring heavy or moderately heavy lifting,
handling or bending... and for
activities likely to cause jerking, jolting or
jarring of his back... as his symptoms have now persisted for 6&#189; years it
would
seem unrealistic to consider that they are ever going to resolve.
Assuming that the basis for his ongoing symptoms is the disc bulging...
and
that this is causing his ongoing symptoms and that these symptoms are going to
remain permanently unchanged, I would assess Mr
Armaghanian as having a
permanent 10% impairment of his back."
<P>

28	Dr Selby-Brown said that, again on certain assumptions, there was a loss of
use of the lower limbs.
<P>

29	In reports of 19 December 1994, 3 December 1996 and 24 March 1998 following
further examination, he said in effect that the Plaintiff's
condition remain
unchanged.  In his report of December 1996 Dr Selby-Brown said:-
<P>

	"Mr Armaghanian walked into and out of the consultation room without any limp
but he was very cautious in any movements involving
his back... He was again
noted to sit freely" and would not allow any forward flexion of his lumbar
spine and" other spinal movements
were restricted "with a moderate degree of
voluntary muscle guarding."  
<P>

30	Dr Selby-Brown was not able to elicit any abnormal neurological findings in
either lower limb, although there was some qualification
of what he had said
earlier concerning these members.  A later report of March 1998 is to somewhat
similar effect. 
<P>

31	<b>Dr Bodel</b>
<P>

In a report of 27 September 1989 to the Defendant's solicitors, Dr Bodel
recorded that "the patient has actively resisted range
of forward flexion" but
was "able to walk on his heels and toes without difficulty, climbs on a couch
also without difficulty and
is seen to sit erect with his hips flexed and knees
extended."  Dr Bodel said:-
<P>

	"I have seen a CT scan of the lumbo-sacral spine which reports some minor
bulging of the posterior aspect of the L4/5 disc.  I
note this appearance on
the x-ray films and agree with the report which indicates that it is of no
clinical significance.  An MRI
scan on 15 February 1989 also reports some minor
bulging of L4/5 posteriorly and early degenerative change at this level.
<P>

32	Dr Bodel's opinion included that:-
<P>

	On clinical testing today there is evidence that the patient is attempting to
manufacture abnormal clinical signs which do not
exist.  He may well have
mechanical back ache arising from a degenerative L4/5 disc, but there is no
objective evidence of major
disc rupture...  It would however be unwise for the
patient to return to heavy manual labour... as this type of lesion would be
vulnerable
to recurrent problems.  The patient is however fit for light work
that does not require frequent bending or lifting.
<P>

	Historically and on clinical testing today, it does not appear that this
patient has sustained a major disc rupture.  He does,
however, have a
degenerate L4/5 disc which may well have been rendered symptomatic by the
lifting incident at work on 13 April 1987.
 I believe however that this
aggravation would have resolved within 6 months, although continued work with
bending and lifting may
have further aggravated him...  The patient's overall
prognosis from an orthopaedic point of view is reasonable, although his
presentation
today would lead one to believe that he is not returning to the
work force in the foreseeable future."
<P>

33	In a report of 26 August 1991, Dr Bodel concluded:-
<P>

	"He has some genuine disability at a degenerative L4/5 disc, ... the patient's
complaints of discomfort are again in excess of
that which can be supported by
the objective finding, although I do believe that he does have some genuine
disability...
<P>

	The patient in my view is still fit now for lighter duty work as long as it
avoided frequent bending, twisting or heavy lifting.
 I can find no objective
cause for the degree of his complaints, although I do accept some minor
mechanical back ache associated
with degenerative change at L4/5...
<P>

	The patient has a somewhat guarded prognosis because of degenerative change at
L4/5, but he is capable of a great deal more than
he will admit to, from the
assessment that I have made today."
<P>

34	In a report of 6 December 1996, Dr Bodel expressed the opinion, inter alia,
that:-
<P>

	"This patient suffered an injury to his back at work on 13.4.1987.  At most he
has suffered a minor disc injury that the L4/5 level.
<P>

	The patient's level of complaint at this stage, almost 10 years after the
injury, is medically inconsistent and unsupported by
objective findings on
clinical testing...
<P>

	The patient probably is not fit for unrestricted bending, twisting or lifting
and probably is not fit for his pre-injury work but
he is fit for a wide range
of alternative duties and has been so for many years.
<P>

	The patient presents as a very anxious individual and he has now been out of
work for a very long period of time and it appears
unlikely that he will return
to paid employment.
<P>

	His continuing genuine mechanical back ache is not inconsistent with a return
to appropriate modified work.
<P>

	...  I have seen a report from Dr Rushworth in which he feels there is very
little wrong with the patient and this is clinically
correct but I believe that
the patient does have minor disc pathology which could lead to mechanical back
symptoms."
<P>

35	The Plaintiff<b> </b>was seen again by Dr Bodel on 9 September 1998.  On
that occasion it is recorded that, in addition to matters concerning his lower
back, the Plaintiff "complains of some tenderness in the trapezius muscles at
the base of the neck but there is no palpable involuntary
muscle spasm.  The
patient has a reduced range of neck flexion, extension and rotation to about
50% of the expected range.  During
the course of the interview, however, he
demonstrated a greater range of rotation."
<P>

36	Dr Bodel's opinion included:-
<P>

	"It appears likely that he suffered a minor disc injury at the L4/5 level.
<P>

	Again the patient's level of complaint is unsupported by his objective
findings and there are signs of medical inconsistency.
<P>

	The patient really should have a repeat MRI scan of the lumbo sacral spine to
more accurately assess his current lumbar status.
<P>

	Based purely on his clinical presentation it appears likely that he is capable
of part time light duty work although it appears
most unlikely that he will
return to any form of paid employment."
<P>

37	In a further report of 15 September 1998, Dr Bodel said that based on
clinical presentation and the x-rays Dr Bodel had seen,
the Plaintiff  had
"approximately an 8% overall permanent impairment of function in the back
(which) has probably arisen as a result
of the injury at work on 13.4.1987."
Dr Bodel went on to say that there is no clinical evidence of work related
impairment of a number
of other parts of the body which he specified.
<P>

38	<b>Dr Henke</b>
<P>

Dr Henke is a consultant in rehabilitation medicine.  In a report of 25
November 1996 to the Plaintiff's solicitors, he recorded
that the Plaintiff's
unwillingness to allow examinations placed some restrictions on the conclusions
that could be arrived at but
that the Plaintiff's presentation was one of a
poorly muscled and de-conditioned man with some wasting of the left leg.  He
said
there was no evidence of neurological deficit but, given the x-ray
findings, such would not be expected.  He said that on the Plaintiff's
history
one would anticipate the Plaintiff probably had bio-mechanic disco-genic low
back pain without nerve root compression.  He
said the Plaintiff's condition
was compounded by his apparent belief that movement was potentially dangerous,
leading to increasing
levels of de-conditioning and poor muscle control.  Dr
Henke expressed the view that the Plaintiff continued to suffer from
disco-genic
back pain.  He concluded that the Plaintiff was potentially capable
of carrying out sedentary type duties such as light process work,
ticket
selling or perhaps as a console operator in a service station but it is
unlikely that he could do this for more than four
hours.  A later report of 29
June 1998, while not as detailed, is to similar effect.  
<P>

39	In a further report of 1 September 1998, Dr Henke said:-
<P>

	"Overall I would therefore be of the view that this man's potential for
employment is poor and the likelihood of him obtaining
employment at this time
is probably less than 25%.  If one ignores the job market issues it would be
considered that his earning
capacity is probably reduced by 50%.
<P>

	The institution of treatments such as a pain management programme associated
with psychiatric management for his dysthymic disorder
has about a fifty
percent probability of success.  Should such success occur then I believe that
the reduction in earning capacity
would still be a minimum of 30% and if the
treatments were unsuccessful then it would be unlikely that this man would
rejoin the
work force.  One could not rate the probability of success with the
pain management and psychiatric programs combined as better than
forty to fifty
percent."
<P>

40	<b>Dr Evans</b>
<P>

In a report of 15 November 1990 to the Defendant's solicitors Dr Evans
concluded:-
<P>

	"Mr Armaghanian, a large robust athlete, gives a history consistent with
lumbosacral disc prolapse in 1987 and later left sciatic
nerve root irritation.
The condition could not have been entirely due to the simple work performed but
symptoms could have been precipitated
in the alleged manner.
<P>

	There is a history indicating significant aggravation of symptoms of the
condition in September 1988, and though no cause is admitted,
I believe that
the aggravation was more than likely due to a private cause...
<P>

	The onset of symptoms in 1987 could only have occurred at work if there had
been a major contributory cause or causes.
<P>

	The present condition is in my view not significantly work related, since the
onset of symptoms was only coincidentally related
to work, and there has been a
major non-work-related aggravation in the intervening period."
<P>

41	Dr Evans opined that the Plaintiff would "remain unfit for heavy work for
about 5 years, before a late spontaneous recovery."

<P>

42	In a report of September 1992 Dr Evans advised that the Plaintiff should be
referred to a psychiatrist for support and treatment,
saying that the Plaintiff
was not significantly physically disabled although unsuitable for some tasks
including long or repetitive
stooping and lifting.  However, he regarded the
Plaintiff unfit for general employment because of his neurotic reaction.  The
physical
abnormality did not amount to more than 5% impairment of the whole
person. In a report of 1 October 1993, Dr Evans said that the
intensity of the
Plaintiff psychological overlay rendered it practically impossible to assess
the degree of genuine disability. 
He recommended psychiatric or psychological
referral.  In a report of December 1994 he repeated earlier findings to the
effect that
the Plaintiff retained good bulk and tonus of lumbar paravertebral
muscularture.  Again he regarded the Plaintiff fit to attend work
although
needing considerable attention from a rehabilitation coordinator.  He estimated
the Plaintiff was suffering from a 10% loss
of effective use of the back as
compared with a worst case.  
<P>

43	It is a clear inference from Dr Evans' reports that he had a deal of
scepticism concerning the Plaintiff.
<P>

44	<b>Dr Robbie</b>
<P>

Dr Robbie was one of four psychiatrists whose reports were tendered.  In a
report of December 1990 to the Defendant's solicitors
he indicated that the
Plaintiff's attitude during consultation had precluded any reliable
conclusion.
<P>

45	<b>Dr McMurdo</b>
<P>

In a report of October 1989 to the Defendant's solicitors, Dr McMurdo said that
the Plaintiff was despondent but not clinically
depressed.  In a report of
December 1993 he said that the Plaintiff was not suffering from a specific
psychiatric illness.  In a
report of January 1995 he said that the Plaintiff
was not overtly depressed or anxious and had no psychiatric disorder which
could
be attributed to the accident.  Dr McMurdo, at least in terms, seems to
accept that the Plaintiff's quality of life has been impaired
by pain. 
<P>

46	<b>Dr Mastroianni </b>
<P>

In reports to the Plaintiff's Solicitors of 14 and 23 April 1998, Dr
Mastroianni recorded that the Plaintiff was anxious and depressed.
 Dr
Mastroianni expressed the conclusion that the Plaintiff was suffering from
Chronic Dysthymic disorder precipitated by a number
of factors which he
enumerated.  Included in these were: "the emotional significance of being
unable to work due to back pain; the
loss of self esteem and confidence in
having failed to meet his own expectations as a husband and father; his
perceived inability
to control his pain or current life situation; (and) his
chronic fear that any movement will exacerbate his disability".  Dr Mastroianni
went on to discuss a number of factors which had or may have had a bearing on
his diagnosis.  Inter alia, Dr Mastroianni said that
the Plaintiff's emotional
distress has manifested itself as both anxiety and as somatic pain symptoms and
"his anxiety has also made
him reluctant to move his spine, resulting in
de-conditioned muscular tone".
<P>

47	Another of the factors to which Dr Mastroianni referred as one which had or
may have had a bearing on his diagnosis was malingering.
 In this regard he
said, inter alia, 
<P>

	"In the absence of any available objective evidence to the contrary, Mr
Armaghanian does not appear to display criteria often seen
in malingering such
as having a poor work record, prior incapacitating injuries, discrepant
capacity for work and recreation, anti
social personality traits or
inconsistency in symptom presentation."
<P>

48	Earlier in the report Dr Mastroianni had said "there is a consistency in Mr
Armaghanian's symptom presentation across all the
medical reports from 1987
until 1996.  Reports by Drs Sarian, Maniam, Morgan, Benczik, Selby-Brown, Grant
and Henke all confirm radiological
findings of disc bulging at L4/5 and L5/S1.
Nonetheless, the consensus opinion seems to be that Mr Armaghanian is "free of
neurological
signs"... all reports corroborate the Plaintiff's account that
rehabilitation proved of limited benefit in controlling his symptoms."
<P>

49	In that report, Dr Mastroianni also records that in 1996 Dr Sarian had
prescribed an anti-depressant for the Plaintiff's anxious
mood but that despite
good clinical effect the Plaintiff undertook the treatment for only 2 weeks,
discontinuing it "because I didn't
want to take it any more and depend on it".
And that in November 1997, the Plaintiff's dermatologist had prescribed
Sinequan at low
dosage.  This medication is reported to have relaxed the
Plaintiff but he ceased it after 9 days "due to his fears of becoming addicted
to the medications and that such medications would be bad for his health in the
long run."
<P>

50	In his report of 23 April, Dr Mastroianni addressed the extent of the
reduction in income earning capacity from which the  Plaintiff
suffered.  Dr
Mastroianni said that accurate assessment based on psychiatric impairment alone
was difficult and he was not qualified
to estimate the extent of physical
impairment.  He said however, that in general terms, a person's ability to earn
an income could
be reduced by up to 30% in the context of a Chronic Dysthynic
Disorder which remains untreated but in view of Mr Armaghanian's quick
and
significant improvement in mood symptoms during both brief trials of
anti-depressant medications, his loss of psychological symptoms
could have been
reduced to as low as 5-10% if he had continued to participate in the prescribed
anti-depressant treatments by both
Dr Sarian and his dermatologist.
<P>

51	<b>Dr Strum</b>
<P>

On behalf of the Defendant, Dr Strum saw the Plaintiff on 26 May 1998.  He
found the Plaintiff "a reluctant interviewee" and this
made it difficult to
make a diagnosis.  Dr Strum records that the Plaintiff said that his main
problem was pain, and anxiety and
depression were only related to attacks of
pain although it appears that the Plaintiff also said that he became depressed
because
of the fact that many doctors disbelieved him.  The Plaintiff told him
he had taken Sinequin (which I infer is the same as "Sinequan"
referred to by
Dr Mastroianni) but did not know whether he was helped by it.
<P>

52	Dr Strum concluded that Dr Mastroianni's diagnosis would be appropriate "if
the symptoms were not pain related, and Mr Armaghanian
feels anxious and
depressed most days for no definable reason".  Dr Strum could not convince
himself that there were other symptoms
of a Depressive Disorder present.  He
said that as the Plaintiff said he was in pain most days, Dr Strum thought the
Plaintiff's
reaction of depression and anxiety was fairly normal.
<P>

53	<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

Independently of the conclusions arrived at by Bruce J, these reports make it
clear that the Plaintiff has lost some part of the
efficient use of his back.
Dr Sarian estimated 50%, Dr Maniam 17&#189;%, Dr Rushworth 5-10% (of the lower
back), Dr Selby Brown 10%,
Dr Bodel 8% and Dr Evans 10%.  It is also clear that
the Plaintiff is not fit for, in the words of Dr Bodel, "unrestricted bending,
twisting or lifting" or, in the words of Dr Morris "stooping, bending or heavy
lifting".  Although there is evidence that such organic
problems as the
Plaintiff has had in recent years, or now suffers from, are the result of
degenerative changes rather than anything
that happened at work, the early
history and the fact that complaints of pain have continued make me think that,
at least in part,
the Plaintiff's current incapacity is due to the incident
which is the subject of the proceedings.  Indeed the contrary was not
suggested.
 Nor was it suggested that this would change in the future.
<P>

54	Any finding that the Plaintiff's incapacity is greater than indicated in the
preceding paragraph depends on an acceptance of
the Plaintiff's evidence and
that his presentation to the various medical practitioners to whom I have
referred has been generally
honest and reliable.  Given the relative lack of
objective evidence of injury or pain causing injury to the Plaintiff's back,
such
opinions of the doctors -I exclude the psychiatrists for the moment - as
are favourable to the Plaintiff's claim are necessarily
dependent to a large
degree on what he has told them.  And I am not persuaded that the Plaintiff has
presented an honest and reliable
picture of his condition.
<P>

55	One factor which, at the lowest, must raise doubts in this regard is the
substantial difference between the symptoms described
by the Plaintiff and what
the doctors, on the objective evidence, would expect.  However, I do not need
to resolve that difference.
 The inconsistency in actions recorded in the
medical reports to which I have referred is itself sufficient to lead to the
conclusion
just expressed.
<P>

56	A passage I have quoted from Dr Maniam's report is suggestive of such
inconsistency.  Dr Morris adverts to it when talking of
the flexing of the
Plaintiff's spine.  Dr Rushworth's reference to variations in actions and
freedom and comfort in sitting points
in the same direction.  Dr Bodel said
that the Plaintiff attempted to manufacture abnormal clinical signs and, albeit
when talking
of the Plaintiff's neck, a variation in the range of rotation.  In
all or virtually all of the activities mentioned in this regard,
the Plaintiff
demonstrated greater freedom of movement when not being formally examined than
when that was occurring or when compared
with his description of his
capabilities.
<P>

57	I do not forget the possibility that the Plaintiff, when being formally
examined, may have been somewhat tense and unconsciously
limited his actions to
some degree.  However the discrepancies seem to me so marked and so common that
the most probable explanation
is that that Plaintiff was dissembling and
manufacturing a degree of disability which did not exist.  I should add that,
although
I did not observe anything in the Plaintiff's demeanour which would
inspire me to believe him despite the matters to which I have
referred, neither
did I observe anything in his demeanour which caused me to disbelieve him.  He
did, frequently, poke his tongue
out in a fashion which seemed to me more than
a lick of his lips, but there was nothing to indicate the significance of this
or whether
it was a habit left over from childhood.
<P>

58	In reaching the conclusion expressed in the middle of the preceding
paragraph, I do not forget the evidence of Dr Mastroianni.
 However I do not
see in that evidence any explanation for the inconsistency in actions or
between actions and the Plaintiff's description
of what he could do, to which
other doctors referred.
<P>

59	I turn to the psychiatric evidence.  That of Dr McMurdo is straightforward.
Dr Strum's is somewhat question begging.  His explanation
of the cause of any
depression and anxiety from which the Plaintiff may be suffering is very
logical if the Plaintiff does suffer
the pain he alleges.  But if he does not!

<P>

60	Dr Strum's report offers the explanation of the Plaintiff being disbelieved
by doctors.  One may add that the prospects of not
recovering what the
Plaintiff wishes in this litigation would also be a possible explanation for a
degree of anxiety, particularly
after the time which has expired since the
accident and during which the Plaintiff has taken, whether rightly or wrongly,
honestly
or dishonestly, the view that he cannot work.  But perhaps more
significantly, Dr Strum does not, as I read his report, conclude
independently
of what the Plaintiff asserted, that the Plaintiff suffers from anxiety and
depression.
<P>

61	Dr Mastroianni, on the other hand does record that on examination the
Plaintiff was anxious and depressed and that his thought
content was
preoccupied with negative themes.  However I remain unpersuaded by his
diagnosis.
<P>

62	In the first place, as Dr Mastroianni records, a diagnosable mental disorder
requires that the syndromal pattern must not be
merely an expected response to
a particular event.  This statement is echoed in an annexure to Dr
Mastroianni's report where it is
said that a Dysthymic Disorder must be
distinguished from a disorder where "the mood disturbance is judged to be the
direct physiological
consequence of a specific, usually chronic, general
medical condition".  Even in the absence of Dr Strum's opinion, I would readily
conclude that if the Plaintiff suffers from the pain and disablement he
asserts, anxiety and depression (and other effects) would
follow.
<P>

63	In arriving at his diagnosis, Dr Mastroianni also considered and, as I read
the report, excluded "Abnormal Illness Behaviour"
including "conscious feigning
of exaggeration of symptoms as in ... malingering" as an explanation for the
Plaintiff's condition.
 He recorded that there was consistency in the
Plaintiff's symptom presentation.  I accept that there may have been
consistency in
the Plaintiff's complaints but evidence to which I have referred
demonstrates that there has been, on his part, a deal of inconsistency
also.  I
am unpersuaded by Dr Mastroianni's exclusion of malingering in arriving at his
diagnosis.
<P>

64	Although I do not rely on them, the differences between what the Plaintiff
said to Dr Mastroianni concerning the effect of Sinequin
and what he said to Dr
Strum and in evidence on this topic, also affect the weight of Dr Mastroianni's
diagnosis.  Dr Selby-Brown's
reference to this medication in his report of 24
March 1998 takes the matter no further.  I do not know what to believe as to
the
impact on the Plaintiff of this medication.
<P>

65	One is nevertheless left with Dr Mastroianni's recorded view that the
Plaintiff was anxious and depressed.  In that view, Dr
Mastroianni echoes those
of Dr Sarian (14 April 1998), Dr Maniam (16 February 1995), Dr Bodel (1989,
1996 and 1998), Dr Henke (25
November 1996), Dr Evans (16 December 1994) and Dr
Robbie (11 December 1990).  The weight of this evidence is such that one has to
accept that the Plaintiff has suffered from anxiety or depression or both for
an extended period.  
<P>

66	Nevertheless, neither this nor anything else persuades me that the Plaintiff
is or has been suffering from a psychotic disorder.
 There remain the
explanations adverted to when I was considering Dr Strum's report.  The fact of
being out of work provides another
explanation as does the existence, from
about the time of the accident or thereabouts, of this common law claim.  
<P>

67	The conclusion that the Plaintiff has suffered from anxiety or depression or
both does raise the questions whether, despite my
reservations concerning the
Plaintiff's honesty, I should conclude he does suffer from significant pain and
indeed whether those
reservations are justified.  
<P>

68	Having reflected on these matters, the conclusion at which I have arrived is
that the Plaintiff - and the onus of proof is on
him - has not established that
he is more restricted than indicated in the first paragraph of this part of my
Reasons and is not
incapacitated by significant pain.  I approach the
assessment of the Plaintiff's economic loss accordingly.  I accept that he is
not able to do the usual work of a machinist fitter and turner, which was his
occupation.  However, he has not established that his
capacities do not extend
to bench work or to, for example, the work of a ticket seller or service
station console operator.  The
latter activity might well involve the Plaintiff
in a small degree of training, but in the light of evidence he gave as to his
abilities
to learn new skills, I do not see this as other than a very minor
complication.
<P>

69	<b>Quantum</b>
<P>

The Plaintiff claimed that, but for the accident, he would have worked till at
least age 65, preferably with the Defendant.  At
the time of the accident the
Plaintiff was aged 44 and had been employed by the Defendant for some 7 years.
Previously he had a good
employment record.  He was very experienced in his
trade of a machinist fitter and turner.  He was married but did not own his own
home or have any substantial savings.  At the time of the trial before me
(November 1998) he had two children aged 3 and 9.  Largely
the source of the
matters to which I have just referred was the Plaintiff.  On these matters, I
accept him.
<P>

70	Evidence was given as to the wages which were earned by two other employees
of the Defendant who, prior to the Plaintiff's accident
were comparable with
him.  There is a significant difference between their income since the
Plaintiff's accident presumably due to
differences in the shifts,
responsibility and possible overtime they have undertaken.  However it was not
challenged that the average
of their income might fairly be taken as indicative
of what the Plaintiff would have earned had he remained as an employee of the
Defendant.  I take that view.  In Exhibit F, which provided most of this
evidence, there is however a gap, and some apparent inconsistency
for the year
1994/95.  It seems to me that the average for that year should be taken as some
figure between those for the previous
and succeeding years.  I have wondered
about taking a figure half way between the two, but increases from year to year
have clearly
not been regular.  The onus is on the Plaintiff to prove his case
and in the circumstances I think I should take a figure by adding
to the $678
for 1993/94 only $61, being 1/3 of the difference between that and the $861
figure for 1995/96.  The result is $739.
<P>

71	There was also evidence of the earnings of another employee, a Mr Bowes, but
this does not inspire me to adopt an approach different
from that indicated.
<P>

72	A complication arises because of the fact that, in 1995/1996 the Defendant
moved its operations from Broadway to Chullora and
there used quite a different
type of plant.  The work force was reduced by &#190; and to have any chance of
being included in the
employees who were retained, persons such as the
Plaintiff had to show that they had, or acquire, significant additional skills
to
those which had been required at Broadway.  The Plaintiff gave evidence
which I accept to the effect that training in these areas
would not have been a
problem, but it seems to me that his continued employment by the Defendant from
the time of the move can not
be assumed.
<P>

73	There was evidence of the award wage for people with his skills.  It is
hundreds of dollars less - in 1997/98 about $500 less,
than the average of the
amounts paid by the Defendant to the two comparable employees.  Except for this
and the evidence of what
the Defendant paid, there was no evidence of other
amounts paid to people with the Plaintiff's skills.  On the other hand, it is
reasonable to conclude that the Defendant would not have paid so much over the
award wage unless it was commercially required.  This
was occurring even back
in 1988 before the move to Chullora, and it seems to me that I should infer
that the award wage is not the
sole measure of remuneration, outside the
Defendant, for persons with the Plaintiff's experience and skills. 
<P>

74	Any estimate of what the Plaintiff, but for his accident, would have earned,
is difficult.  I think it proper to select the average
figure for the
comparable employees until the move to Chullora in 1995/96.  There was no
evidence as to the precise date of this
but it is reasonable to proceed on the
assumption it was at the end of 1995.  Thereafter the average figure should be
discounted
somewhat because of the prospect the Plaintiff would not have been
retained by the Defendant and would have been employed elsewhere
at a wage
nearer the award.  I would not discount to anything like the amount of the
award, nor would I simply take an average of
the two.  It seems to me that a
discount of 10% from the average of the comparable earnings is reasonable.
Because I think the Plaintiff
was a very employable person prior to his
accident, I do not intend to make any specific allowance for the possibility he
might have
been unemployed for a period in the event he did not continue with
the Defendant.
<P>

75	Evidence of what could be earned as a console operator or ticket seller
through much of the period with which I am concerned
was given and, it seems to
me should be accepted as indicative of what the Plaintiff could have earned,
and could earn, not only
in these occupations but, given his incapacity,
generally.  However the figures are not the same at any one time and vary at
different
times.  The variations are also at times different from the end of
financial year changes given for the earnings of the Defendant's
employees.
Recognition has also to be given to the likelihood, as I perceive it to be,
that the Plaintiff, because of his reduced
capacity, is not as employable as he
was.  I think it probable that even with the best will in the world, his
reduced capacity would
lead to some unemployment or time off which would not
otherwise have occurred.  This conclusion may be supported by the number of
unsuccessful job applications the Plaintiff has made, albeit the terms of these
may have well argued against their success.
<P>

76	It seems to me that a reasonable approximation of the value of the
Plaintiff's post accident capacity can be derived by taking
the figures in
exhibit D for full time employment, choosing the figure or figures which
applied for most of a year where there has
been a change within the year,
averaging these where there are figures for both console operators and ticket
sellers (to the nearest
$), and reducing the result by 10%.
<P>

77	Precision is not possible and I do not intend by selecting figures for
particular periods or other specific items to suggest
it is.  On the other
hand, it seems to me that a more reliable estimate of the value of his
incapacity is likely to be arrived at
by using figures the way I have than by
any less specific figuring or merely choosing a global sum.  The value of his
incapacity
should, it seems to me, be determined using the following figures:-

<b>Notes
</b></p>
</TD></TR></TABLE><p>
<P>

&#183;	1988/89.  There is a lack of figures for this year in exhibit F.  $472
represents 590/675 of $540 - these being figures which
are in that exhibit.
$208.80 is 90% of $232, this amount being taken from the following year in Ex D
after taking account of what
seems an obvious mistake in the figure of $332.
<P>

&#183;	1994/95  For the derivation of $739, see text above.
<P>

&#183;	1/7-31/12/1995  Figures from this time onwards in the "Earnings, no
accident" column reflect the average figures in exhibit
F less 10% referred to
in the text above.
<P>

&#183;	1998/99  There is no direct evidence concerning this year.
<P>

78	In arriving at the above I have taken no account of an argument advanced by
the Defendant that the extent and measure of the
Plaintiff's incapacity, at
least during some of the period, was to be determined reference to a decision
of the Workers Compensation
Court.  The evidence of this was contained in the
chronology which was tendered and the accuracy of which the Plaintiff verified.
The relevant part of the chronology was in the following terms:-
<P>

	"1 July 1993 Plaintiff awarded $70.00 per week compensation by Commissioner
Hopkins in Compensation Court."
<P>

79	It may be reasonable to conclude that the award was one made pursuant to
s11(1) of the Workers Compensation Act and in respect
of the injury with which
I am concerned.  It may be proper to infer it was for a period which was
ongoing but the commencing date
was not identified.  Information as to when the
Plaintiff left the Defendant's employ was in evidence but details of what
monies
he received on leaving, and on what account was not the subject of
evidence.  Relevant may be evidence given by the Plaintiff before
me that he
had done no paid work since leaving the employ of the Defendant in April
1989.
<P>

80	However, there was no other evidence of the basis of this award.  Even
putting aside the reservations of Clarke J in <b>Egri v DRG Australia Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2019%20NSWLR%20600" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 19 NSWLR 600</a> at 609 - see also <b>Feltham v St Vincent's Hospital</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%209%20NSWCCR%20547" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 9 NSWCCR 547</a> - as to the applicability of findings in Workers
Compensation proceedings to the issues with which I am concerned, the absence
of
evidence as to the basis of the award and the ultimate findings or
conclusions leading to it is fatal to the Defendant's argument
here.  For
example, I do not know what, within the terms of s 11(1), "may (have)
appear(ed) proper" in those proceedings.
<P>

81	As I indicated at the time of reserving judgment, the parties should have an
opportunity of checking the accuracy of the figures
in the above table.  The
figures for 1998/99 can hopefully be agreed between the parties.  If not I will
make an approximation based
on 1997/98 and prior annual increases.
<P>

82	These figures will allow the appropriate calculations of total past and, by
use of the multiplier appropriate to project the
figures until the Plaintiff's
65th birthday, future loss to be calculated.  The usual 15% discount for the
vicissitudes of life should
be applied to the figure so arrived at for future
economic loss.  During the course of addresses, counsel agreed that the
Defendant's
insurer had paid to the Plaintiff by way of "wages" the sum of
$30,723.56.  Exhibit 3, a letter of 7 August 1996, from the Defendant's
solicitors to the Plaintiff's solicitors also referred to a payment of
$166,946.  Whether or not the latter payment should be reflected
in any the
determination of the matters left to me by the Court of Appeal, it is probable
that the first certainly should be.  I
propose to publish these Reasons and
stand the matter over to enable the parties to make the appropriate
calculations.
<P>
