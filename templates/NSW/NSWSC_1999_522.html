<b>117447/98 - RE THE ESTATE OF MAVIS GWENDOLYN MORGAN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT </b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>This is an application for administration cta of the
estate of Mavis Gwendolyn Morgan.  Mavis Morgan died on 11 September 1998, aged
eighty-two.  At the time of her death she was living in Toukley.
<P>

2	On 3 April 1998 she made a will through Messrs Nash Allen Williams &amp;
Wotton solicitors of Toukley.  In this will she gave
her nieces, Alison and
Lesley one-third of the estate each and gave a quarter of a third to each of
the Aboriginal Childrens' Advancement
Society Ltd, Salvation Army, Catholic
Archdiocese of Sydney Chancery Office and the Royal Blind Society.  She made
her niece Alison
and Alison's husband her executors.
<P>

3	On the 29th of the same month the testatrix saw Mr Randall solicitor of
Newcastle.  She gave Mr Randall instructions.  He prepared
the will in
accordance with those instructions and posted it to her home at Toukley.  He
requested that the testatrix inform him
of the addresses of the nieces and of
Roy Charles Morgan, a nephew.
<P>

4	On 3 June 1998 the testatrix visited Mr Randall's office and delivered the
will to him duly executed.  This will has on it the
date 29 May 1998 and was
witnessed by two retired people in Toukley.  There is no doubt that if it were
not for a document to which
I am about to refer that that was the last will of
Mavis Morgan.
<P>

5	There is admitted in evidence as Exhibit PX02 a handwritten document in the
handwriting of the testatrix, which is headed "<u>WILL. June 1998</u>."  This
document on the first line sets out the testatrix's full name and address, then
the names of the two nieces and their husbands'
names in brackets, and their
addresses, and the nephew's address;  a six line note which also appeared in
both the April and May
wills as to how the testatrix wanted to be cremated and
where she wished her ashes to lay and then these words:
<P>

"(1.  As third (1/3) <u>each</u> to nieces Alison and Lesley (1/3 and 1/3)
<P>

(2.   The remaining one third to be <u>divided</u> between
<P>

1)    the nephew Roy Morgan - 49 Avon Road Pymble 2075
<P>

 
<P>

2.)   The Salvation Army
<P>

3)    Sydney City Mission
<P>

4)     Royal Blind Society
<P>

5)     The Aboriginal Childrens' Advancement Society Ltd".
<P>

6	The Royal Blind Society and the Aboriginal Childrens' Advancement Society Ltd
(to whom I will refer as "the opponents") seek administration,
with the will
annexed, of this handwritten piece of paper or,  alternatively, seek to defeat
the plaintiffs' claim to administration
cta of the May will.
<P>

7	Mr Anderson, solicitor of Messrs Lane and Lane, appears for the plaintiffs,
Mr Bryce Bridges for a beneficiary, the Wesley Mission,
which supports the
plaintiffs, and Miss Painter, of counsel, for the opponents.
<P>

8	The cases show that it is proper to admit a document which is not in proper
form as a will, as if it were a will, under s 18A
of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and
Administration Act 1898</a> if it passes three tests.
<P>

9	Applying what Powell J said in<b> Public Trustee v Commins</b> - 19 June 1992
unreported, the questions that must be asked are:   (1) is there a document?
(2)  does that document purport to record
the testamentary intention of the
relevant deceased?  and   (3) is the evidence before the court sufficient to
show that at the time
the document was brought into existence, or at some later
time, the testatrix by some act or words evidences her intention that the
document should without more constitute her will?
<P>

10	There seems little problem about satisfying the first two tests in the
present case. The critical question is whether the testatrix
intended that the
document without more should constitute her will.
<P>

11	There is some material to suggest that it might, but it seems to me that on
the balance of probabilities it is not.  The testatrix
well knew what a will
was.  She had gone to two different solicitors within the last three months of
her life.  She knew how to execute
a document as a will, so that this is not a
case of a person who is naive in will making.  Had she really intended this to
be her
will one would have thought she would have done it properly.  
<P>

12	Further, the testatrix sent the document to a solicitor.  Miss Painter says
that this reinforces the case that the document was
testamentary.  However,
this is unlikely to be the case.
<P>

13	First, Mr Randall had asked for the addresses of the beneficiaries and this
document does supply it.  It is more likely, to my
mind, that the document was
intended to be instructions for yet a third will.  The word "WILL" at the top,
to my mind, is equally
likely to be instructions for a will, or "how I would
like my next will to be" as with the document itself being a will.  There was
no nomination of an executor and it is unlikely, to my mind, that without more
the testatrix thought that this was a will.
<P>

14	Miss Painter put some store on the evidence of a person who said she was the
donation supervisor of the Royal Blind Society that
the testatrix had given
amounts between $20 and $100 for most of the fifteen years immediately
preceding her death. In cases where
the question is whether the testatrix knew
of the existence of a particular claimant, this sort of evidence is very
valuable.  However,
in the present case, there is no doubt from the April will
that the testatrix knew that this charity existed. The fact that a multi
millionairess was deluged with appeal letters over 15 years and gave up to $100
in most years is of no assistance in the present
case.  Indeed it might perhaps
be said that this charity's continued campaign of seeking donations when the
testatrix had requested
it to send no more than one appeal letter per year may
have been the reason for its deletion from the May will. However, this is
mere
speculation.  
<P>

15	Accordingly, I am not satisfied about the third matter which needs to be
established.  Thus, I will not admit the document PX02
as a testamentary
document: it follows that the plaintiffs are entitled to administration cta of
the will PX01 dated 29 May 1998.
 
<P>

16	I will refer the matter to the Registrar to complete the grant. I consider
that the opponents should pay the costs of the plaintiffs
of the contested
hearing.  The Wesley Mission must bear its own costs.
<P>

(Counsel for the opponents then addressed on costs and the solicitors for the
other parties replied)
<P>

17	Miss Painter has submitted that the costs should come out of the estate.
She said that a contradictor was needed as to the s
18A point and her clients
provided it.  I can see that there is something to be said for that view, and
there are cases where the
court does allow costs out of the estate where a
litigant has rendered assistance to the court in clearing up a difficult
matter;
 see <b>Smith v Kearney </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLawRp/1881/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1881] NSWLawRp 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281881%29%202%20LR%20%28NSW%29%20%28Eq%29%2028" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1881) 2 LR (NSW) (Eq) 28.</a> However, this
submission does not deal with the key questions that arise on questions of
costs in this type of case.
<P>

18	In probate cases, and cases in equity on the construction of wills, the
general rule is that if the problem has been caused by
the conduct or writings
of the deceased, the reasonable costs of all parties to resolve the problem
should be paid out of the deceased's
estate. This rule was noted as early as
<b>Davies v Gregory </b>(1873) LR 3 P &amp; D 28 and was applied in this State
in <b>Brown v M'Encroe </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLawRp/1890/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1890] NSWLawRp 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2011%20LR%20%28NSW%29%20%28Eq%29%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 11 LR (NSW) (Eq) 134</a>, 145.
<P>

19	The rule must be read subject to certain provisos such as a party seeking
costs must be able to say that on the information in
his or her possession at
the relevant time, competent counsel would consider that the case was fairly
arguable and not merely speculative:
 <b>Elders Trustee &amp; Executor Co Ltd v
Eastoe </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20WAR%2036" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] WAR 36</a>, 40.
<P>

20	Again, the wisdom of Rich, J in <b>Gleeson v Fitzpatrick </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1920] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2029%20CLR%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 29 CLR
29</a>, 38 should be noted. If a litigant considers that another party in a probate
or construction case is going to unnecessary expense,
such as briefing counsel,
it is expected that such party will warn that other party that such additional
costs will be the subject
of objection.
<P>

21	The rule is, as all so called "rules" in costs are framed, a guideline as to
the exercise of discretion. In applying the rule,
the court is usually
particularly tender to the position of a person named as executor of a will who
reasonably, though in the event,
unsuccessfully, propounds a will;  see eg
<b>Brown v Mott </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%20QWN%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] QWN 46.</a>
<P>

22	It some cases, courts have been more benign to charities than other
litigants;  see eg <b>Foundling Hospital and Infants' Home v Trustees Executors
&amp; Agency Co Ltd </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2019%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20383" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 19 ALJ 383</a>, 384 (HC).  It is very doubtful that
the same benign view would be taken in 1999 in the case of a large charity with
a fund raising
division which systematically seeks donations.
<P>

23	When all is said and done, in this case, realistically, the opponents saw an
estate worth $2.2 million and made an attempt to
secure many thousands of
dollars.  This failed. Despite Miss Painter's persuasive advocacy, it really
had little chance of succeeding.
 Charities should not think that they can have
a "free kick" in such circumstances. There is no reason why the normal
commercial
rule ought not to apply that failed applicants should pay the costs
caused to others by the application.
<P>

24	I thus adhere to the order for costs noted earlier.
