NEWCASTLE:  TUESDAY 24 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. ERNICE DOROTHY DAVIS</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Ernice Davis has pleaded guilty to an offence under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s316.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.316</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.  She stood charged that between 12 and 15
November 1998 at Beechwood, a small town west of Wauchope, knowing that her
son, Troy
Clayton Davis, had committed the serious offence of murder, being the
killing of Robert Christopher Spradbrow, she failed, without
reasonable excuse,
to bring information which might be of material assistance in the prosecution
of her son to the attention of a
member of the Police Force.
<P>

2  	Detailed facts set out in Exhibit C in the sentence proceedings
have been provided to me.  I will not set out those facts as
they appear in
that exhibit verbatim, but certain of them should appear in these reasons.
<P>

3  	At approximately 11.30 pm on Thursday 12 November 1998, Troy
Davis shot and killed Robert Spradbrow.  The shooting took place
on the beach
of an island named Kooree Island.  Present at the time of the shooting was Troy
Davis' half-brother, the son of the
prisoner, Dean Lulham, who had provided to
his younger brother a rifle and who, on the Crown case, provided lighting so
that the
deceased might be shot.
<P>

4  	It was the Crown case that Dean Lulham and Troy Davis had for a
long time, for good or ill reason, believed in the existence
of grievances
against the deceased for his, in their belief, ill-treatment of them.   There
is no doubt, on the Crown case, that
both brothers were highly intoxicated at
the time at which a resolution to murder the deceased was reached.  It was the
Crown case
that Dean Lulham had counselled and procured or incited his younger
brother to the commission of the offence.  It was the case of
Troy Davis that
he was reluctant to commit the offence but was prevailed upon to do it. 
<P>

5  	After the deceased had been shot, Davis returned to the car.
Lulham drove them back to Beechwood.  On the way the rifle was
secreted in a
gully at the side of the road.  Lulham retired for the night and apparently
went to sleep.  Davis and Moran remained
awake.  They attempted to move the
motor vehicle belonging to the prisoner.
<P>

6  	Some time after 4.00 am, the prisoner intercepted Davis and
Bradley Moran in shifting that motor vehicle.  It was explained
to her by Davis
that he wanted to drive the vehicle.  She declined to allow him to drive the
vehicle but said she would drive him
herself, because she did not want him
driving drunk. 
<P>

7  	She drove him to the area of the cemetery and there Moran and
Davis looked around at the area, locating the secreted rifle.
 The rifle was
taken back to the car and the prisoner drove Moran and Davis to an area called
Murray's Turn-Off, where the rifle
was again secreted.  The prisoner returned
them to her home, where they all retired.
<P>

8  	The deceased's death was discovered about three hours later -
that is, about 7.30 am on the morning of Friday 13 November. 
It was not until
about 2.00 pm that day that the death was treated as suspicious.  Shortly after
10.00 pm that day the prisoner drove
Dean Lulham to the area of the shooting.
When they arrived the police were present and Lulham was taken to the Port
Macquarie Police
Station where he was interviewed.  The prisoner returned home.
About 2.00 am on the morning of the 14 November the police arrived
and executed
a search warrant.  The prisoner was arrested, as were Troy Davis and Bradley
Moran.
<P>

9  	At about 4.50 am the prisoner took part in an electronically
recorded interview and told the police that at about 4.00 am on
the 13
November, her son Troy had awoken her and asked for a cigarette;  but that she
had subsequently heard the sound of a car being
moved;  that she told Moran and
Troy Davis that they were too drunk, had agreed to drive them but said that
when they searched in
the vicinity of the cemetery she did not know what they
were doing until they returned with the gun.
<P>

10  	She admitted driving Moran and Davis to Murray's Turn-Off, where
they got rid of the gun, and that her son had told her on
the return to her
home that he had shot the deceased.  She had told the police she thought Troy
Davis was joking.  She told the police
she did not know what to think when they
brought the gun to the car.
<P>

11  	She was asked a question concerning what Davis had said, and in
particular that he had told his mother about the shooting before
she drove them
to the cemetery, and she replied (question 76):-
<P>

"Yeah, that is when I thought he was joking, but I believed him when I got
back."
<P>

12  	She told the police she did not still believe he was joking when
she had seen the gun.  She maintained that she had thought
her son was fooling
around at the time.
<P>

13  	There is some difference between the version originally given to
the police and that told subsequently, but there can be no
doubt that early in
the morning of the 13th she became aware that her son Troy was asserting that
he had killed the deceased.
<P>

14  	She told the police that she knew what had been done was wrong;
that she did not go to the police earlier because the persons
concerned were
her sons;  and in the electronically recorded interview with suspected persons,
at question 128 she referred to her
having said to her son:-
<P>

"Troy, you are going to have to go and give yourself up."
<P>

15  	After thus advising her son she could not sleep anymore, and she
was waiting for her other son.  She thought about contacting
the police, but
did not, because she was scared, because they were her sons.  She knew they did
wrong, but did not know how she felt.
 She was scared of what might happen to
her sons.
<P>

16  	Later she told Troy again that there was something he "had to
tend to", meaning that she had to give himself up.  She advised
him to "put up
with the consequences, don't run".
<P>

17  	During this time it is perfectly apparent from what she said to
the police concerning her state of mind and her asthma that
she was suffering
severely from anxiety and asthma, and that has been confirmed as being her
general condition from the time at least
of the commission of the offence until
the present, in the Probation and Parole Service's report and in the evidence
given by that
officer concerning the contact with the prisoner's medical
adviser.
<P>

18  	At no time prior to her arrest had the prisoner attempted to
bring to the attention of the police the information that she
had obtained from
Troy Davis as to his crime.
<P>

19  	She was originally charged with being an accessory after the
fact to the murder.  She was committed for trial on that charge.
 However,
reconsideration was given by the Crown to the appropriate charge and on 23
August 1999 she was arraigned on that charge
and pleaded guilty to it at the
first opportunity.  She had indicated a willingness to plead guilty to it some
days earlier.
<P>

20  	That charge is punishable by a maximum penalty of two years
imprisonment and is customarily dealt with by a magistrate on a
summary
basis.
<P>

21  	The prisoner has no previous record and has spent no time in
custody.  Further, she had expressed a willingness to co-operate
and assist the
authorities from the time of her original electronically recorded interview as
to matters of general factual context.
 She expressed a particular willingness
to be able to give evidence as to the true facts as far as her son Troy Davis
was concerned,
and as far as the proceedings were concerned against Bradley
Moran.  
<P>

22  	Mr. Moran has, however, himself pleaded guilty to an offence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s316.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.316</a> and is has not been necessary for the Crown to avail itself of the
prisoner's assistance in those proceedings.
<P>

23  	There has been provided to me a Probation and Parole Service
report.  That report was provided at short notice.  It is Exhibit
B in the
proceedings.
<P>

24  	She has lived in Beechwood for over 29 years in the one home and
has been estranged from her husband for twenty years.  She
has the asthmatic
and anxiety conditions to which I have referred.   She is now 56 years of age.
She has some assistance from her
daughter. 
<P>

25  	Due to her geographic location, attendance centre orders or
periodic detention are not available.  Although she might perform
some
functions which might fit within the definition of community service, she has
indicated a degree of anxiety in respect of performing
those functions.
<P>

26  	Ms. Rennard of Probation and Parole gave evidence before me, and
in particular that in her view the prisoner's personal development
would be
assisted by participation in alcohol and personal self-esteem development
programmes provided by the Probation and Parole
Service, and that an order for
general supervision should be included as part of a recognisance, not because
that order might relate
particularly to the avoidance of any particular risk of
future criminality, but because it might aid the prisoner in her own life.
<P>

27  	Ms. Rennard further gave evidence that since there was some
matter of alcohol related to the commission of the offence and
some inability
to withstand the pressures of being a mother placed in such a dreadful
situation, that the prisoner might benefit
and future criminality be avoided by
orders for supervision.
<P>

28  	Having heard the evidence of the Probation and Parole Service
officer, the Crown conceded that it did not seem as though any
particular risk
of re-offending might exist such as might warrant the making of such orders as
would impose such a restriction upon
the prisoner's future life.	
<P>

29  	It is clearly a matter for her to relieve her own anxiety and
asthma conditions by obtaining the appropriate medical or other
assistance.
<P>

30  	I accept the view that has been espoused in many of the cases
that to impose a term of recognisance in punishment for a criminal
offence
simply for the general betterment of the conditions of the prisoner may be to
exceed the purpose for which the recognisance
exists.  In this case the
concession of the Crown that supervision is not particularly required is, in my
view, an entirely proper
one, and indeed, in the context of this case, on the
evidence, really the only appropriate course.
<P>

31  	The law does not disregard normal human passions and emotions
and relationships.  The practicality of this case is that this
mother, at a
difficult time, was confronted with an appalling and bizarre situation.  She
did nothing positive to put justice at
risk once she was aware of the
commission of the offence.  She did urge her son to surrender himself, but she
did commit this offence
in that she did not herself turn him in.
<P>

32  	The burden the law imposes on a mother in those circumstances
has to be considered in the light of the conflict that it generates
with
ordinary human passion.  Having regard to that frailty, having regard to the
fact that the prisoner has no prior criminal record,
nor would it seem likely,
given the circumstances of this offence, that the prisoner might have any
future criminal record, I do
not regard it as a matter in which a conviction is
called for.  It is, however, a matter in which I am minded to impose a
recognisance,
and therefore, considering the facts and the provisions of s.556A
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, I discharge the prisoner conditionally upon her entering
into a recognisance, self, in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour
for a
period of 18 months and to appear for conviction and sentence if called on at
any time during such period.  That recognisance
may be entered before a
magistrate.  I am not making any other direction for supervision.
<P>
