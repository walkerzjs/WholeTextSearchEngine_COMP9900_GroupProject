<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 5 November instant the Court heard
concurrently two applications, one by Darren Alan Slater, and the other by
Nathan Isaac Michael.
Each application is brought pursuant to s.13A of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> (NSW)</b>, ["the Act"]. Each application seeks the
re-determination, in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A</a> of the Act, of a sentence of life
imprisonment to which each applicant is currently subject. 
<P>

2  	The Serious Offenders Review Council has submitted in connection
with each application a comprehensive report. Each such report
summarises as
follows the relevant factual background:
<P>

<i>"The circumstances of the offence were that on 9 September 1989 MICHAEL and
SLATER (both eighteen years of age) met the young female
victim outside a night
club and drove her to a deserted area. They put her out of the car when she
declined to have sex with MICHAEL.
SLATER punched her and requested MICHAEL to
hand him a baseball bat out of the vehicle. SLATER used the baseball bat to
strike the
victim across the back of the head. SLATER removed the victim's
jeans and boots with MICHAEL'S assistance. MICHAEL and SLATER then
drove away
with some of the victim's clothes. After driving a short distance they
returned, fearing that the victim may be able to
identify their vehicle and
report the matter to the police. They drove the victim to a deserted area near
Flat Rock Creek Dam. While
still alive, they dragged her to the edge of the dam
and pushed her over an observation deck, where she fell more than 8-1/2 metres,
falling onto a concrete pump house, valve house. She sustained gross head and
brain injuries and a broken neck, dying almost immediately."</i>
<P>

3  	The <i>"young female victim"</i> to whom reference is made in
that quoted material was Miss Colleen Joy McIlwain. Miss McIlwain had been born
on 22 December 1963.
She was, therefore, aged 25 years and not quite 9 months
when she met her death at the hands of the two present applicants.
<P>

4  	The facts as thus summarised were not disputed by either
applicant at the recent hearing. It is, however, necessary for present
purposes
to look more closely at some particular aspects of the facts as thus
summarised. In that connection:
<P>

(1)	Dr. William Ryan, a medical practitioner who inspected the victim's body at
the site where it had been left after the killing,
and about 9 hours after the
killing had occurred, noted, in addition to the substantial head injuries which
were the immediate cause
of death, the following additional injuries:
<P>

	(a)	Injuries above the right eyebrow and to the lip area of the upper jaw,
each of which was consistent with a blow or possibly
a punch.
<P>

	(b)	A wound to the back of the head which was consistent with a  blow from a
baseball bat.
<P>

	(c)	Deep bruising to the front of the throat which was consistent with
attempted strangulation or throttling.
<P>

(2)	Both Mr. Slater and Mr. Michael were put on trial charged with the murder
of Miss McIlwain. For reasons not now material they
were ultimately tried
separately. Each pleaded not guilty. Each was found guilty by the verdict of a
jury. Mr. Michael was the first
of the two men to be dealt with. He was found
guilty of murder by a verdict returned on 3 July 1990. He was sentenced on 27
July
1990, and by Finlay J of this Court, to penal servitude for life
commencing on 11 September 1989. Mr. Slater was found guilty by
a verdict
returned on 14 August 1990. He was sentenced on 12 October 1990, and by Loveday
J of this Court, to penal servitude for
life, dated from 28 June 1990.
<P>

	Mr. Michael was called as a witness for the Crown in the trial of Mr. Slater.
His evidence was consistent, as I understand the
fact, with the substance of a
statement which he gave to the relevant authorities on 3 August 1990 after he
had himself been tried,
convicted and sentenced. It is relevant to note the
detail of paragraph 16 of that statement. The paragraph is in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>"I don't know how Darren got her into the car, but when I got back there she
was already on the back seat. So I threw her clothes
in the back with her and
we took off. I then asked Darren "Where are we going?". He said "To the river,
just keep driving, I'll give
you directions". He then told me to turn here,
turn there. Then he said "Turn around here, we've already past it". It was just
a
dead end where we were at the time, so I turned around and drove back and he
said "It's the dirt road here on the right". I said
"Are you sure this is it?".
He said "Yeah, I used to ride my motor bike in here". So I turned down the road
and started to follow
the track up, but it got too bumpy and I said "I'm going
no further". He said "That's alright, we'll here(sic). It's far enough".
So I
stopped the car and Darren jumped out and put the seat forward and dragged her
out by the arms. He dragged her along the dirt
in front of the car and started
to head down this track. While he was still in the range of my lights, he
stopped and called out
"Come on cunt you were in it too". When I just stayed
there for a minute he called it out again so I got out and went over to where
he was and grabbed her by the legs. By this time she wasn't moving or saying
anything. I picked her legs up, Darren had hold of her
under the arms and by
the shoulders. He was walking backwards and we headed down along the track. As
we were carrying her along,
Darren was pulling and saying "Come on". Trying to
get me to hurry. It was very dark at the time and I couldn't see where I was
going
and I remember stumbling once and dropping her feet. Darren then said,
"Come on, pick her up". So I did and we keep going along.
When we got up the
walkway a bit, Darren said "This will do, put her down here". So I let her legs
go and he put her top half down.
He then said "Come on give us a hand to roll
her over". I said "What is it down there?". He said "It's all rock down there".
I put
my hands on about her thigh area and pushed had her by the shoulder and
pushed also. At the time she was on her back. I don't remember
exactly how far
we pushed her, but the next thing she just went over the side and that was it.
The next thing I heard was a splat
sound and I panicked and ran back up to the
car." </i>(I read this as meaning : <i>".........and pushed her. Darren had her
by the shoulder and pushed also."</i>)
<P>

(3)	I accept for present purposes that what is thus stated in paragraph 16 of
Mr. Michael's statement is reliable. That is a matter
of some significance for
present purposes because, in the immediate wake of the killing, both applicants
were interviewed extensively
by the investigating police. In large part, the
versions thus given by the two applicants are consistent each with the other;
but
there are significant differences. The version given by Mr. Slater, the
detail of which it is not necessary to set out here, sought
to give the
impression, to say the very least, that Mr. Michael had been much the more
active of the two men in ensuring that Miss
McIlwain did in fact fall from the
observation platform and onto the concrete slab lying below it. 
<P>

	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, although the conduct of both
applicants was criminally culpable in high degree, and
although there is not a
great deal of difference between their respective particular criminal
culpability, it is, nevertheless, Mr.
Slater who was the instigator of the plan
to dispose of Miss McIlwain. I am satisfied, similarly, that it was Mr. Slater
who chose
the Flat Rock Creek Dam as the place where that evil deed might be
done; and that he was as directly implicated as Mr. Michael in
the doing of the
acts which caused Miss McIlwain to fall to her death.
<P>

(4)	Two further questions, each of which is important for present purposes, can
now be considered. The first of them is whether
Miss McIlwain was alive at the
time she fell to her death. The second of them is whether, if alive, she was
conscious at that time.

<P>

	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Miss McIlwain was alive when she
fell to her death.  Paragraph 16 of Mr. Michael's
affidavit gives no specific
assistance on the point; but I think that the evidence otherwise available is
sufficient to establish
that fact beyond reasonable doubt.
<P>

(5)	Much more difficult to resolve is the question whether Miss McIlwain was
not only alive, but conscious, as she fell to her death.
Paragraph 16 of Mr.
Michael's statement suggests to me that she was not. There are suggestions to
the contrary in other pieces of
evidence; but I do not think that they go
beyond establishing a possibility that Miss McIlwain was conscious as well as
living as
she fell to her death. I am not persuaded to a finding, reached
beyond reasonable doubt, that Miss McIlwain was conscious at that
time.
<P>

5  	The foregoing factual matters having been established, it is
convenient to turn to a more particular consideration of the detailed
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13A</a> of the Act, which provisions govern the way in which the
Court is required to deal with applications of the present kind. It is
convenient
to look, first, at sub-section (4A) which provides, relevantly, as
follows:
<P>

<i>"(4A)	In considering such an application, the Supreme Court is to have
regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for
which the life
sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person
has been convicted at any time......................"</i>
<P>

6  	<i>"(A)ll the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the
life sentence was imposed"</i> indicate, in the present case, a truly appalling
crime. In my opinion, the murder of Miss McIlwain is properly to be
characterised
as in the worst case category. I have taken into account, in
forming that opinion, the following principles which were approved by
the Court
of Criminal Appeal in <b>Reg v Twala</b>: unreported; CCA (NSW); 4 November
1994:
<P>

<i>"However, in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case
category, it must be possible to point to particular features
which are of very
great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts
mitigating the seriousness of the crime
(as distinct from subjective features
mitigating the penalty to be imposed). </i>[per Badgery-Parker J at p.7]
<P>

7  	As to criminal antecedents, Mr. Michael, when he stood for
sentence, had none; and Mr. Slater had six previous matters noted
on his
record, all of which matters were either drink-driving offences or other motor
vehicle-related offences. The only relevance
for present purposes of those
convictions is that they tend to confirm the picture, established otherwise by
the evidence, of Mr.
Slater as having been at the time of Miss McIlwain's
murder a young man with a severe alcohol problem.
<P>

8  	It is necessary to consider, next, the provisions of sub-section
(9). That sub-section provides, relevantly, as follows:
<P>

<i>"(9)	The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section, is
to have regard to:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced
to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on
licence under section
463 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> and of the practice relating to the issue of such
licence; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other
relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example,
reports on
the person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to
the Supreme Court; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the need to preserve the safety of the community, and </i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and
also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application),</i>
<P>

<i>and may have regard to any other relevant matter."</i>
<P>

9  	Sub-section 9(a) was considered by Finlay J in <b>Reg v
Clarke</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2048%20ACrimR%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 48 ACrimR 100</a>, which matter was one of the earliest
re-determination applications brought pursuant to section 13A of the Act. In
connection with
the requirements of sub-section 9(a), Finlay J notes the
following relevant matters:
<P>

<i>"It is appropriate that the Court have regard to the statistics as to the
former releases on licence of prisoners serving life sentences.
In saying that,
it must be acknowledged that such statistics can be misleading. The offence of
murder encompasses a whole range of
circumstances where the act of the offender
causing the death charged was done with reckless indifference to human life or
with intent
to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person (as
well as felony murder). So on the one hand, an offender under former
legislation may have been sentenced to what was then a mandatory life sentence
where what he did was acceding to the wishes of a
terminally ill relative, or
on the other hand, it may encompass an horrendous gruesome sadistic
killing.</i>
<P>

<i>An annexure to the report of the Serious Offenders Review Board before me in
the present case sets out statistical information relating
to prisoners serving
life sentences:</i>
<P>

<i>"..... who were either released by the Indeterminate Sentence Committee
(ISC) between October 1981 and September 1983, released by
the Release on
Licence Board between February 1984 and October 1987 or who were still in gaol
on the 1st July 1989."</i>
<P>

<i>That section of the report concluded:</i>
<P>

<i>"The mean length of time served before their first release on licence by the
161 prisoners was 11.7 years (minimum of 3, maximum of
34 years), and 149
(92.5%) prisoners had served 15 years or less. Of the 238 lifers still in
prison, 32 (13.4%) have been in prison
more than 12 years and 13 (5.5%) for
more than 15 years."</i>
<P>

<i>The report is accompanied by graphs showing in columns the percentage
released in each year of imprisonment. This indicates, for example,
that about
20 per cent were released in the year when they had served 10 years; a little
under 15 per cent were released in the year
having served 11 years; and a
little over 10 per cent were released in the year having served 12 years."
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=48%20ACrimR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[48 ACrimR, 104]</a>
<P>

10  	I think that it is a fair application of sub-section (9)(a) to
the present matters, to proceed upon the basis that the Judges
who sentenced
the present applicants would have understood that the murder in question was so
dreadful a crime that it was likely
that the applicants, if released on licence
at all under the previous licence-release scheme, would not be so released
until after
each of them had served a sentence that was well toward the upper
end of the generally accepted practical range.
<P>

11  	As to the requirements of sub-section (9)(b), I have read and
considered the contents of the reports made available by the
Serious Offenders
Review Council. I have considered, as well, all of the material put forward by
each of the applicants in aid of
the submission, which was advanced by each
applicant, of demonstrated substantial progress towards rehabilitation.
<P>

12  	In the matter of rehabilitation, the cases of the two applicants
have striking similarities. Each applicant has been, generally
speaking, what
might be described as a model prisoner. Each prisoner has at present a C1
classification, which entails, put simply
and in the terms of the relevant
Regulation, confinement <i>"by a physical barrier unless in the company of an
officer"</i>.<i> </i>Each appears to have benefited from psychological and the
like support and counselling, so as to have come to a proper appreciation
of
the terrible responsibility that each man bears for what happened to Miss
McIlwain. Each applicant appears to have made continuing,
and significantly
successful, attempts to acquire improved educational skills, together with a
range of practical skills of a kind
that are likely to assist in a real way in
the obtaining by each applicant of lawful and gainful employment if and when he
is released
on parole back into the general community.
<P>

13  	It is appropriate to conclude this discussion of the sub-section
(9)(b) requirements by adverting to the particular comments
of the Serious
Offenders Review Council in connection with the present applications.
<P>

14  	Of Mr. Slater, the Review Council makes the following
comments:
<P>

<i>"This inmate has shown great potential to benefit from the Inmate
Development Services within the Corrective Services system. Should
his life
sentence be determined then, subject to any drug or association problems, he
will be encouraged to continue to do so, particularly
in the areas of Drug and
Alcohol and Psychology with a view to further reduction in security
classification when appropriate with
eventual progression with unsupervised
leave programs directed towards his eventual re-integration to the
community."</i>
<P>

15  	As to Mr. Michael, the Review Council comments:
<P>

<i>"MICHAEL appears to have made strong efforts to benefit from his period of
incarceration to date and from Inmate Development Services
facilities. His
attempts have been limited by the need, not his fault, to keep him in secure
custody for almost all of that period.
</i>
<P>

<i>If his sentence is re-determined the Council will continue to encourage him
to progress through the correctional system to, when appropriate,
minimum
security classification and unsupervised pre-release programs with the
objective of his being ready for re-integration into
the community at the
expiration of his minimum term."</i>
<P>

16  	As to the requirements of sub-section (9)(c), there are two
aspects of the need, in the cases of the present applicants, to
ensure the
continuing protection of the public.
<P>

17  	There is, <i>first</i>, a need to ensure in a general sense that
the present applications, if granted, do not lead in time to a state of affairs
in which
either applicant is at large in the community in circumstances likely
to endanger the life, or the physical safety otherwise, of
any member of the
community.
<P>

18  	There is, of course, an obvious need to be careful in that
respect. That need does not entail, however, a need to refuse outright
either
of the present applications. Even if the Court accedes to the applications and
fixes for each applicant a determinate sentence,
the Serious Offenders Review
Council will monitor constantly the implementation of the terms of that
sentence. If, at the completion
of any minimum term set for either of the
applicants, the Review Council is of the opinion that that applicant is not yet
ready to
be released on parole back into the community, then the Review Council
has, and will no doubt exercise, the necessary powers to ensure
that the
applicant is not in fact so released. Even if the applicants are released to
parole at the expiration of minimum terms set
for them by this Court, their
conduct on parole will be the subject of constant monitoring by the proper
authorities.
<P>

19  	<i>Secondly</i>, there is a need in the present particular cases
to have regard to something that is said by Mrs. Hazel McIlwain, the mother of
the
late Miss McIlwain, who has made a Victim Impact Statement, which has been
admitted into evidence as Exhibit H. It will be necessary
to refer later to
this document, but for the present it is sufficient to note the following
particular things said by Mrs. McIlwain:
<P>

<i>"I would be frightened if they were let out. As it is, I can't have anyone
walking behind me. I can't go on holidays, as I feel something
might happen to
me. I am very frightened of the dark and will only drive my car in town,
because if it broke down in the country,
I might get
murdered..................."</i>
<P>

20  	Mrs. McIlwain is a lady aged some 72 years. She is, in practical
terms, alone in the world. It is a terrible thing that such
a person should be
spending the twilight of her life under such shadows as she describes. I do not
find it in the least surprising
that Mrs. McIlwain has the apprehensions of
which she speaks in her statement. Her entire statement will be sent, by
direction of
this Court, which direction I now formally give, to the
Commissioner of Corrective Services and to the Serious Offenders Review Council
with a request that a copy of the statement be kept at all times as part of the
respective official files of the two applicants.
The Court's intention in
giving such a direction is that if, in due course, the applicants are released
to parole, then the conditions
of their parole should be particular and
explicit in requiring that the applicants not contact in any way whatsoever, or
cause anybody
else to contact in any such way, either Mrs. McIlwain herself, or
any other surviving member of her family.
<P>

21  	As to the requirements of sub-section (9)(d), the relevant
particulars can be stated simply and as follows:
<P>

(1)	Mr. Michael was born on 21 January 1971. He was aged 18 years and about 8
months as of 9 September 1989, the date of the murder.
He was aged 19 years and
about 6 months when he stood for sentence on 27 July 1990. He was aged 28 years
and about 10 months when
this Court heard his application. 
<P>

(2)	Mr. Slater was born on 14 April 1971. He was aged 18 years and about 5
months as of 9 September 1989, the date of the murder.
He was aged 19 years and
about 6 months when he stood for sentence on 12 October 1990. He was aged 28
years and about 7 months when
this Court heard his application.
<P>

22  	There are additional relevant matters to which the Court should
have regard in connection with each of the present applications.
They are as
follows:
<P>

1)	I take it to be now well settled law that an application, made pursuant to
section 13A of the Act, for the re-determination of
an existing life sentence
should only be refused in those cases where, after further review, the Court to
which the application is
made considers that the particular applicant should
never be released; or, alternatively, where the Court to which the application
is made is not satisfied at the time of the application that the applicant
should be released: see per Wood CJ at CL in <b>Reg v Sorenson</b>: unreported,
Supreme Court NSW, 6 September 1990; followed and applied by Abadee J in <b>Reg
v Malcolm</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2058%20ACrimR%20148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 58 ACrimR 148</a> at 158. At the recent hearing, the learned
Crown Prosecutor indicated, in response to a question from the Bench, that the
Crown did
not contend that either of the present applications should be simply
dismissed.
<P>

2)	Each applicant has served, already, a substantial period of full-time
custody. Mr. Michael has spent in continuous custody until
today 10 years and
about 3-1/2 months. Mr. Slater has served 9 years and about 11 months.
<P>

3)	Each applicant has spent a not insignificant portion of his time in custody
to date in some form of protected custody. The best
available information
suggests that Mr. Michael has spent some 5 years 6-1/2 months, and that Mr.
Slater has spent some 3 years and
7 months in such protected custody. I think
that it must be accepted that the nature of prison life is such that a prisoner
who is
in any form of protected custody is, without more, at greater risk from
other inmates, especially inmates who are in the general
 prison population.
That consideration is, I think, of particular importance in Mr. Michael's case,
he having been a Crown witness
against his co-offender. 
<P>

4)	I advert, once again, to the victim impact statement of Mrs. Hazel
McIlwain.
<P>

	It is provided by section 23C(3) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act 1986</a>
(NSW)</b> that:
<P>

<i>"The Supreme Court ...............must receive a victim impact statement
given by a family victim under this section and acknowledge
its receipt and may
make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate. However, the court
must not consider the statement
in connection with the determination of the
punishment for the offence unless the court considers that it is appropriate to
do so."</i>
<P>

	In <b>Reg v Previtera</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20ACrimR%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 ACrimR 76</a> at 85, Hunt CJ at CL expressed,
and explained, the view that it could never be appropriate to take a victim
impact statement into
account in determining what actual sentence should be
passed upon the offender whose crime had caused the loss to which the
particular
victim impact statement is addressed. The stance thus taken by Hunt
CJ at CL has been consistently followed in subsequent decisions
dealing with
the point.
<P>

	The Court would wish, however, not merely to receive and to acknowledge Mrs.
McIlwain's statement; but to assure her that the Court
has read and considered
the contents of the statement; is moved by them; and hopes that the opportunity
which Mrs. McIlwain has had
to express her feelings of grief and loss, and to
have a proper public respect paid to what she has had to say, will at least do
something to relieve, to however small an extent, the burdens that her
daughter's cruel death have imposed upon her.
<P>

5)	In fixing determinate sentences, as I propose to do, I am of the opinion
that such a sentence passed upon Mr. Slater should be
somewhat heavier than one
passed upon Mr. Michael. Given the facts of the present case, I do not think
that the difference should
be very great; but I think that it should be
distinct. My reasons are:
<P>

	(a)	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr. Slater who
suggested that Miss McIlwain should be silenced and her body
disposed of; and
who thereafter chose the location and the method. 
<P>

	(b)	Mr. Michael gave evidence for the Crown at Mr. Slater's trial. This
cooperation, and its practical consequences for Mr. Michael,
deserve some real,
albeit prudently measured, recognition.
<P>

6)	The dating of any determinate sentence passed upon Mr. Slater needs some
thought in the light of section 13A(5) of the Act. The
relevant facts are
these:
<P>

&#183;	Mr. Slater was first remanded in custody by order of the Nowra Local
Court made on 12 September 1989. 
<P>

&#183;	He was admitted to Supreme Court bail on 12 March 1990.
<P>

&#183;	He remained at liberty on that bail until 20 June 1990, being the date
on which his trial, originally a joint trial with
Mr. Michael, commenced.
<P>

&#183;	Thereafter, he has remained in unbroken custody.
<P>

	Section 13A(5) has been the cause of some division of judicial opinion as to
its precise meaning and application: <b> Reg v Stephens</b> (CCA, 2 November
1993, unreported); <b>Reg v Purdy</b> (CCA, 3 September 1993, unreported). In
the present case there is not, in my opinion, any need for me to add to that
controversy.
The fact is that Mr. Slater was first remanded in custody for this
murder on 12 September 1989. Whether it follows that I must choose
that date as
the commencing date; or that I may, but need not, choose that date for that
purpose, I propose to choose it in fact.
It seems to me to accord better with
what a reasonable mind would think just and sensible that both of the
determinate sentences
which are now to be passed should have a common starting
date. 
<P>

	Finlay J, when his Honour came to sentence Mr. Michael, dated the life
sentence then passed upon Mr. Michael so as to deem it to
have commenced on 11
September 1989, being the date upon which Mr. Michael first entered custody in
connection with the murder of
Miss McIlwain. His Honour took that course at the
express request of Mr. Michael's then legal representative, and in aid of any
section
13A application that might be made in the future. 
<P>

	It seems to me, however, that Mr. Michael, like Mr. Slater, was not remanded
in custody, in the sense in which that terminology
is normally understood,
until an order in that behalf was made by a Court of competent jurisdiction. I
think, therefore, that in
the case of each applicant the appropriate commencing
date of any redetermined sentence is 12 September 1989.
<P>

7)	I advert, finally, to the requirements of sub-section (10A) of section 13A
of the Act. It provides:
<P>

<i>"The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	must have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant
recommendations, observations and comments made by the original
sentencing
court when imposing the sentence concerned, and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to their substance
and the intention of the original sentencing court when
making them, and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	must, to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to those
matters, state its reasons for doing so."</i>
<P>

	I have read and considered the remarks on sentence of both Finlay J and
Loveday J. Both of their Honours denounced the criminality
of the relevant
offender in clear and strong terms which do not differ in substance from my own
views. Each of their Honours made
observations which indicated clearly an
expectation that a section 13A application might well be made at some
appropriate future
time. Neither of their Honours recommended that the
particular offender being sentenced should have his file marked `Never to be
Released'.
<P>

23  	It is now necessary to bring together all of the foregoing
considerations and to distil them into determinate sentences. 
<P>

24  	It is unavoidable, on the view that I take of the enormity of
this particular murder, that each applicant must spend a further
substantial
period in full-time custody. The proper maintenance both of the rule of law,
and of a proper public confidence in the
law, requires no less. But, in setting
each such period, I have endeavoured to give proper weight to the
rehabilitation already achieved,
and to the need to encourage the steady
continuation of that process.
<P>

25  	<b>Darren Alan Slater</b>: your application for a re-determined
sentence is granted. In lieu of the sentence of penal servitude for life which
was previously
passed upon you, you are sentenced to penal servitude for 24
years, to comprise a minimum term of 18 years and an additional term
of 6
years. The minimum term will commence on 12 September 1989 and will expire on
11 September 2007. The additional term will commence
on 12 September 2007.
<P>

26  	<b>Nathan Isaac Michael</b>: your application for a redetermined
sentence is granted. In lieu of the sentence of penal servitude for life which
was previously
passed upon you, you are sentenced to penal servitude for 21
years, to comprise a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term
of 5
years. The minimum term will commence on 12 September 1989 and will expire on
11 September 2005. The additional term will commence
on 12 September 2005.
<P>

27  	I direct the Registrar of the Court to transmit forthwith to the
Serious Offenders Review Council and to the Commissioner of
Corrective Services
a copy of these remarks on sentence so that the same may be included in the
relevant official files of each prisoner.
