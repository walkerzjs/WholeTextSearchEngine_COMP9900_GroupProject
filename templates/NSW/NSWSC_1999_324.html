<b>2562/94 - IBRAHIM ATILGAN &amp; 4 ORS  V  MAHMUT ATILGAN &amp; 2 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>	Introduction</b>
<P>

1	This is a very sad case about a family of Turkish immigrants, the Atilgan
family.  The plaintiffs are Ibrahim and Elife Atilgan
(`Mr and Mrs Atilgan'),
their two daughters Muzeyyen (their second child) and Meziyet (their third
child), and the Estate of their
deceased daughter Mukates (their fourth child).
Mr Atilgan is about 69 years old, and Mrs Atilgan is about 63.  The defendants
are
their two sons Mahmut (their eldest child who is about 40) and Mehmet
(their youngest child), and Mahmut's wife Ayfer. 
<P>

2	The family has been deeply split since about 1990.  Until they met in court,
Mehmet had not seen his parents since they commenced
these proceedings in 1994.
His parents had not seen Mehmet's children, born in the intervening period.
The intensity of their emotions
was plain on the faces and in the voices of all
members of the family, as they progressed through the witness box.  The root
cause
of their conflict was the chain of events leading to the present
litigation, as I shall explain.  
<P>

3	If ever there were a case for settlement by less confrontational means than
legal proceedings, this was it, as the hearing obviously
aggravated emotions
which were already raw.  But several attempts to settle the case before the
hearing, by mediation and negotiation,
have failed, no doubt in spite of the
efforts and persuasive powers of counsel and their instructing solicitors.  At
the beginning
of the third day of the hearing, I spoke directly to the parties
in court, through an interpreter.  I said, amongst other things:
<P>

	`This is a very sad case about a family which has fallen apart.  My judgment,
if I have to give it, will not help to bring the
family together.  It is very
likely that it will make matters worse.  I, therefore, want both sides to think
again very seriously
about whether some agreement can be reached which will
avoid further costs and give everyone a chance to become a proper family again.
It is never too late to settle a case such as this.'
<P>

4	Nevertheless the case continued for a total of seven days.  In my judgment Mr
and Mrs Atilgan are partially successful in relation
to one of the two
properties in which they claim an interest and I shall hear further submissions
as to costs.  I do not pretend
that this outcome, which results from the
application of the law to the facts as I have found them, will do anything to
resolve the
personal conflicts within the Atilgan family, let alone bring them
together again.  
<P>

	<b>History of litigation</b>
<P>

5	The proceedings were initially brought by a summons filed on 1 June 1994.
The sole plaintiffs were Mr and Mrs Atilgan, and the
sole defendants were
Mahmut and Ayfer.  The summons sought declarations that a house and land at 8
Hutchinson Street, Auburn (`Hutchinson
Street') and a home unit at 1/53 Harrow
Road, Auburn (`Harrow Road'), were held on trust for Mr and Mrs Atilgan, and
consequential
relief.  Title to the Hutchinson Street and Harrow Road
properties is registered in the names of Mahmut and Ayfer.  
<P>

6	The proceedings were eventually fixed for hearing in December 1997 but that
fixture was vacated.  On 10 August 1998 Windeyer J
directed that the issues be
defined by pleadings, and on 8 September 1998 a statement of claim was filed on
behalf of Mr and Mrs
Atilgan.  Then at a further directions hearing on 28
September 1998 Windeyer J expressed the opinion that, having regard to the
agreements
alleged in the statement of claim and the orders sought against the
defendants, all Mr and Mrs Atilgan's children should be joined
either as
plaintiffs or defendants.  He directed that an amended statement of claim be
filed and served.  Consequently an amended
statement of claim was filed on 7
October 1998, joining the two daughters and the Estate of the third daughter as
plaintiffs, and
the second son as a defendant. 
<P>

7	In their amended statement of claim the plaintiffs say that part of the funds
used for the purchase of the Hutchinson Street and
Harrow Road properties was
provided from a common pool of money accumulated from contributions by all
family members.  Therefore,
say the plaintiffs, those two properties belong in
equity to all family members in proportion to their contributions, or that Mr
and Mrs Atilgan are the equitable owners of them.  They seek declaratory relief
to recognise their equitable rights and consequential
orders for the transfer
or sale of the two properties.  The defendants deny that the plaintiffs made
any financial contribution to
the acquisition of the two properties and assert
that they are the sole beneficial as well as legal owners. 
<P>

8	The dispute between the parties turns on some hotly contested issues of fact,
rather than on the applicable legal principles.
 I have found it difficult to
resolve the factual issues, because of the limited scope of the evidence before
me.  The evidence comprises
affidavits by each of the seven parties, together
with oral evidence by each of them, and very limited documentary evidence
(comprising
principally notices of income tax assessment for Mahmut and Ayfer,
and a few documents concerning their bank loans).  Except in the
case of Mahmut
(most of the time) and Mehmet, the affidavit and oral evidence by the parties
was given with the aid of an interpreter.
 
<P>

9	At various times I was concerned that the cross-examiner used Australian
property concepts which may not have translated well
into Turkish, and the
witnesses may have had in mind Turkish concepts for which there may have been
no direct Australian equivalent.
 On the third day of the hearing I expressed
my concern to counsel in this way:
<P>

	`When we use expressions about `ownership' we give that concept a quite
precise technical meaning.  This is so, even when we use
language which we
regard as non-technical, such as (to name some of the expressions I have heard
counsel put to witnesses):  `property
in the name of', `owned', `belong to',
`interest in', `benefit', `right to live in', even `gave her money to'.  We
have precise concepts
in mind when we use those expressions, and the reason we
have precise concepts in mind is that we are victims of our training and
our
narrow Australian legal culture.  We should not assume that even an
Australian-born lay person has those technical concepts in
mind when asked
questions of the kind which have been put to witnesses in this case.  People
who are born and raised in a non-English
speaking country like Turkey, where,
as far as I know, there is no concept such as the `English trust' or `equitable
proprietary
interest' will not appreciate the technical elements of the
questions which they are asked.  The Court's task is to listen to the
evidence
... without making assumptions about the witnesses' understanding of concepts
upon which we impose technical meanings.'
<P>

	I have found that to be a difficult process because of a combination of
cultural differences and the uncertainties created by translation.
<P>

10	An affidavit of the plaintiff's solicitor seeks to explain the absence of
documentary evidence to support the plaintiff's case.
 He was told by the
Department of Society Security and the Australian Taxation Office in September
1997 that they had not retained
records at that stage for the period from the
1970s to 1990, the crucial period in this case.  That evidence does not explain
the
absence of bank records from the plaintiff's evidence, nor the absence of
any corroborating affidavits or oral testimony by relevant
witnesses, such as
Mr Sami Sakman, the bank manager who according to Mr and Mrs Atilgan gave the
family some advice about buying
property, or Mr Nejdet Sayin, a real estate
agent who according to them was a witness to a conversation in which, they say,
Mahmut
promised to transfer Harrow Road to his mother.  I mention the absence
of this evidence not for the purpose of drawing an adverse
inference pursuant
to <i>Jones v Dunkel </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298.</a>  As I shall explain, I have
decided to reject the evidence of Mr and Mrs Atilgan on the relevant matters
because of its own implausibility
and internal inconsistencies.  My point,
rather, is to underline the difficulties with which the Court is faced when
assessing evidence
presented through interpreters by parties whose concepts of
property may be affected by cultural differences, when there is no external
corroboration whatsoever.  
<P>

11	I shall proceed by setting out my findings on the facts generally, and then
describe the established facts and allegations with
respect to financial
contributions to the acquisition of the two properties.  I shall then make some
observations about the credibility
of the witnesses, in order then to make some
findings about the financial contributions of the parties.  Having dealt with
these
factual matters, I shall then apply the law and set out my
conclusions.
<P>

	<b>The facts generally</b>
<P>

12	Mr and Mrs Atilgan arrived in Australia as immigrants in February 1970, with
their children.  At that time Mahmut was about 12,
Muzeyyen was about 9,
Meziyet was 7, Mukates was 2 and Mehmet was 1 year old.  Mr Atilgan had been a
carpenter in his village in
Turkey.  Though he had some carpentry
qualifications, he was unable to get work as a carpenter in Sydney, and so took
employment
at a factory which he describes as a `metal factory' at Regents
Park, where he worked for 6&#189; years to March 1976.  Mrs Atilgan
obtained a
job as a process worker at an Arnotts biscuits factory in April 1970, and
continued to work until 1976.  Neither Mr nor
Mrs Atilgan spoke English, and
that is still the case.  
<P>

13	Mahmut left school in 1972, when he was about 14 years of age.  He worked as
a process worker at Lidcombe, and then as a shift
worker with ARC Engineering
and also had a part-time job at a bed factory.  Mr Atilgan returned to Turkey
for three months in 1973,
and at that time he purchased two properties in
Turkey.  Mr Atilgan says that the purchase price of the properties was 228,000
Turkish
lira, and that the properties are subject to a conservation order which
prevents them from being renovated.  Consequently, he says,
their value as at
13 March 1996 was no more than A$20,000.
<P>

14	In March 1976 Mr and Mrs Atilgan returned to Turkey with their family.
There is a suggestion in the evidence that they initially
intended to return
only for a holiday, but in fact they stayed for nearly five years.  Mr Atilgan
bought a whitegoods business and
his son worked for him there, receiving some
payment but not a commercial wage.  
<P>

15	Mahmut was conscripted into the Turkish military forces from 1978 to 1980,
receiving some financial support from his family during
that time.  He married
Ayfer in 1980.  Muzeyyen also married in a religious ceremony in 1980.
<P>

16	The Atilgan family returned to Australia in 1981-82.  Mahmut returned in
January 1981, and Mr and Mrs Atilgan and the other children
returned in July
1981.  Ayfer arrived in Australia in February 1982.  Muzeyyen came to Australia
either with the family or at some
time in 1982.  Although she had married, her
husband remained in Germany, where he was working.  
<P>

17	The family moved into a rented house at 21 Board Street, Auburn in 1982.  In
mid-1982 the family living at 21 Board Street comprised
Mr and Mrs Atilgan,
Mahmut and Ayfer, Muzeyyen and her daughter (born in April 1982), Meziyet,
Mukates and Mehmet.  The family lived
together until early 1985, when they
moved to Hutchinson Street, but there were several changes to the composition
of the family.
 Muzeyyen and her daughter moved out of the family home in April
1984 to live with Muzeyyen's husband, who had arrived in Australia
from
Germany.  Mahmut's son was born in 1983.  Mukates became very ill in 1984,
suffering from terminal encephalitis.  She was hospitalised
from time to time
thereafter, and eventually moved into a nursing home, and did not return to the
family home.  
<P>

18	After his return to Australia, Mahmut took employment in various positions,
for ANI Engineering, Acrow Engineering, Mr Plastic,
State Rail and the Urban
Transport Authority, over the period from 1981 to 1992.  He also had part-time
employment for a while, delivering
pizzas for Pepsico.  Ayfer was also in
full-time employment, taking two months off on the respective occasions of the
birth of her
son in 1983 and her daughter in 1986, and three months vacation in
Turkey in 1989.  
<P>

19	Mr Atilgan did not work at any time after his return to Australia in 1981.
He says he developed high blood pressure and rheumatism,
and has received
social service benefits.  Mrs Atilgan has not worked since her return to
Australia, and has also received social
service benefits.
<P>

20	Muzeyyen commenced work as a process worker at the Prima Tissue Factory in
Rydalmere soon after her return to Australia, and
continued in full-time
employment, at least until she left the family home in 1984 to join her
husband.  Meziyet also worked at the
Prima Tissue Factory from her return to
Australia in 1981, and was generally in full-time employment at all relevant
times, though
she was absent from work for some time when she injured her hand
at work.  Mukates also worked for a short time until she became
ill.
<P>

21	Mehmet had a part-time job as a waiter for about a year in 1987, while in
year 11 at school.  He completed his Higher School
Certificate in 1989 and then
undertook tertiary education at Meadowbank TAFE.  He remained living with his
parents at Hutchinson
Street until 1991, when he married and went to Turkey,
returning in 1992.  He and his wife stayed with his parents for about three
months and then moved out.
<P>

22	Whatever may have been their intentions about the ownership of property, it
is evident that the members of the Atilgan family
had discussions from time to
time while living in Board Street on the subject of buying a home.  Eventually
Mahmut and Ayfer entered
into a contract to buy Hutchinson Street in December
1984, completion taking place early in 1985, and the family moved into
Hutchinson
Street.  The purchase price was $76,000 with additional expenses
including stamp duty in the sum of about $5,000, making a total
sum of about
$81,000.  $40,000 was borrowed from the Telopea branch of the Commonwealth Bank
of Australia.  An additional $5,000
was borrowed by Mahmut from his solicitor,
and the remaining $36,000 was paid in cash.  At the time of the move to
Hutchinson Street,
the family comprised Mr and Mrs Atilgan, Mahmut, Ayfer and
their son, Meziyet, Mukates and Mehmet.
<P>

23	In August 1986 Meziyet married and left the Hutchinson Street home.  Then
sometime in 1987 Mukates' illness forced her to move
into a nursing home, and
she died on 11 February 1988.  
<P>

24	In 1987 the family discussed buying another property as an investment.  Mr
and Mrs Atilgan say that Mahmut promised to buy a
property for his mother, and
that part of the purchase money came from an interest bearing deposit of
$15,000 in Mrs Atilgan's name.
 Mahmut denies all of this, and says that the
property was purchased from his wife's and his savings, with no contribution
from other
family members.  I shall return to this dispute later.  Whatever be
the source of the funds, the fact is that the unit at 1/53 Harrow
Road, Auburn
was purchased in November 1987.  The purchase price was $62,500, with legal
fees and stamp duty of approximately $2,500,
making a total of $65,000.
$31,000 was borrowed from St George Building Society, and $3,000 was borrowed
by Mahmut from a friend.
 The remaining $31,000 was paid in cash.
<P>

25	Harrow Road was purchased in the names of Mahmut, Ayfer and Mehmet.  It
appears that Mahmut agreed to a request by his parents
to make his brother
Mehmet, then a student not earning income, a part-owner of the unit, the three
owners taking the legal title
as tenants in common in equal shares.  Mehmet did
not contribute financially to the purchase nor the mortgage instalments paid to
St George Building Society.
<P>

26	The mortgage over Hutchinson Street was repaid by instalments, and was
discharged in November 1988.  An additional investment
property was purchased,
at 5/29 Gibbons Street, Auburn.  It was bought in the names of Mahmut, Ayfer,
Mr and Mrs Atilgan, as tenants
in common.  The evidence does not indicate the
exact purchase money, but it was in the vicinity of $120,000 and most of the
purchase
money was borrowed.  
<P>

27	In 1989 Mr and Mrs Atilgan, Ayfer and her two children went to Turkey for a
three month holiday.  During that time Mrs Atilgan
purchased a house in Turkey
for 68,000,000 Turkish lira.  It appears that the relationship between Ayfer
and Mr and Mrs Atilgan was
not entirely a happy one during the holiday.  Mahmut
says he sent money to Ayfer to pay for holiday expenses because his father
would
not give her any of the money which Mahmut had previously supplied.  
<P>

28	Shortly after their return to Australia, Mahmut and Ayfer decided to move
from Hutchinson Street to Harrow Road with their children.
 Prior to that time,
Harrow Road had been tenanted.  Mahmut says their purpose in doing so was to
avoid friction with his parents
and to establish an independent household for
themselves and their children.  Clearly a degree of tension had developed
between them
and Mr and Mrs Atilgan. 
<P>

29	Shortly before or just after the move to Harrow Road, Mahmut was diagnosed
as having cancer.  It became necessary for him to
have tests and undergo
chemotherapy.
<P>

30	Mr and Mrs Atilgan became anxious about their future security.  They may
have developed this anxiety when Mahmut and his family
moved to Harrow Road,
because by that time Mrs Atilgan in particular was well aware that neither
Harrow Road nor Hutchinson Street
was registered in her husband's and her
names.  She had been anxious about this matter for some time, a fact which
explains why the
Gibbons Street property was acquired in the name of Mr and Mrs
Atilgan as well as Mahmut and Ayfer.  Whatever feeling of insecurity
Mrs
Atilgan had before her son was diagnosed with cancer can only have been
increased by that event. 
<P>

31	There is conflicting evidence as to exactly what occurred next, and when.
In her affidavit of 30 September 1994 Mrs Atilgan said
that in 1990 after
Mahmut and his family had moved into Harrow Road, she said to him `if you die,
your wife will put me out in the
street'.  She did not identify the occasion
upon which she made this statement.  In his affidavit of 4 October 1995 Mahmut
said that
he was visited by his parents at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, when
he was undergoing therapy for cancer.  He said that one of his
parents said to
him `you don't know what might happen in the future.  Please sign these
documents which transfer your properties
to us.  You don't know what you wife
will do to us if you died'.
<P>

32	In his affidavit Mahmut said he refused to sign the documents and said to
his parents `this brings shame on you and our family.
 This is the first time I
have heard of parents trying to snatch property from a child before he is even
dead.  You will never get
these properties even if I die.  If I die, they
belong to my wife and children.'  According to Mahmut, similar conversations
occurred
on more than one occasion.
<P>

33	In their oral evidence Mr and Mrs Atilgan both denied that either of them
had said any such thing to their son.  However, the
similarity between Mrs
Atilgan's account of a conversation in which she expressed concern about what
Ayfer might do if Mahmut died,
and Mahmut's own account of the conversation in
the hospital, persuades me that during 1990 Mrs Atilgan expressed a concern to
her
son as to what Ayfer might do if he died.  I think it is more likely than
not that the concern was expressed after Mahmut had been
diagnosed with
cancer.
<P>

34	Observing Mrs Atilgan in the witness box, I formed the strong opinion that
she was very anxious about her future and her lack
of property in Australia.
It was also clear that there is real animosity between her and Ayfer.  Her
demeanour in the witness box
tended to render plausible Mahmut's account of the
conversation in the hospital.  In his evidence Mahmut frequently returned to
this
event, which he clearly regarded as a turning point in his life, an event
which deeply upset him and caused him to treat his parents
with contempt at all
times thereafter.  Assessing the reactions of the witnesses as well as their
affidavit and oral evidence, my
opinion is that Mahmut's account of the
conversation and the context in which it occurred is accurate and the denials
of his account
by Mr and Mrs Atilgan are false.
<P>

35	Some time in 1993 Mahmut approached his brother Mehmet, saying that he
wished to buy out Mehmet's interest in Harrow Road, for
$17,000.  Mehmet told
his parents that an offer had been made and they advised him to take it.  He
then accepted the offer and transferred
his interest in the property to Mahmut
and Ayfer for that amount.
<P>

36	Mahmut's illness led him to decide that he could no longer retain the
Gibbons Street investment property.  According to his evidence,
the tenants'
rent was not covering outgoings on the property.  He therefore decided to sell,
but needed the consent of his parents
to do so.  He spoke to his mother,
telling her that he was ill and could not afford the repayments.  She objected
to the sale, asserting
that his true motive was to remove her name and his
father's name from the title.  A few weeks later Mahmut spoke to his mother
again,
in the presence of Nejdet Sayin, a real estate agent.  There is a
dispute about what was said, but I prefer Mahmut's as the more
plausible
account.  On Mahmut's version, both he and Sayin said, in effect, that the
property had to be sold and there was no other
option.  It is common ground
that Mrs Atilgan eventually agreed to the sale, tearfully and reluctantly.  Mrs
Atilgan asserts that
she did so only on the condition that her son undertook to
transfer the Harrow Road unit into her and her husband's names.  Mahmut
denies
ever giving such an undertaking.  It is implausible that he would have done so,
given that he was living in the unit with
his family and intended to continue
to live separately from his parents, and so I reject Mrs Atilgan's evidence on
that matter.
<P>

37	It was necessary for Mahmut to take some time off work for his cancer
therapy, but he was able to return to work for a while
in 1992/93 before
eventually ceasing work in 1993.  He subsequently applied for and obtained
social security benefits.  Ayfer has
continued to work.  
<P>

38	After Mahmut agreed to buy Mehmet's share in Harrow Road, he had a
conversation with his father about future living arrangements.
 He alleges that
his father told him that he and Mrs Atilgan would be returning to Turkey, and
that Mahmut could have the Hutchinson
Road property in 12 months.  Mr and Mrs
Atilgan deny that any such thing was said.  On balance, it is likely that there
was a conversation
in which Mr Atilgan, more or less in resignation, indicated
that he may return to Turkey, but it is unlikely that he made any firm
promise
or categorical statement of intention to return to Turkey within 12 months, or
that he had actually decided to do so.  I
reach this conclusion partly because
by 1993, when the conversation is alleged to have occurred, Mr and Mrs Atilgan
were at loggerheads
with Mahmut and Ayfer, the parents asserting that they were
entitled to the properties and Mahmut saying that they had lost their
claim to
his respect by their conduct when he was in hospital.  Additionally, Mahmut
thought it necessary and appropriate to instruct
his solicitors to issue a
termination notice to his parents, a step which would have been unlikely if
they had indicated a firm intention
to leave.
<P>

39	Evidently Mahmut's solicitors wrote to Mr and Mrs Atilgan on 13 May 1993,
though that letter is not in evidence.  Mr and Mrs
Atilgan's solicitors replied
by letter of 20 May 1993, asserting that their clients had `an equitable
interest in the property [Hutchinson
Street] and a contractual right to remain
in occupation of the property', and consequently that they would not be
vacating the property.
 The letter also asserted an equitable interest in a
strata title property, presumably Harrow Road.  Notwithstanding that letter,
Mahmut and Ayfer issued a termination notice dated 21 June 1993, requiring Mr
and Mrs Atilgan to give vacant possession of Hutchinson
Street on 30 June 1994.
Mr and Mrs Atilgan commenced the present proceedings by summons filed 1 June
1994.
<P>

	<b>Financial arrangements</b>
<P>

40	The evidence is that Mr and Mrs Atilgan own some property in Turkey.  There
are two properties that were purchased by Mr Atilgan
in 1973, and a property
was purchased by Mrs Atilgan in 1989.  There may be others.  Mahmut's evidence
is that those properties produce
income which has been retained for his parents
in Turkey.  However, the evidence is that Mr and Mrs Atilgan do not have any
substantial
assets in Australia.  They have a bank account, and although their
evidence is not clear, it appears that it was originally with
the Commonwealth
Bank at Lidcombe and was transferred at some point in the 1980s to the
Commonwealth Bank at Auburn.  Their social
security benefits are paid into that
account.  It appears that they live frugally.  Mr Atilgan does not drive and
throughout the
financial period which is relevant to these proceedings, from
1981 to 1990, it appears that he was usually at home.
<P>

41	The documentary evidence indicates that in December 1984 Mahmut had three
accounts with the Commonwealth Bank at Lidcombe, though
there were negligible
amounts in two of them.  Mahmut's evidence is that he also maintained bank
accounts with the Commonwealth Bank
at Auburn (which was presumably closer to
home than the Lidcombe branch after the move to Hutchinson Street) and also at
the Westpac
Bank at Lidcombe.  He says that he maintained several accounts in
order to obtain a good savings record with more than one bank with
a view to
purchasing a house.  Mahmut's evidence is that he had no assets and only a
small amount of money when he returned to Australia
in 1981.  He has not said
that he acquired any windfall assets during the ensuing decade, and his
evidence implies that he did not.
 Therefore the only assets which he could
have accumulated during that period are assets acquired out of the sources of
income which
were available to him and his wife.  
<P>

42	The documentary evidence includes notices of income tax assessments for
Mahmut and Ayfer for most of the financial years from
1981 to 1990, and for
1992 and 1993 in the case of Mahmut.  Ayfer gave oral evidence to the effect
that Mahmut always told the Australian
Taxation Office exactly how much he was
earning.  When it was put to Mahmut that he could not have paid off the
Hutchinson Street
mortgage in three years and saved up the amount he claimed to
have saved for Harrow Road, without financial help from his parents
and
sisters, he said that the evidence he had given should prove the matter.  In my
opinion it is reasonable to infer, and I do infer,
that their taxable incomes
for the years 1981-1990 were not greatly less than the actual income of each of
them from all sources
in those years.
<P>

43	Mr and Mrs Atilgan saved money during their residence in Australia from 1970
to 1976, depositing their savings into a joint account
in their names.
However, they say that when they returned to Australia in 1981, they gave their
pension monies to their son, believing
that he deposited the money into an
account in his name at the Commonwealth Bank at Lidcombe or at the ANZ Bank at
Auburn.  According
to Mr Atilgan, Mukates did some casual work during the
period 1981 to 1984 and gave her money to Mahmut, and after she became ill
she
received a pension which was deposited into her account at the Commonwealth
Bank at Auburn, and she signed withdrawal slips to
enable Mahmut to withdraw
that money.  Muzeyyen says that she handed Mahmut her unopened pay packet every
week, in response to his
demand that she do so, and Meziyet says that she gave
her sealed pay packets to her father, who she usually saw give the pay packet
to Mahmut.  Mr Atilgan says that Mehmet took up casual employment after 1984
and that his earnings also contributed.  He says that
they all gave their
income to Mahmut because he was the eldest and because he could speak English,
with the intention that the money
would be saved to buy a house in which the
family could live, which would be in the name of Mr and Mrs Atilgan. 
<P>

44	Mahmut denies that any money was given to him by any of the plaintiffs to
deposit in a savings account to save up for a house.
 He denies that his
brother and sisters gave him any such money, saying instead that they gave
money to their father.  In his affidavit
of 4 October 1995 he said that the
only monies ever deposited into his bank accounts came from the earnings of his
wife and himself,
and he denied that his parents gave him any money, except for
small amounts for purchases which he made on their behalf.  However,
in his
oral evidence he said that his parents paid half of the household expenses and
outgoings in Board Street and Hutchinson Street
when they were living in those
places together. 
<P>

45	Mr and Mrs Atilgan say that after they moved to Hutchinson Street their
pension cheques were paid directly into their account
at the Commonwealth Bank
at Auburn, but they signed a withdrawal slip which allowed their son to take
out the same amount every month,
and as far as they were aware, Mahmut
deposited the money into the Commonwealth Bank at Lidcombe to pay off the
mortgage.  Mahmut
denies that any such payments were received from his
parents.
<P>

46	It is agreed that the purchase price for Hutchinson Street was $76,000, with
additional expenses of about $5,000, making a total
of $81,000.  $40,000 was
borrowed from the Commonwealth Bank.  Accepting (as I do) Mahmut's evidence
that he borrowed $5,000 from
his solicitor, it follows that $36,000 was paid in
cash as deposit and balance of purchase monies in December 1984/early 1985.
<P>

47	Though there are minor discrepancies between the figures given by Mr and Mrs
Atilgan and Mahmut for the purchase price of Harrow
Road, I accept Mahmut's
evidence that the total purchase price was $62,500 plus $2,500 for expenses,
making a total of $65,000. 
I also accept Mahmut's evidence that he borrowed
$3,000 by personal loan, and $31,000 from St George Building Society, leaving a
balance of $31,000 provided as cash purchase money.
<P>

48	An interest bearing deposit of $15,000 was saved by members of the family to
take Mukates back to Turkey.  Mahmut says that the
money was saved by him and
Ayfer, without any significant contribution from the others, but Mr and Mrs
Atilgan dispute this.  The
interest bearing deposit was ultimately in Mrs
Atilgan's name, but there is a dispute as to whether it was always in her name
or
was transferred into her name by Mahmut.  It appears that the money was
saved to take Mukates back to Turkey, or possibly to provide
further medical
treatment for her.  When it became evident that she would be too ill to return
to Turkey and that there was no hope
of further successful medical treatment,
it was planned, evidently by Mrs Atilgan and Mahmut, that the money would be
used to take
Mukates' body to Turkey after she died.  Mrs Atilgan originally
said, in her affidavit of 30 September 1994, that she received advice
after
Mukates died that the $15,000 should be invested in real estate.  She says that
accordingly, the $15,000 was used as part of
the purchase money for Harrow
Road.  This would have been impossible, since Harrow Road was purchased in late
1987 and Mukates did
not die until 11 February 1988.  Mrs Atilgan purported to
correct her affidavit evidence in her oral evidence, saying that the advice
to
invest in property was given in 1987.  Mahmut accepts that advice to invest in
property was received from Mr Sami Sakman, who
was then employed by the Auburn
branch of Westpac Bank.  However, he says that the money was not withdrawn from
the interest bearing
deposit until after Mukates died, and he believes that the
money was used by his parents to visit Turkey in 1989.  
<P>

49	Mahmut says that Mr and Mrs Atilgan went to Turkey in 1985 and 1989.  In his
affidavit of 4 October 1995 he said that he gave
his father money to take to
Turkey on each of those occasions.  Annexed to his affidavit were two
Commonwealth Bank of Australia
transaction slips for deposits to cover the cost
of two overseas drafts payable to Mr Atilgan in Turkey.  One transaction slip
is
dated 17 June 1985 in the sum of AUD3,000.  The other transaction slip is
dated 16 April 1985 in the sum of AUD17,000.  Though an
initial appears above
the word `Teller' on the form, this transaction slip (unlike the other slip)
does not bear any bank stamp.
 In his affidavit Mahmut said that he also gave
his father money in 1989.  Mr Atilgan denies that $17,000 was sent to him in
Turkey,
and says that the $3,000 was sent to him in 1989 rather than 1985.  He
says that the $3,000 came from pooled family money and was
used primarily for
holiday expenses for his son's wife and children in 1989.  In his oral evidence
Mahmut said that the $17,000 was
not in fact sent in 1985, but was sent in
1989, and that it was used by his parents to buy property in Turkey, rather
than for holiday
expenses.
<P>

50	It will be seen from this summary of the evidence on financial contributions
that almost every significant assertion by one side
is disputed by the other.
The disagreements are of a kind which could easily be resolved if documentary
evidence were available,
but by and large it is not.  In order to reach
conclusions about financial contributions, I must therefore make findings as to
the
credit of the witnesses who gave the conflicting accounts.  
<P>

	<b>The witnesses - credit</b>
<P>

51	I propose to make some remarks about the affidavit and oral evidence of Mr
and Mrs Atilgan, Muzeyyen and Meziyet, Mahmut, Ayfer
and Mehmet.  However, I
shall state my conclusions in advance.  I found the evidence of all four
plaintiffs to be generally unreliable.
 I would not believe any disputed
assertion by any of the four plaintiffs unless it was independently
corroborated, and there is
no direct corroboration for most of their evidence.
I found Mehmet to be an honest witness but by his own admission, he was not
much
interested in, or involved in, the family discussions on financial
matters, and so his evidence related more to impressions than
to facts, so far
as the family finances (as opposed to his own financial contribution) were
concerned.  I found that Mahmut's evidence
was truthful to a degree, but could
not be relied upon on certain crucial issues.  Generally, he began by
portraying himself as the
generous son, but during the course of the two and a
half days of his cross-examination, this changed gradually but decisively, and
in the latter part of the cross-examination, he was reluctant to admit to any
expenditure on the family's behalf.  Ayfer's evidence
generally supported
Mahmut's, and was therefore subject to the same deficiencies.  In the end, some
of their evidence is inconsistent
with external reality in ways which I shall
point out. 
<P>

	<i>Mr Atilgan</i>
<P>

52	Mr Atilgan's affidavit of 30 September 1994 contains some specific
assertions which are inconsistent with the truth as it emerged
from his son's
affidavit of 4 October 1995 and the annexures to that affidavit.  He
endeavoured to correct his evidence in the witness
box, but his oral evidence
was unconvincing.  All in all, he impressed me as a person whose recollection
was stimulated principally
by self-interest, and he was unable to give any
satisfactory explanation for the serious inconsistencies in his evidence.
<P>

53	Thus, in his affidavit of 30 September 1994 he asserted that he went to the
Commonwealth Bank at Lidcombe to obtain finance for
the purchase of Hutchinson
Street.  Mahmut's evidence shows that the loan was arranged from the Telopea
branch of the Commonwealth
Bank.  In his oral testimony, Mr Atilgan originally
denied that he had gone to the Commonwealth Bank to obtain finance for
Hutchinson
Street.  Then when confronted with his affidavit he said that he did
go to the bank, but only to have money transferred from his
joint account with
Mrs Atilgan to Mahmut's account, so that Mahmut could then use the money to
purchase Hutchinson Street.  This
suggests that in 1984 there was a significant
accumulation of funds in Mr and Mrs Atilgan's joint account, and yet his
affidavit
evidence was that he started to give Mahmut their money in 1981, for
him to deposit in the account in his own name with the Commonwealth
Bank at
Lidcombe.
<P>

54	In his affidavit of 30 September 1994 he said that the purchase of
Hutchinson Street was financed by a loan of $40,000 from the
Commonwealth Bank,
but in his oral testimony he claimed not to know where the finance came from.
He asserted that the family members
contributed money towards the purchase of
Hutchinson Street, and that this money was paid into a joint account.  However
he said
in oral evidence that he could not recall the bank at which the account
was held, and when asked why he did not obtain this information
from Mahmut he
had no adequate explanation.  The evidence implies that he had abdicated his
role as head of the household, that he
had been `gelded' (as counsel for the
defendants put it), and yet he had conducted the family finances with Mrs
Atilgan, apparently
successfully, before they went to Turkey in 1976.  His
assertions in oral evidence are simply implausible.
<P>

55	In his affidavit of 30 September 1994 he asserted that, after completion of
the purchase of Hutchinson Street, he and his wife
paid their pension cheques
directly into their joint Commonwealth Bank account at Auburn.  However, in
oral testimony he initially
claimed that they gave their pension money directly
to Mahmut, and later claimed (on the following day of cross-examination) that
they paid their pension money into the joint account as stated in the
affidavit.  Mr Atilgan gave confusing and inconsistent evidence
about Mehmet's
casual employment.  Mehmet's own evidence is that he worked at a restaurant in
1987 or possibly 1986.  His father's
affidavit evidence is that Mehmet began
working at a restaurant in 1984 and 1985, but in oral testimony he claimed that
Mehmet began
working at a printing firm.  The suggestion that Mehmet earned a
sufficient amount of money to make a significant contribution to
a pooled
savings fund is implausible and was effectively demolished by Mehmet's
evidence.  Early in his oral evidence Mr Atilgan
said that Meziyet gave her
wages directly to Mahmut.  However, when confronted with Meziyet's affidavit
evidence to the effect that
she gave her wages to her father, Mr Atilgan
changed his evidence.
<P>

56	As counsel for the defendants submitted, if one puts together all of these
criticisms of Mr Atilgan's affidavit evidence, all
of the substantial affidavit
evidence about financial contributions is destroyed.  Mr Atilgan's attempted
corrections in oral evidence
were unconvincing and seemed to be motivated by
self-interest and the desire to render his evidence consistent with the
evidence
of others.  My impression of his demeanour in the witness box was that
Mr Atilgan cast himself in the role of advocate rather than
a witness seeking
to recollect and present the factual truth.  Perhaps his misapprehension of the
role of a witness is due to cultural
differences or linguistic difficulty, but
such an explanation does not make his evidence any more credible.
<P>

	<i>Mrs Atilgan</i>
<P>

57	It is clear from her demeanour in the witness box that Mrs Atilgan has been
deeply hurt by the rift with her son and daughter-in-law,
and is greatly
worried by the insecurity of her financial circumstances.  The combination of
these issues and painful recollections
of her daughter's death made her a very
emotional witness.  I am sorry to say my assessment is that her emotions got
the better of
her judgment, and led her to give evidence which was sometimes
incoherent, and plainly self-contradictory on important issues.
<P>

58	In her affidavit of 30 September 1994 she said that she believed she and her
husband owned Hutchinson Street jointly, and that
she owned Harrow Road
herself.  In oral testimony she seemed to claim that she thought she and her
husband owned both properties
jointly, or at least that he had interest in
Harrow Road as well as Hutchinson Street.  Her affidavit and oral evidence also
indicates
that she was aware, at least eventually, that neither she nor her
husband was a registered proprietor on the title to Hutchinson
Street or Harrow
Road.  It was important to her that she be named as a registered proprietor of
the Gibbons Street property and according
to her evidence (which I have already
rejected on this point), she extracted an undertaking from her son to transfer
Harrow Road
to her and Mr Atilgan as a condition of her consent to the sale of
Gibbons Street.  These latter parts of her evidence appear to
me to be
incompatible with the belief that at all relevant times she and her husband
owned Hutchinson Street and the belief that
they owned Harrow Road.
<P>

59	According to her affidavit of 30 September 1994, she said to Mahmut `if you
die, your wife will put me out in the street.'  In
oral testimony she denies
that she said this.  For reasons I have already given, I reject her oral
testimony on this point.  In my
opinion, based on her demeanour in the witness
box and the way she denied the suggestion that she had said these words, her
reason
for the denial is that she believed that she would be seen in a poor
light if she admitted to such a statement.
<P>

60	In her affidavit she claimed that the family had saved $15,000 in an
interest bearing deposit to take Mukates back to Turkey,
but that after
Mukates' death she received advice suggesting that the money be used to
purchase property.  In her oral testimony
she said she had made a mistake and
that she must have received the advice before Mukates' death.  This was an
obvious attempt to
adjust her evidence to the fact that Mukates died in
February 1988, some months after the purchase of Harrow Road.  The original
account in the affidavit is plausible, in the sense that she may well have
decided after her daughter's death that there was not
much point sending the
body back to Turkey.  It is less plausible that during the last few months of
her daughter's life, she would
have taken the family fund saved up for Mukates
and invested all of it in the Harrow Road purchase.  
<P>

61	Perhaps the most astounding part of her evidence was that, when she was
pressed about the sequence of the purchase of Harrow
Road and Mukates' death,
she said that she could not recall the date or even the month in which Mukates
died.  
<P>

62	In her affidavit of 30 September 1994 she said that Mr Sami Sakman of
Westpac had approved the loan for the purchase of Harrow
Road.  In fact,
annexures to Mahmut's affidavit of 4 October 1995 show that the lender was St
George Building Society.  In her affidavit
she said that she went with her son
to the Westpac Berala branch where they saw a female employee.  There her son
told her that the
unit could not be registered in her name because the bank
would not make a loan in her name as she was not working.  I find that
this
alleged visit to the bank did not occur, since the lender was St George
Building Society rather than Westpac.  Counsel for the
plaintiff pointed out
that the signs and uniforms in both Westpac and St George branches contain the
colour red, and a person with
no understanding of English could easily become
confused between the two.  I reject that submission.
<P>

63	As with her husband's evidence, not much of significance remains in Mrs
Atilgan's evidence when these parts of it are rejected.
<P>

	<i>Muzeyyen</i>
<P>

64	It was plain that Muzeyyen had decided that she would support her parents in
their court case against her brother and sister-in-law.
 That determination to
support her parents, come what may, typified her approach in the witness box
and, I infer, her approach to
the preparation of her affidavit.  I find her
affidavit evidence to be fundamentally implausible.  When she returned to
Australia
in 1982 and began to work, she was already married and had a
daughter.  She must have been thinking about establishing a financial
foundation for her married life and her own family.  Yet she says that from the
day she started work in Australia, she gave her unopened
pay packet to Mahmut
every week.  She says she never opened it and that she did not know how much
was in it.  
<P>

65	Additionally, her evidence is internally inconsistent on some matters of
detail.  For example, she says that Mahmut said to her
sisters and her `we are
going to buy a house for mum', but that she understood her wages were to be
saved to purchase a house for
her father as well as her mother.  Similarly she
says that Mahmut told her and other members of the family `we're going to buy
the
flat in my mother's name', but on other occasions that he would transfer
the unit to his mother's and father's names.  She said in
her affidavit that
Meziyet gave her unopened pay packet to Mahmut, but she endeavoured to resile
from that statement in her oral
testimony, presumably having read Meziyet's
subsequent affidavit.  In oral testimony Muzeyyen said that Meziyet gave her
unopened
pay packet to her father rather than her brother, and purported to
explain the difference between her sister's practice and her own
by saying that
her sister would sometimes come home late, after her brother had gone shopping,
and would hand over the pay packet
to her father so that her father could pass
it on to her brother.  I find this change of evidence unconvincing.
<P>

66	There is one other problem with Muzeyyen's evidence.  In her affidavit she
said that she left the family home in about 1984 when
she married.  In fact,
Muzeyyen was married in a religious ceremony in Turkey in 1980, as she admitted
in oral evidence.  But she
said that she had a civil marriage ceremony in
Australia in 1984, in order to ensure that her marriage would be recognised
here.
 Counsel for the defendants submitted that in view of her earlier
religious marriage, it was misleading for her to say in her affidavit,
without
further explanation, that she married in April 1984.  He submitted that the
earlier religious marriage was not mentioned,
because it would render
implausible her claim that she handed over her pay packets to her brother.  I
agree with these submissions.
 In fact no other members of the family would
have been misled, because they understood Muzeyyen's position, and the Court
was not
misled because the statement in the affidavit was explained and
corrected in oral evidence.  Nevertheless, the statement that she
married in
April 1984 was inherently misleading and should have been clarified in the
affidavit, and in its context suggested an
intention to strengthen
illegitimately her evidence that she handed over pay packets to her brother.

<P>

67	Muzeyyen's loyalty to her parents was no doubt intensified by the bitterness
of the dispute between her parents and her brother
and sister-in-law.  Perhaps
she has allowed the dispute to distort her evidence, with the result that in my
opinion, her evidence
should not be relied upon where it is contradicted by
other evidence.
<P>

	<i>Meziyet</i>
<P>

68	My general remarks about Muzeyyen apply with equal force to Meziyet's
evidence.  In her affidavit she gave an account of conversations
amongst
members of the family while they were living at Board Street, Lidcombe, about
buying a house.  She said `I do not remember
any conversations regarding in
whose name the house would be placed'.  However in oral testimony she claimed
that it was agreed that
Hutchinson Street would be put into the names of her
parents.  In her oral evidence she initially said that she knew that her
mother's
name was not on the title for Harrow Road.  Later she appeared to
claim that Harrow Road was held in the names of both her parents
and Mahmut and
his wife.  
<P>

69	Initially she claimed that her current residence, acquired in about 1997,
was the first property she has owned.  Later in her
oral evidence she conceded
that she had owned property before with her previous husband.  Her evidence
about the ownership of property
was generally very confused, and it is possible
that this confusion is connected with cultural and linguistic difficulties.
Like
Muzeyyen, Meziyet has had very little formal education, and even now she
appears to speak only a little English.  On the other hand,
she struck me as an
intelligent witness, confident and forthright in her oral evidence, and well
able to handle the questions put
to her in cross-examination.  I was therefore
left unsure whether her unsatisfactory evidence on matters to do with the
ownership
of property was referrable to confusion on her part, or an excess of
zeal to defend her parents' interests.  I am inclined to the
latter
explanation, and in any event I believe that her evidence should not be relied
upon in respect of any contested points.
<P>

	<i>Mahmut</i>
<P>

70	There are two important inconsistencies between Mahmut's affidavit evidence
and his oral evidence.  The first relates to his
father's contributions to
household and food expenses.  In his affidavit of 4 October 1995 he said that
his father gave him only
small amounts of cash as a contribution to household
and food expenses.  However, in oral evidence he said that his father
contributed
half of the money needed to pay household expenses, though he
insisted that there was no contribution towards a deposit for the house
or home
unit.  Secondly, his affidavit of 4 October 1995 stated that $17,000 was sent
to his father in Turkey on 16 April 1985, and
a transaction slip showing that
deposit was annexed to the affidavit.  In his oral evidence he said that,
notwithstanding the date
on the transaction slip, he was not sure whether he
sent the $17,000 to his father in Turkey in 1985 or 1989, and seemed disposed
to prefer 1989.  
<P>

71	Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that these changes to Mahmut's evidence
were referrable to a broader pattern.  Early in
his evidence, Mahmut minimised
his father's contribution to household expenses and made out that he, Mahmut,
had provided for the
family in a relatively generous way.  However, counsel's
cross-examination about expenditure was persistent and detailed.  It must
have
become obvious to Mahmut that the purpose of the cross-examination was to show
that expenditure on household expenses, when
added to the other payments which
Mahmut claimed to have made from his own and Ayfer's savings alone, far
exceeded their joint income.
 And so Mahmut became more and more reluctant to
give estimates of expenditure as the cross-examination progressed, and when
pressed
to do so, his estimates of expenditure were more and more abstemious.
Parallel with that process, Mahmut gradually acknowledged that
his father's
contributions to household expenses played a greater role than he had indicated
in his affidavit.  Initially he accepted
that he and his father had made equal
contributions to certain specific kinds of bills, and in the end he accepted
that his father's
contribution to all household expenses including rent was
approximately equal to his own.  Of course, this would reduce the amount
of
household expenditure which would need to be covered by his and Ayfer's
incomes, thereby increasing the plausibility of his claim
that all deposits and
mortgage repayments were funded by him and Ayfer alone.  
<P>

72	Similarly, if the $17,000 was sent by him to his father in 1985, he would
have to explain where the money came from for him to
make that payment while
(according to his evidence) repaying the mortgage on Hutchinson Street and
saving up the deposit for Harrow
Road.  So he suggested, instead, that he may
have sent the $17,000 to his father in Turkey in 1989, notwithstanding the date
on the
transaction slip and his earlier affidavit evidence.  
<P>

73	Having reviewed the transcript, I find the account by the plaintiffs'
counsel of Mahmut's evidence to be plausible.  The shifts
from his affidavit to
his oral evidence were each in the direction of reducing the amount of
expenditure borne by his and Ayfer's
incomes during the crucial periods from
1982 to 1984 (when the deposit for Hutchinson Street was being saved) and 1985
to 1987 (during
which time the Hutchinson Street mortgage was substantially
reduced and the deposit for Harrow Road was saved).  One can see a progression
in the evidence, as well as an increasing testiness in the witness.  For
example, initially he claimed that he paid for all expenses
relating to the
car, but later he changed his position and claimed that his father actually
contributed 50% of the expenditure for
upkeep of the car.  Initially he claimed
that he paid for the television and refrigerator himself, but later he claimed
that his
father contributed 50% of the cost.  His estimate for the family's
weekly expenditure on fruit and vegetables in the period 1982
to 1984 was
between $30 and $50 per week, but his estimate for expenditure on fruit and
vegetables in the period 1985 to 1989 had
fallen to $15 per week.  He said the
cost of car maintenance went down from the former to the latter period,
although the car was
getting older.
<P>

74	All in all, I find that Mahmut's evidence was generally more reliable than
the evidence of the plaintiffs, and is generally to
be preferred to their
evidence.  Though the documentary evidence in this case is limited, Mahmut at
least annexed some documents
to his first affidavit, including a document from
the Commonwealth Bank which indicated that he had caused a search to be made of
his bank accounts at the time of the loan for Hutchinson Street.  His accounts
of specific conversations such as the conversation
with his mother and Nejdet
Sayin in 1990, and the conversation with his mother and father in hospital in
1990, appear to be more
plausible than the accounts of those conversations by
his mother. 
<P>

75	Nevertheless, I find his oral evidence is affected by inconsistencies,
specifically as regards the level of his father's financial
contribution to
household expenses and as to payment of the $17,000 to his father in Turkey.

<P>

	<i>Ayfer</i>
<P>

76	I did not detect any flaws or inconsistencies in Ayfer's evidence, and I
found her to be satisfactory as a witness.  Clearly,
however, she was concerned
to minimise her expenditure on herself and her children, so as to preserve as
far as possible the plausibility
of the assertion made by her and her husband
that they funded the deposits for the two properties and repayment of the
mortgages
by themselves, without help from other members of the family.
<P>

	<i>Mehmet</i>
<P>

77	Mehmet's attitude to the proceedings was that he did not want to claim any
interest, or to be represented, or to be otherwise
involved in the proceedings.
He was nevertheless required to give evidence and did so willingly.  But
because of his overall approach
to the case, he was less of a protagonist than
the other witnesses had been, and therefore I found his evidence to be more
reliable.
 I accept his evidence that he worked as a waiter in a restaurant for
only a couple of days a week while in year 11 at high school,
and that he gave
the money to his father on his father's insistence.  However, while I do not
doubt the truthfulness of the witness,
I cannot attach much weight to his
affidavit evidence that when the family moved into Hutchinson Street it was
`quite clear to me
and to all members of the family' that the house had been
bought by Mahmut and Ayfer;  nor to his oral evidence that `everyone knew'
that
the house was his brother's and sister-in-law's.  He admitted that if his
parents and older brothers and sisters were talking
about such things as buying
property and the banks in which money was held, during the period from 1982 to
1987, he would be unlikely
to be interested.  As he said, `I didn't want to
know'.
<P>

	<b>Findings on financial contributions</b>
<P>

78	If it were necessary for my findings to rest solely on an evaluation of the
affidavit and oral evidence of the parties, it is
plain from what I have said
that on all contested issues I would find against the plaintiffs.  In fact, I
do find against the plaintiffs,
subject to an overriding consideration which I
shall mention.
<P>

79	Specifically, I reject the claims by Mr and Mrs Atilgan that they handed
over their pension monies to Mahmut or gave him a withdrawal
slip which enabled
him to withdraw all those monies.  I reject the claim by all the plaintiffs
that the three daughters made available
to Mahmut, either directly or through
their father, their entire weekly earnings.  On that point, I find it more
likely that the
father had access to his daughters' earnings, and that he would
have retained part of the weekly earnings as a contribution to household
expenses, returning the remainder to the daughter.  
<P>

80	I find that Mehmet did not work or make any contribution prior to 1986 or
1987, and at that time he worked only for about a year,
in a casual position as
a waiter for a few days each week.  I find that he gave his earnings to his
father, but it may be that he
received some of the money back as pocket money.

<P>

81	I find that Mahmut and his father shared household expenses, including rent
in Board Street, on an equal basis.  However, it
may well have been that part
of the father's 50% contribution to expenses actually came from the earnings of
his daughters and (to
a limited degree) Mehmet.  The remainder of the father's
and mother's pensions was accumulated in their savings account with the
Commonwealth Bank.
<P>

82	On balance I prefer Mahmut's account in oral testimony to the statement in
his affidavit of 4 October 1995 that his father paid
only small amounts towards
household expenses.  It would be surprising if the father did not use his
pension money to pay at least
a significant share of these expenses.  Mahmut
moved from maintaining that his father paid only a `small amount' to
acknowledging
that his father and he contributed equally to most expenses,
after counsel painstakingly took him through the items of household
expenditure, one by one.  He conceded that his father would have paid 50% of
the electricity bill, and then conceded that much the
same would probably have
applied to other utility bills, and then made a similar concession in respect
to the other expenses.  When
he prepared his affidavit he may not have thought
in depth and detail about the particular items of household expenditure,
recording
instead his overall impression that his father's contribution was a
small amount compared with his own contribution.  The revision
of evidence
seems to me to have been a natural and plausible progression, even though it
appears to have been motivated in part by
a desire to explain his ability to
repay the mortgage and save for the deposit.  I therefore prefer the end result
of that progression
to the point prior to its commencement. 
<P>

83	As to Mahmut's various estimates of the amounts of household expenditure, I
take the view that the items of expenditure were
not less than his
estimates.
<P>

84	I find that the $17,000 was sent to Mr Atilgan in Turkey in April 1985, not
in 1989.  While the transaction slip annexed to Mahmut's
affidavit of 4 October
1995 does not appear to bear the bank's stamp, it appears to have the initials
of a teller, and the date is
quite clearly stated.  It may be that the stamp
was fixed solely to the part of the transaction slip on the other side of the
perforation,
which is not in evidence, or it may be that the bank teller
omitted to affix the stamp.  The absence of the appearance of a stamp
on the
part of the transaction slip which is in evidence is therefore not by any means
conclusive.  I think it is safer to rely on
the documentary evidence
constituted by the transaction slip than to accept oral evidence to the
contrary, very tentatively expressed.
<P>

85	I reject the evidence of the plaintiffs that Mahmut promised Mr and Mrs
Atilgan or either of them that he would give them an
interest in Hutchinson
Street or Harrow Road.  I infer from the evidence of all four plaintiffs that
from quite an early time, before
the acquisition of Hutchinson Street, it is
probable that Mrs Atilgan expressed concern that there was no family home and
that she
and her husband would not be properly provided for.  It may have been
that Mahmut made reassuring statements of some kind which his
sisters have now
reconstructed into more specific statements about acquiring property in his
mother's name.  I do not accept the
evidence of Muzeyyen and Meziyet, or the
evidence of Mr and Mrs Atilgan, that any such more specific statements were
made.
<P>

86	As I have explained, I reject the evidence of Mrs Atilgan that the interest
bearing deposit of $15,000 was used as part of the
purchase money for Harrow
Road.  And I reject her evidence that she consented to the sale of the Gibbons
Street property only on
the condition that her son undertook to transfer Harrow
Road into her name or into the names of her and her husband.  I reject Mrs
Atilgan's evidence that she went to Westpac Bank for the approval of the loan
for the purchase of Harrow Road, or to attempt to make
arrangements for the
property to be transferred into her name.
<P>

87	I accept, however, that Mr and Mrs Atilgan, with financial help from their
daughters, accumulated some savings during 1982-1984
after making their
financial contributions to household expenses.  Similarly, I accept that there
were some savings of their pensions
after deduction of their share of household
expenses during the period 1985 to 1987.  I prefer Mahmut's evidence to theirs,
that
he did not obtain this money, except to the extent, and only to the
extent, that an overriding consideration which I shall mention
points to the
contrary.
<P>

88	The plaintiffs assert that they made financial contributions with the
intention that Mr and Mrs Atilgan would acquire ownership
of or interests in
the Hutchinson Street and Harrow Road properties.  Muzeyyen and Meziyet say
that when they made contributions,
they did not intend thereby to acquire any
interest for themselves, but rather to enhance the interest of their parents.
Mr and Mrs
Atilgan say that they intended, when making contributions, to obtain
an interest for themselves in Hutchinson Street, and to obtain
an interest
either for Mrs Atilgan or for both of them in Harrow Road.  I have found that
the daughters made financial contributions
to their father in amounts which I
cannot quantify, and I accept that in doing so, they did not intend to obtain
any interest in
property for themselves.  However, on the evidence before me,
and particularly having regard to my assessment of the credit of witnesses,
I
am not able to find that any of the plaintiffs intended, when making the
financial contributions which they made, to obtain the
ownership of or any
interest in Hutchinson Street or Harrow Road.  
<P>

	<b>The overriding consideration - the mathematical calculation</b>
<P>

89	If that were the end of the matter, I would therefore find against the
plaintiffs on all of their claimed grounds for relief.
 However, to do so would
be to ignore an overriding consideration which arises out of the mathematics of
the financial circumstances
of the parties.  As I have mentioned, counsel for
the plaintiffs cross-examined Mahmut in detail on his and Ayfer's income, and
on
all expenditure which they claimed to have been made from that income,
during three periods:  namely, the period 1981-1984 when the
family lived in
rented accommodation in Board Street, Lidcombe;  the period 1985-1987 when the
family lived in Hutchinson Street
prior to the purchase of Harrow Road;  and
the period 1988-1989, when the family continued to live in Hutchinson Street
after having
bought Harrow Road.  On the basis of the evidence given by Mahmut,
supplemented by the evidence of Ayfer as to her income and expenditure,
counsel
for the plaintiff prepared a series of schedules showing income and expenditure
for each of those periods, and an overview
for the period 1981-1989.  Counsel
handed up the schedules during submissions after the close of evidence.  I made
sure that counsel
for the defendants would have time to consider and respond to
the schedules.  
<P>

90	Counsel for the plaintiffs said that the calculation of household expenses
was prepared on the basis that wherever a range was
given by Mahmut as to the
cost of an item, the lower figure in the range was used.  Some expenditures
which are known to have occurred
were not included because of the absence of
estimated amounts - certain telephone bills, the purchase of two lounge suites,
and a
van.
<P>

91	The schedules contain some estimates made by counsel rather than by
witnesses.  For the financial year ending 30 June 1982 Ayfer's
income is
estimated to be $3,000.  This is because, on her evidence, she worked for about
three months during that financial year,
and her income for her next full
financial year was just over $12,000.  Further, there was a gap in the evidence
of Ayfer's taxable
income, affecting the financial year ended 30 June 1987.
Counsel has made his calculations on the assumption that the income for
that
year was the same as the income in the subsequent year, even though in the
subsequent year the income was higher because of
rental of Harrow Road, and in
the missing year the income would probably have been lowered by the arrival of
Ayfer's second child.
 This is why there is a note for the 1987 year which says
`probably $8,000 baby etc', but the higher figure is the one used in the
calculation.  Finally, since Mahmut was less cooperative later in
cross-examination than at an early time, his estimated expenditures
for the
period 1988 to 1990 cover more limited ground than for the earlier period, and
consequently counsel has made his own extrapolations
from earlier estimates
where the witness did not give any estimate for the later period, bearing in
mind the number of adults living
in Hutchinson Street at the time. 
<P>

92	I have reviewed the schedules in light of the evidence.  I agree with the
submission of counsel for the plaintiffs that Mahmut's
estimates of
expenditure, upon which the schedules are based, appear to be lower than one
would expect expenditure to be for the
number of people in the house during
each relevant period.  In my opinion, therefore, the estimates of expenditure
are very conservative.
 Moreover, common experience suggests that there
probably would have been other unbudgeted expenditures outside the matters
covered
in cross-examination.  
<P>

93	I reproduce the schedules as an appendix to these reasons for judgment.
They show that during the period from 1981 to 1984 there
was a deficiency of
expenditure over income of $29,939.  Expenditure includes the whole of the
household expenditure and the $36,000
deposit for Hutchinson Street.  The
income is the income of Mahmut and Ayfer alone. 
<P>

94	Mahmut's oral evidence, which I have preferred his earlier affidavit
evidence for reasons which I have given, is that his father
contributed up a
half of the household expenses, though not necessarily on every item of those
expenses.  Without going through all
of the categories of expenditure
separately, it is evident that if Mahmut and Ayfer were required to bear only
half, or a little
more than half of the total household expenditure of $62,472,
they would have been able to save out of their income the whole of
the deposit
of $36,000 for Hutchinson Street. 
<P>

95	As far as Hutchinson Street is concerned, therefore, I take the view that
the schedules do not have the effect of overriding
the findings which I would
otherwise make on the evidence, because the schedules do not demonstrate that
Mahmut and Ayfer would have
been unable to pay the $36,000 deposit from their
own savings.  It follows that the plaintiffs have been unsuccessful in proving
any evidentiary basis for an equitable interest of any kind in Hutchinson
Street.
<P>

96	The schedules show that during the period 1985 to 1987, total expenditures
exceeded Mahmut and Ayfer's income by $60,102.  The
expenditures which are
listed include household expenses of $28,875, loan repayments of $44,000
(including interest), the accumulation
of the term deposit of $15,000, bank
drafts to Mr Atilgan in Turkey of $20,000, and the deposit of $31,000 for
Harrow Road.  One
could also add repayment of the $5,000 loan which Mahmut
borrowed from his solicitor at the time of acquisition of Hutchinson Street,
but as the evidence is not clear on when the loan was repaid, it is probably
best to leave it out.  If one reduces the household
expenses borne by Mahmut
and Ayfer to half the figure shown in the schedule, the deficiency is reduced
to $45,665.  The reliable
evidence is that the bulk of the $15,000 in the term
deposit was contributed by Mahmut and Ayfer.  But even if one reduces the
$15,000
substantially, expenditure still exceeds Mahmut and Ayfer's income by
an amount well in excess of $31,000.
<P>

97	How was this shortfall funded?  As I have mentioned, my conclusion on the
evidence as a whole is that Mahmut and Ayfer had no
other substantial income.
Mahmut's evidence is that he had no other assets, and while Ayfer did not
expressly say so, I infer from
the evidence which they both gave that she had
no substantial assets which she brought to the table to fund the acquisition of
the
properties.  The money could have been provided by loans from friends, but
again I believe the proper inference from all of the evidence
is that there
were no such loans, since Mahmut consistently asserted that the funds came from
their own resources.  On the other
hand, I have found that Mr and Mrs Atilgan
were steadily accumulating savings in some account or other, from their social
security
payments and contributions by children living with them.  In my
opinion the most plausible inference is that Mahmut and Ayfer used
the savings
of Mr and Mrs Atilgan, in an amount well in excess of $31,000, to make up the
shortfall. 
<P>

98	Just how Mr and Mrs Atilgan's savings came to be used by Mahmut and Ayfer is
totally unclear, on the credible evidence which
is available to me.  All I have
is the simple factual inference that the money was probably used, either by
being applied from an
account in their name, or by virtue of it already having
been paid into an account in the name of Mahmut and Ayfer or one of them.
<P>

99	Counsel for the defendants says that the schedules cannot be used to support
the kinds of inferences and conclusions which I
have made, because they do not
take into account anything in the nature of other payments which might have
been received by Mahmut
and Ayfer, in addition to their taxable incomes.  For
example, he points to the availability of a government scheme to assist first
home owners which was in place in the 1980s.  In fact there is evidence that
Mahmut and Ayfer benefited from such a scheme, appearing
as annexure C3 to
Mahmut's affidavit of 4 October 1995.  From that annexure it appears that the
total value of the scheme, over a
five year period, was less than $5,000, and
so that receipt is not material.  Counsel for the defendants also submits that
Mahmut
and Ayfer would have been entitled to child endowment payments in
respect of their children.  However, there is no evidence of the
level of child
endowment payments and I have concluded on the evidence as a whole that
substantially all of their income was represented
by their tax assessments.
<P>

100	Counsel for the defendants also makes a submission based on, or by analogy
with, <i>Browne v Dunn</i> (1893) 6 R 67.  He complains that neither Mahmut nor
Ayfer was challenged on the basis that it would have been impossible for them
to have covered all of the expenditure from the income disclosed in their
taxation assessments.  In fact, however, a series of questions
was put to
Mahmut along those lines.  For example, the following appears at page 323 of
the transcript:
<P>

	`Q.  The reality is that once the Hutchinson Street purchase was made and the
family had moved there, you couldn't possibly have
paid that mortgage off in
the three years that you did, and been saving the amount of money you say you
saved for the Harrow Road
property, unless you were getting the financial help
from your mum and your dad and your sisters that they have said they were
giving
you?
<P>

	A.  Excuse me I would like to say again, I don't want to argue on that.  I
just said whatever evidence or whatever documents I
have given to you, it
should prove and show you there, nice and clearly.  It doesn't matter what I am
saying.'
<P>

101	Imperfect though they are, the schedules demonstrate an inexorable reality,
if we accept at face value the evidence of Mahmut
and Ayfer that they had no
other sources of income.  The reality is that their income fell a long way
short of what would have been
needed to make all the expenditure which they
claim to have made, unless their savings had been augmented by other family
members.
<P>

	<b>The law</b>
<P>

102	The legal principles which are relevant to these peculiar facts can be
stated in brief compass.  In my opinion the only basis
for giving relief to the
plaintiffs of the kind which they seek is under the law of trusts.  The facts
would not support equitable
proprietary relief on some other basis, such as
under the law of proprietary estoppel or the law concerning liens:  cf
<i>Morris v Morris</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 61.</a>  Nor has any such basis been
asserted.
<P>

103	Nor is this a case where there is any factual basis for finding an express
trust.  This is because, on my findings of fact,
it has not been proven that Mr
and Mrs Atilgan provided funds with the intention of becoming entitled to a
beneficial interest: 
cf <i>Malsbury v Malsbury </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 226.</a>  They
assert that they did so, but I have rejected that evidence.  All we have here
is an inference arising out of the financial
mathematics, that Mahmut and Ayfer
must have used savings of Mr and Mrs Atilgan to buy Harrow Road, but no finding
that Mr and Mrs
Atilgan intended that their savings be used for that
purpose.
<P>

104	<i>A fortiori</i>, this is not a case where a trust might be found to arise
out of an agreement or some lesser expression of common intention,
side-stepping
the Statute of Frauds because equity will not allow that statute
to be used as an instrument of fraud:  <i>Bannister v Bannister </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%202%20All%20ER%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 2
All ER 133</a>;  <i>Allen v Snyder </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202%20NSWLR%20685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2 NSWLR 685.</a>
<P>

105	In my opinion, the correct analysis is that on the facts as I have found
them, there is a resulting trust of the Harrow Road
property for Mr and Mrs
Atilgan, who together are entitled to an equitable interest in the proportion
that $31,000 (the cash deposit)
bears to $65,000 (the total purchase price and
expenses).  My reasoning is as follows.
<P>

106	First, the inference from the limited facts which have been proved is that
there was a shortfall in excess of $31,000 between
the expenditure made by
Mahmut and Ayfer and their income, and the savings of Mr and Mrs Atilgan
(augmented by their daughters' contribution)
must have been used to make up the
shortfall.  But that does not demonstrate that Mr and Mrs Atilgan's money must
have been used
as the deposit for Harrow Road rather than (say) for repayment
of loans.  Since the obligation to repay the loan to the St George
Building
Society, and the earlier loan in respect of Hutchinson Street to the
Commonwealth Bank, were undertaken only by Mahmut and
Ayfer, subsequent
repayments by Mr and Mrs Atilgan of instalments of those loans would not give
them any interest in either property,
even though the lenders were secured by
mortgages:  <i>Bloch v Bloch</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20180%20CLR%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 180 CLR 390</a>;  <i>Calverley v Green

Gissing </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 86</a>, 903 (Lord Pearson); <i> Jacobs' Law of Trusts in
Australia </i>(6th ed, 1997 by R P Meagher and W M C Gummow), 293-294.  
<P>

107	However, in my opinion it is appropriate to apply an equitable presumption
which, in the present circumstances, produces the
conclusion that the money
expended for other purposes is presumed to be money of Mahmut and Ayfer, with
the result that otherwise
than as necessarily depleted for those other
purposes, Mr and Mrs Atilgan's money remains for payment of the deposit on
Harrow Road.
 The presumption arises out of <i>Re Hallett's Estate</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2013%20Ch%20D%20696" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880)
13 Ch D 696</a> and <i>Re Oatway </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1903%5d%202%20Ch%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1903] 2 Ch 356.</a>  In the former case the
English Court of Appeal held that where trust money is mixed by the trustee
with money of his own, and expenditure
is made from the mixed fund, withdrawals
are to be treated as representing the trustee's own money and the trust money
is to be treated
as withdrawn only after the exhaustion of the trustee's money.
In the latter case it was held that when an investment is made out
of a mixed
fund and the balance is later dissipated, the investment is treated as having
been made with the beneficiary's money.
 
<P>

108	In the present case the skimpy facts do not establish that there was mixing
of trust money with the money of a trustee.  They
do establish, however, that
during a period of time money over which Mahmut and Ayfer must have had control
or access (namely Mr
and Mrs Atilgan's savings) and their own money were used
for various purposes, with no evidence as to how they were used.  Given
that
Mahmut and Ayfer had control over their own money and Mr and Mrs Atilgan's
money, and there is no way of specifically severing
the funds and tracing them
into the expenditures which were made because of the total absence of evidence,
the situation is closely
analogous to a mixing of trust money and trustee's
money in a single account - so closely analogous, in my opinion, that it is
appropriate
to apply the principle of <i>Re Hallett's Estate </i>and <i>Re
Oatway</i>.  The application of that principle means, in the circumstances,
that the $31,000 deposit for Harrow Road is presumed to have been
provided
entirely by Mr and Mrs Atilgan. 
<P>

109	Secondly, it appears to me on balance that although I have not been able to
find that Mr and Mrs Atilgan intended to make their
savings available in order
to acquire a beneficial interest in Harrow Road, their savings have in fact
been used (with the aid of
the <i>Re Hallett's Estate </i>presumption) to
provide the cash component of the purchase money, the remainder of which was
borrowed.  In the family circumstances
which obtained in this case, there is no
basis to treat Mr and Mrs Atilgan's funds as a further loan to Mahmut and
Ayfer, in addition
to the loans made by the external financier and the
individual from whom Mahmut borrowed $3,000.  Here, relevantly, the only
evidence
is that the savings existed and must have been used as the cash
component of the acquisition.  It is a bare case of legal title vested
in
someone other than the person who must have provided the cash component of the
purchase money, and that is the very case in which
(absent a presumption of
advancement) equity will presume a resulting trust rather than a loan:  <i>Dyer
v Dyer </i>(1788) 2 Cox 92;  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Exch/1788/J8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">(1788) EWHC Exch J8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=30%20ER%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">30 ER 42</a>;  <i>Napier v Public Trustee (WA)</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2032%20ALR%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 32 ALR 153</a>, 158 (per Aickin J);  cf <i>Heydon v The Perpetual Executors
&amp; Agency Co (WA) Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1930/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1930] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281930%29%2045%20CLR%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1930) 45 CLR 111.</a> 
<P>

110	The presumption of a resulting trust may be rebutted by the presumption of
advancement, where property is transferred into the
name of the wife or a child
of the person who provides the purchase money:  <i>Napier v Public Trustee
(WA)</i>, at 158 (Aickin J).  In this case, however, though the evidence is
slight, the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to rebut any
presumption of
advancement.  The evidence shows that Mr and Mrs Atilgan were living in a house
owned by Mahmut and Ayfer.  They shared
household expenses with Mahmut and
Ayfer, but did not confer any bounty in that process.  They were concerned
about their own future
financial security.  They were already apprehensive
because they were not on the registered title to Hutchinson Street.  Taken
together,
these facts are sufficient to rebut any presumption that if their
money was used (and used, it should be noted, without any evidence
that the
money was in fact made available for that purpose or with any actual intention
on the part of Mr and Mrs Atilgan to acquire
an equitable interest), they
intended to make a gift to their son and daughter-in-law.  Here the surrounding
circumstances rebut
the presumption of advancement, and the lack of evidence
about the circumstances of the actual provision of the funds leads to a
presumption that Mr and Mrs Atilgan's money was used for the making of a
permanent investment, and also to a presumption of resulting
trust.
<P>

111	The result of the application of these equitable presumptions is that Mr
and Mrs Atilgan have provided the deposit of $31,000
for the acquisition of
Harrow Road.  They have not provided any part of the borrowed funds which make
up the balance of purchase
money, since those funds were borrowed only by
Mahmut and Ayfer:  see <i>Bloch v Bloch</i>, cited above.  The total purchase
price for the purpose of the application of the law of resulting trusts
includes the incidental
costs and disbursements incurred by the purchaser in
acquiring the property, rather than merely the benefit to the vendor:
<i>Currie v Hamilton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NSWLR%20687" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NSWLR 687</a>, 691 (McLelland J);  cf <i>Little v
Little </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%2043" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 15 NSWLR 43 (Bryson</a> J);  see <i>Jacobs' Law of Trusts in
Australia </i>(6th ed, 1997, by R P Meagher and W M C Gummow JJ) p.293.  In the
present case the total cost measured in this way was $65,000.  Therefore
Mr and
Mrs Atilgan's interest in Harrow Road is an interest in 31/65ths of the
entirety of that home unit property.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Conclusions and orders</b>
<P>

112	For the reasons given, the plaintiffs fail to the extent that they seek a
declaration and consequential relief in relation to
Hutchinson Street.
However, they are entitled to a declaration that Harrow Road is held by Mahmut
and Ayfer on trust for themselves
as to 34/65ths, and on trust for Mr and Mrs
Atilgan as to 31/65ths.  That finding may lead to a consequential order that
Harrow Road
be sold and the proceeds be distributed to Mahmut and Ayfer, on the
one hand, and Mr and Mrs Atilgan on the other hand, in those
same proportions.
However, I intend to hear the submissions of counsel before the final terms of
my orders are settled.
<P>

<center>113	On the question of costs, the plaintiffs have had some success in
relation to one of the two properties, and have failed in relation
to the other
property.  A convenient if approximate method reflecting this outcome would be
to make no order as to costs, with the
intention that each side should bear
their own costs.  However, I shall also hear the submissions of counsel on the
question of costs.
 Clearly, no order for costs will be made against Mehmet,
and I would be very reluctant to make any order for costs against Muzeyyen
and
Meziyet, given the circumstances in which they became parties to the
proceedings.
