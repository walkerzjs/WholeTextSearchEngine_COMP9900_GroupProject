<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	In actions in this court, the first commenced on behalf of the children of
two deceased parents under the Compensation to Relatives
Act, the second
commenced by a plaintiff, one of those children who sustained severe personal
injuries in the motor vehicle collision
in which her parents were killed, the
parties have been able to come to agreement.
<P>

2	In each case my sanction has been sought for that agreement as it is by way
of compromise under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/dapouma1929411/" class="autolink_findacts">Damages (Infants and Persons of Unsound Mind) Act 1929</a>.
On the applications for approval, there has been tendered to me as evidence a
summary of the plaintiff's case dealing with the probabilities
of success in
the action and the quantum of damage, summarising, so I am told, the relevant
medical reports.
<P>

3	It is a summary to which the defendants have also assented.  I am assured by
senior counsel appearing for all parties that in
their view the settlement of
both actions is an appropriate one and that examination has been made of the
medical reports and a commonalty
of views amongst those experts providing
reports has been noted.
<P>

4	The substance of those views is noted at the conclusion of the summary.  The
injuries were appalling.  Provision for the future
is understandably very
large.  There is little discount involved in the settlement for the possibility
of loss of the action although
there was raised by the pleadings, and no doubt
to be raised in the evidence, a prospect that the plaintiff might fail against
the
first defendant on a defence of inevitable accident, and could also fail
against the second defendant, a local council on the basis
that it could not be
shown that council had responsibility for the slipperiness of the road which
would have been the basis for that
defence of inevitable accident.
Nonetheless, on the calculations, that prospect seems little, if at all, to
have been taken into
account.
<P>

5	The sums providing for each head of damages in the personal injuries action
referred to in that summary seem proper.  In those
circumstances, I am of the
view that I can approve the settlement of that action and since I am assured
that the sum in respect of
the Compensation to Relatives action accords with
the general table in relation to damages appearing in the standard text, and
with
the assessment by all counsel of the means of the deceased, affords
appropriate provision for the children, and I am further informed
that
provision is to be divided equally amongst the children, I am, in the context
of the provision, made for the plaintiff in the
other action, of the view that
settlement might also be properly approved in those proceedings.
<P>

6	In each matter I sanction the settlement in respect of Pauline Josephine Borg
who is the plaintiff by her tutor Victoria Pauline
Borg in the first action and
one of the children on behalf of whom the action was brought in the other
action which itself is brought
by Victoria Pauline Borg.
<P>

7	I enter judgment and order costs in accordance with the terms of settlement
in action 12794/87, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8. 
I note paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 9
and 10;  in accordance with the terms of settlement in action 12793/87,
paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,
9 and 10.  I note paragraphs 6, 7, 11 and 12.
<P>

8	I note that I am informed by counsel for the plaintiff that an application
will be brought immediately to enable the appointment
of the Protective
Commissioner, an officer of the court, under the Protected <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea103/" class="autolink_findacts">Estates Act</a> in
respect of the estate of the plaintiff Pauline Josephine Borg.
<P>

9	The monies payable pursuant to the judgment shall be paid to the Protective
Commissioner in his capacity as an officer of the
court to be held for and on
behalf of that plaintiff pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/dapouma1929411/" class="autolink_findacts">Damages (Infants and Persons of
Unsound Mind) Act 1929</a> and in accordance with such order as is made under the
Protected <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea103/" class="autolink_findacts">Estates Act</a>.
<P>

10	I note further that in respect of those monies payable under the judgment,
the monies to be paid to the Commissioner shall be
paid subject to any
deduction under the Social Security Legislation or that the Health Insurance
Corporation is legally entitled
to make.
<P>

11	In respect of one-third of the sum provided for by the judgment in the
action under the Compensation to Relatives Act, I make
the like orders as I
have made in respect of the action for personal injuries.
<P>

12	I direct by consent that the payment of the amounts to be paid to the
Protective Commissioner on behalf of the plaintiff Pauline
Josephine Borg be
consolidated to the intent that one fund shall be established by the
Commissioner on receipt.
<P>

13	Further I grant liberty to the parties to apply on seven days notice in the
event of there being any difficulty in the implementation
of the appointment of
the Protective Commissioner.
