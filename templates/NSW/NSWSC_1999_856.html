<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - difference in substance - "<i>lack of
commitment</i>" - "<i>lack of discipline"</i>)</b>
<P>

1   	The publication in respect of which this plaintiff sues is
an edition of <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>of 8 January 1997.
<P>

2   	By an Amended Statement of Claim filed in Court on 28
November 1997, the plaintiff contends that that publication conveyed
of her, in
its natural and ordinary meaning the following defamatory imputations:
<P>

<i>"(a)	that she obtained unusually poor results in her HSC exams because of a
lack of commitment on her part;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that she obtained unusually poor results in her HSC exams because of a
lack of discipline on her part".</i>
<P>

3   	The plaintiff seeks leave to file a Further Amended
Statement of Claim to plead the following imputations:
<P>

<i>"(a)	that she obtained unusually poor results in her HSC exams due in past
to a lack of commitment on her part.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that she obtained unusually poor results in her HSC exams due in past to
a lack of discipline on her part.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	that she had no commitment to her studies for the HSC.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	that she had no discipline in her studies for the HSC.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	that she obtained unusually poor results in her HSC exams due in part to
not being sufficiently committed to her studies.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	that she obtained unusually poor results in her HSC exams due in part to
her not being sufficiently disciplined in her studies.</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	that she lacked sufficient commitment to her studies for the HSC.</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	that she lacked sufficient discipline in her studies for the
HSC".</i>
<P>

4   	Imputations (e) to (h) are said to be "<i>fall-back"
</i>imputations.
<P>

5   	The matter published by <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>has been
the subject of two judgments by myself in <b><i>Bryant v Nationwide News Pty
Limited;  </i></b>10 July 1998 (DLJ: 1) and 21 April 1999 (NSWSC 360:  DLJ: 2).
Those judgments dealt with different causes of action.  It is clear
however
that the relevant matter complained of common to both actions deals with
principally the failure of the "<i>system"</i>.  It is the concluding
paragraphs however that have given rise acutely to the various plaintiffs'
cases.
<P>

6   	Those concluding paragraphs are:
<P>

<i>"Students from Mt Druitt High School's class of '96 blamed poor resources, a
lack of discipline and their own tomfoolery ofr the disastrous
HSC
results.</i>
<P>

<i>Students David Deagan, Eid Haddad and Tim Jawabreh admitted classes had been
</i>`<i>'mad</i>' <i>last year.</i>
<P>

<i>`There was no commitment [among the students],' Eid, 17, said.  `It was like
a game'."</i>
<P>

7   	These constitute what Mr Molomby described as the "<i>sting
in the tail of the publication</i>".
<P>

8   	For the defendant it is submitted, first, that the
expressions "<i>lack of commitment</i>" and "<i>lack of discipline</i>" are
ambiguous and essentially do not differ in substance.  Secondly, the word
"<i>unusually" </i>as used in respect of the plaintiff Ms Carroll is
"<i>unsustainable</i>" insofar as it is a reference back to her performance and
achievement of "<i>poor results</i>"  This is meaningless vis-a-vis the
plaintiff and the matter complained of is incapable of conveying such a
concept. 
<P>

9   	Thirdly, the word "<i>sufficient</i>" is equally vague
there being no benchmark or guideline vis-a-vis the plaintiff personally
capable of being isolated from the matter
complained of.
<P>

10   	Fourthly, the proposed imputations (g) and (h) arguably
are not capable of being defamatory. 
<P>

11   	It is to be observed that in the proposed imputations
there is included the word "<i>partly</i>".  This is explicable (and not
subject to dispute) on the basis to which I have referred namely that the
article clearly attributes
fault in the system as a cause for poor results.

<P>

12   	For the plaintiff it is argued that there is no ambiguity
on the one hand and there is a clear difference in substance on
the other in
the use of the words "<i>commitment</i>" and "<i>discipline</i>".  The
proposition is put that one could be "<i>committed</i>" to a particular course
of action yet lack "<i>discipline</i>" in pursuing the course to which one is
committed.
<P>

13   	It is further argued for the plaintiff that the origin of
the word "<i>unusually</i>" is clear:  it is the natural meaning that would be
understood by the ordinary reasonable reader of the <i>"whole</i>" of the
matter complained of by reference to the performance, as I understand it, of
Mount Druitt High School in terms of its results
in the context of the whole of
the State.  
<P>

14   	With respect to the first submission for the defendant I
am not persuaded that either of the words in the context of the proposed
imputations "<i>commitment</i>" and "<i>discipline</i>" is ambiguous.  They are
ordinary words in the English language readily understood and the more so by
reference to the matter complained
of.  Further they do differ in substance as
articulated by Mr Molomby.  The submission for the plaintiff I accept.
<P>

15   	With respect to the second and third submissions for the
defendant relating to the words <i>"unusually</i>" and <i>"sufficient</i>" I
accept the submissions for the defendant.  As to the former, the publication is
pleaded to be of and concerning this plaintiff
and the simple point about it is
the obtaining by her of "<i>poor results</i>".  That there are several causes
is capable of being understood from the article.  The failure of the system
arguably is the principal
one that arises from the whole of the article, the
second is the lack of commitment combined with a lack of discipline.  I agree
that essentially the use of the word <i>"unusually</i>" is meaningless in the
context of the article.  Assuming it to be the fact that the article could be
established as being "<i>of and concerning"</i> Ms Carroll, it is capable of
being understood as saying no more than she achieved poor results for the
reasons to which I have referred.
 
<P>

16   	As to "<i>sufficiently</i>" nothing in the matter
complained of in relation to the plaintiff, in my view, admits of any question
of "<i>degree</i>".  The article is capable of being understood as speaking of
a <i>"lack</i>" of commitment and discipline and that is all.  
<P>

17   	These connotations can be captured in imputations of the
following substance:
<P>

<i>"(a)	That she obtained poor results in her HSC exams due in part to a lack
of commitment on her part.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	That she obtained poor results in her HSC exams due in part to a lack of
discipline on her part."</i>
<P>

18   	By reason of the conclusions I have reached as to the
"<i>absolute</i>" nature of the "<i>lack</i>" of "<i>discipline"</i> and
"<i>commitment" </i>there is, in my view, no room for fall-back imputations at
all.  Leave will not be granted to plead them.  In this context however,
I
would add that imputations in the form of (g) and (h) as proposed could be
understood by the ordinary reasonable reader, in my
view, as being defamatory.

<P>

19   	Proposed imputations (c) and (d) are directed to the
conduct or the act of the plaintiff in relation to her studies.  Imputations
(a) and (b) as amended consequent upon my rulings are different and are
directed to the consequence of the discretely identified
conduct in (c) and
(d).
<P>

20   	Accordingly, the plaintiff will have leave to file a
Further Amended Statement of Claim on terms that the following imputations
are
pleaded:
<P>

<i>"(a)	That she obtained poor results in her HSC exams due in part to a lack
of commitment on her part.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	That she obtained poor results in her HSC exams due in part to a lack of
discipline on her part.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	That she had no commitment to her studies for the HSC.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	That she had no discipline in her studies for the HSC."</i>
<P>

21   	These imputations I would find are capable of being
conveyed, are proper in form and are capable of being defamatory.
<P>

22   	On reviewing the submissions it seems to me that the
degree of success on each side is roughly equivalent and a costs order
will
reflect that.  The pleadings had otherwise been closed and accordingly the
plaintiff will have to pay any costs of the defendant
occasioned by the filing
of the Further Amended Statement of Claim.
<P>

23   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Leave to the plaintiff to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim within
21 days of today pleading the four imputations referred
to in these reasons.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff is to pay any costs occasioned to the defendant by reason of
the grant of leave to file a Further Amended Statement
of Claim.
<P>

3.	Each party is to pay her and its own costs of the application of 13 August
1999.
<P>

4.	At the expiry of 21 days liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 7 days
notice.
