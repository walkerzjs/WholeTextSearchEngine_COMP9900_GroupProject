- Forsyth QC and his trust co. owned 12000 ac Yarrawah at Hay and permitted
Clancy and his trust co. to conduct operations including
grazing and cropping
from October 1992 until Forsyth died in August 1997.  During this time Clancy
carried out extensive irrigation
works and other improvements with Forsyth's
knowledge approval and encouragement and earnt large sums from operations.  The
basis
of dealing was recorded in a long series of letters and several documents
- Option, Memorandum, Contract and Licence.  Contract was
poorly drafted by
Forsyth and neogtiations for over 2 years between solicitors for formal
contract to be exchanged did not result
in exchange.  Several weeks before
Forsyth's death Clancy objected to the price and contended it was unfair and
did not give credit
for his improvements.  Forsyth's executors treated this as
repudiation, gave notice of termination and sued for possession.  Clancy
disputed that the Contract was intended to be binding, alleged that it was
unconscionable, alleged a Proprietary Estoppel and relied
on the Agricultural
Tenancies Act.  These defences failed on the facts, principally (1) the
Contract was intended to be binding (2)
If there had been room for Proprietary
Estoppel, the property was held out as available only on payment of Forsyth's
price, which
Clancy was unwilling to pay (3) there was no sharefarming
arrangement as between Forsyth and Clancy.

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  <b><u>The litigation and the parties.</u></b>  These
proceedings relate to possession and ownership of "Yarrawah", a rural property
in the Hay district said to contain approximately
12,000 acres.  Yarrawah is
the land in Certificates of Title Volume 14803 Folio 20 and Identifiers
9/756766 and 13/756766.  There
are now extensive irrigation works on the
property, almost all of which were constructed by the defendants since the
relevant events
opened in October 1992.

3  	The Plaintiff Salienta Pty Ltd was under the control of the late
Mr Neil Harry Mark Forsyth Q.C., during his lifetime. Mr Forsyth
was a member
of the Inner Bar of Victoria;  he died on 29 August 1997. Mr Forsyth was
hospitalised and under treatment for some months
from about the middle of 1994
at which time it was known that he suffered from terminal bowel cancer.  He
informed Mr Clancy of this
in August 1994. He was not an invalid at all times
and displayed vigour in his dealings until 1997; in that year it was clear that
he was gravely ill and that his life was closing.  Many pieces of evidence
including recitals in contractual documents and letters
and assertions by Mr
Forsyth are to the effect that Salienta held Yarrawah in trust or as nominee
for Mr Forsyth.  These statements
must be attributed to Salienta as Mr Forsyth
was the only principal in its affairs and Salienta was wholly under his control
and
direction.  Although there is no evidence of the formal constitution of any
trust, there is no reason to doubt that there was a trust
and the affairs of
the parties were conducted on the footing that there was. 
<P>

4  	In all events relevant to these proceedings, Rosefarms the second
defendant was wholly under the control and direction of the
first defendant Mr
Stephen William Clancy. There is no sign in the evidence that either Salienta
or Rosefarms functioned under a
board of directors, and acts of their
respective principals are attributed to the companies themselves. 
<P>

5  	<b><u>Four Documents</u></b>.  The litigation revolves around
four documents which relate to rights to occupy and own Yarrawah.  The parties
dispute the effect
of those documents, and the defendants dispute whether they
were all intended to have effect and truly express arrangements, and
the
defendants claim equitable relief against their operation. 
<P>

6  	The first is the Option.  This is a licence together with an
option to purchase the property, recorded in a letter from Mr Forsyth
to Mr
Clancy, dated 27 October 1992 - Exhibit 1, Document 2.  Mr Forsyth set out "the
terms we have agreed upon for a licence, and
option to purchase Yarrawah."  The
parties are identified as follows:
<P>

<i>"1.	Licensor:  Salienta Pty. Ltd. (registered proprietor) and Neil Harry
Mark Forsyth (beneficial owner).</i>
<P>

<i> 2.	Licensee:  Rose Farms Pty. Ltd. as trustee of the Clancy Bros. Family
Trust."</i>
<P>

7  	The terms provided for a licence commencing on 1 November 1992
and ending on 30 June 1996, and a licence fee of $1170 four weeks
payable in
arrears; that is, approximately $23,010 per year.  An option to purchase was
granted in these terms: 
<P>

<i>"12.	</i><cite>Option to Purchase</cite><i>:  The licensee is hereby granted
an option to purchase the whole of the property by giving written notice to
that effect at any time
before 1 July 1996.</i>
<P>

<i> 13.	</i><cite>Purchase Price</cite><i>:  The base price will be $1,625,000.
It will be increased by:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	$1,000 for every week which elapses between 1 November 1992 and </i>
<P>

<i>the date of settlement of the purchase;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a further $50,000 if the date of settlement is later than 1
November</i>
<P>

<i>1994; and a further $50,000 if the date of settlement is later than </i>
<P>

<i>1 November 1995; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	any further capital expenditure by the licensor (with the consent
of</i>
<P>

<i>the licensee) between 1 November 1992 and the date of exercise of the</i>
<P>

<i> option (such as acquisition of further water licences)."</i>
<P>

8  	The time-based increases in the base price over 191 weeks would
amount to $291,000 by 30 June 1996 when the Option expired.
 The price was also
to be increased by any further capital expenditure made by the licensor with
the licensee's consent.  In addition
by cl.6 the licensee was to complete a
program of capital improvements "to be agreed between us from time to time"
having a value
of not less than $1000 per week.  The minimum obligation for
expenditure over 191 weeks on capital improvements was $191,000.  By
cl. 15 a
more formal written agreement was to be drawn up by solicitors if either party
desired.  
<P>

9  	An important part of the context in which improvements were
carried out is that under the Option of 27 October 1992 Mr Clancy
was obliged
to carry out a program of improvements.  On the one hand Mr Forsyth had an
entitlement to have improvements carried out
and an economic interest in having
them carried out, because they would accrue to him if Mr Clancy did not
exercise his option or
otherwise acquire the property.  On the other hand Mr
Clancy could contemplate getting the benefit of his improvements by acquiring
the property in accordance with the Option or any other arrangements between
himself and Mr Forsyth.
<P>

10  	The second document is the Memorandum dated 13 December 1994,
Exhibit 1, Document 15 headed "Contract for Sale of Yarrawah".
 It is preceded
in Exhibit 1 by two unsigned generally similar memoranda.  The parties are
referred to as follows:
<P>

<i>"1.  Vendor: 	N.H.M. Forsyth;</i>
<P>

<i>     Purchaser: 	Steve Clancy or nominee approved by vendor."</i>
<P>

The price was $2,115,556, payable by instalments of $250,000 each year on  or
before 30 June 1995, 1996 and 1997, and the balance
on or before 30 June 1998.
There was to be interest on the whole amount at 2% payable quarterly until 30
June 1997 then at 10% payable
quarterly, and a further $50,000 per annum for
each year 1995 to 1998 inclusive.  This introduced the terminology that the
payments
made pending payment of the price were referred to as "interest" on
the amount of the price. Sometimes Mr Forsyth referred to such
payments as
"agistment". In economic function they were the same as the Licence fee under
the Option. The Memorandum was signed by
Mr Forsyth and Mr Clancy.  It does not
contain any express term conferring a right of occupation before settlement.
<P>

11  	The third document is the Contract dated March 1995, Document 17
headed "Contract for Sale of Yarrawah".  The copy in evidence
is signed by Mr
Forsyth: other evidence shows that Mr Clancy received a copy in March, later
showed it to his solicitors and then
signed a copy in May or June and returned
it to Mr Forsyth by 15 June 1995.  The Contract provided for the sale of
Yarrawah by Mr
Forsyth to Mr Clancy for $2,327,111, for instalments of $250,000
to be payable on 30 June 1996, on 30 June 1997 and on 30 June 1998,
and the
balance on 30 June 1999.  Clause 5 set out a table of interest payments payable
at the end of each quarter from 30 June 1995
to 30 June 1999.  The interest
rates were not stated and the amounts payable on each 30 June were much greater
than the amounts payable
on other quarter days.  There is no provision in this
document conferring an entitlement to possession on the vendor, but as with
the
Memorandum of 13 December 1994 the obligation to pay interest on the purchase
price suggests a common assumption that the purchaser
would be in
occupation.
<P>

12  	The Contract dated March 1995 is quite clear in expressions
which establish that  Mr Forsyth as beneficial owner was the vendor,
the
purchaser was Mr Clancy and the subject of the sale was the land Yarrawah,
together with incidental rights.  Clause 13 provided
for transfer of the whole
of the issued capital of Salienta to the purchaser.  On a reading of the whole
terms of the document it
is clear that Salienta was registered owner of the
land and that the transfer of the shares in Salienta was incidental to the main
subject matter.  It could I suppose have been thought that transfer of control
of Salienta while Salienta was still the registered
owner was means of
effecting transfer of the land which the parties could adopt; the contract did
not provide that they had to adopt
those means.
<P>

13  	The fourth document is the Licence, Document 30 entitled
"Licence to Occupy Land".  This document refers to itself as a deed
and was
signed sealed and delivered by Mr Forsyth, Salienta and Rosefarms who were
named as the parties.  Mr Clancy was not named
as a party.  The date of the
deed is given as 1996 and the copy bears no other date except an inscription
suggesting that it was
word-processed on 2 August 1996.  Recitals refer to
Salienta as registered proprietor and Mr Forsyth as beneficial owner, and refer
to the Contract dated March 1995 as a Contract by which Mr Forsyth had agreed
to sell Yarrawah to Mr Clancy.  The recitals also establish
that Salienta
granted the licence to Rosefarms as Mr Clancy's nominee, at the direction of Mr
Forsyth.  The Deed conferred a licence
to occupy the land from the possession
date 1 March 1995 for the Permitted Use, which was defined and meant "...<i>the
right to farm the Land and to carry out all ancillary activities</i>."  
<P>

14  	There were many meetings, conversations and letters between Mr
Forsyth and Mr Clancy from about October 1992 until Mr Forsyth
died.  There
were also communications with solicitors and other representatives of Mr
Forsyth and Mr Clancy.  Mr Forsyth visited
the property many times and took a
close interest in the improvements and farming activities which Mr Clancy
carried on there.  There
was a  friendly personal relationship with easy
communication between the two men throughout the events and until shortly
before
Mr Forsyth died.  This relationship existed in a context where it was
obvious that they were dealing with each other over ownership
and use of
property of significant value and in the contemplation that ownership of that
property would pass for a large amount of
money.  Many letters from Mr Forsyth
to Mr Clancy are in evidence and they contain many examples of suggestions,
encouragement and
expressions contemplating a successful outcome for Mr Clancy
and a transfer of the property.  I view these communications in the
context of
the contractual relationships between the parties.  
<P>

15  	<b><u>The pleadings</u></b>.  The proceedings were commenced on
10 June 1998 when Salienta issued a Summons against Mr Clancy and Rosefarms.
In the Further Amended
Statement of Claim of 7 June 1999 Salienta seeks
declarations which would establish that on or before a Notice of Termination
dated
23 December 1997 which Salienta gave to the defendants, their rights of
occupation under the Contract dated March 1995, the Licence
or from any other
source were terminated.  Several alternative bases are put for this contention
and, reflecting cl.2.4(b) of the
Licence, the defendants' entitlement to enter
the land until 30 June 1998 for the purpose of cultivating, harvesting and
removing
crops planted prior to 23 December 1997 is accepted.  Salienta claims
judgment for possession of the property and leave to issue
a writ of possession
and also damages.  The principal bases are that the Licence was terminated on
23 December 1997 by breach of
the Contract of March 1995 and a notice based on
cl.2.4(a)(iii) in that Rosefarms had not made any payments of principal and
interest
after September 1997, that the defendants repudiated the Contract of
March 1995 by a letter dated 25 August 1997 from Mr Clancy's
solicitors to Mr
Forsyth's solicitors, Document 60.
<P>

16  	In his Defence Mr Clancy takes the position that the Contract
dated March 1995 was not and was not intended to be a binding
agreement.  For
this reason he denies that he defaulted in payments under it and thereby
committed a breach, and that he repudiated
it.  Paragraph 10 of the Defence
states that the contract was not intended to be binding, that it was too
incomplete or uncertain
to constitute a binding legal contract, and that it was
signed in such circumstances that it ought to be set aside having regard
to the
relationship between Mr Forsyth and Mr Clancy.  It is also contended that
documents required by cl.4(1) of the Conveyancing
(Vendor Disclosure and
Warranty) Regulation 1996 were not annexed.  It is also contended that the
Contract dated March 1995 an agreement
for sale of the issued shares in
Salienta and not for the sale of Yarrawah.
<P>

17  	In its Defence Rosefarms takes a generally similar position to
Mr Clancy.  It also relied on subss.19(4) and 27(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural
Tenancies Act 1990</a>.  It also contends that Salienta was estopped by
representation or alternatively by convention from claiming possession of
Yarrawah
and that Rosefarms was entitled to a charge over and a conveyance of
Yarrawah.
<P>

18  	In its Amended Cross-claim Mr Clancy and Rosefarms allege that
the Contract dated March 1995 was not intended to be of legal
effect and was
not binding, allege entitlement to equitable relief against the March 1995
document and set up a proprietary estoppel
entitling the cross-claimants to a
conveyance of Yarrawah and alternatively to a charge over it.  The
Cross-defendants are Mr Forsyth's
executors and also Salienta.  There are three
executors, Mrs Brown formerly Mrs Forsyth, Mr I.R. Phillips and Mr J.W.
DeWijn.
<P>

19  	The pleadings and the conduct of the proceedings establish that
the signatures and authenticity of the principal documents
are not disputed,
nor is the Notice of Termination; the dispute relates to their legal effect,
and to circumstances which are alleged
to create an equitable estoppel and to
disentitle Salienta from relying on its rights as owner of Yarrawah.
<P>

20  	Neither party has claimed to enforce the Contract dated March
1995, except in the limited sense that Salienta maintains that
a right of
termination of the Licence arose on breach. Indeed both parties are now
prevented from enforcing the contract; Salienta
and the executors by giving
Notice of Termination and claiming possession, and Mr Clancy and Rosefarms by
contending that it was
not legally binding and by all later conduct, including
the terms of their pleadings and the position taken at the hearing; and neither
has claimed any remedy based on it.    Salienta contends that Mr Clancy
repudiated the Contract, and in my opinion it is clear from
the terms of the
letters that, if the Contract dated March 1995 had effect, Mr Clancy's letter
of 12 August 1997 and his solicitors'
letter of 25 August 1997 were a clear and
complete repudiation of it. There is no possibility that either Mr Clancy or
Rosefarms
may obtain any remedy based on the Memorandum of 13 December 1994 or
has any equitable estate arising from it, and they have not
so contended.  
<P>

21  	<b><u>Approach to Fact finding</u></b><u>:</u> Several
circumstances influence my approach to fact finding and the application of the
standard of proof on the balance of probabilities.
 One is that in substance
Rosefarms and Mr Clancy make a claim against the estate of a deceased person in
circumstances where Mr
Forsyth's evidence on matters in dispute is not
available.  There is a well-established practice of approaching claims of that
kind
with care and considering carefully the availability of corroborative
material.  Another circumstance of some importance is that
the case put forward
by Mr Clancy and Rosefarms involves impeaching the apparent effect of
documents, including documents signed
by Mr Clancy, which passed between the
parties without contemporaneous challenge.  A contention that these documents
were not the
true arrangements and do not express the true basis of action over
a number of years requires careful consideration.  Another is
the need for
clarity of expression and of proof of the representation or other circumstances
alleged to give rise to an equitable
estoppel.  Equitable remedies of that kind
are not granted unless the basis for the remedy appears clearly.
<P>

22  	<b><u>The principal issues.</u></b> There are two principal
issues in the case. The first revolves around the defendants' principal case
based on Proprietary Estoppel.
 It is claimed that Salienta's conduct created
an expectation that the defendants would not be evicted but would be permitted
to
purchase Yarrawah at a fair value having regard to the improvements they
effected, that in that expectation the defendants carried
out improvements, and
that as a result Salienta is estopped from claiming possession and the
defendants are entitled to purchase
Yarrawah at a fair value having regard to
the improvements which Rosefarms effected; or if not, is entitled to an
equitable charge
over the property. The other principal issue revolves around
the defendants contention that the Contract of March 1995 does not establish
the rights of the parties; and that it was not intended to have legal effect,
and that, if it had legal effect, the defendants should
be relieved in equity
against it. To address these issues it is necessary to review the long history
of the parties' relationship.
<P>

23  	Cases are not classified precisely by describing them as
Proprietary Estoppel cases.  Cases depend greatly on careful examination
of
their facts and of the circumstances which are held to render it unconscionable
for a proprietor to rely on ownership of land
and on the absence of any
obligation under the general law to recognise a claim.  Defendants' counsel
referred me extensively to
the case law but I do not find in the cases cited
any close or useful analogy to the present facts because the present facts are
distinguished by the overwhelmingly important characteristic that the
acquiescence and extensive encouragement on the one side and
the extensive
works performed on the other took place in the presence of explicit written
arrangements which spelt out the principal
advantages which each party was to
expect. <u>If</u> the Contract dated March 1995 was binding it would remove the
whole subject from the law relating to equitable estoppel; if it were
not
binding, its highly explicit character would make it impossible that any
equitable relief to be granted would be on terms other
than that the stipulated
price was to be paid.  
<P>

24  	The remove between a case where the parties do have a contract
and the subject of equitable estoppel is I think illustrated
by the
propositions distilled by Priestley JA from the decision of the High Court in
<b>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v. Maher</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387.</a>  Priestley
JA's judgment embodying these propositions in <b>Silovi Pty Ltd v. Barbaro
&amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 466</a> was concurred in by Hope and McHugh JJA.  The
fifth of Priestley JA's propositions, at 472 was <i>"For equitable estoppel to
operate in circumstances such as those of the present case there must be the
creation or encouragement
by the defendant in the plaintiff of an assumption
that a contract will come into existence or a promise be performed, and
reliance
on that by the plaintiff, in circumstances where departure from the
assumption by the defendant would be unconscionable." </i> This proposition is
not exhaustive, as there is also room for equitable estoppel to be the basis of
relief in a further class of
cases where the plaintiff is unable to point to an
agreement which although yet unformed or unenforceable contains terms
describing
what he expected from the defendant; see Priestley JA's observations
in <b>Austotel Pty Ltd v. Franklins Selfserve Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 502</a>
at 604.  Proprietary estoppel cases typically fall within the further class so
identified by Priestley JA.  A lack of precision is
a characteristic of many
cases in this field including <b>Plimmer v Wellington Corporation</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%209%20AC%20699" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 9
App. Cas. 699</a> which defendant's counsel described as the archetypal
illustration, and <b>Cameron v Murdoch</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2063%20ALR%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 63 ALR 575</a> on which great
reliance was placed.  Where the parties' behaviour has pointed out in detail,
for example in a purported but ineffective
contract, what  their expectations
were, the court is obliged to treat those as the expectations which were
reasonable.
<P>

25  	<b><u>The history of the parties' relationship</u></b>. It is
appropriate to look at the terms of each communication for the purposes the
defendants' claim that on a whole view of the
parties' relationship the
defendants are entitled to an estoppel and equitable relief. The first
significant document between the
parties is Mr Forsyth's letter of 15 October
1992 Exhibit 1, Document 1.  This letter points out that what is under
discussion at
this stage is a licence to use part only of Yarrawah.  In it Mr
Forsyth stated that the licence was not to be a lease and that he
was  "free to
go and come upon the land" as he chose. Mr Forsyth looked forward to a meeting
on 24 October 1992.  This letter can
be looked to for interpretation of the
Option, to identify the subject matter or resolve any ambiguity.  
<P>

26  	Exhibit 1, Document 2 is the letter of 27 October 1992, the
Option.  Each party accepts that this letter was fully effectual
to create a
licence and an option to purchase according to its terms.  This was a very
advantageous arrangement for Rosefarms.  The
payments for Licence fee $23,010
and improvements $52,000 totalled $75,010 per year, about 4.6% of the base
price; and were mostly
in a form the benefit of which could be taken back by
Rosefarms.  The licence fee per year was about 1.4% of the base price.  There
was no deposit, and there was no premium for the Option.  Rosefarms had an
immediate licence to occupy, not stated to be exclusive,
an entitlement to
sublet all or any of the property and an option to purchase which was available
until 1 July 1996.  There was no
obligation to pay a large capital sum for up
to three years and eight months and in the meanwhile Rosefarms could work the
property.
 The Option was not ever exercised.
<P>

27  	On 30 November 1992 the Headingly Agreement Exhibit 1, Document
4 was made between Headingly Farm Contractors Pty Ltd which
Mr Forsyth
controlled, and other parties including Rosefarms and Mr Clancy. Headingly
agreed to provide a finance facility for $200,000
to Rosefarms.  This facility
was to be drawn against by Rosefarms for the sole purpose of financing capital
improvements on Yarrawah.
 In the course of the next year it was fully drawn.
The loan was assigned to Alnwick Pty Ltd on 19 February 1996 and again assigned
to Stourhead Pty Ltd on 20 August 1997; these companies are also associated in
some way with Mr Forsyth.
<P>

28  	In 1993 Mr Forsyth purchased some water rights for the benefit
of Yarrawah from a neighbour Mr Heckendorf, and he maintained
that this led to
his being entitled to an increase in the four-weekly payments of licence fee.
This was accepted and from March 1994
payments were made at an increased rate.
Correspondence dealing with this subject is Exhibit 1, Documents 6 and 7.  
<P>

29  	In 1994 Mr Clancy negotiated with neighbours called the Headons
for the purchase of land adjoining Yarrawah.  This led to negotiations
in which
Mr Forsyth and Mr Clancy considered arrangements under which the Headingly loan
of $200,000 was to be treated as repaid,
and a new loan from Stourhead Pty Ltd,
also controlled by Mr Forsyth, of $1,300,00 was to be made to enable Mr Clancy
to purchase
the Headon property.  In recompense or in part recompense for this
further advance the price which was to be payable for Yarrawah
on exercise of
the Option, which was slowly escalating in accordance with the terms of the
letter of 27 October 1992, was to be altered
and was to become $2,440,556
payable by instalments of $250,000 each on or before 30 June 1995, 1996 and
1997 with the balance payable
on or before 30 June 1998.  Correspondence
relating to this proposed arrangement appears at Exhibit 1,  Documents 8, 9 and
10.  These
proposals did not mature, apparently due to lack of progress in
dealings between Mr Clancy and the Headons.  On 4 August 1994, Document
12, Mr
Forsyth in a letter to his solicitors recorded the state of his dealings with
Mr Clancy, which he said were an agreement in
principle but had not been
carried to the detail of agreeing on the appropriate adjustment.
<P>

30  	The next significant correspondence was the Memorandum dated 13
December 1994, Document 15, preceded by the two unsigned generally
similar
memoranda and which recorded the price to be $2,115,556 payable by three
instalments of $250,000 by 30 June in each of 1995,
1996, 1997 and the balance
on 30 June 1998.  If the Memorandum had effect it would not be possible to
treat the Option of 27 October
1992 as still governing the relationship; there
could be no purpose in continuing the existence of a contractual option to
purchase
if the parties entered into a memorandum of contract of sale of the
property.  The price and instalments were different.  There were
no provisions
for capital improvements or escalation of the price and the time contemplated
for settlement was extended by up to
two years.  There was no express provision
for Mr Clancy to be permitted to occupy Yarrawah pending completion, although
the parties'
behaviour clearly shows that that was permitted, and the provision
for interest on the purchase price seems to contemplate that Mr
Clancy would
have the benefit of occupation. 
<P>

31  	Also on 13 December 1994 by letter Exhibit 1, Document 16 Mr
Forsyth confirmed extension of the Headingly loan of $200,000
to 30 June 1997,
and specified other terms .  One term was "If the principal of $200,000 is not
repaid in full by 30/6/97 NHM Forsyth
may rescind the contract of sale of
Yarrawah as if default had been made under that contract."  Mr Clancy signed
this letter, and
this shows his agreement to its contents<i>.</i>
<P>

32  	The Contract dated March 1995 established another price that was
higher than that in the Memorandum, namely $2,327,111.00,
and a scale of
payments which start a year later than in the Memorandum; $250,000 on 30 June
1996, 1997 and 1998 and the balance
on 30 June 1999.  In the Contract interest
was payable in amounts specified for each quarter; mathematically the amounts
stated represent
a low rate, although no rate is stated.
<P>

33  	Document 18A, Exhibit 1 is a lengthy letter dated 26 June 1995
from Mr Clancy's solicitors to Mr Clancy seeking detailed instructions
on many
matters which would have a bearing on the terms of a contract for sale of
Yarrawah.  The letter shows that Mr Boyce, the
solicitor then acting for Mr
Forsyth, was to prepare a contract for sale of the property and submit it to Mr
Clancy's solicitors.
 Document 18A addresses many matters which had not been
addressed in the documents prepared by Mr Forsyth but were appropriate for
consideration when professional skills were brought to bear on a sale of a
large rural property for over two million dollars.  (Mr
Forsyth later quoted
his own solicitors as considering that Mr Forsyth's drafting was amateurish;
and so it was.)  Mr Clancy's solicitors
spelt out at page 3 the view that the
low rate of interest for the first two years implied that the agreed price was
inflated above
market value, and brought before Mr Clancy's consideration a
number of practical commercial aspects of the transaction 
<P>

34  	In Exhibit 1, Document 20, a letter of 7 August 1995, Mr Forsyth
set out an explanation of how the purchase price of $2,327,111
had been arrived
at.  In doing so he recounted what he said was the effect of negotiations from
time to time over the period since
27 October 1992 and the impact of various
changes in the parties' dealings.  The stages were that he said that the base
price in
a contemplated exchange of contracts of 1 July 1994 was to be
$1,888,890, that this was escalated by 4% per annum for 3 years making
$2,115,556 and an extension of the contemplated time for payment of the balance
to five years led to an increase of 5% per year for
each of two extra years,
that is a further 10% above $2,115,556 making $2,327,111.  Mr Forsyth's letter
went on to discuss various
considerations and contingencies affecting time and
amount of final payment.  This letter shows his contemplation that there might
be further negotiations and movement in the parties' positions.
<P>

35  	On 18 August 1995 Exhibit 1, Document 21, Mr Forsyth's
solicitors Messrs Hunt and Hunt sent Mr Clancy's solicitors Messrs Greaves
Wannan &amp; Williams drafts of <u>a</u> contract of sale of land and of a deed
of release, obviously contemplating an exchange of contracts which was still to
take place.
 Salienta was to be the vendor and Mr Clancy was to be the
purchaser.  The price was to be $2,327,111 with no deposit.  The vendor
was to
provide second mortgage finance of $2,077,111 from Alnwick Pty Ltd on
completion.  The draft deed of release would have extinguished
the Option of 27
October 1992.
<P>

36  	Correspondence followed between the solicitors about the terms
of the draft contract. There was discussion about the draft
at a conference
attended by Mr Clancy, his accountant Mr Lea and solicitors for both parties on
24 November 1995. The correspondence
shows that in late 1995 and thereafter the
parties contemplated that the terms of the formal contract of sale would be
agreed on
and that an exchange would take place. The form which the contract
would take when exchanged was never settled by agreement.  
<P>

37  	In his letter of 5 October 1995 Exhibit 1, Document 26 Mr
Forsyth encouraged Mr Clancy to plant belts of Tasmanian Blue Gum
trees on
Yarrawah.  Mr Clancy proceeded with a planting project.  
<P>

38  	In a letter of 15 July 1996 Exhibit 1, Document 28 Mr Forsyth
said to Mr Clancy: <i>"Basically, we are still proceeding in accordance with
the March 1995 Contract of sale signed by both of us.  However, it has been
agreed that Rosefarms Pty Ltd rather than you personally, should be the
purchaser."</i>  He also said: <i>"Perhaps it is also as well to record that
the present intention of the parties is to proceed with reasonable expedition
to enter
into a formal contract of sale, (our solicitors considering that my
own drafting is somewhat amateurish); followed quite soon by
a transfer of the
property and a mortgage back."</i>  In my finding this then was the intention
of both Mr Forsyth and of Mr Clancy.
<P>

39  	In a second letter to Mr Clancy of 15 July 1996 Exhibit 1,
Document 29 Mr Forsyth recorded a change in the financial arrangements
in the
Contract dated March 1995.  First the instalment of $250,000 due on 30 June
1996 was deferred and interest was running at
18% per annum.  Secondly Mr
Clancy was to obtain a first mortgage from some third party of $1,000,000 and
the mortgage advance by
Alnwick was to be deferred to that.  There was to be a
higher rate of interest on the second mortgage.
<P>

40  	Another letter of 15 July 1996 from Mr Forsyth to his
solicitors, Exhibit 1, Document 31, shows that he contemplated settlement
of
the sale in the near future and he commented: <i>"As I pointed out to Steve,
completion of the contract of sale with me is really irrelevant to his
continuing negotiation.  Economics
effectively compels him to go ahead with the
Yarrawah purchase no matter what.  (He has obtained a recent valuation of
3.7M.)"</i>
<P>

41  	Document 30 in Exhibit 1 is the Licence to Occupy Land of 1996.
This is not the product of communications between the solicitors
who were
acting for the parties in relation of the proposed exchange of contracts; it
seems that one or other of them may not have
known of the Licence.  The Licence
refers to the Contract dated March 1995, and deals with that agreement as if it
were regarded
by all parties to the Licence as in effect.  The possession date
is given in the Licence as 1 March 1995 which was the earliest possible
date
for the operation of that agreement, and provisions relating to termination of
the licence in cl.2.4 are related to completion,
rescission or termination of
that agreement.  On ordinary principles of estoppel by deed the Licence bound
its parties to the proposition
of fact that there was an agreement of March
1995. Mr Clancy himself did not execute the licence as a party to it; he
participated
in Rosefarms' execution.
<P>

42  	Document 46 is the second draft contract forwarded on 9
September 1996.  In relation to this it was Mr Clancy's evidence that
if the
proposed financiers had been able to provide sufficient finance both sides
would have gone ahead with that contract.  As the
financiers were not so able,
discussion between solicitors for the parties turned to a proposal for Salienta
as vendor to provide
finance for the whole of the purchase price.
<P>

43  	Correspondence between solicitors about the terms of the draft
contract continued after 9 September 1996 - Exhibit 1, Document
32 and others.
Mr Forsyth wrote a letter of 10 September 1996 Exhibit 1, Document 36 to Messrs
Morrison and Sawers solicitors for
Kyabram Pty Ltd, a proposed mortgagee, in
support of finance to Mr Clancy to complete the purchase.  Those solicitors
gave searching
consideration of the proposal, but no first mortgage finance was
forthcoming.  
<P>

44  	In a letter of 2 December 1996 Exhibit 1, Document 42 Mr Forsyth
informed his solicitors (and he sent a copy to Mr Clancy)
that he had agreed a
new financing regime with Mr Clancy; no principal was to be paid until 30 June
2002; the price contemplated
remained $2,327,111, further interest was to be
paid; Alnwick Pty Ltd was to be the mortgagee and that <i>"Steve is now anxious
to proceed promptly with signing a contract and settlement.  So, of course, am
I."</i>  Mr Forsyth contemplated that the solicitors would <i>"... agree the
terms of the contract and proposed mortgage."</i>
<P>

45  	On 23 January 1997 Document 48 Kyabram Property Investments Pty
Ltd declined to proceed with a proposed loan to Rosefarms.
<P>

46  	A further draft contract incorporating a mortgage back was
submitted on 24 January 1997 -  Exhibit 1, Document 45.  In this
draft the
contract the price was unchanged and the covering correspondence did not
discuss changing it.  This continued to be the
position with solicitors'
correspondence and all correspondence between the parties until August 1997.
This draft was more detailed
and elaborate and dealt with subjects which
earlier drafts had not expressly dealt with.  The draft contemplated that
exchange and
completion would be contemporaneous.  The entire price of
$2,327,111 was to be secured by a first mortgage granted to Alnwick Pty
Ltd,
the principal to be repaid on 30 June 2002, and there were detailed provisions
for interest until then.  Salienta's solicitors
said: <i>"We confirm that we
are advised by Mr Forsyth that he is very ill and that he considers the
completion of this transaction to be a
matter of urgency."</i>  They commented
on a number of matters of detail.  They also enclosed drafts of a guarantee to
be given by Mr Clancy, a deed extinguishing
the Option and a Licence to Occupy
Land; these were to be completed at exchange.
<P>

47  	On 28 January 1997 Exhibit 1, Document 47 Mr Forsyth wrote to Mr
Clancy with suggestions to assist him to make an application
for a working
capital loan to some other lender such as a bank.  His concluding comment was:
<i>"Plainly, I have a direct interest in all this, because the sounder your
finances are, the more readily you will be able to perform
under the mortgage.
But quite apart from that, I do very much want you to reap the financial
benefits from Yarrawah which your enterprise
and industry deserve."</i>
<P>

48  	Correspondence between the solicitors about the proposed
exchange and completion continued in March 1997 and thereafter.  Meanwhile
Mr
Clancy continued to make payments to Mr Forsyth referable to the Contract dated
June 1995, but with some modifications which I
do not understand.  Mr Forsyth's
letter of 3 April 1997 Document 51 to Mr Clancy recorded the then state of
these payments.  Correspondence
continued and in his letter of 10 April 1997
Exhibit 1, Document 54 Mr Forsyth gave Mr Clancy and Mrs Clancy warm assurance
of his
concern that they should reap the full rewards of their initiative,
perseverance, ingenuity and hard work.  On 2 May 1997 Mr Clancy's
solicitors
objected to some provisions of the proposed contract.
<P>

49  	<b><u>The end of the relationship.</u></b>  There was a change
in the mood and mode of expression of the correspondence with Mr Forsyth's
solicitor's letter of 31 July 1997
Document 57.  This responded and made
comments on matters raised in the letter of 2 May 1997.  Expressions in the
letter clearly
show an understanding that there was potential for a dispute;
for example the letter is referred to as an open letter, although there
was no
reason theretofore why "without prejudice" or any other reservation should be
attributed to the correspondence.  Mr Forsyth's
solicitors made a statement
adhering to the proposed repayment regime, with detailed comments.  They
reviewed various steps in negotiations,
including some which are not recorded
in correspondence in Exhibit 1.  They commented in detail on the implications
of the purchaser's
having invested a large amount of money and effort into
improving the property, as was of course well known to Mr Forsyth.  They
gave
assurances of Mr Forsyth's continuing admiration and goodwill for Mr Clancy.
They put forward Mr Forsyth's views on the causes
of Mr Clancy's apparent
financial difficulties.  They demanded that various payments which, in Mr
Forsyth's view of things, had fallen
due be brought up to date, including two
instalments of $250,000 which had become due to Alnwick Pty Ltd on the loan,
earlier the
Headingly loan, and had not been paid.  They concluded: <i>"Our
client regrettably wishes it to be made known to the purchaser that the time
has come for it to perform in accordance with its
contractual obligations or
otherwise face the action that will flow."</i>
<P>

50  	On 10 August 1997 there was a meeting at which Mr Clancy, his
accountant Mr Lea, Mrs Forsyth and Mr De Wijn were present.
<P>

51  	In a letter headed "Without Prejudice" and dated 12 August 1997,
Document 58, addressed to Mr Forsyth and his wife, Mr Clancy
stated his
position.  This letter was prepared for him by his accountant Mr Lea, but as Mr
Clancy said in evidence, "It was my thoughts".
 Mr Clancy reviewed the work
which had been done on Yarrawah and many steps in the negotiation. He presented
the view that the base
value of Yarrawah was $700,000 and had not increased
during his association with it and that the increases in value arose from
expenditure
by Mr Clancy.  In a letter which made many assertions which were
contentious Mr Clancy put forward a broad position based on the
assertion that
the property apart from his own efforts was worth $700,000.  <i>"I would be
happy to purchase "Yarrawah" on the following basis.  I believe a genuine offer
for the property would be $2,400,000.
 From this I would deduct a modest
$1,200,000 on account of my contribution.  This would leave Neil with
$1,200,000 for his contribution.
 This figure represents an extremely fair
appreciation of his investment including the Headingly and Heckendorf
loans".</i>  He proposed that he would obtain $800,000 on first mortgage from a
third party and give Mr Forsyth a second mortgage of $400,000
at 11% for three
years.
<P>

52  	The terms of the letter of 12 August 1997 show that Mr Clancy
was then not prepared to treat or to continue to treat the Contract
dated March
1995 as binding on Rosefarms or on himself, and the cessation of payments soon
afterwards bears out this view.  The position
which he has taken at all times
since, particularly in his pleadings and the conduct of this litigation shows
that he and Rosefarms
have since the last payment was made been entirely
unwilling to comply with that arrangement, whether or not it is a binding
contract.
<P>

53  	In their reply of 21 August 1997 Document 57 Messrs Hunt  and
Hunt asserted Mr Forsyth's position that the contract entered
into in March
1995 was binding and enforceable and called for confirmation by 22 August that
it would be performed, and otherwise
threatened proceedings. On 25 August 1997
Mr Clancy's solicitors wrote a letter Document 60 to Mr Forsyth's solicitors
which, with
a narration of some facts, made a denial that the Contract dated
March 1995 was binding on Mr Clancy.  The letter stated that it
was astonishing
to suggest that it was binding, described the deal then proposed as harsh and
unconscionable and threatened a claim
for compensation for the value of the
improvements.  Mr Forsyth's death followed within a few days and with it any
communications
recognisable as negotiations ended.
<P>

54  	<b><u>The legal effect of the Memorandum</u></b>.  Mr Clancy
said in evidence to the effect that when he signed Document 15 the Memorandum
dated 13 December 1994 he was not happy
to have it represent the arrangement
pursuant to which he agreed that Rosefarms would buy Yarrawah and that he was
under a lot of
pressure from Mr Forsyth.  Mr Clancy also said that he did not
believe that the document was a binding contract but only that it
was an
agreement in principle, meaning "<i>a proposal as to how he would move to a
contract for the purchase of the property</i>". 
<P>

55  	Mr Clancy said too that he did not believe he actually agreed
with everything in Mr Forsyth's calculation which produced the
price set out in
Document 15; he thought the rate of interest was too high and there was not any
allowance made for the fact that
Rosefarms did not have to do anything until
mid-1996.  I do not accept his evidence on the effect of the Memorandum.  It
purports
to be a memorandum of a contract, it deals with the essential terms of
a sale of land, and the contemporaneous arrangement in Document
16 confirms
that it was a contract by providing for its rescission.
<P>

56  	<b><u>The legal effect of the Contract dated March 1995</u></b>.
Preparation of the Contract dated March 1995 followed Mr Clancy's coming to the
view that he could not make a payment of $250,000
on or before 30 June 1995,
and it would seem telling Mr Forsyth that this was so.  Mr Clancy's evidence
shows that he relied on himself
in deciding whether he could make payments.
<P>

57  	It was contended that the intention that the Contract should not
be binding should be inferred from later dealings, and from
the openness of the
parties to discussion of terms for a more formal arrangement.  Further Mr
Clancy has asserted in evidence that
he did not consider it binding "...
<i>bearing in mind the relationship I had with Neil"</i> (t126, l7).  The
behaviour of the parties to it shows that there was room in their intentions
for negotiation and modification; and
the contemplation was clear that a more
formal document would be entered into.  
<P>

58  	Mr Clancy ceased to make weekly payments in accordance with the
earlier arrangements in March 1995; from that date he made
payments in
accordance with the March 1995 document.  The first interest payment of $61,635
was paid in July 1995.  This supports
the view that that document was then
regarded as effective to create an obligation to pay money, and effective to
override the previous
arrangements.  Payments broadly in accordance with that
document continued until September 1997.  One payment was made several weeks
after Mr Forsyth's death; thereafter they stopped.  Mr Clancy was unable to
explain why the payments ceased and said he did not recall
why that was.
<P>

59  	Some things which well ought to have been attended to were not
attended to.  On the purchaser's part stamp duty should have
been paid but was
not.  The Contract dated March 1995 generally speaks at an imprudently simple
level and does not deal appropriately
with complexities such as the water
rights and the transfer of shares in Salienta.  It would have been prudent to
enter into a more
formal document, and the drafts produced by solicitors
illustrate that many subjects had not been addressed with which it is prudent
for a contract about such an elaborate matter as the sale of a property of
12,000 acres to deal.  In my view what was under consideration
until August
1997, through three drafts and much solicitors' correspondence, was putting an
established agreement into a more suitable
form; however the established
agreement remained a binding contract.  There is no evidence of any express
arrangement which established
that the Contract dated March 1995 was not
intended to be binding.  In my finding the Contract dated March 1995 was
binding and was
intended to be.
<P>

60  	<b><u>The Legal Effect of the Licence dated 1996.</u></b>  One
advantage produced by the Licence Agreement was that it established in a clear
way and in writing that Rosefarms did in fact
have a licence, that is the
permission of Salienta, to be in occupation of Yarrawah.  A licence is
explicitly granted by cl.2.1,
limited to the permitted use and subject to the
concurrent right of the lessor to enter the land under cl.2.2. It was expedient
that
there should be a licence in writing in that the Option according to its
terms expired on 30 June 1996 and it could not be thought
that thereafter the
Option conferred a licence.  The parties' conduct since late 1994 shows that
they no longer treated the Option
as effective, but there was no express
written arrangement which established that.
<P>

61  	The Licence confirmed in a clear way that the Contract dated
March 1995 was treated as binding.  This appears from the recitals
and the
references to the Contract.  The recitals are as follows:
<P>

<i>"Recitals</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The Licensor is the registered proprietor of the Land.</i>
<P>

<i>B.	Forsyth is the beneficial owner of the Land.</i>
<P>

<i>C.	Pursuant to the Contract Forsyth has agreed to sell the Land to</i>
<P>

<i>Stephen William Clancy (Clancy) or his nominee.</i>
<P>

<i>D.	Forsyth has directed the Licensor to grant a Licence to occupy the
</i>
<P>

<i>Land to the Licensee, as Clancy's nominee.</i>
<P>

<i>E.	The Licensor has agreed to that request subject to the execution of
this</i>
<P>

<i>Deed by the Licensee."</i>
<P>

The definition of "Contract" in cl.1.1 is as follows:
<P>

<i>"Contract means the Agreement dated March 1995 for the sale of the Land by
Forsyth to Clancy or any subsequent Agreements for the
sale of the Land between
the Licensor as registered proprietor acting on the direction of Forsyth and
the Licensee as Clancy's nominee."</i>
<P>

The definition of "Permitted Use" is: 
<P>

<i>"Permitted Use means the right to farm the Land and carry out all ancillary
activities".</i>
<P>

62  	Termination was dealt with by cl.2.4(a) in these terms:
<P>

<i>"2.4	Termination</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	The Licence shall terminate on the earliest of the following:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the Date of Completion of the Contract;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	the Date of rescission or termination of the Contract;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	the Date on which the Licensor notifies the Licensee of the </i>
<P>

<i>		termination of the Licence for a breach under this Deed of</i>
<P>

<i>		the Contract; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	the liquidation of the Licensee.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Unless paragraph 2.4(a)(i) applies, the Licensee shall give vacant
possession of the Land to the Licensor on the Termination Date,
however, the
Licensee and its sublicensees shall be permitted to enter upon the Land for the
purpose of cultivating, harvesting and
removing any crops planted prior to the
Termination Date by the Licensee or its sublicensees."</i>
<P>

63  	Document 31 suggests that the Licence Agreement was prepared by
Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley Canberra who were acting for Bald
Hill Quarries in a
proposed sharefarming and financing agreement with Rosefarms, and that they in
some way wanted comfort with respect
to Rosefarms' occupation of Yarrawah.  Mr
Clancy gave a similar explanation for the Licence.  Mr Clancy explained the
licence document
of 1996 as arising out of a need to offer Bald Hill Quarry,
which was growing crops under a share-farming or some similar arrangement
with
Mr Clancy on Waradgery and on Yarrawah, some greater certainty of occupation.
Bald Hill Quarry was growing corn on Yarrawah.
 In Mr Clancy's explanation the
expiry of the Option on 30 June 1996 was not related to the Licence.  
<P>

64  	A word-processing  imprint in the Licence suggests that it was
printed on 2 August 1996.  Correspondence in Exhibit 12 suggests
that the
Licence was probably executed early in August 1996.  In Mr Clancy's explanation
of how he came to execute the Licence Agreement
he says that he was approached
by his own accountant Mr Lea who presented the problem of Bald Hill Quarries'
requirement to him.
 In my finding no pressure of any kind was exercised on Mr
Clancy in relation to entering into the Licence.  He had a full opportunity
to
consider its terms, and obtain advice about its implications before Rosefarms
executed the document.  Mr Clancy said that he did
not intend Rosefarms to be
bound by its terms.  The evidence gives no real basis why the document should
not be accepted as effective
to bind Rosefarms according to its terms.  Among
other things it would bind Rosefarms to the proposition that the Contract dated
March 1995 was in force as a contract.
<P>

65  	The Licence, Document 30 was executed under its common seal by
Rosefarms attested by Mr Clancy as director and Mr Andrew S.
Lea as secretary.
Although Mr Clancy sought to disavow this document and said to the effect that
he did not know its contents and
did not intend that Rosefarms be bound by it,
there is no basis in substance on which it could be held not to be binding on
Rosefarms
as its Deed.  I find that the Licence was binding on the parties to
it,  according to its terms.
<P>

66  	Curiously in view of the explanation for its existence relating
to giving comfort to Bald Hill Quarries Pty Ltd the licence
in cl.2.1(a)(i)
appears to be limited to permission to Rosefarms to occupy the land for the
permitted use.  Sub-licensing was contemplated
as there is a reference in
cl.2.4(b) to permitting sub-licensees to enter; but this relates only to entry
by sub-licensees after
the termination date and for the purpose of cultivating
harvesting and removing any crops planted prior to the termination date.
 Mr
Forsyth's conduct seems to show that as before he accepted that there would be
sublicensing.
<P>

67  	<b><u>The improvements</u></b>. A large body of evidence
established what improvements to Yarrawah have been carried out and illustrated
their scale.  There is
a lack of precision in establishing the times at which
works were carried out, what work in detail was done and the expense involved.
In October 1992 a small area of Yarrawah had been contoured for irrigation,
variously stated as 100 acres and 250 acres, but it was
principally rough
country appropriate for grazing with improvements suitable for that purpose.
The major works carried out by Mr
Clancy later were water storage facilities,
construction of supply channels, drainage and recycling system, and
construction or irrigation
and layouts. 
<P>

68  	Development work began late in 1992 and early 1993 when Mr
Clancy says he did irrigation work on 500 to 600 acres for cropping.
 In 1994
Mr Clancy built a water storage of about 48 hectares on the northern part of
Yarrawah, an area known as "The Crown Lease"
(although freehold). Early in 1994
the big river pump was constructed; its volume of 140 megalitres, many times
the previous pumping
capacity, enabled irrigation works for 2,500 acres of rice
to be constructed.  In and after 1996 he built a larger water storage
of
approximately 77 hectares in the southern part of Yarrawah. Construction of the
storage works involved huge volumes of earthmoving
works, which Mr Clancy was
well equipped to do by experience and availability of equipment.  These water
storages greatly enhance
the utility of other irrigation works, as they allow
the accumulation of water when available by purchase or at times of high river
flow, and storage until time of need when further supply may not be available.
Complex arrangements exist for pumping water from
the pump on the Murrumbidgee
River and transporting it by a channel over several neighbouring properties.  A
lengthy main supply
and infield channels have been constructed for reticulation
from the Murrumbidgee River and thence to irrigated fields from the storages.
Further drainage and recycling works have been constructed.  Huge areas have
been laid out for irrigation, partly by contoured ploughing
and partly by laser
levelling; Mr Clancy claimed that over 7000 acres of irrigated layout have been
created.  He estimated that the
contour banks constructed were almost 200
kilometres.
<P>

69  	Associated with the irrigation works are many items of hardware,
including a large pump at the river and the constructions
for head walls,
valves, pipes, gates, road crossings and many other works.  There have also
been general improvements including fencing
and cattle yards.
<P>

70  	Mr Clancy and Rosefarms in fact continued to make improvements
on a large scale after payments ceased in September 1997 and
after Notice of
Termination in December 1997.  In my opinion there is no basis in which any
remedy in respect of them could be granted.
Development work continued in 1998.
Mr Clancy's evidence was that he did not undertake any new projects after
December 1997 but that
he completed projects which had been commenced by then.
These included completing the construction of the second storage, which was
completed in 1998.  He also completed development work for irrigated land.
<P>

71  	The improvements carried out must be regarded as permanent
improvements.  By carrying them out Mr Clancy greatly enhanced his
earnings
during the years he has been in occupation. Revenue was generated from
occupation of Yarrawah in several ways.  Income was
gained from cropping,
grazing, rental and sale of water.  Crops included rice, soya beans, wheat,
barley, oats and hay.  Cropping
was undertaken in a variety of arrangements,
some involving sharefarmers and not always producing revenue in money.
Proceeds of cropping
from Yarrawah and from other properties are not well
differentiated.  Stock have been run on parts of Yarrawah not used for
cropping,
or during intervals.  There have been large earnings contemporaneous
with occupation, not always in the form of money as they sometimes
take the
form of work performed in exchange for use of land for cropping or agistment,
or other advantages, and the advantages do
not always accrue on Yarrawah.
<P>

72  	Mr Clancy and Rosefarms were not in a position to prove in
detail the value in money or otherwise of their expenditures on
Yarrawah.  It
was Mr Clancy's case that he simply did not have or was unable to produce
detailed records or accounts which would
establish what the costs had been.  I
found this very unsatisfactory, as maintaining records and accounts is an
obligation incurred
by operating in the corporate form.  Expert evidence was
tendered providing assessments of the volume of the work done and of its
costs,
but these appear to me to leave very wide margins of possible inaccuracy.  Then
too Mr Clancy was not in a position to give
any clear evidence of the
advantages which he has gained from occupation.  The material put in evidence
leaves me to deal only in
broad terms.  
<P>

73  	Mr Clancy gave evidence only in the broadest detail of the costs
and time which he had expended in working on Yarrawah.  He
said that he had
worked 80 to 100 hours a week on Yarrawah; I regard this as an overstatement,
particularly as he had enterprises
on other properties.  
<P>

74  	In my finding the works carried out are improvements which have
transformed the nature of Yarrawah and very greatly enhanced
its value.
Irrigation works require considerable maintenance.  Lasered areas need to be
re-lasered every four or five years, and
work on clearing and maintaining
channels is more or less continuous.  However the works are of permanent value.
The utility of the
works will depend on continuing maintenance work of
appropriate intensity, and also on commercial success in negotiating water
supply
by purchase or other arrangements with land-holders, on managing
availability of water off-location and at times of high flow, and
otherwise on
continued and successful water management. I do not regard the evidence as
enabling me to make a finding more precise
than that the improvements have very
greatly enhanced the value of Yarrawah, doubling and perhaps trebling its
value, and that the
cost of the works has probably exceeded the large
advantages which have flowed to Mr Clancy and Rosefarms from occupation.  If
the
facts had been that the Contract dated March 1995 was not legally binding
but Mr Clancy wished to complete a transaction to the same
effect including its
provisions as to price, and Mr Forsyth or his successors had resisted, Mr
Clancy and Rosefarms would have had
a strong claim for remedies based on
Proprietary Estoppel.  However the facts are very different.
<P>

75  	Mr Valuer Shuter expressed the view that Yarrawah's value was
$3.4m as of 1 April 1998.  I accept his valuation, which in a
general way is
indicative of the level of value at present.  Mr Valuer Smith in what he said
was an estimate only, expressed the
view that the value of Yarrawah as of
August 1997, valued on the assumption that the improvements effected since
October 1992 had
not been carried out, was $720,000.  I do not regard this
evidence as reliable as it was expressed to be an estimate and not a valuation
and no convincing supporting detail was given with it.  In any event, on the
findings I have made elsewhere, the value of the property
at the time and on
the assumption referred to is not relevant.  Mr Engineer Healey gave evidence
in which he estimated the cost of
the earthworks as $2,523,407.  This is a
crude assessment based on generalised material and assumptions, and more
accurate material
ought to be available from Rosefarms if its affairs were
conducted with appropriate care.  It is a particular difficulty that Mr
Healy
proceeded on market rates for contracting work, which I do not regard as an
appropriate measure for the purpose in hand, in
which the cost to Rosefarms is
a significant element in appraising the detriment which Rosefarm would incur if
it did not obtain
relief.  While I do not accept Mr Healy's estimate in detail,
it is obvious that the earthworks were very large, continued over some
years
and involved costs on a massive scale.
<P>

76  	Mr Halligan, a chartered accountant, made an assessment as
revised that the net profit from trading on Rosefarms over the period
of his
occupation was $827,204.  He also assessed the revenues over the period at
$7,468,718.00.  Mr Halligan's evidence was based
on his analysis of the records
which Rosefarms did maintain. However proceeding from the records to
conclusions relating to the facts
now relevant required him to depend on a
number of arbitrary ex post facto allocations, largely made by Mr Clancy for
the purposes
of the analysis.  Mr Halligan did not offer a conclusion about the
amount of the Development Costs.  His allocations left a large
majority of
expenditure, very large sums unallocated.  The cost of development activities
cannot be established to any reasonable
degree of reliability.  I can only take
a very general view of what they were and in that general view it seems that
they probably
amounted to several million dollars and are unlikely to be fully
represented in the value of the property.  It seems likely that
the development
activities were largely financed from Mr Clancy's and Rosefarms contemporaneous
revenue-producing activities on Yarrawah
and on other properties, and from the
employment of otherwise unused capacity of his earthmoving business.  
<P>

77  	<b><u>Proprietary Estoppel.</u></b>  Mr Clancy in his evidence
made a statement which in its terms appears to explain the nature of his
attachment to the project of
improving and acquiring Yarrawah  (t123-124):
<P>

<i>"Q.  You said you felt under pressure to sign that document which you
received in March 1995.  If you did so, why did you wait until
late May or
early June or, on the basis of your last answer, possibly until early July to
sign it and return it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Because I was unsure about signing it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  What was it about it you were unsure of?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Your, Honour could I explain something that might help understand the
answers?</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  I think the question allows that, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>WITNESS:  It goes back to the definition, that's why I have a problem in
answering, that goes back to the actual definition of even
what `Yarrawah' is.
When you have the map you will see the physical boundaries of `Yarrawah'.  To
me, that is only part of what `Yarrawah'
is, that is, the physical
property.</i>
<P>

<i>Part of what `Yarrawah' is the bond between Neil and myself, the friendship
between Neil and myself, the drive between us to achieve
is mutual benefit,
which was, on the one hand, Neil getting a very advantageous price for the
property, us getting the long term
benefit of the property; together we got the
enjoyment of creating the property.</i>
<P>

<i>`Yarrawah' is physically `Yarrawah'.  `Yarrawah' was an entity.  Also
discussed anything we did; in my eyes to generate income, to
create what Neil
and I would enjoy, to fulfil the partnership that Neil and I had to build or
create what was a work of art.  To
me it's ongoing, `Yarrawah' still lives and
grows through that.  Neil still lives, our friendship is still there, Neil
never died.
 To me Neil lives in what I created and it's very hard to take.
When they talk of `Yarrawah' they are talking of physically myself.</i>
<P>

<i>I am talking an entirely different subject.  The whole thing of what we
built and created together and I find it very hard to rationalise
between the
physical part of it and the entity of what we built and we were -</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  I am not sure you have done yourself justice in answering the
question.</i>
<P>

<i>WITNESS:  The pressure that was there was the pressure that my side of the
bargain, arrangement, partnership, whatever it was, to
create all this, to
fulfil my side of the partnership, it's hard to reduce that to words and say
the pressure was --</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  Q.  I see you have explained there was a sense of commitment to
a project.  Do you feel you have done yourself justice
in answering the
question, or do you feel there is anything else that deals with the question
</i>
<P>

<i>A.  What was the question?</i>
<P>

<i>(Question marked * read)</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Neil, for his side of the bargain, was to advise, treat us fairly, help,
assist in any way he could, whether that fitted into
- whether this agreement
fitted into that category.  If Neil said I could afford to do something, I
would try and do that thing.
 If he said I could afford to make these payments,
I wold attempt to make these payments."</i>
<P>

78  	This is not as a matter of language a clear explanation, but it
shows that Mr Clancy felt a deep emotional involvement in Yarrawah
and in his
dealings and personal relationship with Mr Forsyth.  At several other passages
Mr Clancy also spoke about the nature of
his personal relationship with Mr
Forsyth in a manner which revealed considerable feeling.
<P>

79  	At all times there was before Mr Clancy a document which
described in clear detail the terms upon which Mr Forsyth was prepared
to sell
the property; several different documents from time to time, but the proposal
before Mr Clancy was always clearly stated
in writing.  At no time was it
reasonable for Mr Clancy to expect that Mr Forsyth would transfer Yarrawah to
Rosefarms at any less
price than the price stipulated.  Different prices were
stipulated from time to time.  When there were movements, they were upward.
The amounts and times of payments were renegotiated; but in no way was it ever
held out to Mr Clancy that Rosefarms could obtain
the property for a lower
price than Mr Forsyth currently stipulated in writing, or that he could get
benefit from his improvements
except by buying the property (except, of course,
for what he was earning by his operations on Yarrawah). 
<P>

80  	The existence of a good and personal relationship between the
two men, and the many expressions of encouragement, approval
and hopes of
success which Mr Forsyth made do nothing to obliterate, on any reasonable view
available to Mr Clancy, the understanding
that the availability of the property
was availability at the price stipulated.  Indeed the fact that a price had
been established
in Mr Forsyth's proposals, and the clarity of statement and
the absence of any challenge to it, must have had a great deal to do
with the
element of goodwill in the relationship.  For each side there were advantages,
and the advantages were ones which each party
wished to obtain.  Mr Clancy's
position now appears to be to the effect that his relationship with Mr Forsyth
was such that he felt
that Mr Forsyth would not ultimately require him to pay
more than a suitable and fair price.  In my finding there was no reasonable
basis for Mr Clancy to have any expectation about price other than expectations
based on what Mr Forsyth expressed in writing.  
<P>

81  	From June 1995 until August 1997 all dealings were conducted on
the basis that the price was to be $2,327,111.00.  Apart from
an entirely
subjective interpretation put forward by Mr Clancy there is no objective
indication that Mr Forsyth did anything to create
an expectation of Mr Clancy
that Rosefarms would get the property at any other price or at a price
determined on any other basis.
Other aspects of the transaction or proposed
transaction were discussed or further considered or the subject of new
provisions in
drafts; and these aspects included the time and manner in which
the purchase price was to be paid and whether there was to be mortgage
finance
from the vendor; but the price itself was never the subject of questioning or
further discussion until the conversation of
10 August 1997, involving Mrs
Forsyth and Mr De Wijn, followed by Document 58 of 12 August 1995.  The
challenge which was then made
to the price was entirely new.  The terms of the
letter show that it was not the continuation of some long-running debate about
the
price.  The position put in the letter was radically different to any
position with which Mr Forsyth had ever been associated; in
effect it was a
proposal that he would accept far less than the $1,625,000 with which
arrangements between the parties had opened
almost five years earlier.
<P>

82  	The expectations which Mr Clancy could reasonably hold and which
could in any way be attributed to Mr Forsyth about the terms
on which Rosefarms
would acquire Yarrawah could not at any stage have included an expectation that
the price would be a price as
determined by objective valuation, as of any
date, on the basis that the improvements had not been made.  At no time did Mr
Forsyth
deal with Mr Clancy on any basis of which that was a possible
interpretation.  The letter of 12 August 1997 departed in a most radical
way
from any expectation which it could have been reasonable for Mr Clancy to hold
until then.  Until that date the expectations
on which it was reasonable to act
in carrying out improvements were expectations based on Mr Forsyth's current
position as expressed
in writing.  
<P>

83  	From October 1992 until the parties ceased to act on the basis
of the Option at some time from December 1994 to June 1995,
the only
expectation on which it was reasonable for Mr Clancy to act was that if he
exercised the Option within the time available,
and incurred and met the
obligations which came with exercising the option, he would have the property
including the benefit of the
improvements which he was carrying out; he had no
reasonable basis for an expectation that he would get the benefit of the
improvements
in any other way.  From 13 December 1994 onwards and again from
June 1995 onwards, the only expectation on which it would be reasonable
for Mr
Clancy to act in incurring expenditure for improvements, and the only
expectation which it could be said was created or contributed
to by Mr Forsyth,
was an expectation that Rosefarms would own the property and have the benefit
of the improvements if the terms
in the documents of those dates were carried
out, Rosefarms met the obligations expressed in them and did so within the
times referred
to; all the obligations, including as to the price. This is true
whether or not the Contract dated March 1995 was intended to be
or was a
legally binding contract; I am of the view that it was, but if it were not, it
could not reasonably give rise to any expectation
which differed from its
terms.
<P>

84  	Mr Clancy's expressions in evidence to the effect that he
believed that Mr Forsyth would treat Rosefarms and Mr Clancy fairly
were borne
out in a way by the fact there were several re-negotiations; however this is
not a basis for any expectation that there
would be a departure from Mr
Forsyth's stated price, which was a basic matter throughout.  
<P>

85  	All of Mr Forsyth's acts of acquiescence and encouragement
occurred in the context of express arrangements, reliance on which
is entirely
sufficient to explain the conduct of Mr Clancy and Rosefarms in occupying and
improving the land.  For the period during
which the parties acted on the
Option, the rights under it were a sufficient source of remedies and protection
against incurring
loss by carrying out the improvements.  The value of the
improvements could be realised by purchasing the land in exercise of the
Option
and would be lost if that were not done; so much was then obvious.  At later
stages any expectation which it would be reasonable
to rely on and could be the
source of equitable remedies must have related to the Memorandum of 13 December
1994 and then from June
1995 onwards to the Contract dated March 1995.  From
June 1995 onwards the Contract dated March 1995 and expectations of advantages
to be obtained under it were the only reasonable bases upon which Mr Clancy and
Rosefarms could rely for protection in respect of
improvements.  The only
reasonable expectations of advantage to flow from improvements which Mr Clancy
could hold related to completing
the Contract and taking title under it, and it
must then have been obvious that if those things were not done no long-term
value
would be gained from the improvements.  I see no room for the operation
of the law relating to Proprietary Estoppel where the rights
of parties are
established contractually, no matter what acquiescence or encouragement there
was.  If the Contract dated March 1995
were not binding its operation for the
purpose of the law of Proprietary Estoppel could only be to create expectations
according
to its terms, including to the term relating to price, a subject of
central importance and explicit statement on which Mr Forsyth
did not after
June 1995 show any flexibility, and was not asked to.  
<P>

86  	There could not in my opinion be any continuing expectation, on
a reasonable basis, that Mr Clancy and Rosefarms would obtain
title to Yarrawah
and the benefit of the improvements after the series of events of August and
September 1997 in which Mr Clancy
stated that he was quite unwilling to pay
$2,327,111 but that he was willing to pay $1,200,000, his solicitors denied
that there
was a binding arrangement, Mr Forsyth died and the personal
friendship between Mr Forsyth and Mr Clancy ended and Rosefarms ceased
to make
payments after September.  At no stage since then and throughout the hearing
have Mr Clancy and Rosefarms adopted the position
that they were willing to pay
$2,327,111; the case put forward was to an entirely different effect, that the
amount which should
be paid was a value to be determined by the Court supported
by evidence which suggested that that value was even far less than $1,200,000.

<P>

87  	In these circumstances it is in my judgment in no way
unconscionable for Salienta and Mr Forsyth's successors to rely on Salienta's
legal title to the land, its legal right of possession and on the termination
of the Contract dated March 1995.  I see no room for
Proprietary Estoppel when
all relevant conduct happened in the context of legally binding contracts under
which Mr Clancy and his
nominee had rights to take title if they complied with
the obligations.  If these were not binding they have much the same effect
to
define what expectations it would be reasonable to hold and act on about the
interest which would be conferred and the circumstances
in which it would be
conferred.
<P>

88  	As of August 1997 Mr Forsyth, who had been known to be seriously
ill for some years, was known to be gravely ill; this was
referred to in the
correspondence of 1997 and was well known to Mr Clancy.  In the context of the
parties' earlier dealings and Mr
Forsyth's circumstances, the letter of 12
August 1997 appears retrospectively to be an astonishing departure from any
expectation
which might reasonably have been held by Mr Forsyth about the
future of his transactions with Mr Clancy.  At about this time Mr Clancy,
being
as he says unhappy with the proposed arrangements, came to <i>"...the opinion
that we could not proceed under those lines and if I could have one final
attempt at getting back to square one."</i>  In my finding, in August 1997 and
before Mr Forsyth's death Mr Clancy and Rosefarms became entirely unwilling to
purchase the property
on the terms which Mr Forsyth had kept before them in
various forms since June 1995, and that, whatever else its terms may show,
the
letter of 12 August 1997 is an expression of this entire unwillingness.  Until
then discussions had proceeded for years on the
basis that the price was
agreed. 
<P>

89  	Mr Clancy also said of the schedule of payments in the
Memorandum of 13 December <i>1994 "I assumed the payments would be credited
against any ultimate price."</i>  There is no reasonable basis for that
assumption; there was no reason why Mr Clancy should not pay contemporaneously
for the advantages
of occupation as distinct from the price.  
<P>

90  	For the first time too the letter of 12 August 1997 expressed an
alleged understanding by Mr Clancy that Rosefarms was to be
credited with the
value of the improvements on the property.  This too was an entirely radical
change in the proposed arrangements.
 It is altogether inconsistent with each
of the Memorandum and the Contract, which are the parties' expressions and
purport to be
expressions of agreement, and with the various forms of draft
contract.
<P>

91  	Mr Clancy expressed in evidence in various ways a complaint to
the effect that he was not given any credit or allowance in
the price for the
improvements which Rosefarms effected on Yarrawah.  This was a characteristic
of each proposal which is recorded
in any way, from October 1992 until the end
of Mr Forsyth's life.  At each stage Mr Clancy and Rosefarms had the benefit of
possession
of Yarrawah, the opportunity to carry out improvements on Yarrawah
the opportunity to work the property and get the concurrent benefits
of the
improvements, and generally to get the benefits of occupation before having to
pay the purchase price.  In the first form
of the arrangement, in October 1992
there was actually an obligation to make improvements at least at a stated
rate.  At later stages
when the Option was no longer treated by the parties as
governing their affairs, improvements continued to be made, on a large scale.
The flow of advantages was not solely favourable to Mr Forsyth; the price was
deferred and Mr Clancy and Rosefarms had the opportunity
to work the property
with the benefit of the improvements, and to allow others to work the property
in return for advantages of various
kinds, without any payment in the nature of
a deposit.  It was obvious from the outset that unless Mr Clancy and Rosefarms
in some
way completed a purchase the long-term advantage of the improvements
would be lost and the only advantages gained would be gained
while actually in
occupation.  This was obvious whether or not the various documents were
intended to be binding; the risk that there
would be no long-term benefits from
improvements if there were no transfer of title was obvious at all times.  
<P>

92  	The reasoning underlying the price of $2,327,111.00 in the
Contract dated March 1995 was explained by Mr Forsyth in a letter
of 7 August
1995, Document 20, and in the terms of that explanation there was no place for
a credit or allowance in the price for
the improvements.  Mr Clancy showed this
letter to his solicitors.  However until August 1997 there was no challenge to
the reasoning
or debate about the principles or the amount in any written form,
or as far as evidence shows, in any other way.  It does not appear
to me that
the reasoning expressed by Mr Forsyth in that letter relies on Rosefarms paying
for the improvements which it effected.
 However even if that were a true view
of the reasoning underlying the price, from June 1995 onwards the price had
been established
in the parties' negotiations, and until August 1997 it was
never challenged or raised for re-negotiation.  Quite otherwise, it was
a
constant in the communications between the parties, and was the basis on which
Mr Clancy sought to obtain mortgage finance from
a third party.  Correspondence
between solicitors about the drafts does not include debate about this figure.
Nor does it appear
that it was debated or discussed or challenged at the
conference attended by Mr Clancy and his accountant, and by solicitors for
both
parties, on 24 November 1995.  Mr Clancy's dealings over many months with
solicitors representing a proposed intended first
mortgagee proceeded on the
basis that $2,337,111 was to be the purchase price.
<P>

93  	The central reasoning supporting the price was that the contract
price was structured in a way which effectively deferred Mr
Forsyth's benefit
and gave Rosefarms the benefit of a low occupancy fee until Rosefarms purchased
Yarrawah, with a countervailing
increase over what would have been the value of
Yarrawah in a present sale for ready money.  It would be difficult to justify
any
of the prices referred to in the documents in terms of the value of
Yarrawah in its limited state of improvement in October 1992;
for $2,327,111
this justification would be quite impossible.  The justification of the price
is not that it is objectively a fair
value on any set of assumptions, but that
it is the price that Mr Forsyth stipulated and in the knowledge of which Mr
Clancy acted
and to all outward appearance and in fact agreed to.  The price is
one element in a congeries of advantages and disadvantages which
the contract
brought with it, and the clear fact that it is higher than market value at the
outset has to be taken with the advantages
of there being no deposit, deferral
of payment, occupation for relatively small current payments, the income that
could be earnt,
the Headingly loan, the prospects of future ownership and Mr
Clancy's perception of the suitability of the property for what he planned
to
do.  It is for the parties and not for the Court to say whether $2,327,111 as
an element in all this is the appropriate price:
they have said in effect that
it was.  Mr Clancy's viewpoint on the fairness of the price now after he has
had the advantages and
occupation and the elapse of time is not the same as the
viewpoint he had in 1995.
<P>

94  	<b><u>Unconscionable Contract</u></b>.  It was contended that
the Contract of March 1995 if in effect should be set aside as an
unconscionable contract.  The case in support
of this was to the effect that Mr
Clancy had been overborne by Mr Forsyth.  Mr Forsyth no doubt had considerable
advantages in subjects
related to his talents as Queen's Counsel.  It is a
completely wrong view of the relationship between the two men and of Mr
Clancy's
abilities to think that Mr Clancy was or could be in any way overborne
in entering into the transactions or continuing from 1992
to 1997 to carry on
his activities of improvements.  In his own field of rural business Mr Clancy
is a talented and successful person.
 He has no ability for paper work but in
his evidence before me he showed that he has a good and clear command of spoken
language,
and a ready grasp of commercial considerations.  He had professional
advice available to him independently of Mr Forsyth, and he
consulted his
professional advisers as he wished; his solicitors and his accountant, who were
entirely independent of Mr Forsyth.
 When the events opened Mr Clancy had an
accountant in Hay who attended to his accounts, and was mainly oriented to
keeping records.
Mr Clancy consulted Mr Lea a chartered accountant and had his
advice from March 1995 onwards.  From April 1994 he consulted Messrs
Greaves
Wannan &amp; Williams solicitors.  He had ready access to his solicitors and
was in a position to refer documents to them
for consideration and advice and
did so when he thought he should. It is clear that Mr Clancy did not place
himself in Mr Forsyth's
hands.
<P>

95  	Mr Clancy contended that he felt pressured into signing the
document of 13 December 1994, which he referred to as guidelines
and as an
agreement in principle.  The pressure which he felt was "<i>the pressure not to
fail in Neil's eyes</i>" and he felt that by not signing the agreement that
would have constituted a failure - "... <i>if he thought I could accomplish
something, which he obviously must have done to come up with these things then,
yes, it would have
been a failure not to sign it and a failure not to be able
to do it</i>."
<P>

96  	Mr Clancy said in evidence that he had been prepared to commit
himself to a binding arrangement to purchase the property being
"<i>a binding
arrangement that was suitable and fair."</i>  He accepted that he did sign
Document 16 which expressly conferred a power of rescission if he did not pay
the Headingly loan by
30 June 1997.   He said "<i>I felt under a fair bit of
pressure to sign the document</i>".  In my view however he was not in fact
under any influence of Mr Forsyth which could reasonably be thought of as
pressure.  
<P>

97  	Mr Forsyth's legal skills gave him considerable advantages in
some respects over Mr Clancy.  His legal skills were not well
deployed in his
dealings with Mr Clancy.  Mr Clancy for his part had abilities in rural life
and the world of practicalities which
gave him some advantages over Mr Forsyth.
Mr Clancy is a person of considerable talent and ability and adept at business.
For some
years he has conducted an earthmoving business and all affairs related
to operations on Yarrawah, and also related operations on
several other
properties, complex affairs involving dealings amounting to millions of
dollars.  This has involved him in detailed
and elaborate transactions with
neighbouring owners over occupation, sharefarming and water rights.  In some
ways he had advantages
over Mr Forsyth in understanding rural life, capacity to
carry out engineering works, knowledge of the personalities and talents
involved and presence at or near the site, whereas the main scene of Mr
Forsyth's activities was in Melbourne and from 1994 onwards
he was suffering
from terminal illness.  I do not accept that the terms of the agreement were
unconscionable or unfair in any way.
 The price agreed upon was high but it was
reached in the course of several negotiations and re-negotiations in which Mr
Clancy was
in a position to weigh the relevant considerations and the
advantages and decide whether they should be set off against the price.
 The
advantages were considerable as they brought him the opportunity over some
years and for small payments to occupy the property,
improve it according to
his own requirements and work it, earning revenue in millions  while making
payments which were to a marked
degree concessional, and deferring any large
payments on account of the price.  I do not accept that the contract was
unconscionable
or that it ought to be set aside.  Suggestions that in some way
Mr Forsyth overbore Mr Clancy into entering into the Contract dated
March 1995
are in my view groundless.  
<P>

98  	<b><u>Sharefarming.</u></b>  Paragraph 13 of Rosefarms' Amended
Defence relies on the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990</a> and is in these terms:
<P>

<i>"13.	In further answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim so far as it
concerns Rosefarms, Rosefarms says that if the Notice dated
23 December 1997
would otherwise have been valid and legally effective:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	as at that date, `Yarrawah' was being used for the purpose of growing
three crops (in rotation) on a share-farming basis;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	as at that date, the second of those crops was to be harvested in 1998
and the third was to be harvested in 1999;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the Notice did not provide for notice of at least a period ending at
least one month after the end of the current annual cropping
program;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	by sub-section 19(4) and 27(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990</a>,
the Notice was invalid and of no legal effect."</i>
<P>

99  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19</a> of the Agricultural Tenancies 1990 is in these
terms:
<P>

<i>19.(1)	A tenancy for a fixed term with no provision for holding over
terminates at the end of the fixed term without the necessity
for any
notice.</i>
<P>

<i>    (2)	A periodic tenancy (other than a tenancy from year to year) cannot
be terminated unless written notice of termination is served
by a party on the
other party so as to give notice at least equivalent to the length of the
term.</i>
<P>

<i>    (3)	A tenancy from year to year cannot be terminated unless written
notice of termination is served by a party on the other party
so as to give not
less than 6 months' notice.</i>
<P>

<i>    (4)	In addition to the requirements of subsections (2) and (3), a
tenancy cannot be terminated unless written notice of termination
is served by
a party on the other party so as to give notice of at least:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	in the case of a sharefarming arrangement for crop growing -</i>
<P>

<i>		a period of 1 month, ending at least 1 month after the end of </i>
<P>

<i>		the current annual cropping program; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	in any other case - a period of 1 month.</i>
<P>

<i>    (5)	This section does not apply to termination for a breach of the
tenancy or where the parties have otherwise agreed on the notice
to be
given."</i>
<P>

100  	Provision for termination in cl.2.4 of the Licence did not
provide for termination by notice of any period.  
<P>

101  	"Tenancy" is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> in these terms:
<P>

<i>"'tenancy' means a lease or licence, an agreement for a lease or licence, a
tenancy at will or a sharefarming arrangement or any other
arrangement by which
a person who is not the owner of the farm has a right to occupy or use
it;"</i>
<P>

102  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 27</a> avoids provisions for contracting out of the
operation of the Act.
<P>

103  	Defendants' counsel contended that the defendants' licence to
occupy arose out of the series of events beginning in October
1992 in which the
defendants in fact occupied Yarrawah and carried on development and farming
activities and paid outgoings, supported
by the invitations, representations
and encouragement of the owner.  It was further contended that this licence was
a sharefarming
arrangement because, it was said, a sharefarming arrangement is
one pursuant to which sharefarming takes place.  The sharefarming
to which
counsel referred was not any sharefarming as between Salienta and Mr Forsyth
and the defendants.  Counsel relied on the
fact that to the knowledge of Mr
Forsyth the defendants sharefarmed with other persons.  These arrangements are
described by Mr Clancy
in his affidavit of 8 October 1998 para.62, to the
effect that Rosefarms then had a sharefarming arrangement with the Violi
Brothers
relating to part of Yarrawah; the Violi Brothers hired machinery to
Rosefarms which was used primarily for undertaking development
on Yarrawah and
in return they were permitted to grow crops on the land at their own expense
and for their own benefit, under a cycle
of planting and cropping three
different products which was to run until the last harvest about May 1999.  In
Mr Clancy's affidavit
of 31 March 1999 para.5(b) he narrated that he had told
Mr Forsyth in 1993 about an arrangement with Sally and Kyle Smith to jointly
grow rice for the 1993, 1994 season under the name Riverina Rice Company.  The
Smiths operated as Third Sargasso Pty Ltd.  A letter
from Mr Forsyth to Mr
Clancy of 15 July 1996, Document 28 also shows that Mr Forsyth was aware and
agreed that Rosefarms would allow
others to farm on Yarrawah.
<P>

104  	In my opinion the contemplation, acceptance and permission of
Salienta and Mr Forsyth that Rosefarms would allow others to
farm on Yarrawah
and would do so under various arrangements for sharing expenses and proceeds
does not characterise the Licence granted
by Salienta to Rosefarms as a
sharefarming arrangement within the meaning of para.19(4)(a).  Salienta was not
involved in any arrangement
for sharing in any sense, either expense or
proceeds, and no money amounts payable to Salienta were related to the outcome
of farming.
 In the ordinary and natural meaning of words referring to
sharefarming, a sharefarming arrangement is an arrangement between those
who
participate in the sharefarming; an arrangement under which land is made
available to a person who then participates in sharefarming
with someone else
is not a sharefarming arrangement.  
<P>

105  	Although para.13 of the Defence does not in terms allege that
there was a sharefarming arrangement  the allegations which
are made (in
subpara (a) "On a sharefarming basis" and subpara.(c) "At least one month after
the end of the current annual cropping
program") show that it is alleged that
there was a sharefarming arrangement and show that the provision relied on is
para.19(4)(a).
 Evidence shows clearly that an annual cropping program was
current on 23 December 1997 when the first notice of termination was
given.
<P>

106  	The operation of para.19(4)(a) to extend a tenancy until after
the end of a current annual cropping program applies only in
relation to a
sharefarming arrangement, which is one of several kinds of arrangements and
agreements which fall within the definition
of "tenancy".  "Sharefarming" and
"Sharefarming arrangement" are not defined expressions and it appears from the
terms of the definition
of `tenancy', and also from the general meaning of
those words that an arrangement is not a sharefarming arrangement simply
because
a person who is not the owner of a farm has a right to occupy or use
it.  
<P>

107  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990</a> does not alter the nature
of the rights conferred by arrangements between the parties; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19</a> alters the
time and manner of termination of the tenancy, but does not alter the nature of
the rights which exist pending termination.
 A lease remains a lease and a
contractual licence remains a contractual licence, and a contractual licence
does not confer a right
of exclusive possession, a defence to a claim for
possession or any right to possession except by reference to any claim the
licensee
may make for an injunction to restrain breach of the contractual
licence.  The defendants contend that the Licence did not have effect,
so it is
inconsistent with their position that they should ever be entitled to enforce
it specifically by injunction.  If some arrangement
between the parties did
have effect to confer a licence to which subs.19(4) applied the extension to
one month after the end of the
annual cropping program current in December 1997
has long since expired.  It probably expired before the Summons was issued on
10
June 1998.  It clearly expired before the Amended Statement of Claim of 26
October 1998 in which Salienta first claimed possession
of Yarrawah, and
certainly expired before their claim was made again in the Further Amended
Statement of Claim dated 7 June 1999.
 By making those claims Salienta clearly
terminated any then existing and unterminated licence.  In my opinion the
question whether
subs.19(4) ever had any operation is now academic.  
<P>

108  	Salienta's counsel contended that observations in the judgment
of the Full Court of the Supreme Court in <b>Dudgeon v Chie</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=55%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">55 SR (NSW) 450</a>
set out in the report of the decision of the High Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1955/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2092%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 92 CLR 342</a> at
347 and approved at 352, which dealt with entitlements as regulated by the
Agricultural Holdings Act 1941, are applicable to tenancies
as affected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990</a>, particularly the observation "The
Agricultural Holdings Act 1941 was not designed to affect the status of a
share-farmer, as such,
or to confer upon him an estate in possession as against
the owner, unless such a right could be spelled out of the agreement itself."
In my opinion s.19 where applicable to a tenancy as defined has the same effect
as the legislation considered in <b>Dudgeon v. Chie:</b> the term of the deemed
tenancy is affected by limiting the manner of its termination, but the nature
of the rights conferred by the
parties' agreement is not affected.  If the
deemed tenancy does not according to its terms confer an exclusive right of
possession
or any right which will protect the tenant from ejectment, s.19 has
no impact on the deemed tenant's protection from ejectment. 
The basis of this
view is that neither in s.19 nor elsewhere in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act
1990</a> is there any provision protecting a deemed tenant's occupation in any way
other than by providing for periods of notice as stated
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19.</a>
<P>

109  	In my opinion the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990</a> does not
afford any protection to the defendants' occupation.  The provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ata1990233/" class="autolink_findacts">Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990</a> relating to notice of termination do not
apply having regard to provisions of subs.(5).  If that were not so the notice
given was
for longer than one month and complied with para 19(4)(b).  The
pleaded defence relates only to subpara 19(4)(a) and has not been
made out.
<P>

110  	<b><u>Termination of the Licence.</u></b>  Notice of
Termination of Contract dated 23 December 1997 directed by Salienta and Mr
Forsyth's executors to Mr Clancy and Rosefarms
stated that it terminated the
Contract dated March 1995, and the grounds recited were defaults in payments of
principal and interest
under the Contract and the denial of the letter of 25
August 1997 Document 60 that the Contract was binding on Mr Clancy.  In my
finding these grounds were well based, there were further grounds and
circumstances from which repudiation of the Contract by Mr
Clancy was clear, it
was open to Salienta and the executors to accept that repudiation and terminate
the Contract, and that notice
was effective.  The Licence was terminated on 23
December 1997 having regard to sub-paragraphs 2.4(a)(ii) and (iii) of the
Licence.
 I find that the Contract dated March 1995 was repudiated by Mr Clancy
and Rosefarms in August and September 1997 and that the Notice
of Termination
operated to accept the repudiation and terminate the Contract.
<P>

111  	The Notice of Termination conferred permission on Mr Clancy,
Rosefarms and any sub-licensees to enter upon the land until
30 June 1998 for
the purpose of the rights specified in cl.2.4(b).  Subject to this permission
the Notice of Termination was effective
to bring the licence to an end.
<P>

112  	In my opinion Salienta is entitled to recover damages for mesne
profits against Mr Clancy and Rosefarms in respect of the
period commencing 26
October 1998, when the claim for possession was first made in the Statement of
Claim.
<P>

113  	The claim against Mr Clancy personally for damages under the
Contract dated March 1995 was not pressed (t229).  The improvements
effected by
the defendants even after 23 December 1997 will make proof of actual loss and
the assessment of quantum quite difficult.
<P>

114  	ORDERS
<P>

Upon the Further Amended Statement of Claim:-
<P>

1.	Give judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the property known as
Yarrawah being approximately 12,000 acres of land in
Certificates of Title
Volume 14803 Folio 20, Identifiers 9/756766 and 13/756766.
<P>

2.	Reserve further consideration of leave to issue a Writ of Possession.
<P>

3.	Order that Caveat 5646342 P be withdrawn within seven days.
<P>

4.	Give judgment for the plaintiff against the defendants for damages for mesne
profits for the period from 26 October 1998 until
recovery of possession.
<P>

5.	Order that it be referred to a Master to inquire, ascertain and certify the
amount of the plaintiff's damages and further order
that judgment be entered as
of today for the amount so certified.
<P>

6.	Order that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

Upon the Amended Cross-claim:-
<P>

7.	Give judgment for the Cross-defendants with costs.
