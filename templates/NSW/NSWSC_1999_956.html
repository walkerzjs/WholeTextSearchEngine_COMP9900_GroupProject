<P>

<b>				s 76E SCA)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 11 May 1999 the
defendants seek that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 13</a> r 5 of the
<b>Supreme Court Rules (SCR)</b> or alternatively that the proceedings be
stayed until the final determination of proceedings No 40214/99 in the Court of
Appeal from
the decision of Young J on 5 March 1999 equity proceedings No
2151/97.  By notice of motion filed 16 April 1999 the plaintiff seeks
that
interim damages be granted pursuant to s 76E of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>
(SCA)</b>.  The plaintiff relied on his affidavits sworn 14 April 1999, his DCM
document and a schedule of damages.  The defendant relied on
the affidavit of
Helen Allison sworn 11 May 1999.
<P>

2  	It is convenient now to set out the rule and law relating to
summary judgment.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> r 5 provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to
the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for
relief in the
proceedings -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious;</b>
<P>

<b>	or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or
in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings."</b>
<P>

3  	It is necessary to approach every application for summary
judgment with care.  Such a peremptory termination of an action denies
a
litigant the opportunity of having a trial of the claim on the merits.
Nevertheless, if a close and even prolonged scrutiny of
the facts, proved or
undisputed, and of the applicable law, demonstrates that there is, for example,
a complete legal answer to the
action, summary judgment is a useful facility.
It should then be readily applied, in order to save the needless delay, anxiety
and
expense of fruitless litigation.
<P>

4  	The test to be applied on summary judgment has been variously
expressed;  as "so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly
succeed";
"manifestly groundless";  "so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of
argument";  "discloses a case which the court
is satisfied cannot succeed";
"under no possibility can there be a good cause of action";  "be manifest that
to allow them" [the
pleadings] "to stand would involve useless expense";  see
the High Court decision in <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner
for Railways (NSW)</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> at 129.
<P>

5  	Previously the plaintiff had filed a summons in equity
proceedings No 2151/97.  The plaintiff originally commenced these proceedings
by way of summons in which he made numerous wide ranging allegations.  On 5
June 1997 Master Macready granted the plaintiff leave
to make an application to
file a statement of claim upon condition that such an application be
accompanied by the form of statement
of claim which the plaintiff wished to
have leave of the court to file.  
<P>

6  	On 3 April 1998 Master McLaughlin made an order that any
application by the plaintiff for leave to file a statement of claim
against the
defendants who remained parties to the proceedings be filed on or before 29 May
1998.  Master McLaughlin dismissed the
proceedings against all the defendants
other than the Minister for Police, the Commissioner of Police, the Department
of Corrective
Services, the Minister for Health, and the Director General of
Health.
<P>

7  	The learned Master also held that that he was satisfied that no
reasonable cause of action had been disclosed against the other
defendants or
in relation to the other allegations made in the statement of claim.  He
permitted the allegations asserted against
the police and against the
Department of Corrective Services in respect to the incident in January 1993
referred to in paragraph
1.27 and in paragraph 1.37 of the proposed statement
of claim and the incident referred to in paragraph 1.29 (which makes
allegations
against the police in relation to an incident in October 1993) the
plaintiff the opportunity to litigate those alleged causes of
action.  
<P>

8  	Master McLaughlin also said that the proposed statement of claim
could not be allowed to stand.  It contravened the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> r 7(1)
of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>, which requires that a pleading shall
contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts,
but not the
evidence by which those facts are to be proved.  He said that it
also contravenes the provisions of Part 15 r 8, which requires that
a pleading
shall be as brief as the nature of the case admits.
<P>

9  	Master McLaughlin stated that if the plaintiff wished to pursue
his claim in respect to the above incidents where it alleged
that he was the
subject of wrongful arrest, malicious prosecution and false imprisonment, it
would be necessary for the plaintiff
to prepare a further pleading limited to
those alleged causes of action and for such fresh pleading to comply with the
Supreme Court
Rules relating to the form of pleadings by a party.  The
plaintiff appealed this decision.  On 5 March 1999 Young J dismissed the
appeal.  The plaintiff is currently seeking leave to appeal Young J's decision
in the Court of Appeal.
<P>

10  	I have reproduced paragraphs 1.27, 1.29 and 1.37 of the summons
which were the ones that were allowed to stand.  They are:
<P>

<b>"1.27	On 15 January 1993 Det. Geoffrey McNevin arrested the Plaintiff at his
home on charges of using telephone to menace Lesley Newling
of Westmead
Coroner's Court.  The plaintiff was wrongfully detained in the cell at the
Penrith Police Station and then at Parramatta
Prison.  The Plaintiff was
investigated during his detention.  The Plaintiff was wrongfully charged,
wrongfully detained, investigated
and then the charges were withdrawn."</b>
<P>

11  	This is known as the first detention.
<P>

<b>"1.29	On the 11 February 1994 Det. Inspector Z Feszczuk wrongfully arrested
the Plaintiff on criminal charges of threat to Ken Bradstock,
who is one of the
principal person responsible for killing Plaintiff's Wife.  The Plaintiff was
arrested at his home on criminal
charges, then detained in the Mental
Institution at the Nepean Hospital for a five months period without any
clinical evidence of
mental illness of the Plaintiff. The Police Service did
not investigate the allegations made by the Plaintiff and therefore, allowed
a
carriage of justice before the Protective Division (matterr (sic) 52/94) and
before the NSW Court of Appeal (matter 40277/94) on
the basis of facts yet to
be investigated by the Police.  To this end the plaintiff was represented by
his solicitor Mr. Harry Freedman
of Milne Berry and Berger and contested on the
same facts by the NSW Health Department."</b>
<P>

12  	This is known as the second detention.
<P>

<b>"1.37	In January 1993 the Plaintiff was wrongfully imprisoned at the
Parramatta, he was investigated, and was subjected to threats
of personal
injury.  Existence of a similar plan was communicated to the Plaintiff by a
person named Mr. Michael Asisi when the Plaintiff
met Mr Asisi at the Complaint
Unit of the Health Department.  While in the prison the Plaintiff was
investigated by Mr Dan Bergin,
the prison psychologist and his woman companuion
(sic).  The plaintiff was threatened and vilified."</b>
<P>

13  	The plaintiff in the summons pleaded a third detention namely
that on 21 December 1996 Senior Constable Andrew McKellar initiated
malicious
prosecution of the plaintiff, wrongfully arrested him and detained him by false
imprisonment.  A fourth detention was also
pleaded namely that on 5 October
1997 four officers employed by the New South Wales Police Service initiated
malicious prosecution
of the plaintiff and also the Health Department detained
him between 5 October 1997 and 9 October 1997  by falsely imprisoning him
in
the mental institution at the Nepean Hospital at Penrith owned by the Health
Department.  Master McLaughlin had held that these
were not reasonable causes
of action.  The third and fourth detentions are repleaded in the current
proceedings.
<P>

14  	In relation to these 3 paragraphs which were allowed to stand
Young J stated that when one looked at them, and took into account
the
additional material which was before the court, namely (a) that the plaintiff
was taken before a Magistrate and bail was refused;
 and (b) that in the mental
health matter orders were made under s 27 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Act</a></b> 1990,
it seemed to him that those counts must fall with all the rest.
<P>

15  	He also said that generally speaking, the plaintiff had set out
what were the facts that concerned him, but he did not in his
draft statement
of claim show that those facts, if established, would lead to liability on
behalf of the defendant.  Young J said
that two years had now passed since the
proceedings were commenced and that had been adequate for the plaintiff to
formulate his
case, especially as even in December 1998, there was an
invitation to the plaintiff to reformulate, if he wished to.  It seemed 
Young
J that the learned Master was right in striking out those claims.
<P>

16  	Thus the first three detentions have already been dismissed the
plaintiff lost the opportunity to replead the fourth detention
and additional
claims for false imprisonment, wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution by
virtue of the judgment of Young J of 5
March 1999.  On this basis paragraphs 1
to 48 of the current statement of claim should be dismissed.
<P>

17  	That leaves two additional detentions which have been pleaded in
the present statement of claim.  These alleged detentions
occurred after the
statement of claim that Young J considered was filed.  The fifth detention
allegedly occurred on 18 October 1997
and is pleaded at paragraphs 49 to 54 and
the sixth detention allegedly occurred on 27 July 1998 and is pleaded at
paragraphs 55
to 62 of the statement of claim. The fifth detention allegedly
occurred when two officers employed by the New South Wales Police
put the
plaintiff under unlawful arrest and unlawfully detained the plaintiff for about
two hours at Penrith Police Station and interrogated
him for the purpose of
investigating him.  The sixth detention occurred allegedly when two officers
employed by the New South Wales
Police Service accompanied by two officers
employed by the New South Wales Health Department at Penrith initiated
malicious prosecution
of the plaintiff and detained him from 27 July 1998 until
6 August 1998 by false imprisonment in the mental institution at Nepean
Hospital Penrith owned by the New South Wales Health Department.  According to
the plaintiff both detentions give claims for wrongful
arrest, malicious
prosecution and false imprisonment.  The sixth detention like the first
detention would appear to have been made
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health
Act</a></b> 1990 and applying the same reasoning as Young J did in the first
detention, the sixth detention count must fail.
<P>

18  	The claim for malicious prosecution in relation to the fifth
detention must also fail as the plaintiff was not prosecuted.
 On his own
pleading the plaintiff was not charged and was allowed to leave.  That leaves
the claims for wrongful arrest and false
imprisonment.  On his own pleading, he
voluntarily attended the Penrith Police Station.  He alleges that a constable
said to him
"you are under arrest" but did not provide any details.  He was not
charged with any offence and allowed to leave two hours later.
 This sequence
of events would seem to be most improbable and contradictory so as to consider
it hopeless.  Accordingly I dismiss
the balance of the statement of claim.
<P>

19  	Most of the pleading in the current statement of claim has been
the subject of three prior decisions of this court and ultimately
they were
dismissed.  Inadequacies of the plaintiff's pleadings have been highlighted to
him on prior occasions such that I do not
see any utility in allowing the
plaintiff to replead the statement of claim.  I dismiss the statement of claim
as it is an abuse
of the process of the court and discloses no reasonable cause
of action.
<P>

20  	In relation to the plaintiff's motion seeking an interim payment
under s 76E, <b>SCA</b> he had helpfully provided a schedule of damages.  He
claims the sum of $155.4 million damages but regrettably this is out of date
and needs to be updated.  He is seeking a modest 33% of the total amount
claimed to enable him to get on with the rest of his life.
<P>

21  	Section 76E of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> provides:
<P>

<b>"Court may order interim payments</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	In any proceedings for the recovery of damages, the Court may, in
accordance with this section, order a defendant in the proceedings
to make one
or more payments to the plaintiff of part of the damages sought to be recovered
in the proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	The Court may make such an order against a defendant on the application
of the plaintiff at any stage of the proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Court may make such an order if:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the defendant has admitted liability; or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the plaintiff has obtained judgment against the defendant for damages to
be assessed; or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the Court is satisfied that, if the action proceeded to trial, the
plaintiff would obtain judgment for substantial damages against
the
defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	The Court may not make such an order if the defendant satisfies the
Court that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the defendant is not insured in respect of the risk giving rise to the
plaintiff's claim for the recovery of damages; and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the defendant is not a public authority; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the defendant would, having regard to the defendant's means and
resources, suffer undue hardship if such a payment were to be
made.</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	The Court may order a defendant to make one or more payments of such
amounts as it thinks just but not exceeding a reasonable
proportion of the
damages which in the opinion of the Court are likely to be recovered by the
plaintiff.</b>
<P>

<b>(6)	In estimating those damages, the Court is to take into account any
relevant contributory negligence or any cross-claims on which
the defendant may
be entitled to rely."</b>
<P>

22  	Liability has not been admitted nor has the plaintiff obtained
judgment against the defendants for damages to be assessed.
 It is my view that
the plaintiff has a weak case and if it proceeded to trial, the plaintiff would
not obtain judgment for substantial
damages against the defendants.  Therefore
I decline to make an order under s 76E.  The plaintiff's motion is dismissed.
The plaintiff
has been unsuccessful.  Costs should follow the event.  The
plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs of both motions and of the
proceedings.
<P>

23  	The orders that I make are:
<P>

(1)	The statement of claim filed 16 April 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff's notice of motion filed 16 April 1999 be dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of the motions and of the
proceedings.
