<P>

<b>    <u>LAND RIGHTS ACT 1983  &amp;  Anor</u></b>
<P>

<center><b><u>HEADNOTE</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

The plaintiff, the daughter of an Aboriginal woman and a father of Irish
descent, was born out of wedlock in 1942.  The plaintiff
following her birth
was placed on her mother's application under the control of the Aborigines
Welfare Board, a Board constituted
under s 4(1) the  <b><u>Aborigines
Protection Act 1909-1943</u></b>.  The plaintiff was placed under the Board's
control pursuant to s 7(2) of the Act.  She remained under its control until
she turned
18.  In accordance with its practice, for the benefit of the child,
the plaintiff was placed by the Board with the United Aborigines
Mission at its
Aborigines Children's Home at Bomaderry for the purposes of providing for her
custody, maintenance, upbringing and
care.  At the age of four and a half
years, the plaintiff, whilst still a ward, was transferred in 1947 to the
Lutanda Children's
Home at Wentworth Falls, a home conducted by members of the
Plymouth Brethren faith.  There she was brought up, cared for and maintained,
as a ward of the Board, between 1947 and 1960.
<P>

In 1993 the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendants claiming
that she had developed a Borderline Personality Disorder
(and substance abuse
disorder) as the result of her childhood experiences.  She further claimed that
as a child she was denied bonding
and attachment, had been a victim of maternal
deprivation and further suffered a disorder of attachment.
<P>

The plaintiff alleged that her psychiatric injury was due to the default of the
defendants.  The plaintiff claimed damages for negligence,
breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of statutory duty and for trespass.  The plaintiff sought to
recover very substantial damages for
her misfortunes, upbringing and her
disturbed and unhappy life, as well as for her claimed psychiatric injury,
harm, mental and emotional
problems and difficulties.  She also sought to
recover exemplary and aggravatory damages.
<P>

<b><u>Held</u></b>
<P>

1.	There was no duty of care, breach of duty or relevant causation established.
The plaintiff's action in negligence failed;
<P>

2.	No trespass was established.  No private action for breach of statutory duty
was available;
<P>

3.	Assuming a fiduciary relationship (not decided) there was no breach of
fiduciary duty.  In any event had a fiduciary duty or
breach of fiduciary duty
been established there would have been a basis for denying equitable
compensation by reason of laches, prejudice
or delay;
<P>

4.	Any assessment of damages or equitable compensation was highly speculative,
however, a "contingent" assessment of damages was
appropriate in the
circumstances;
<P>

5.	There was no entitlement to exemplary or aggravatory damages in any
contingent assessment.

<P>

					    <b><u>LAND RIGHTS ACT, 1983  &amp;  Anor</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		The plaintiff, Joy Williams by her
tutor, by her Further Amended Statement of Claim sues the Minister responsible
for the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a></u></b>  ("the first defendant")
and the State of New South Wales ("the second defendant").  She claims damages
from them.  Further or alternatively,
she claims equitable compensation.
<P>

2   	A tutor was appointed shortly before the trial on 12 April
1999.  The plaintiff in March had been admitted to hospital with
a clinical
diagnosis of psychosis and there is no dispute that the plaintiff is and has
been unable to give oral evidence at the
trial.
<P>

3   	The first defendant is sued upon the basis, by statute,
that the Minister is the legal entity against whom claims made against
the
Aborigines Welfare Board ("AWB" or "Board") must be brought.  The Board was
constituted under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a> of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909-1943</u></b>
("the Act").  The second defendant, it is said, is liable to be sued pursuant
to s 5 of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Act 1988</a></u></b>  and is said to be
vicariously liable for the acts of the first defendant and the Board.
<P>

4   	The defendants (appearing by the same counsel) have
submitted that the second defendant is not personally liable because the
express provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Act 1988</a></u></b>
exclude claims or demands against a statutory corporation representing the
Crown and that the first defendant is such a statutory
corporation representing
the Crown:  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a></u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s50.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 50.</a>  It also
submitted that the second defendant is not vicariously liable for the acts of
the first defendant and the AWB.  In his written
submissions in reply counsel
for the plaintiff stated he did "not take issue with the submissions of the
defendants in this regard".
 It is appropriate to here record also that the
case pleaded is a case against the AWB, and that no action is pleaded or
alleged
against the State of New South Wales in respect of any "activity" or
breach or breaches of any duty involving the former Child Welfare
Department of
the Government of New South Wales.
<P>

5   	Before turning to the pleadings its is important from
inception to make clear that the case does not concern so called "Stolen
Generation" issues.  The plaintiff was not a member of the "Stolen Generation"
as that expression is used: cf  <b><u>Cubillo  v  The Commonwealth of
Australia</u></b>   <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1999/518.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) FCA 518</a> (30 April 1999).  So much will appear from
the reasons herein.
<P>

<b>The Pleadings</b>
<P>

6   	It is convenient to summarise the allegations made in the
Further Amended Statement of Claim.  That document is some nineteen
(19) pages
in length and contains numerous allegations of negligence and breach of
duty.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff alleges she was born on 13 September 1942 and
that her mother was an Aboriginal.  It is alleged that the AWB
assumed the role
of guardian and placed itself in loco parentis viz-a-viz the plaintiff
"<b><u>by taking</u></b> the plaintiff from her natural mother and assuming
custody of her.  It is claimed that the AWB owed the plaintiff a duty of care
including to supervise her upbringing; to monitor at regular intervals the care
she was receiving; to interview the plaintiff regularly
for purposes of
assessing her well being; to investigate or inquire into allegations of
maltreatment; to acquaint the plaintiff from
time to time with details of her
mother's whereabouts; to take reasonable care to safeguard her mental and
physical well-being.
<P>

8   	Shortly after the plaintiff's birth the plaintiff alleges
that in the exercise of its powers under the Act (and particularly
s 11B
thereof), the AWB placed the plaintiff in the custody of the United Aborigines
Mission (UAM) which placed the plaintiff in
its Aboriginal Children's Home at
Bomaderry (NSW).
<P>

9   	The plaintiff alleges that by "removing the plaintiff from
her mother" the AWB breached its duty of care by failing to facilitate
the bond
between the mother and the plaintiff; removed the plaintiff in circumstances
where the Board was not in a position to provide
an adequate substitute for the
plaintiff's mother in the form of a caring adult who would be likely to "form a
reciprocal attachment
for the plaintiff and thereby ensure or promote her
healthy psychological development"; failed to take precautions for the
psychological
well-being of the plaintiff and exposed her to a risk of
psychological harm.  It is also alleged that the AWB failed to take adequate
steps to permit the plaintiff to remain with her mother.
<P>

10   	It is also said that by placing the plaintiff at Bomaderry
the AWB knew or ought to have known Bomaderry was an institution
in which the
plaintiff would have no or inadequate opportunity to form an attachment with a
caring adult which was necessary for
her psychological well-being; that the
plaintiff would inevitably suffer from "maternal deprivation" which would
require treatment
and change of circumstances to reverse; and that Bomaderry
was overcrowded so that formation of close emotional attachment between
the
plaintiff and a caring adult was unlikely to occur.
<P>

11   	It is alleged that by requiring the plaintiff to remain at
Bomaderry until the age of four years there were further breaches
of duty in
failing to provide a proper environment whereby the plaintiff could form a
close emotional attachment to "one caring adult";
failing to acquaint itself
with the then state of knowledge as to the hazards to a child of the
plaintiff's age of institutional
life; and failing to restructure the
institution to increase the likelihood of the plaintiff forming a close
emotional attachment
with at least one caring adult.
<P>

12   	In April 1947 the plaintiff (then four and a half years
old) was transferred to another home, "Lutanda" at Wentworth Falls
by the AWB,
which was allegedly done pursuant to s 11B of the Act or otherwise.  (In her
case I might add the plaintiff accepts that
the transfer to Lutanda was not the
subject of any allegation of negligence or lack of good faith).  It is alleged
that the AWB thereafter
breached its duty in a number of respects.  These
include failing to inquire whether if the plaintiff resided at Lutanda, she
would
have contact with members of her family and members of the Aboriginal
race; that the plaintiff would be properly looked after, and
not be subjected
to vilification, physical or mental cruelty or sexual abuse; failure to inquire
whether the plaintiff would have
the opportunity to form a reciprocal close
emotional attachment with a caring adult; that the plaintiff's psychological
well being
would be safely guarded by appropriate care in the form of
attachment and inquire that Lutanda was sufficiently cognisant of psychological
learning of the day to permit damage to the plaintiff by her removal from her
mother to be identified and treated.
<P>

13   	Alternatively, it is alleged that the Board, when it
caused or permitted the plaintiff to be placed in the institution at
Lutanda,
knew or ought to have known of a number of matters including that Lutanda was a
place likely to prejudice her psychological
well-being because of the absence
of any adequate opportunity for the plaintiff to form a close reciprocal
attachment with a caring
adult who would look after her; that Lutanda did not
operate according to the known state of psychological learning of the day and
was not in a position to recognise aspects of the plaintiff's behaviour as
childhood antecedents of an "attention-seeking disorder"
which if not treated
was likely to develop into a psychiatric disorder by the time the plaintiff
reached late adolescence or adulthood.
<P>

14   	It is alleged that at Lutanda the combination of the
plaintiff's relatively fair complexion and her Aboriginality carried
with it
certain risks including that she would not be informed of her Aboriginality;
that at some stage her Aboriginality would be
revealed to her by Lutanda staff;
that there was a chance of her not being placed in a foster home; that she
would be treated differently
because of her Aboriginality; and that she was
likely to deny her Aboriginality.  In consequence of the above matters it is
said
that the plaintiff was likely to be deprived of the opportunity of forming
close relationships with others and with aboriginals and
more particularly with
at least one caring adult who would "care for the plaintiff individually and
promote the development of attachment
and assist in the reversal of harm
suffered by her removal from her mother at birth and institutionalisation at
Bomaderry".
<P>

15   	By reason of the matters so claimed it is alleged that
there was a serious risk that the plaintiff:
<P>

"(i)	would develop a disorder in the development of attachment (if she had not
already done so at Bomaderry; or
<P>

(ii)	be subjected to aggravation of a disorder in the development of
attachment, which had its onset at Bomaderry which if not adequately
 treated
or reversed would render her susceptible to a serious personality disorder in
adult life".
<P>

16   	It is alleged the AWB caused or permitted the plaintiff to
remain at Lutanda until 1960.  The following further breaches of
duty were
particularised in paragraph 11 of the further amended Statement of Claim in
respect of the plaintiff's time at Lutanda:
<P>

"(a)	failed to supervise the plaintiff's upbringing adequately or at all;
<P>

(b)	failed to monitor at regular intervals or at all the care which the
plaintiff was receiving at Lutanda; [in the written submissions
(p 81) the
plaintiff argued that for the AWB to have discharged its duty of care it would
have visited the plaintiff at regular intervals
"at least once a year and more
frequently in earlier years"].
<P>

(c)	failed to inquire as to, or investigate, any allegations of maltreatment of
the plaintiff;
<P>

(d)	failed to interview the plaintiff at any time for the purpose of assessing
her well-being or for any other purpose;
<P>

(e)	failed to provide any supervision which was sufficient to detect the
vilification, physical and emotional maltreatment, the
physical and mental
cruelty and the sexual abuse to which the plaintiff was subjected whilst at
Lutanda;
<P>

(f)	failed to remove the plaintiff from Lutanda;
<P>

(g)	took no steps, or insufficient steps, to ensure that persons having the
care of the plaintiff were not guilty of conduct which
was proscribed by the
Act;
<P>

(h)	failed to acquaint the plaintiff's mother with details of the plaintiff's
whereabouts notwithstanding a specific request contained
in a letter from the
plaintiff's mother to the Board dated 10 December 1956;
<P>

(i)	failed to acquaint the plaintiff with details of her mother's
whereabouts;
<P>

(j)	failed to ensure that the plaintiff's circumstances were reasonably
adequate for her health, physical and mental well-being,
maintenance, education
and advancement in life; and 
<P>

(k)	breached each of the statutory duties which it owed to the plaintiff which
are particularised in paragraph 13(a)-(c) below."
<P>

17   	At the trial the plaintiff alleged that there was a
failure to take the plaintiff to a Child Guidance Clinic during her stay
at
Lutanda and that had such been done her childhood attachment disorder problem
would have been reversed and addressed.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant owed a
statutory duty under s 7(1)(c) of the Act to provide for her custody
and
maintenance and under s 7(1)(e) to exercise general supervision and care over
all matters affecting her interests and welfare
and to protect her against
injustice, imposition and fraud.  It is alleged that these statutory provisions
were each breached.
<P>

19   	The particulars in support of the common law counts are
also relied upon as constituting allegations of breaches of the statutory
duty.
In addition, it is also asserted that the AWB failed to protect the plaintiff
from injustice by placing her at Bomaderry and
Lutanda in institutions which
the AWB knew or ought to have known were inimical to her psychological well
being because they were
not conducive to the development of a close emotional
attachment between the plaintiff and a caring adult and in removing the
plaintiff
from her mother when it had no legal justification to do so.
Further, it is alleged there was a breach of statutory duty including
placing
her in institutions where in the case of Bomaderry psychological harm was
likely to result but be undetected, and in the
case of Lutanda physical abuse
including sexual abuse was likely to be inflicted and unlikely to be detected
by the AWB.
<P>

20   	Further the AWB was alleged to have been in breach of duty
by failing to visit the plaintiff or make inquiries about her whilst
she was at
Lutanda which visits or inquiry would have revealed that the plaintiff was
subjected to vilification, physical and mental
cruelty and sexual abuse.
<P>

21   	Next the plaintiff relied upon a cause of action in
trespass (wrongful or false imprisonment) based upon a claim of being
taken
from her mother in September 1942 until her discharge from Lutanda in 1960.
<P>

22   	The plaintiff has also made a claim for equitable
compensation for alleged breach of fiduciary duty in a number of respects.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff claims damages, exemplary damages,
aggravated damages and equitable compensation.
<P>

24   	I now turn to the defendants' defence.  By its Further
Amended Defence they denied negligence (including a denial of any duty
of care,
breach or causation).  They denied trespass.  They denied that an action for
breach of statutory duty arose.  They denied
the existence of any fiduciary
duty or breach thereof.  Further or alternatively, in respect of the claim for
breach of fiduciary
duty they raised further "defence(s)" of laches and
prejudice.  These defences were pleaded to an action for breach of fiduciary
duty but were not (and could not be pleaded) in respect of the common law
causes of action.
<P>

<b>The Nature of the Case</b>
<P>

25   	As will be seen from the above, the case does not involve
what might perhaps be described as a specific single identifiable
act or
omission occurring at a particular time and constituting, inter alia,
negligence.  No specific incident, happening or event
in the history from 1942
to 1960 is relied upon as giving rise to the plaintiff's claimed psychiatric or
psychological conditions.
 Nor is there any identifiable single casual act of
negligence alleged.  The conduct (essentially "omission" conduct) relied upon
to constitute negligence is said to have generally been of an ongoing nature
throughout the period referred to.
<P>

26   	The plaintiff's primary case (and which, for reasons which
will appear, I accept) is that the plaintiff was admitted to the
control of the
AWB on the mother's application in accordance with s 7(2) of the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909</u></b>  (the Act) as amended.  As will
appear from this judgment I have found that the plaintiff's mother for reasons
no doubt valid to
herself, applied to the Board to take control of her child
between the time of her birth on 13 September 1942 and the child's transfer
to
the United Aboriginal Mission Children's Home at Bomaderry, New South Wales on
13 October 1942.  My finding is that the AWB considered
the mother's
application to give up control of the plaintiff to its control, and having done
so, admitted the child to its control.
 I find that there was not any removal
by the Board to the plaintiff, in the sense of taking the child against the
will of the mother.
 The plaintiff was taken into the AWB's control because the
mother did not want the child, could not keep the child and asked the
AWB to
take control of her: see s 7(2).
<P>

27   	The primary submission made by Mr Hutley SC for the
plaintiff, was that there was no unlawful removal and detention or taking
of
the plaintiff at any time and that there was no factual removal of the
plaintiff in the sense of her having been "stolen".  If
there was a removal, or
taking it was pursuant to the mother's request for the Board to do so.  She
applied or asked the Board to
take control of the plaintiff and the Board
acceded to her application.  It is right and proper that any misconceptions, or
potential
misconceptions about the nature of the plaintiff's case should be
removed early in my reasons for judgment.  The following passages
appear in the

"<b>HIS HONOUR:	</b>	Mr Hutley, I want to know whether at the end of the day
you will be suggesting that this child is somehow or other to be described
emotively or otherwise as being a stolen generation child.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>		Your Honour will not hear me use that terminology at all
because I don't think it is of assistance in a case of this variety.  What
we
say is, and this seems to be the law, it's my learned friend that had the child
under its control from its birth, or shortly after
its birth, it's for them to
prove it was legal".
<P>

28   	The following exchange later took place between the
plaintiff's junior counsel and myself:
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		It is correct to say that [Mr Hutley] does not maintain
that this particular plaintiff, to use the expression, is a member of the
stolen generation, whatever that expression might mean:  Is that correct?
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>	Quite, your Honour.  The plaintiff's primary case is that the
plaintiff's mother made an application to the Board under s 7(2).
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		It would be inconsistent.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:	</b>Quite.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Because the plaintiff's case is that her mother surrendered
control of the child to the Board.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>	Yes, pursuant to an application.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		And in fact made an application under s 7(2) and if indeed
she surrendered the child to the Board, or asked the Board to take control
of
the child, then that is her application.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>	Quite, your Honour that is the plaintiff's primary case.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:	</b>	And in fact it is done at her behest.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>	At the plaintiff's mother's request, quite, your Honour.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Am I also correct in saying that the plaintiff's case is
not that the Board in any way sought to remove the child, but that the
mother
requested the Board to take control of the child, for reasons best known to the
mother?
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>	Yes, that's right and it appears that that occurred on or about
12 October 1942."
<P>

29   	Although, as will be seen the plaintiff in her Further
Amended Statement of Claim has spoken in terms of the AWB taking the
plaintiff
from her natural mother, that claim must be understood to involve a taking at
the mother's request and not in the sense
of the plaintiff being "stolen".
Further, for example, the history given by the plaintiff to Dr Twomey (13 April
1999) that soon
after her first child's birth, that that child was taken from
her ("the third of the stolen generation") is equally not correct,
despite its
assertion in the history to him.
<P>

30   	I find as my reasons shall make clear that the plaintiff
following her birth then became a ward of the AWB within the meaning
of s 3 of
the Act and thereafter until the age of 18 the plaintiff remained a ward of the
AWB and under its control.  I further find
as a fact that the plaintiff's
mother at no time between 1942 and 1960 made application to the AWB or,
otherwise sought to have the
plaintiff released from the AWB's control, or
sought her restoration to her care within the meaning of s 11D(1)(h) of the
Act, nor
was any discharge of the plaintiff sought at any time pursuant to s
11D(1)(i) of the Act.  The reasons for such will appear later.
<P>

31   	It is appropriate if I immediately record here that a
number of conclusions of fact urged by the defendants (written submissions
111)
were conceded to be appropriate by the plaintiff (written submissions in Reply
at 51).
<P>

32   	Firstly it was accepted that the plaintiff's placement at
Bomaderry and/or control or custody by the AWB was lawful, being
with the
consent of and at request of her mother.  Second, the plaintiff's "legal
guardian" was at all times her mother.  Third,
the transfer to Lutanda was with
the consent of the mother.  Fourth, transfer was in accordance with the Board's
statutory duty.
 Fifth, transfer was for the purpose of giving the plaintiff a
better chance in life at Bomaderry.  It is appropriate if I also record
the
plaintiff made no allegations that her transfer to Lutanda was improper or
negligent.  I make the above findings.
<P>

<b>Borderline Personality Disorder  and  Attachment Disorder</b>
<P>

33   	It is appropriate if I here mention several other matters.
The plaintiff in her Further Amended Statement of Claim has made
reference to a
disorder in the development of attachment and to her suffering from a
Borderline Personality Disorder (and an associated
substance abuse disorder as
well).  It is perhaps convenient if I deal with these suggested disorders.
They will be dealt with again
in a more extensive way in the judgment.
<P>

34   	In his report of October 1991 Dr Waters said (at p 8) that
Borderline Personality Disorder:
<P>

"... appears to be due to a fundamental failure in parenting.  Typically adults
who develop borderline personality disorder have
sustained psychological abuse
often, but not necessarily, associated with physical and sexual abuse and
neglect.  The typical pattern
of parenting recalled is of rejection,
terrorising, neglect, ignoring (etc), most of which are reported by Ms
Williams.  These patterns
fundamentally distort a person's capacity to have
relationships and to have a stable personality, and often also lead to
substance
abuse and self destructive behaviour.  In addition such individuals
are ill-equipped to parent and very often provide just the type
of parenting to
their children which Ms Williams has provided for her two older children
....
<P>

In my view Ms Williams' bond of attachment to a primary caretaker living in a
congruent cultural setting was never established".
<P>

35   	Further, he said that Borderline Personality Disorder was
a disorder of attachment usually happening when a child is young,
around three
to four years.  He said that Borderline Personality Disorder was rarely
constitutional.  It could not be technically
diagnosed before the age of 18 in
its proper form, but its antecedents were usually evident in adolescence and
even in early childhood.
<P>

36   	In the  <b>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders Fourth Edition</b>  ("DSM-IVTM) (1994)  published by the American
Psychiatric Association (tendered by the plaintiff although an earlier version
was
referred to by Dr Waters in his report) there is a discussion of Borderline
Personality Disorder.  It is appropriate to say that
DSM-IVTM (the first
edition was published in 1952) is a text that classifies diagnoses and
categories of mental disorders and is
used by psychiatrists in this country.
The DSM appears to divide mental disorders into categories, and relevantly into
types of personality
disorders based on criteria with certain defining
features.  Both parties referred to, and relied upon DSM-IVTM in the
presentation
of their cases. The DSM  on foot as at 1952 to 1968 was not
referred to or relied upon nor were portions of it tendered in the plaintiff's
case.  In  DSM-IVTM the matter of Borderline Personality Disorder is discussed
at 650.  Underneath the heading  <b>"Borderline Personality Disorder"</b>  and
the sub-heading  <b>"Diagnostic Features"</b>  the following appears:
<P>

"The essential feature of Borderline Personality Disorder is a pervasive
pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships,
self image and affects,
and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a
variety of contexts".
<P>

37   	The diagnostic criteria are said to be nine in number with
diagnosis based upon the presence of five or more of such criteria.
 The
impairment from the disorder is said to be greatest in the young adult years
and gradually wanes with advancing age.  In their
thirties and forties the
majority of individuals with the disorder attain greater stability in their
relationships and vocational
functioning.  It is stated that physical and
sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss or separation
are more
common in the childhood histories of those with Borderline Personality
Disorder.
<P>

38   	The text discusses the matter of differential diagnosis.
Similar but alternate diagnoses to Borderline Personality Disorder
(BPD)
are:
<P>

1.	Histrionic Personality Disorder.
<P>

2.	Schizotypal Personality Disorder
<P>

3.	Paranoid Personality Disorder
<P>

4.	Narcissistic Personality Disorder
<P>

5.	Antisocial Personality Disorder
<P>

6.	Dependent Personality Disorder
<P>

39   	BPD must be further distinguished from:
<P>

Personality change due to a General Medical Condition
<P>

Symptoms that may develop in association with chronic substance use.
<P>

40   	Borderline Personality Disorder may be confused with a
number of other personality disorders.  This is usually because these
other
disorders share some common characteristic features particularly noting this in
relation to Anti-Social Personality Disorder.
I do not understand that a
particular diagnosis necessarily  implies a specific level of impairment or
disability on the part of
a sufferer or that particular behaviour and actions
on any particular occasion ought necessarily to be attributed to that disorder.
The circumstances surrounding such individual behaviour, or control on any
instant occasion still needs to be examined.  Additional
factual information is
required including as to functional activities at the relevant time.  Nor does
diagnosis carry any implications
as to its necessary aetiology.
<P>

41   	The DSM-IVTM  states that Borderline Personality Disorder
is diagnosed predominantly (about 75%) in females.  The pattern
of behaviour
has been seen in many different settings around the world.  Under the heading
<b>"Prevalence"</b>  the following passage appears (at 652):
<P>

"The preponderance of Borderline Personality Disorder is estimated to be about
2% of the general population, about 10% among individuals
seen in out-patient
mental-health clinics and about 20% among psychiatric in-patients.  It ranges
from 30% to 60% among clinical
populations with Personality Disorders."
<P>

42   	It is not suggested that the Australian experience would
be statistically different to that in the United States.
<P>

43   	The importance of this passage is that institutional care
is not identified as the one relevant factor in the 2% of the general
population figure.  The percentage does not distinguish between those who
suffer from it, having been brought upon in a parent's
home, adopted parent's
home, foster parent's or in an institution or home (State or charitable or
religious).  Second, despite the
learning on the matter in 1950's the disorder
has not been eliminated perhaps suggesting it cannot be, or, that the risk of
suffering
from it, cannot be removed.  Third, the fact that it cannot be
removed or eliminated gives rise to important questions in relation
to duty and
breach, and whether negligence can be found, or should be.  Fourth, as DSM-IVTM
makes clear, Borderline Personality Disorder
is about five times more common
among first degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the
general population.
 Fifth, as Dr Waters admitted, the Kenmore Hospital records
reveal that the plaintiff's mother had a very long history of alcoholism
(for
most of her life was a user of alcohol) and (T 118-119) and was an alcoholic.
Against such background, according to Dr Waters,
had the plaintiff remained
with her mother when the mother was an alcoholic at the time the plaintiff was
young, the plaintiff could
in any event have developed the Borderline
Personality Disorder he "diagnosed".  The important point is that the alleged
diagnosis
is not one <i>dependant</i> on a child being brought up in an
institution.
<P>

44   	As to the category Borderline Personality Disorder, there
is the view of Dr Ellard that it is a spectrum, having taken years
to achieve
its "present status".  He said it did not have that status in the "1940's,
1950's or even the 1960's".  Dr Ellard also
made clear that not everyone
subjected to a disadvantages early environment would develop a Borderline
Personality Disorder.  I would
add that DSM-IVTM does not in terms point in
terms to the need for an antecedent condition of disorder of attachment as a
condition
for its occurrence.  According to Dr Ellard some persons without
early deprivation will become borderline with many "borderlines"
having no
history of early deprivation.
<P>

45   	The plaintiff alleges that she also suffered from the
childhood antecedents of personality disorder (also termed "attachment
disorder") which were reversible and Borderline Personality Disorder.  The
plaintiff particularly relies upon an expert, Dr Katz,
to show that there was a
connection between lack of attachment and personality disorders.  The lack of
bond of attachment (with the
mother) was said to be known to be a very common
condition of people who develop personality disorder.  Indeed, it is part of
the
plaintiff's case.  The plaintiff alleges that by early adolescence if not
before, she was solitary, bitter, sulking, resentful, negative
and sad and that
had the AWB been told of these matters they would have sent the plaintiff to a
Child Guidance Clinic for assessment
and treatment.  They allege that the
plaintiff's disorder would have been reversible had she been given timely
treatment by a child
psychiatrist (who generally worked in one of the few
clinics) or other child mental health professionals.  In support of her case
both Dr Katz (retired child psychiatrist) and another expert, Mrs Bull, (a
retired social worker) gave evidence.  Their evidence
is that the reversal of
attachment disorder would be facilitated if there is a loving person with whom
the unattached child can form
a close attachment.
<P>

46   	In his evidence Dr Water said that although the plaintiff
no longer met the diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality
Disorder, she
continues to abuse substances.  She claims that the Borderline Personality
Disorder and associated substance abuse
has compromised her life in all
respects including an ability to form relationships and to look after herself.
Indeed, her claim
is that the abuse of substances was a consequence of the
Borderline Personality Disorder, and that many of her current problems are
due
to substance abuse.  Dr Waters considered that the plaintiff was a recovered
alcoholic.  He accepted her mother had been an alcoholic.
 When asked whether
alcoholism was not in part hereditary, he replied (123) that it was a
controversial subject, but that there was,
in a fairly complex way, an
inherited component to alcoholism.
<P>

47   	Dr Waters accepted that there was a distinction between
Borderline Personality Disorder and psychosis (a biological condition),
that
the plaintiff as at the time of hearing had a psychosis, and that it was
possible that the plaintiff even possibly had a genetic
predisposition to
psychosis.
<P>

48   	The matter of "the human phenomenon attachment" (or
bonding) and attachment disorder has been raised as an important issue
in this
case.  It is a matter concerned very much with mother-infant interaction.  This
is a matter that has been explored in the
area of emotional research and
development of children.  It is a matter arising in the field of human emotions
in human relationships.
 The quality of the bond ("the attachment process")
between infant and care giver is, so it is claimed, instrumental in the
development
of personality and provides the foundation for healthy
psychological functioning.
<P>

49   	Dr Katz spoke of the need for the development of close
emotional relationships with a caring adult.  He said that such would
probably
have been sufficient to prevent childhood antecedents of disorder in the
development of attachment from developing into
a Borderline Personality
Disorder.  He said that attention seeking disorder (from which she was
allegedly suffering in 1948) was
a disorder in the development of attachment.
It reflects the lack of availability of an appropriate person with whom the
child can
form an attachment.
<P>

50   	Dr Katz also said that because the plaintiff was
"deprived" of contact with her mother (usually the prime carer with whom
the
reciprocal bond is formed), she was, in the absence of a substitute mother, at
grave risk from the time of birth, of suffering
from a disorder in the
development of attachment.  The institutional environment at Bomaderry he said,
was likely to aggravate the
risk in so far as she was suffering from disorder
in development of attachment at some time between removal from mother and
arrival
at Lutanda and because there was no effective facilitation of the
formation of attachment at Bomaderry.
<P>

51   	The instant case raises issues of personal and
interpersonal relations concerning interpersonal experiences generally between
the infant and the mother - that is, interaction between the two.  It concerns
among other things the interactive creation of the
attachment bond of effective
communication between primary care giver and infant - an event central to human
emotional development.
 If a mother-infant interaction is successful it is
suggested that there is the foundation for a healthy personality structure and
healthy psychological functioning.  Dr Waters (October 1991) referred to the
plaintiff having been placed in an environment where
no primary bond of
attachment to a primary care giver was established and in an environment where
she did not have the opportunity
to form new stable, caring and developmentally
appropriate attachments.
<P>

<b>Dr Bowlby's Views in  1951-1952</b>
<P>

52   	In 1948 in response to concerns about the problems and
needs of homeless children in post-war Europe, an important project
looking at
the "mother-infant" bonding process, was commissioned by the World Health
Organisation.  Dr John Bowlby, a British Psychologist
was inter alia, asked to
undertake an assessment of mother and infant behaviour.  Dr Bowlby's work
(1951)  <b>Maternal Care and Mental Health  (</b>Geneva World Health
Organisation), and his development of what appears to have become known as the
attachment theory heavily impacted
upon research into mother-infant
interactions.  His report was tendered in the plaintiff's case, and is, inter
alia, relied upon.
<P>

53   	As I understand his views, if early interaction is
successful, critical foundation stones of personality structure are laid
down.
The mother helps the baby attach and learn to recognise emotions and their
vicissitudes.  Early infant experiences or lack
thereof may lead to insecure
attachment formation resulting in personality deficits later manifesting
themselves in different ways.
<P>

54   	The long term consequences of inadequate attachment it was
claimed may lead to or include personality disorder.  The plaintiff's
case is,
inter alia, built upon the views of Dr Bowlby in his 1951 report.
<P>

55   	In order that the plaintiff's allegations can be further
understood, (and indeed the issues in this case also) it is appropriate
if I
now quote somewhat extensively from Dr Bowlby's report.
<P>

56   	I quote in full from pages 11 and 12 of his report under
the heading <b>"Some Origins of Mental Ill-Health"</b>:
<P>

"Among the most significant developments in psychiatry during the past quarter
of a century has been the steady growth of evidence
that the quality of the
parental care which a child receives in his earliest years is of vital
importance for his future mental health.
 Such evidence came first from the
psycho-analytic treatment of adults and then from that of children.  It has
been greatly amplified
during the past decade by information gathered by
psychologists and psychiatrists working in child guidance and child care - two
fields affording unrivalled opportunities for first-hand observation both of
the developing child and of his milieu.
<P>

Largely as a result of this new knowledge, there is today a high level of
agreement among child-guidance workers in Europe and America
on certain central
concepts.  Their approach to cases, their investigations, their diagnostic
criteria, and their therapeutic aims
are the same.  Above all, the theory of
ethology on which their work is founded is the same.
<P>

The basic principles of this theory of the origins of mental health and mental
illness will be discussed more fully later.  <u>For the moment it is sufficient
to say that what is believed to be essential for mental health is that the
infant and young child
should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous
relationship with his mother (or permanent mother-substitute) in which both
find
satisfaction and enjoyment</u>.  [my emphasis].  Given this relationship,
the <u>emotions</u> of anxiety and guilt, which in excess characterise mental
ill-health, will develop in a moderate and organised way.  When this happens,
the child's characteristic and contradictory demands, on the one hand for
unlimited love from his parents and on the other for revenge
upon them when he
feels that they do not love him enough, will likewise remain of moderate
strength and become amenable to the control
of his gradually developing
personality.  It is this complex, rich, and rewarding relationship with the
mother in the early years,
varied in countless ways by relations with the
father and with siblings, that child psychiatrists and many others <u>now</u>
believe to underlie the development of character and of mental health.  [my
emphasis]
<P>

A state of affairs in which the child does not have this relationship is termed
`maternal deprivation'.  This is a general term
covering a number of different
situations.  <u>Thus, a child is deprived even though living at home if his
mother (or permanent mother-substitute) is unable to give him the loving
care
small children need.  Again, a child is deprived if for any reason he is
removed from his mother's care.  This deprivation will
be relatively mild if he
is then looked after by someone whom he has already learned to know and trust,
but may be considerable if
the foster-mother, even though loving, is a
stranger</u>.  All these arrangements, however, give the child some
<u>satisfaction and are therefore examples of partial deprivation.  They stand
in contrast to the almost complete deprivation which is
still not uncommon in
institutions, residential nurseries, and hospitals, where the child often has
no one person who cares for him
in a personal way and with whom he may feel
secure</u>.  [my emphasis].
<P>

The ill-effects of deprivation vary with its degree.  Partial deprivation
brings in its train acute anxiety, excessive need for
love, powerful feelings
of revenge, and arising from these last, guilt and depression.  These emotions
and drives are too great for
the immature means of control and organisation
available to the young child (immature physiologically as well as
psychologically).
 The consequent disturbance of psychic organisation then
leads to a variety of responses, often repetitive and cumulative, the end
products of which are symptoms of <u>neurosis</u> and instability of character.
Complete deprivation, with which we shall be dealing principally in this
report, has even more far
reaching effects on character development and may
entirely cripple the capacity to make relationships.
<P>

The evidence on which these views are based is largely clinical in origin.
Immensely valuable though this evidence is, it is unfortunately
neither
systematic nor statistically controlled, and so has frequently met with
scepticism from those <u>not</u> engaged in child psychiatry.
<P>

Investigators with a statistical bent have worked with the concept of the
`broken home' and a number of studies have demonstrated
a relation between
maladjustment and this situation.
<P>

But though these studies have been of value in amplifying and confirming
clinical evidence of the far-reaching importance of the
child's early
experience in his home, the concept of the broken home is scientifically
unsatisfactory and should be abandoned.  It
includes too many heterogeneous
conditions having very different psychological effects.
<P>

In place of the concept of the broken home we need to put the concept of the
<u>disturbed parent-child relationship which is frequently, but not
necessarily, associated with it</u>."  [my emphasis]
<P>

57   	What neither Dr Bowlby, nor the evidence in the case
addressed, is how one can quantify or measure or specify the required
scope or
content of maternal care required (in "advance" or "at all") in a particular
relationship between mother and child, and
which will avoid the risk of any
Borderline Personality Disorder or any personality disorder later developing.
Whilst laying down
views as to the need for "a warm intimate and continued
relationship" in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment, such is left
unspecified in terms of quantity, or quality.  It is difficult to see scope for
its enforcement or implementation in human relationships.
 How maternal
deprivation can be necessarily avoided, how maternal warmth and intimacy can be
enforced or compelled is not clear,
since a child may even be deprived if
living at home with a natural mother (or permanent mother substitute) who is
unable or unwilling
to give "the loving care small children need", or the child
is unable to find satisfaction or enjoyment in the intimate relationship.
<P>

58   	Before leaving Dr Bowlby's  WHO  report it is appropriate
if I refer to several other points made by him.
<P>

1.	Anxieties arising from an unsatisfactory relationship in early childhood
allegedly predispose children to respond in an anti-social
way to later
stresses (p 13).
<P>

2.	Dr Bowlby considered that it was not necessary to detail father-child
relationships in the report because and I quote "almost
all the evidence
concerns the child's relationship to his mother, which is without doubt in
ordinary circumstances by far his most
important relationship during these
years.  It is she who feeds and cleans him, keeps him warm and clean, and
comforts him.  It is
to his mother that he turns when in distress.  In the
young child's eyes the father plays second fiddle and his value increases only
as the child's vulnerability to deprivation decreases.  ...  While continued
reference will be made to the mother-child relation,
little will be said of the
father-child relation, his value as the economic and emotional support of the
mother will be assumed".
 (p 13)
<P>

59   	By way of aside even in a contemporary society (whose
views are not relevant to the determination of the issues), many ordinary
citizens (not experts in behavioural science) could well disagree with these
(Dr Bowlby) views.  It is not for me to comment upon
the current acceptability
of such views by mothers, fathers and society in Australia in 1999.
Nevertheless, Dr Bowlby's views are
relied upon (albeit expressed in a somewhat
general ill-defined way) by the plaintiff to support a case of negligence
against the
defendants for events long since passed, occurring in the
1950's.
<P>

3.	Dr Bowlby considered that deprivation of mother love in early childhood
could have far reaching effects on mental health and
personality development of
human beings.  Thus when deprived of maternal care the child's development is
almost always retarded -
physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially
and that symptoms of physical and mental health may appear: (pp 15-16).
<P>

4.	Dr Bowlby was insistent throughout this report that the right place for the
child "is his own home" (p 109).  Neither foster
home nor institutions can
provide children with the security and affection which they need.  For the
child they are always makeshift
(p 112).
<P>

5.	Dr Bowlby said group care of infants and young children must always be
unsatisfactory because of "the impossibility of providing
mothering of an
adequate and continuous kind but also because of the great difficulty of giving
a number of toddlers the opportunity
for active participation in the daily life
of the group which is of utmost importance for their social and intellectual
development"
(p 133).
<P>

60   	This view perhaps suggests the impracticability of
avoiding the situation in a case such as the present where group care was
in
effect in practical terms a no choice option and unavoidable.
<P>

6.	In his "conclusion" (at 157-158) Dr Bowlby referred to the lack of then
recognition that "mother love in infancy and childhood
was as important for
mental health as are vitamins and proteins for physical health".  He also
stated that the evidence in the report
was at many points faulty, "many gaps
remained unfilled and critical information often missing" (p 158).
<P>

<b>Damages Claim</b>
<P>

61   	The plaintiff claims that in consequence of the defendant
AWB's breaches of duty she suffered psychiatric damage, psychological
damage
and physical injuries.  These may be conveniently stated in terms of the
amended Statement of Particulars pursuant to Part
33 Rule 8A filed on the eve
of hearing on 14 April 1999.
<P>

62   	The injuries are summarised as being both physical and
psychological.  The physical injuries include a fracture of the right
wrist,
fracture of the collarbone (construed by the plaintiff to be deliberate),
lacerations, abrasions and contusions due to corporal
punishment being
inflicted; self mutilation in the form of self-inflicted cuts; forcible
confinement; and acts of sexual assault.
 The psychological injuries were
particularised:
<P>

"(a)	Maternal deprivation following removal from mother and failure to provide
substitute which initiated disorder in development
of attachment;
<P>

(b)	Institutionalisation which caused or exacerbated disorder in development of
attachment;
<P>

(c)	Disorder in the development of attachment which manifested itself through
childhood and adolescence in the form of attention-seeking
behaviour and acts
of self-mutilation;
<P>

(d)	Borderline personality disorder, characterised by each of the following:
<P>

(i)	frantic attempts to avoid real or imagined abandonment;
<P>

(ii)	a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships
characterised by alternating between extremes of idealisation
and
devaluation;
<P>

(iii)	identity disturbance; marked and persistently unstable self image or
sense of self;
<P>

(iv)	impulsivity in areas that are potentially self-damaging (sex and substance
abuse);
<P>

(v)	recurrent self-mutilating behaviour;
<P>

(vi)	affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood (eg. intense
episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety);
<P>

(vii)	chronic feelings of emptiness;
<P>

(viii)	inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (frequent
displays of temper, constant anger);
<P>

(ix)	transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative
symptoms;
<P>

(e)	concealment of the plaintiff's racial identity;
<P>

(f)	concealment of the plaintiff's antecedents and in particular concealment of
the identity of the plaintiff's mother and the fact
that she was still alive
and that at least from December 1956 wished to see the plaintiff."
<P>

63   	The plaintiff alleges continuing disabilities including
inability to form and maintain intimate relationships; inability to
fulfil a
parental role; compromised anger; poor self esteem characterised by feelings of
ugliness and unworthiness of affection and
attention of others; extreme guilt;
severe anxiety; identity disturbance; terror at being left alone; depression;
substance abuse;
inability to work; inability to engage in activities requiring
physical exercise due to physical deterioration consequent on substance
abuse
and anxiety which has manifested itself in arthritis, asthma, and emphysema;

abuse and stress; inability to partake in enjoyable activities.
<P>

64   	The plaintiff submits that whilst the Borderline
Personality Disorder could not have been diagnosed before the "age of 18",
nevertheless, the childhood manifestation of attachment disorder manifested
themselves before age five to six and were identifiable.
 The plaintiff's case
is that the Borderline Personality Disorder did not occur or was not
diagnosable until early adulthood (at
T 727).  Thus the claim for damages it is
submitted runs from an early age.  The conduct of the AWB it is said extends
over a period
between 1942 and 1960.  In terms of both liability and damages,
this case involves investigation of events that have occurred during
that
period starting over 50 years ago.
<P>

65   	These matters will be looked at in greater detail when
considering the matter of damages which it was agreed I should consider,
even
were I to find the defendants not liable.
<P>

66   	The claim that the plaintiff makes is a very large one.  I
make this observation because that clearly appears to be the situation.
 In her
submissions on damages the plaintiff has submitted that the total damages that
should be awarded in respect of the common
law counts should be in the order of
$1.7 million to $2.2 million.  This is apart from the claims for general
damages, interest and
for aggravated or exemplary damages.  The case for an
aggravated or exemplary award is put inter alia, upon the basis that the
plaintiff's
"life has been impoverished not by a casual act of negligence on
the part of an ephemeral tortfeasor but by a deplorable failure
by a statutory
body which held itself out as her guardian to have regard for her welfare for
well over a decade when she was utterly
unable to protect her interests".
Further, it is submitted that the Board's conduct became "so neglectful, so
dismissive of the plaintiff's
welfare and so contumelious as the years passed
and the plaintiff deteriorated that an award of aggravated or exemplary damages
is
warranted".  The plaintiff's claim for damages is novel in many respects as
will be seen when I turn to deal with it in detail, as
I said I would
irrespective of my decision on liability.
<P>

67   	Further, or alternatively, equitable compensation is
sought to be recovered for breach of fiduciary duty.  The plaintiff conceded
that there is no material difference between the content of the duty of common
law and the fiduciary duties owed by the AWB to the
plaintiff.  Further in her
reply, the plaintiff also has submitted that Equity would follow the law in
quantifying equitable compensation
by the same measures as are used in the
assessment of common law damages.  Next, there was no submission that the
appropriate time
for assessing damages was complicated by confusion or
inconsistency surrounding the distinction between common law damages and
equitable
damages or compensation; cf  <b><u>Ronnoc Finance  v  Spectrum
Network Systems</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20624" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 624</a> at 630-631.  Mr Hutley also
accepted that on the present state of the law, the better view was that, were
equitable compensation
to be awarded, there could not be included in any sum
for equitable compensation any amount for aggravated or exemplary damages.
That said he sought to reserve his position.  I consider that he is correct in
his view and his position is protected in the event
that this case goes on
appeal.
<P>

<b>History of Proceedings</b>
<P>

68   	The original action was commenced by statement of claim in
April 1993.  The plaintiff in 1993 also filed a notice of motion
seeking an
order under the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a></u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 60G(2))</a> to extend the
period within which she could bring proceedings against the first and second
defendants.  Studdert J in a judgment
dated 25 August 1993 refused the notice
of motion.  The Court of Appeal by majority (Kirby P and Priestley JA with
Powell JA dissenting),
allowed the appeal.  The Court of Appeal's decision is
reported in  <b><u>Williams  v  Minister, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act
1983</a></u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 497.</a>  I will hereafter refer to that decision as
<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>.
<P>

69   	Again as a matter of historical fact, it is appropriate to
mention that the statement of claim has been amended on two occasions
including
on the eve of the hearing.  There is now a count for breach of statutory duty.
Further the particulars of breach of duty
in her Further Amended Statement of
Claim are now more comprehensive and extensive than  originally pleaded.
<P>

70   	It has not been argued that at this trial I am bound by
any legal views contained in the Court of Appeal judgment in  <b><u>Williams
[No 1]</u></b>  As Kirby P (as he then was) said, the "many interesting and
difficult points in law are much better resolved when the law can be
applied to
the facts which Ms Williams ultimately proves at the trial".
<P>

71   	It is not unimportant to also mention that the only matter
being determined in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  was whether in effect the
action should go to trial.  As his Honour also observed (at 515):
<P>

"She (Ms Williams) should have her chance to prove her case.  She might
succeed.  She might fail.  It will then have been determined
as our system of
law provides to all Australians - Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal - according to
law, in open court and on its merits".
<P>

72   	I make no apology for the length of this judgment.  In
writing extensively I have done so deliberately.  I am conscious that
my
judgment will be read not merely by the parties, the judges and the legal
profession.  I am conscious of the fact that it is also
perhaps a social
document.  I am particularly conscious of the sensitive, indeed, controversial
nature of the issues and that there
are groups in the community that will be
interested in this judgment.
<P>

<b>The Trial</b>
<P>

73   	The plaintiff has been given every chance to prove her
case in court. The case lasted almost a month, commencing on 19 April
1999 and
concluding on 14 May 1999.  But, for the efficiency of counsel (in a case where
evidence was missing or not available),
and their co-operation, the trial would
have lasted much longer.  Indeed it may have been a trial of indefinite
duration.  So much
appears from the mode and manner of presentation of the case
and by the presentation of considerable oral and written materials.
 There has
been a high level of thorough preparation both in respect of the issue of
liability and damages.  There can be no doubt
that considerable human and
financial resources have gone into the preparation and trial of the action by
the parties.
<P>

74   	There are almost 1,000 pages of transcript.  Numerous
affidavits have been read in the proceedings.  Many witnesses both lay
and
expert have been called.  A vast amount of documentary evidence (many volumes)
has been tendered on many different issues.  There
are over 350 pages of
submissions.
<P>

75   	Having regard to the issues raised, their novelty and that
the present action is perceived to be some sort of "test case"
as well as the
fact that the matter is likely to go on appeal, whilst applying the laws of
evidence, I have sought not to be unduly
technical in respect of my rulings on
evidence.  This too accords with the approach adopted by both parties.
Further, the case concerns
matters arising from events occurring between 1942
and 1960 with "proof" of matters complicated by the natural effluxion of time.
The rules of evidence whilst they have been applied, such was done so with
tolerance and with some degree of permissible flexibility.
 It seems
appropriate in the circumstances that an appellate court should have the full
benefit of the evidence tendered and sought
to be tendered.  Both parties have
been given every opportunity to put before me available evidence.
<P>

76   	The trial of the instant action has been a difficult one.
There is the problem of having in the present time to address issues
in the
context of social, moral and cultural standards of a different Australia with
respect to events occurring so long ago in its
past history.
<P>

77   	In that context, it is appropriate for me to observe that
the language of this judgment reflects the language of the evidence.
 Both
parties accept that this must be so, even though, it is but stating the
obvious.  Thus Mr Hutley (T 23) accepted that at the
time the plaintiff was
born her mother was unmarried and that the plaintiff was accordingly
"illegitimate".  Additionally, there
are references to certain persons being
"fair-skinned", to people being "white in appearance" and to people being
"half-castes".
 That is an example of language, reflective of the times and to
be found in the evidence.  The point I make is that in writing this
judgment I
acknowledge that some of the language used would not be regarded as appropriate
in contemporary Australian society.  Next,
it is appropriate to remember that
the court does not give effect to its own moral standards or values in deciding
the case.  It
has no personal views of its own to carry out, or implement.  The
court executes the law, its personal views or notions are irrelevant
and are
not to be set above the law.  Indeed, as the judge my role is a strict legal
one, that is to decide the law, decide the facts,
apply the law to the facts
and give a true decision.
<P>

78   	Further on the issue of damages, in examining in close
detail the plaintiff's life and evidence in relation to it, I should
similarly
record that I am not involved in any moral judgment.  Such is totally
irrelevant to the issues.  The point to be made is
that the plaintiff has
brought the action, she claims damages including for her life's events and
misfortunes and how they have affected
her.  These issues have been raised by
her and hence need to be examined and scrutinised by the court as part of its
consideration
of her case.  As it is, the plaintiff who makes allegations, she
must prove them.  It is the plaintiff who has opened up for necessary
scrutiny
her life and all its various incidents.  They are to be therefore subjected to
examination and scrutiny.
<P>

79   	As has been said, the trial has been complicated by the
fact that one is dealing with events that occurred so long ago complicated
by
missing evidence (oral and documentary), and by the unavailability of some
clearly relevant witnesses who are deceased, or incapacitated,
or unable to
attend to give evidence.  It is appropriate to observe that long delays or even
prejudice associated with such provides
no defence to the causes of action
pleaded at common law.  That said, delay and prejudice flowing from such, and
laches are matters
relevant to whether equitable relief can or should be given
in the event that the plaintiff were to establish that a cause of action
for
breach of fiduciary duty was available, and breach has been established.  The
equitable "defences" of laches, prejudice and delay
may deny an entitlement of
equitable compensatory relief.  These matters do not defeat the common law
causes of action for negligence
or breach of statutory duty if established.
The courts have saved from the imposition of limitation provisions, complaints
of breach
of fiduciary duty:  see  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>;
<b><u>Maguire  v  Makaronis</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 449</a> at 463;  see also the
discussion by Justice Gummow writing extra judicially in  <b>"Compensation for
Breach of Fiduciary Duty"  in Youdans (ed) Equity Fiduciaries and Trusts
(1989)</b>  at 75.  A claim for breach of fiduciary duty may be subject to the
equitable doctrine of laches; cf  <b><u>Tito  v  Waddell (No 2)</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20Ch%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977]
Ch 106</a> at 250-251.
<P>

80   	Mr Hutley whilst accepting that in respect of the
fiduciary duty cause of action (if established), I could decline to give
equitable relief based on a defence of laches, submitted that no relevant
prejudice had been identified and that delay of itself
was insufficient to
establish a defence of laches (see T 782).  It will only be necessary to thus
address issues of laches, delay
and prejudice in respect of the cause of action
based on breach of fiduciary duty:  cf  <b><u>Orr  v  Ford</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20167%20CLR%20316" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 167
CLR 316</a>;  <b><u>Fitzgerald  v  Masters</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2095%20CLR%20420" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 95 CLR 420</a> at 433-434.
There has been substantial delay and its effect on any equitable cause of
action such as the present I regard as significant
and considerable.  The
equitable cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, will if available, be
decided on less evidence than
was available at the time that cause of action
arose:  see  <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority  v  Taylor</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541.</a>
<P>

81   	In my view whilst a plaintiff may be able to avoid
limitation problems at common law by alleging a breach of fiduciary duty
based
upon the same facts or circumstances relied upon to support common law counts,
he/she cannot avoid the "defence" of laches
or the consequences of delay (and
prejudice) being separately raised in respect of the equitable cause of action
for breach of fiduciary
duty.  Thus in my opinion where in a case such as the
present, and assuming that there be an equitable cause of action available
generally based on the same or similar facts, or particulars, relied upon to
support the common law counts, there is a strong case
for amending the
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></u></b>  so as to make it apply not only to the common law
counts but to the equitable cause of action as well.  I believe such would
address
what appears to be an anomaly.  Of course, were I to conclude as I have
for reasons to be given, that there is no cause of action
available for breach
of fiduciary duty then there would be no need for legislative change.  That
said, an appellate court might hold
a different view to that held by me.
<P>

82   	Next I wish to mention the matter of evidence.  I am
deeply conscious when weighing the evidence that witnesses have been
giving
evidence of events that occurred many decades ago.  In some cases the witnesses
were children or young persons at the time
the events they give evidence in
relation to occurred.  In other cases, the witnesses were mature adults.  Much
has occurred in their
lives since the 1950's.  They have been subjected to
life's experiences and education in the interim.  It has been said that human
evidence shares the frailty of those who give it.  It is subject to many cross
currents such as partiality prejudice, self interest
and above all imagination
and inaccuracies.  These are matters upon which the tribunal of fact helped by
cross-examination must do
their best:  <b><u>Toohey  v  Metropolitan Police
Commissioner</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20AC%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] AC 595</a> per Lord Pearce at 608-9.  I bear these
matters in mind in assessing and evaluating the witnesses and the evidence.
<P>

83   	This is a case where, as I have said, with the effluxion
of time there are not only missing or dead witnesses, but some of
the witnesses
have filed affidavits but have been unable to give evidence:  see eg Mrs Reid,
Mrs Talbot and Mr Sattler.  There was
no evidence from the plaintiff's mother
who the plaintiff met in 1973 and with whom she later lived.  There is evidence
that she
was alive and in hospital in 1989.  In making this observation I am
not drawing inferences adverse or otherwise.  I merely record
the situation as
one of fact.  In this I have been very much left to infer from the evidence,
the circumstances under which the plaintiff
came under the control of the AWB,
and even in some respects the circumstances relating to her transfer to
Lutanda, as well as in
respect of other matters.
<P>

84   	It is common ground that the records at Lutanda, after the
death of its former superintendent, have been destroyed.  There
are missing
records or a paucity of material from the Crown Street Women's Hospital (where
the plaintiff was born) and from the Aboriginal
Children's Home at Bomaderry
where the plaintiff lived from 1942 to 1947.  There are no records from Hornsby
Hospital or Hornsby
High School.  Dr Lovell (the GP for Lutanda when it was at
Pennant Hills after 1950) is deceased.  There are no records from him
in
respect of the plaintiff or otherwise.  The original application form for
admission of the plaintiff to Lutanda is missing.  According
to Mrs Middleton,
records kept by Mr Murray in relation to Lutanda no longer exist.
<P>

85   	The transcript (T 8) reveals that it was common ground
that the records of the AWB were not complete, or were lost.  Apparently
there
were no interrogatories administered to the Board, or at least none were
tendered.
<P>

86   	A matter to be also mentioned, particularly in respect of
the evidence of former children (but not necessarily confined to
them) is that
a person's recollection including recollection of events may be distorted over
time by various factors with a potential
for error increasing with delay: cf
<b><u>Longman  v  The Queen</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%2079" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 79</a> at 91, 108-109.
<P>

87   	A tribunal of fact also can bring its own common sense and
indeed experiences of life (subject to the principles relating
to judicial
notice) to bear on these issues.  The tribunal of fact is entitled to accept in
whole or in part a witness' evidence:
 <b><u>Naxakis  v  Western General
Hospital</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20782" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 782</a> per Kirby J at 793 applying  <b><u>Leotta
v  Public Transport Commission</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2050%20ALJR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 50 ALJR 666</a> at 669.  That is
part of its fact finding role.  I have regard to these matters as well in
relation to assessing the reliability
and credibility of witnesses, both those
called and uncalled (but whose affidavits have been read).
<P>

<b>Setting of events in the 1940's and 1950's and Contemporary Values</b>
<P>

88   	As I have said before, in 1942 when the plaintiff was
born, Australia was at war having been at war since 1939.  In the 1930's
it had
been in the grip of Depression, with all its hardships.  The White Australia
Policy was in place at the time.  There was in
the general community, a
prejudice towards the Aborigines, as referred to in the <b>1939 Public Service
Board Report</b>.  That Report recommended that the "problem" of Aborigines and
the community as recognised in the Australia Conference of 1937 was
to be
addressed by way of assimilation; see also inter alia the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
7(1)(a)</a> of the amending Act of 1940.  Thereafter, the stated policy of the AWB
was that of assimilation and more particularly so in respect
of part Aboriginal
children who were "white" in appearance.  Assimilation was not only a policy of
the Board, but as I have said,
there was a statutory duty in respect of that
approach that had to be implemented.  Irrespective of today's standards, it was
felt
in the 1940's that assimilation of Aborigines into the community was in
the best interests of the Aborigines.  This was the view
of the legislature and
of other political leaders of the era, presumably reflecting the values and
standards, of the time.
<P>

89   	In 1942, (and during the war years till 1945) the war
effort had the priority in terms of demands on labour and resources.
 The AWB
reports during the war years and post-war years reveal problems for the Board
arising from staff and resource shortage also
caused by the war.  The
priorities were not on the domestic front.  Many families had been broken up
because of the war.  Many fathers
were overseas in the military forces.  The
plaintiff's father was in fact said to have been a soldier (in the Sixth
Division) when
the plaintiff's mother became pregnant on New Year's Eve
1941.
<P>

90   	The following exchange appears (at T 208):
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		We are putting this in the context that this case concerns
not standards of the 1990s and 1990 perceptions.  This concerns standards
and
contemporary values and perceptions and the like in the 1940s and early 50s.
That will be remembered in this case.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>		We have never made a submission to the contrary.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		We have to be very careful we do not look at 50s and 40s
through the so-called enlightened or better educated or more knowledgable
views
of the 1990s.  That would be error; wouldn't it.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>		It would be.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Yes, it would be".
<P>

91   	The following further exchange later took place (at T
560-1):
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:		</b>I am concerned about the danger arising from a situation
that clearly must be thought about, that I do not look at yesterday through
today's eyes.  Today's moral standards and values and contemporary standards
and values are not constant, they shift and so in a
situation like this, where
acts and omissions are alleged between 1942 to 1960, the claims have to be put
into historical context,
the context being standards and values at the time and
not standards and values of contemporary Australia in the 1990's.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:		</b>At a theoretical level, we do not dissent from that.  One has
to attempt to do that and, with respect, we submit that there is and
can be a
tendency to believe that we were so much better than they were and that is
something which one ought, as equally, guard
against as saying they were so
much worse than we are, as I cannot tell because I do not know."
<P>

92   	Thus one is looking at the contemporary community
standards of the 1940's and 1950's and not the standards that exist today.
 The
subject of contemporary community standards was referred to by Brennan CJ in
<b><u>Kruger  v  Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20190%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 190 CLR 1</a> where his
Honour said (at 36-37):
<P>

"... it would be erroneous in point of law to hold that a step taken in
purported exercise of a discretionary power was taken unreasonably
and
therefore without authority if the unreasonableness appears only from a change
in community standards that has occurred since
the step was taken".
<P>

93   	See also Dawson J at 53-54; Toohey J at 97.  Gummow J in
<b><u>Kruger's</u></b>  case also commented on this question of "standards".
He said (at 158):
<P>

"The philosophy given expression in the specific provisions to which I have
referred now may appear entirely outmoded and unacceptable.
 Nevertheless, in
its time, the 1918 Ordinance expressed a response to what then for at least 80
years had been perceived, initially
by the Imperial Government, as the plight
of the indigenous inhabitants of Australia as a consequence of the expansion of
European
settlement and land occupation."
<P>

94   	In  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  Kirby P at 514 referred
to "the passage of time and changing perceptions of right and wrong conduct" as
presenting problems.  As
Powell JA said (at 520) "there will be the difficulty
...... in seeking to recreate for the benefit of the tribunal, some 50 years
after the event what was the atmosphere of .... at the times when the relevant
events are said to occur".
<P>

<b>Remedies under the Law</b>
<P>

95   	The next matter that I propose to accept views upon
perhaps touches upon community perceptions.  The courts "cannot provide
a
solvent for every social problem or a remedy for every social problem":
<b><u>Tucker  v  U.S. Department of Commerce</u></b>  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA7/1992/412.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] USCA7 412</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20958%20F%202d%201411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 958 F 2d 1411</a> at
1413 cited by Gaudron and McHugh JJ in  <b><u>Breen  v  Williams</u></b>
(1996) 186 CLR 71.  Their Honours further said (at 115):
<P>

"In a democratic society, changes in the law that cannot logically or
analogically be related to existing common law rules and principles
are the
province of the legislature.  From time to time it is necessary for the common
law courts to re-formulate existing legal
rules and principles to take account
of changing social conditions.  Less frequently, the courts may even reject the
continuing operation
of an established rule or principle.  But such steps can
be taken only when it can be seen that the "new" rule or principle that
has
been created has been derived logically or analogically from other legal
principles, rules and institutions."
<P>

96   	Nor in my view can it be said that all human relationships
problems, including those of nurture and nature can always be the
subject of
solution by law.  Matters concerning their emotions, their level and content,
happiness, and other natural relationships
are not readily susceptible of
resolution by the courts.  Nor does the law accept that when misfortune occurs
someone is necessarily
to blame, or that there is a legal responsibility in
someone to pay compensation or damages.
<P>

97   	Some of the restraints on the function of the Court have
been discussed by Mahoney JA in  <b><u>Breen  v  Williams</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35
NSWLR 522</a> at 557-558.  The function of the court is to apply the law, not to
legislate for the change of it.  It is the function of courts
to decide cases
coming before them according to law.  It is not the function of courts to
change the law by processes which are legislative
not judicial.  As was said in
<b><u>State Government Insurance Commission  v  Trigwell</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20142%20CLR%20617" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 142
CLR 617</a> by Mason J at 633:
<P>

"The court is neither a legislature nor a law reform agency.  Its
responsibility is to decide cases by applying the law to the facts
as
found."
<P>

98   	In some cases it is the responsibility of Parliament to
decide for example whether a common law rule should be replaced. 
Indeed,
sometimes the solution may be wholly a political one and one beyond the
jurisdiction of the court.
<P>

99   	In determining what is the meaning of "reasonable" in the
statement of the common law duty of care, perfection or the use
of increased
knowledge or experience embraced in hindsight after the event should form no
part of the components of what is reasonable
in all the circumstances.  That
matter must be judged in prospect and not in retrospect:  <b><u>Maloney  v  The
Commissioner for Railways (NSW)</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2052%20ALJR%20292" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 52 ALJR 292.</a>  In  <b><u>Quigley

581) when discussing an employer's duty of care observed "But what will satisfy
that duty at any particular time will
depend upon the circumstances prevailing
at that time".
<P>

100   	The common law cannot provide a remedy for all life's
accidents, which are the fault of no person.  The point is well made
in the
dissenting judgment of Fullaghar J in <b><u>Commissioner for Railways  v
Anderson</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20105%20CLR%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 105 CLR 42.</a>  His Honour when speaking of "accidents"
said as follows (at 58):
<P>

"I make one observation in conclusion.  The word "negligence" has tended of
recent years to lose all meaning.  It is interesting
to recall that Sir
Frederick Pollock foresaw that this very result might follow as an indirect and
unjustified consequence of the
decision of the House of Lords in <i>Donoghue v.
Stevenson (1)</i>.  That very learned lawyer, immediately after the publication
of the decision in that case, wrote a note upon it for the Law Quarterly
Review
(2).  That note has been reprinted in the last two editions of Pollock on
Torts.  Towards the end of it the writer issued
a warning against "untenable
exaggeration" of the rule laid down in the case, and added "We still have to
take notice that there
are such things as inevitable accidents which are
nobody's fault."
<P>

101   	Further or alternatively, even where there is error, not
every error is to be equated with negligent error giving rise to
an entitlement
to recover damages:  <b><u>Giannarelli  v  Wraith</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 543</a>;
<b><u>Public Trustee  v  The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>  (NSWCA 20
December 1995, unreported) per Mahoney JA at 29-30;  <b><u>Barrett  v  Enfield
London Borough Council</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20WLR%2079" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 WLR 79.</a>  If it were it otherwise,
public authorities, welfare authorities, indeed charitable bodies might even
restrict or qualify services
which they are or might be willing to provide:  cf
<b><u>Romeo  v  Conservation Commission (NT)</u></b>  (1998) 192 CLR 431  per
Brennan CJ (a case rather involving a traditional category of negligence, in
which individual responsibility
was also examined in some detail).  Even if
there was error and I do not find any in the circumstances of this case, it
would not
in any event amount to negligent error, for reasons that will
appear.
<P>

102   	At common law, no action lies for, in effect, "bad
parenting" or "bad upbringing", at least by natural parents:  <b><u>Hahn  v
Conley</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20126%20CLR%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 126 CLR 276</a>; see also  <b><u>Attorney-General  v  Prince
&amp; Gardner</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20NZLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 NZLR 262.</a>  Thus for example, had the plaintiff
stayed with her mother, and developed a disorder of the type alleged, it would
appear that the
plaintiff could not have sued her mother.
<P>

103   	To impose a legal duty on a substitute for a non
biological carer to provide maternal care of the type that a natural mother
could or might be expected to ordinarily provide, apart from issues of
practicability and realistic achievability, could involve
imposing a higher
duty of care on the substitute carer than that imposed on the natural mother.
Thus there is an issue of whether
in circumstances where a natural parent
(mother) cannot be sued, a third party carer who has taken responsibility for
bringing up
a child which the mother is unable or unwilling to do, or cannot
do, should be liable to be sued.  Next, it is difficult to see how
the law can
always be expected to provide the solution to a all problems arising from life
itself, from nature or nurture.
<P>

104   	The case also raises issues as to whether the obligations
urged are confined to situations where a child became a ward on
the application
of the mother under s 7(2) of the Act as opposed to a committal by a Children's
Court order, under s 13A of the Act
creating a "wardship".  Indeed, the
committal to a home (under s 11 of the Act) may be for a short specified
period.  A question
may arise as to whether there is an alleged duty to provide
a "mother substitute" only under s 7(2) but not under s 13A.  It would
perhaps
be surprising if different duties existed qua a neglected or uncontrollable
child under s 13A to those under s 7(2) of the
Act.  Next there are issues of
non-delegable duty urged in the instant case yet under s 11A(1) there is the
specific power to indenture
or place a ward in employment of an employer.
Again the AWB may place a ward in a home; board out a child under s 11(1) or
place
a ward in the care of a foster parent: see also s 11D and s 11E.
<P>

105   	Next, the case raises issues that may, as well, have
future impact in the area of parent/child relationships; foster parent/child
relationships; adoption situations and in respect of children who were or are
brought up in State, charitable, or denominational
institutions or homes
(voluntary and otherwise).  Indeed, the decision is one that concerns the
bringing up of all children, of parenting
generally, irrespective of the
child's race, sex, colour or creed.
<P>

106   	As to different standards of society at different times,
this may be illustrated by examples found in the evidence.  Mrs
Bull (a retired
social worker) was called by the plaintiff.  She was asked (at T 69-70) whether
referral of a child to a Child Guidance
Clinic in the 1950's (the matter of a
Child Guidance Clinic reference was in issue) was a matter of last resort for
schools, parents
or carers.  She said there was a lot of prejudice about
psychiatrists and about psychotherapy.  She thought on the whole that there
was
often a jeering attitude.  "You know, sort of oh, you've got something wrong
with your mind type of thing.  So there was prejudice
that might of operated to
stop some people from having a go if you know what I mean".  She accepted that
at the time some people
might have thought it might have done more harm than
good in rearing a child of pre-teenage years to take them to a clinic with
psychologists
and psychiatrists rather than trying to deal with the situation
in the circumstances in which they were living.  This passage of
itself suggest
that counselling had a role in the 1950's different to that in the 1990's.
<P>

107   	Mrs Buxton was called by the defendant.  She made a
similar point.  She gave evidence that in 1952 she was a qualified nurse
with
triple certificates in general, midwifery and infant welfare (care of babies
from birth to kindergarten age).  She was asked:
<P>

"Q.	Where you lectured upon the importance of the mother of child bond"?
<P>

A.	It was mostly difficult feeders and the care and feeding of the infant more
than the mothering bond.  That was not recognised
I don't think for some years
after that the very great importance of a mothering bond certainly not in my
training time.  Lectured
more in the health of the infant and feeding of the
infant.  The Truby King form of training.  We didn't have psychology lectures
or those sorts of things in our course".   (T 406-407).
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Admission to Wardship at Bomaderry</b>
<P>

108   	The plaintiff submits that the plaintiff's mother had
been a ward of the Board (251J) and was therefore either a full blooded
(the
probability) or a half-caste aborigine within the meaning of s 3 of the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act 1918</u></b>.  The defendants
accepts that document (252J) records the plaintiff's mother amongst the
"register of wards" of Aborigines Protection
Board.  Document (251M), an
internal letter 22 February 1939 from the Secretary of the Board to the Matron
of the Aboriginal Girl's
Home Cootamundra (a home run by the Aborigines
Protection Board) and seen and noted by Mrs T. English Inspector on 25 May
1939, records
advice that Miss Casey will arrive at Cootamundra on 24th instant
to "escort Dora Williams; CM, RO and BC to situations" which save
for one
person, were to be in Sydney and to see that arrangements were carried out.
Clothing was to be provided for the girls.  They
were to be medically examined
and a certificate to be obtained in relation to their present physical
condition.  The plaintiff's
mother would at that time then have been fifteen
years of age.  The handwritten words "Girls were discharged as per your
instruction
being administratively implemented or departure from the
Cootamundra home as per instruction.  I do not find to mean the plaintiff's
mother was discharged from the Board's supervision or control but rather from
Cootamundra.  Clearly the Board would not have intended,
to use the plaintiff's
expression, "let loose", the plaintiff's mother then a young woman at fifteen
from the control of the Board,
without her being placed in the hands of an
appropriate person or in a employment situation.  It does seem that such a
"situation"
had already been arranged in Sydney by the Board hence the
escort.
<P>

109   	The plaintiff's mother appears to have remained a ward of
the Board until the age of eighteen.  She was no longer a ward,
having attained
the age of eighteen, at the time of the plaintiff's birth: see s 3 of the Act
for definition of "child" and "ward".
<P>

110   	There is no precise information as to the mother's
situation between 1939 and 1942 (ie between the age of fifteen and eighteen).
However, I would infer that she worked in a "situation" type employment
probably as a "domestic servant".  The birth certificate
reveals the mother's
address as being at what appears to be a private residential address at North
Sydney.  This view is also reinforced
by a history to Dr Waters recorded in his
report of 22 October to which I will turn to shortly.
<P>

111   	The plaintiff was born on 13 September 1942 at the Crown
Street Women's Hospital to Dora Williams.  The plaintiff's mother
had been
admitted to the Hospital on the day of the plaintiff's birth.  She remained at
the hospital for 29 days and was discharged
on 12 October 1942.  The Hospital's
Admission Register, and other available hospital records reveal the plaintiff's
mother as being
aged eighteen and single.  There is no reference to the father
in that record.
<P>

112   	The birth certificate does not record any details of the
father.  The only evidence in relation to the plaintiff's father
is contained
in the history to Dr Waters (22 October 1991) which I accept so far as it
relates to her parentage.  It is as follows:
<P>

"Ms Joy Williams was the daughter of an Aboriginal woman.  Her mother was the
youngest of five girls.  At aged 7 (in 1931), Ms Williams'
mother was removed
from her family by the Aboriginal Protection Board and placed in Cootamundra
Girl's Home.  Ms Williams stated
that her mother had never been allowed to
speak her indigenous language and had been forced to speak English under the
threat of
having her mouth washed out with carbolic soda.  Both maternal
grandparents were Aboriginal from Cowra.  Ms Williams father, an Irishman
and a
soldier in the 6th Division, was the son in the household in which her mother
worked as a domestic servant.
<P>

The pregnancy with your client was the product of a sexual encounter at a New
Years Eve party at her father's house.  Her mother
had a hysterectomy which
left her sterile.  Joy was removed and her mother stayed on to work as a
domestic in private hospitals.
 Joy's mother apparently never told anyone of
Joy's birth.  She was also unaware of the hysterectomy and was not informed of
this
until later when she found out that she was infertile".
<P>

113   	The mother and father never married.  The child was
illegitimate within the law.  The plaintiff never met her father or his
family.
<P>

114   	Several points may be made by way of confirmation of this
parentage history.  The birth was about nine months after a New
Year's Eve
party.  The War was on, and there was a Sixth Division.  It is probable that
the "situation" earlier referred to was a
"situation" of like nature to a
"situation" in a private home as a domestic servant.  The mother did not
apparently return to the
home of the father's family.
<P>

115   	The history to Dr Waters is not only supported by what I
have just said but there are the independent and reliable pieces
of evidence
that the plaintiff's mother was "removed" from her family by the Board (she was
included in the ward register), and that
she was also placed in the Board's
Cootamundra Girl's Home.  The plaintiff did not give sworn evidence but she did
swear in para
82 of her affidavit of 20 November 1996 that she was reunited
with her mother in 1973 and that she had "found out that I was an
aboriginal".
<P>

116   	Of significance in the history recorded by Dr Waters is
that "Joy's mother apparently never told anyone of Joy's birth".
 By this I
take it to mean that neither her parents or members of her family nor the
father's family or the father were told about
the plaintiff's birth.  There is
nothing to suggest that the plaintiff's father (or his family) ever displayed
interest in the pregnancy,
the birth or in the plaintiff.  What happened to him
one does not know.  There is nothing to suggest his family showed any interest.
It is probable that the mother's pregnancy was unplanned.
<P>

117   	At the time of the birth the plaintiff's mother was
eighteen years and single and probably of limited or no financial means.
 There
is nothing to suggest she had independent means, nor relatives or the personal
capacity to raise or support the child.  There
is nothing to suggest she had
any known relatives friends or otherwise in Sydney or at all who could help or
assist her.  There is
nothing to suggest that she had other than the
accommodation in the private home where she worked or that after the birth she
was
welcomed back.  There is reference in the history to her "staying on" to
work as a domestic in hospitals and not returning to the
father's home.  This
was a likely situation in the circumstances.  In my view the plaintiff's mother
was in the situation of being
an unmarried single Aboriginal woman with an
illegitimate child and with really no one to turn to for support, other than to
the
Board.  She had been a ward with the Board since the age of seven up until
the age of eighteen.  It had looked after her, cared for
her and raised her in
its home at Cootamundra.  There was no where else for her to go, or turn to for
help, other than to the Board
in a situation where she could not keep the
plaintiff child for one or more reasons no doubt valid to herself.  The absence
of the
father's name or the birth certificate supports this view.  Who would or
could best look after the child to the eighteen year old
plaintiff's mothers
knowledge (and she was living in Sydney) having regard to her many years spent
with the Board?  The irresistible
inference is that it could only be the
Board.
<P>

118   	Indeed, it would seem to me that in the circumstances
outlined that the Board when approached by the mother under s 7(2)
was firstly
willing to accept the plaintiff (and did accept her) and continued to accept
her and treat her as an aboriginal child
within the meaning of s 3 of the Act.
The Board knew the "status" and Aboriginality of the mother who, had been in
its earlier care
and control.  There is no evidence it knew of the father's
"origins" at the time of birth, or was concerned about such.  It acted
upon the
basis that it had, or would have jurisdiction over the child.  She was the
child of an Aboriginal as well.  Nor is there
any evidence as to the
"appearance" of the plaintiff as a baby as and at her birth.  However, as its
1941 report also revealed the
Board had found difficulty in defining "half
caste aboriginal" within the meaning of s 3 of the Act.  In my view it was
willing to
accept in the circumstances the plaintiff as a "ward" and did so.
Indeed, I consider the Board accepted the plaintiff as a ward upon
the basis
that she plaintiff was an Aborigine and/or the child of an Aborigine.  The
Board had the plaintiff's mother at its Aborigine
Home at Cootamundra and knew
she was an aborigine and treated her as such.  Second, if the Board had not
accepted the plaintiff's
child, the mother not being in a position to keep her,
there can be little real doubt that the Board could probably have been
compelled
to take the child under its control pursuant to Children's Court
committal procedures then capable of being invoked under s 13A of
the Act.  The
Board under this section assumes control of Aboriginal children if they are
committed to it by the Children's Court.
 In the present circumstances the
point is that had the Board not acted voluntarily it probably could have been
required to take
the child under the s 13A procedure.  This is significant in
that, if the with the plaintiff's arguments are good, then they would
potentially apply in a situation where the Children's Court has made an order
under s 13(A) including a possible order that a child
be committed to a home.
Further, if the plaintiff's arguments are valid then they would impose the same
duties and obligations upon
the Board qua a child ward not only in a s 7(2)
situation but also where there has been a Court committal involving one of the
situations
under s 13A(1).  The Board in the latter situation involving a
committal would have no choice but to accept the child as a ward.
 This
potential situation highlights some of the very early problems for the
plaintiff in the case.
<P>

119   	In my view in the circumstances there was but one
practical option available to the plaintiff in the circumstances (including
being in hospital for 29 days) where the plaintiff's mother was an Aboriginal
woman with limited training or education and who did
not tell any one of the
plaintiff's birth, and where she probably had no relatives or friends who could
assist in raising the child.
 She was without money or a job and probably
homeless.  She was in no position to keep the child and in my view turned to
the Board
under s 7(2).  Indeed, the defendants accept that the only
organisation in Sydney with which the plaintiff's mother had a connection
was
the Board and its officer Mrs English.
<P>

120   	In my view without options or choices available to her I
infer, indeed, I find that the probability is that before 12 October
1942 the
plaintiff's mother contacted the Board, (or this was done on her behalf) and
having established contact the plaintiff's
mother made application as the
parent of the plaintiff child to admit such child to the control of the board
under s 7(2) of the
Act and that the Board having received the mother's
application admitted the plaintiff baby to its control.  Having been admitted
by the Board to its control the plaintiff also became a "ward" within the
meaning of s 3 of the Act.  Once it admitted the child
to its care, the Board
itself had no practical option but to send the child to the UAM Children's Home
at Bomaderry being in reality
the only suitable home accommodation or place
available for her reception.  (See also the Public Service Board's Report
1940).  Based
upon the prior dealings with the Aboriginal plaintiff's mother
including having her at its home at Cootamundra, the Board in my view
would
have had no difficulty in accepting the mother's application under s 7(2) of
the Act.
<P>

121   	The defendants' argue that there is no documentary
evidence that the plaintiff was admitted to the control of the Board (which
is
perhaps not surprising after 57 years) and that there was no oral evidence on
the issue.  It is submitted I cannot make a finding
that the plaintiff was ever
admitted to the control of the Board.  I reject this submission.  I repeat I
draw the inference that
the Board took control of the plaintiff on or before 12
October 1942 at the mother's request whilst she was still in hospital.  There
are further reasons for this view.  The date of the plaintiff's mother's
discharge from hospital was 12 October 1942.  The plaintiff
arrived at
Bomaderry Children's Home on 13 October 1942.
<P>

122   	The Children's Home at Bomaderry had been in existence
for many years prior to 1942.  It was an Aboriginal Children's Home
conducted
by the United Aborigines Mission (who had a mission to evangelize the
aborigines of Australia).  The Aborigines Children's
Home was apparently
experienced in looking after and raising very young Aboriginal children from
birth.  Indeed there is evidence
that as at 1930 the Home housed children of
both sexes with the Board determining the policy in terms of the age up to
which Aboriginal
children could remain at Bomaderry.  Up until 1947 when the
plaintiff left the Bomaderry Mission appears to have communicated problems
to
the Board for the latter's consideration.  The Board conducted general
inspections from time to time, at least probably annually.
<P>

123   	The United Aborigines Mission was a body that appeared to
emphasise the importance of religion as and at the 1940's when
they conducted
the home at Bomaderry, New South Wales.  Religious training and the teaching of
religion and moral values was regarded
as important by the Board and was
considered important generally in terms of the contemporary standards of the
1940's and 1950's:
cf s 11A(2) "religious instruction of a ward".  This Home
was conducted by the Mission as at April 1947 to look after and raise
Aboriginal
children.  The staff in April 1947 at least included a Matron and
Mission Sisters.  Other staff also assisted including two full
time assistants
and two voluntary helpers.  As to the relations between the Board and
Bomaderry, the incomplete correspondence tendered
reveals that the
communication was ongoing communication between the Mission and the Board in
respect of the operation of the Bomaderry
Home.  While Bomaderry Children's
Home was run by the UAM, it was subject to the oversight and direction of the
AWB.  The staff at
the home were employed by the UAM (see: Board memo to
Director General Public Health - 29 October 1948).  And the correspondence
of
the Board including Mrs English's report of 13 December 1948 often referred to
and described the children as being "Wards of this
Department".
<P>

124   	Until 1930, the Home housed children of both sexes up to
the age of fourteen.  At that stage the AWB apparently determined
as a matter
of policy that the ages of children staying at the Home should be restricted to
ten years.  At this age the boys were
removed from Bomaderry to be placed at
Kinchela Boys' Home and the girls were removed for placement at Cootamundra
Girls Home.  The
situation was reviewed by the Board in 1931, 1934 and 1938 but
was not altered.
<P>

125   	In 1945, at the request of the United Aborigines Mission,
the Board considered the matter of extending the age of the children
to stay at
Bomaderry.  The decision taken by the board consisted of extending the age for
removal of girls to 12 years, but maintaining
that the removal of the boys take
place at the age of 10 years. Had the plaintiff not gone to Lutanda in 1947
then presumably in
accordance with that policy the plaintiff would have been
removed from Bomaderry at the age of 12 in 1954 and then transferred to
the
Board's Home at Cootamundra.
<P>

126   	The correspondence in 1945 (when the plaintiff was aged
three years) reveals that at the Bomaderry Home that girls of 10
years assisted
in the caring of younger children such as getting them dressed in the morning,
giving them other little attentions
and assisted in taking them to and from the
dining room.  The boys also assisted in little tasks.  Matron Darby considered
that this
help from the boys and girls not only helped the staff in work but
was "helpful training for boys and girls".  It is difficult to
see how any
valid criticism could be made of this.
<P>

127   	It would appear that in 1946 for some months there were
some staff shortages.  The Board was requested to remove certain
boys to
Kinchela.  The material suggests that placement and removal of the children was
a matter for the Board with the UAM making
the request for action. 
<P>

128   	In this respect and in others, the Board exercised
oversight of Bomaderry.  It carried out from time to time through its
inspector
(in some cases Mrs English) a general inspection of the Children's Home at
Bomaderry: cf the General Inspection report
of Mrs English in 18 June 1947).
Indeed, the inspector could recommend transfers to the Kinchela and Cootamundra
Homes and arrange
for Sydney medical care for children at the home (s 14A) and
arrange medical examinations.  In one inspector's report to the Board
Superintendent in referring to her inspection of the Aboriginal Children's Home
at Bomaderry, dated 13 December 1948, Mrs English
stated that at the time there
appeared to be "a mistaken idea that because the children are wards of this
Department the latter is
responsible...".  This view provides additional
support for the view that the plaintiff was a "ward" of the Board,  whilst at
Lutanda.
<P>

129   	The plaintiff was such a ward at Bomaderry from 1942 to
1947.  In respect of the plaintiff herself the UAM was of the view,
contained
in a letter from the Secretary of the UAM, Miss Turner of 9 April 1947 to the
Board to the then Superintendent of the Board,
Mr Lipscombe, that the Board's
approval was required to remove the plaintiff to Lutanda.  The letter request
that she be taken there
without further delay subsequent to the Board giving
that approval.  On the question of removing other Aboriginal children of white
appearance from Bomaderry, the Board considered that this too was a matter for
it and was being considered: see the letter dated
22 April 1997 from the Acting
Secretary of the AWB.
<P>

<b>The Reports of the Aboriginal Welfare Board.</b>
<P>

130   	The Board additionally made consistent reference to the
Bomaderry Home and other Board run homes in their yearly reports
throughout the
period 1939-1960.  During the years up to June 1939, the Board was known as the
Aboriginal Protection Board. In the
 Aboriginal Protection Board's report of
the year ended 30 June 1939, in which there was reference to the Board having
to deal with
diverse problems including prejudice on the part of the white
community and reference to the objective end of complete assimilation
of
aborigines as well as to the resolutions relating to assimilation objectives
passed at a conference of Aborigines Protection Authorities
in 1937, there is
recorded the following:
<P>

"At Bomaderry there is a Children's Home, conducted by the United Aborigines
Mission and accommodating about 25 inmates, the maximum
age of which is 10
years, after which they are transferred to Kinchella and Cootamundra.  This
home is partially supported by the
Board, but staffed by the Mission to which
the premises belong."
<P>

131   	See also the report of the Board for the year ending 30
June 1940 where there is reference to Children's Homes and to Bomaderry.

<P>

132   	The report of the Aboriginal Welfare Board for the year
ending 30 June 1940 made further reference to adopting the policy
of
assimilation expressed in the APB's report ending 1939.  The reference to the
Children's Homes is as follows (at 1488):
<P>

"The care of Aboriginal Children committed to the Board's care because of
cruelty , neglect or loss of parents is still regarded
by the Board as one of
the very important features of its administration.  Many years ago a home was
established for girls at Cootamundra
and later an institution for boys at
Kinchela on the Macleay River.  In <i>addition</i> to these two home the United
Aborigines Mission has established an institution for the reception of babies
and very young children
at Bomaderry on the South Coast".
<P>

133   	See also s 7(1)(a) of the Act which also imposed an
assimilation duty.  The report noted that an average of twenty four children
were maintained in care at Bomaderry, there being twenty one as at 30 June
1940. 
<P>

134   	In the Board's report for the year ending 30 June 1941
the following is recorded:
<P>

"Aboriginal children who have been committed to the Board's care as wards
continue to receive affectionate care in the homes specially
provided for their
reception. The children thus committed have been the victims of unhappy
circumstance., sometimes through the loss
of parents or perhaps from conditions
of cruelty, vice or neglect. The staff of the Homes receive these children with
kindness and
endeavour to bring happiness into their young lives."
<P>

135   	As to the Bomaderry Home, the report notes that it is run
by the UAM but is subject to inspection and oversight by the AWB.
 It continues
(at p 1496):
<P>

"The Home is situated in a bush environment about one mile and a half from
Nowra, and the children of school age attend the Bomaderry
Public School.
Medical and dental attention is given in an honorary capacity by local
professional men. 
<P>

Apart from a general oversight of the Home, the Aborigines Welfare Board
contributes largely to its maintenance by supplying food
and clothing for the
children's use. 
<P>

Upon attaining the age of ten years the girls are transferred to Cootamundra
and the boys to Kinchela.
<P>

An average of thirty children was maintained at the Home during the past year."

<P>

136   	The Board concluded its report by saying that the task of
caring for the aborigines of this State is not an easy one, indeed
it may be
regarded as one of the most difficult to administer of all the social services.
It is stated that the Board was doing their
utmost with the funds at its
disposal for the benefit of those under its care.
<P>

137   	It is clear that as at 1942 when the plaintiff was born,
the Board had established two homes under s 11at Cootamundra (Girls)
and
Kinchela (Boys).  As a matter of practice the Board's wards that were very
young wards were sent to Bomaderry.  There was no
other institution or place to
which they could be sent although legally, had the Board wished, it could have
sent them to it's Cootamundra
Home or Kinchela Home.  The one and only facility
or place, in any real practical sense, available to which the plaintiff could
be
sent was to Bomaderry where there was in effect special provision for the
care of Aboriginal babies and children of tender years.
 As much is confirmed
by Mrs English's report dated 18 June 1947.
<P>

138   	In its report ending 30 June 1947 which covered the
period during which the plaintiff was transferred to Lutanda, the Board
emphasised (as it did in 1946) that one of the principal features of its policy
was the assimilation of aborigines, particularly
those of lighter caste into
the community.  I have referred to the Board's difficulty in seeking to
identify who was a "half caste".
 The report stated that legally the Board was
not responsible for the protection and general welfare of those persons of
mixed caste
who do not possess a preponderance of aboriginal blood.  With
respect to the position of the plaintiff in this case, several points
may be
made.  Firstly, the reference here is to suggested legal responsibility and not
factual responsibility for persons without
a preponderance of aboriginal blood.
Secondly, there is no evidence that the Board acted strictly in accordance with
this policy.
 There is no evidence to suggest that it never went beyond its
mere legal responsibilities.  Thirdly, in my view, as I have said,
I consider
that in the circumstances of this case the plaintiff was accepted without
dispute as having a preponderance of aboriginal
blood for the purpose of her
being an Aboriginal child under s 3 of the Act and that she was accepted by the
Board into its control
under s 7(2) . The Board acted as if she did fall within
the section and did not thereafter treat her or act as if she did not or
even
suggest that she was not a child of an Aborigine.  The Board presumably
exercised some discretion in determining who had the
relevant preponderance of
aboriginal blood an who was to be regarded as an Aborigine of full-blood or one
who was a half-caste Aborigine,
comprehended as it then was within the
terminology of the time.  The plaintiff was accepted to be within its power.
Further, or alternatively,
the Board should not now be heard to say the
plaintiff was not a person within its jurisdiction or a "ward" under the
Act.
<P>

139   	The 1947 report dealt with Children's Homes in the
following terms:
<P>

"An important duty of the Board, as laid down in the Aborigines Protection Act,
is that it shall provide for the custody and maintenance
of the children of
aborigines.  In practice, the Board assumes control of aboriginal children
after they have been committed by the
Children's Court as neglected or
uncontrollable children.  Frequently children are admitted to the control of
the Board at the request
of the parent or guardian.  These applications are
considered on their merits, and if the parents are found to be unable to
exercise
proper care of their children, the Board usually assumes control of
their children  The Board at present maintains two Children's
Homes for the
reception maintenance, education and training of the aboriginal children
admitted to its control.  These two Houses,
namely, the Kinchela Boy's Training
Home and the Cootamundra Girls' Training Home, have continued to function
satisfactorily."
<P>

140   	In addition there was as mentioned the Bomaderry Home to
receive babies and children of tender years.
<P>

141   	The Board's report for the year ended 30th June 1948
enunciated the Board's policy as follows:
<P>

<b>"Board's Policy</b>
<P>

Assimilation of the aboriginal into the general community is the keynote of the
Board's policy.  When it is considered that 95 per
cent of the so-called
aborigines in New South Wales are half and light castes, whose former social
fabric has been torn asunder by
the onrush of Western civilisation, and who if
left alone would have neither the traditional background of the aboriginal way
of
life nor the culture of the white man to stabilise and guide them, the need
for this policy should be abundantly clear.
<P>

The policy has a positive aim, namely, to make the aboriginal a responsible,
active, intelligent citizen.
<P>

The Aborigines Welfare Board realises the difficulties arising from a different
mode of thinking, content of knowledge and emphasis
on different values and
ideals.  It realises the aborigines inherit a different view of life, and that
the value of our culture must
be proved to them before it will be accepted.
Again the burden of ostracism and the stigma of inferiority, which have been
the aborigines'
lot in the past, have left them with a deep-seated resentment
which must be overcome if constructive reform is to be carried out.
<P>

In the past progress has been slowed by colour prejudice in the general
community.  With a betterment of the aborigines' conditions,
it is hoped that
prejudice will be lessened and the Board looks forward to the day when
aboriginal and white will live together happily
and harmoniously - an example
to the world of how, by liberal and wise administration, this social problem
can be solved".
<P>

142   	I repeat again that in my view the evidence gives rise to
the clear inference that the plaintiff's mother applied to admit
the child to
the Board's control pursuant to s 7(2) and the Board agreed to accept control
of the plaintiff pursuant to such application
and upon the basis it could do
factually and legally as being a person within the Act and its jurisdiction.
That is what I consider
probably happened.  It would be somewhat unreal to
consider that the plaintiff was involved in Children's Court committal
proceedings
under s 13A of the Act with an order being made pursuant to s 13(7)
of the Act.  There is nothing to suggest why such a procedure
might be involved
where the plaintiff baby was with the mother in hospital for four weeks.  It
was hardly likely to be in such situation
neglected or uncontrolled with s
13A(1), although this may well have happened had the plaintiff's mother not
acted under s 7(2).
 Indeed, the defendant concedes that there is no evidence
to support the view that a court order may have been sought under s 13A.
 It
also follows that there was no trespass at Bomaderry because the AWB took
control of the child on the mother's application under
s 7(2) of the Act and
thereafter the Board had lawful control over the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>The Home at Bomaderry</b>
<P>

143   	On 5 July 1988 the United Aborigines Mission advised the
plaintiff's solicitors that the Missionaries who worked at Bomaderry
during the
time of her residence (now deceased) kept few records maintaining only the
basic essential details.  The letter said:
<P>

"Our Mission workers are called by the Lord and supported by the people, back
in the 1940's very little support was available, they
came to fill a need that
they saw and were not aware of the political influences behind the reason for
the home.  We firmly believed
we were filling a need that the aboriginal people
wanted."
<P>

144   	For reasons that (including the "need" of the plaintiff),
I will elaborate on, both here and in considering the lay witness
evidence, I
find that that need was in fact filled in a loving devoted, charitable
religious way by the staff including Mission Sisters,
in particular Sister
Saville, no doubt in difficult circumstances involving the bringing up of other
people's children in a home,
including in wartime Australia, and in early
post-war Australia.
<P>

145   	The United Aborigines Mission was clearly a religious
mission very much concerned with the Christian religion and its practice.
 I
have already referred to the article by Sister Saville (16 October 1942).  It
was a place of intended good charitable works looking
after the children,
caring for them and in effect raising them with the Board's involvement as
explained.  Indeed in the United Aborigines
Messenger, August 1, 1948 in an
article  "Children's Home Bomaderry"  written by A. V. Darby there is a report
upon movement of children
from Bomaderry to Kinchela and Cootamundra.  Prayers
were offered for them.  Reference was made to the fact that in 1947 the family
was reduced to forty three and to the plaintiff's departure in terms:
<P>

"Joy, four and a half years, with us from the age of four weeks has been
recently placed in another Home.  We miss our little Joy:
she loved the Lord,
and often said so and Joy had an understanding beyond her years and often
surprised us with questions and statements".
<P>

146   	The evidence would suggest a caring religious atmosphere
with the Mission seeking to do the best it could in the circumstances
for the
bringing up and protection of the plaintiff.  Indeed, there is evidence that it
was interested in advancing her interests
to do the best for her and to monitor
her progress.  It appears to be that it was the UAM who initiated the
suggestion in December
1946 that, because of her white appearance, that a more
suitable environment for her would be Lutanda at Wentworth Falls.  It was
apparently considered in good faith that it would be better and more
advantageous for her (by the standards and values of the time)
being a girl of
"white" appearance to go to a Home for white children at Wentworth Falls.  It
was apparently the UAM at Bomaderry
who initiated inquiries at Lutanda for the
placement of the plaintiff.  It was the UAM who pleaded the plaintiff's case to
the Board
of which she was a ward (see letter 9 April 1947).  One can infer
that it was, with the best will in the world, seeking to protect
and advance
her interests because of feelings of compassion towards her.  The Board agreed
that it was in her best interests for
her to go to Lutanda.  Indeed one might
infer that, so did the mother, who signed the Lutanda application.  If the girl
had not gone
to Lutanda with the support of UAM and approval of the Board she
would have remained at Bomaderry, and absent fostering or adoption,
have stayed
there till she got older and then been transferred to the Aboriginal Girl's
Home at Cootamundra, where her mother had
been a ward.  There is no evidence
the mother sought her restoration under s 11D(1)(h) or sought to have the
plaintiff discharged
to her care under s 11D(1)(i).  Clearly she was in no
position to care for her or look after her (see also the mother's letter to
Miss English in December 1956). It is worth again noting that the mother had
not told any one of the plaintiff's birth and so the
question of relatives (the
father's or the plaintiff's mother) being in a position to take care did not
arise at all.  Absent fostering
(which could not be permanent) or adoption, the
situation was one where the plaintiff was to be raised as a ward in an
institution
Lutanda, or the Aboriginal Children's Home Bomaderry followed by
the Aboriginal Girl's Home at Cootamundra, and to the use the language
of the
time to be raised in effect as a "white girl" in those institutions.  The UAM
Sisters considered that it was desirable she
be brought up as a "white child"
in a white environment as being more suitable ie children "should go to Homes
with children of their
own colour": letter 9 April 1947.  The Board agreed,
that it was in her interests to be transferred to Lutanda.  It also accorded
with its policy and accorded with the duty of "assimilation" imposed on the
Board by s 7(1)(a) of the Act.  In my view the collateral
purpose of relieving
pressure on accommodation was probably very much a secondary one.
<P>

147   	As to the plaintiff's mother visits at Bomaderry.  I
accept that the plaintiff was visited by her mother at Bomaderry as
she asserts
in paragraph 6 of her affidavit (see also history to Dr Waters in October
1991).  I have no reason to doubt that this
history given to her by her mother
is correct.  I would also add that the Children's Home at Bomaderry was not a
home established
under s 11 of the Act, and s 13(1) of the Act did not apply.
The plaintiff's mother was entitled to visit the plaintiff at Bomaderry
and I
find she did so between 1942 and 1947.
<P>

148   	There appears to have been a warm affectionate
relationship that arose between the plaintiff and her carers at Bomaderry,
particularly one carer, Sister Saville (a photograph was tendered in evidence).
I accept there was bonding and attachment to her
after the plaintiff's arrival
at Bomaderry and whilst she remained at Bomaderry between her and Sister
Saville  According to the
history (which I accept on this point), after Joy was
placed in the Bomaderry Children's Home, Dr Waters records the following
history:
<P>

"....  She has a number of early memories at Bomaderry which she described as
"comfortable safe memories".  She felt that someone
was looking after me and
she recalled being cared for at this time by several black women who were
there.  She also remembers being
visited by a lady with a silver buckle "whom
she now believes was her mother"."
<P>

149   	There is evidence (not objected to) in respect of the
relationship of Miss Saville with the plaintiff at Bomaderry.  Miss
Moorehouse
(from Lutanda) gave evidence (at T 334-335) that she had not met Miss Saville
but had heard that Sister Saville was a
missionary in Bomaderry who through
caring for Joy, was getting married and that Joy was one of her favourites.
Miss Moorehouse that
Sister Saville had thought that Joy should be given a
chance in a good home and that Sister Saville had asked whether she could go
to
Lutanda.  Miss Moorehouse said she was told this by Miss Sangwell at
Lutanda.
<P>

150   	In cross-examination (T 338-339) Miss Moorehouse said
that Joy had told her "When Miss Saville got married, she should have
taken me
to be her little girl".  She continued (at T 339) "She just thought that when
Miss Saville married she should have gone
with her to be her little girl".  She
was asked (at 339):
<P>

"Q.	How often did she say that to you?
<P>

A.	Oh, I didn't count, but I knew that's how she felt".
<P>

151   	This evidence also points to bonding and attachment with
Sister Saville.  I accept Miss Moorehouse's evidence (see also para
9 of her
affidavit of 3 December 1997).  Miss Moorehouse gave the following evidence
which I also accept (at T 362):
<P>

"<b>Q.	</b>	Were you told how many staff there were?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	No, the only thing I know about it was that photo I had of Joy with
Miss Saville and the little ones, but there could have been more,
but I don't
know how many more children, no.
<P>

<b>Q.	</b>	So you didn't know, for example, that one of the reasons that Joy
was sent away from Bomaderry is because it was too crowded?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	It wasn't too crowded, but this Miss Saville thought that Joy would
have a chance to be assimilated - that's a bad word, isn't it?
 But they did
think it would give Joy a chance to grow up in a good children's home where she
would be well cared for and loved.
<P>

<b>Q.	</b>	But you weren't told that one of the reasons that they wanted Joy to
be removed was because it was too crowded down there?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	No, no, I didn't.  I just know it was because Miss Saville was
getting married and Joy was her favourite little girl.
<P>

<b>Q.</b>		And you didn't know how many children were there?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	No, and I never ever met Miss Saville, I just know that.
<P>

<b>Q.	</b>	And you didn't know how many staff were taking care of the
children?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	Oh no, I don't know.  I could have found out, but the lady I would
have asked died two years ago, so it was too late."
<P>

152   	Mrs Buxton (nee Parker) gave evidence along similar lines
which I accept.  She said (at 399-400) that she knew "back then"
that Joy had
been at Bomaderry Children's Home prior to coming to Lutanda that "she had much
paler skin than anybody else there and
that she was transferred to Lutanda at
Wentworth Falls because she looked so out of place amongst the black
children".
<P>

153   	The above evidence suggests a caring feeling and
compassionate relationship, that she was cared for and looked after, perhaps
even given special additional attention because of the particular interest with
her by Sister Saville.  Whilst the plaintiff was
at Bomaderry she had such a
close enough relationship with Sister Saville that she wanted to go with her as
her little girl when
Sister Saville left to get married.  According to the
plaintiff Sister Saville took her from Bomaderry to Lutanda at Wentworth Falls.
Indeed, the relationship bond was such that the plaintiff also remembered her
only visitors at Lutanda were Aunty Leila (Sister Saville)
and Uncle Sid
(Sister Saville's husband).  In para 65 of her affidavit the plaintiff
described visits to her when she was twelve
and recalled getting phone calls
every two years after Sister Saville moved to Western Australia.
<P>

154   	There was in my view a particular bond of affection
between the plaintiff and Sister Saville at Bomaderry, interrupted inter
alia
by Sister Saville's departure and desire to see the plaintiff placed in a "good
home" at Lutanda.  This was also a good faith
act on the part of the Mission,
particularly Bomaderry, to try to get the plaintiff transferred to Lutanda
described as "a good Children's
Home where she would be well cared for and
loved".  Sister Saville would not I believe have supported a transfer of a
"problem child"
without disclosing she was such a problem child, to someone
especially her superiors as well as the Matron.  If there had been a
problem I
am confident the Matron would have disclosed it to Mrs English or the Board at
the time of discussing the transfer.
<P>

155   	As to the plaintiff also being properly looked after at
Bomaderry, the Board "generally inspected" Bomaderry.  Mrs English's
report of
18 June 1947 is revealing.  The plaintiff was admitted to Lutanda on 16 April
1947 just shortly after the plaintiff left
for Lutanda.  There was an
inspection on 22 and 23 April, the subject of Mrs English's report of 18 June
1947.
<P>

156   	The report reveals there were 43 children in residence.
The plaintiff had left just one week prior to the inspection.  She
observed
that the children were neat and tidy in appearance.  She reported that when
required the children were medically examined
by local doctors and that their
diet was adequate and nourishing.  Recreational activities are well catered
for.  The staff numbers
were also described.
<P>

157   	The Matron reported to Mrs English that the conduct of
the children was very satisfactory and that there were <b>"no problem
cases"</b> [my emphasis].  I accept that what was being reported upon included
that of the position of the plaintiff prior to her recent departure
for
Lutanda.  The proposition of the plaintiff that technically the plaintiff was
not covered by the description because she had
just been transferred is not one
that I accept.  It would be strange if the only "problem case" had just left
Bomaderry.  For reasons
that I will set out more fully in respect to the lay
evidence, I find that the plaintiff was not problem child in any respects nor
at Bomaderry displayed anything that showed a manifestation of any psychiatric
or emotional disorder.  I infer and find that at Bomaderry
and when she left
Bomaderry she was a normal child including in her behaviour.  I find that she
was in no way disturbed or showed
signs of disturbed or abnormal behaviour and
that this was the situation when she departed Bomaderry.  I reject the
plaintiff's submissions
to the contrary.  Importantly, a medical certificate
was also mandatory for entrance into Lutanda (see the pro forma Lutanda
Application
Form).  I infer that this practice was followed qua the plaintiff
and a certificate given.  I will return to consider these matters
again when I
consider the lay evidence.
<P>

158   	In my view, a child such as the plaintiff who was
transferred a week before the inspection with the assistance and support
of
Sister Saville, would probably have been a "non problem case" as described by
the Matron and given the requirement for a medical
certificate, also in good
health. 
<P>

159   	Whilst there may have been some "overcrowding" at
Bomaderry, the position appears to be that, as concluded by Mrs English
 in
April 1947:
<P>

"This Home appears to be functioning in a satisfactory manner and to be serving
a useful purpose in the care of Aboriginal Children
of tender years."
<P>

160   	In any event I find that any overcrowding did not
diminish the care and proper support given to the plaintiff at Bomaderry
by the
UAM including in particular that provided by Sister Saville.  The plaintiff has
submitted that the report of Mrs English cannot
support any inference that the
conditions at Bomaderry (commencing in 1942 and including continuing one or
three year till the war
finished) were other than adverse to the plaintiff's
emotional health.  I reject this submission.  I reject the submission that she
was or appeared to be profoundly disturbed or disturbed at all.  This
submission is advanced by the plaintiff perhaps to support
the evidence of Dr
Katz, a medico legal expert called in the plaintiff's case, and Mrs Bull, a
retired social worker, that the plaintiff
was suffering a disorder of
attachment and must have been displaying signs of that disorder when she was
young.  For reasons that
will become clear, I reject the views of Dr Katz and
Mrs Bull because of my findings on the lay evidence that no such behaviour is
proved whilst at Bomaderry.  Dr Katz's and Mrs Bull's views that there was or
must have been a situation involving a disorder of
attachment present some 52
years ago involves rejection of my findings and inferences from the evidence.
They are views not in accordance
with the facts as I have found them to be.
<P>

161   	In respect of its case against the defendants in respect
of Bomaderry, essentially all that the plaintiff submits should
have been done
was in my opinion, in fact reasonably done, namely, regular inspections of the
institution and children in order that
the AWB would be in a position to give
an accurate history of the background of the individual child if and when the
child was moved
to another institution.  The plaintiff has not proved or proved
to my satisfaction what history was in fact given.  I have already
referred to
some of the material.  There is also the application form.  The plaintiff's
counsel submits that the plaintiff (residing
at Bomaderry in 1947) should have
been examined by staff of a Child Guidance Clinic in Sydney (at the age of
4-1/2 years) before
going to Lutanda (Wentworth Falls) in April 1947 in order
to determine her mental state and the risk of harm to which she was subject
having regard to the circumstances of her maternal deprivation and the
conditions of Bomaderry.  I reject this submission.  No such
examination was
reasonably required, practically required or called for.  The child was in my
view behaving as a normal child of
her age.
<P>

162   	Indeed, it is appropriate for me to repeat something I
have said before.  The Board's report for the year ended 30 June 1945
specifically referred to the previous five years being fraught with many to
give contest to the plaintiff's position at time of birth
in difficulties and
restrictions in connection with the implementation of constructive and
comprehensive policy:
<P>

"These war years have necessitated a curtailment of expenditure and an
inability to proceed with a general programe shortage of
manpower and
availability of material.  Furthermore plans for the development of welfare
activity which would be consequent upon
more adequate staffing had to be
deferred because of inability to secure trained staff".
<P>

163   	Indeed, in its 1943 report the Board noted that the war
had depleted the Board's manpower and material resources causing
a progressive
policy to be differed.  The war was impacting then upon the Board's man power
and resources and upon its policies activities
and operations and its capacity
to "deliver" services.  In 1946 the Board's report referred to the year under
review presenting difficulties
from the point of view of staffing owing to the
fact that the curtailment of demands due to the war was only gradual.
<P>

164   	With respect to the inspections of Bomaderry the Board's
inspector saw the children and the accommodation.  The Inspector
acted upon
received reports and information from the Matron(s).  The children that were
old enough were in attendance at public schools
at Bomaderry.  Further there is
no evidence of any psychiatric problems with any of the other children at
Bomaderry.  There is no
evidence led that the any of the children since the
1930's up till 1947 or at all who have been at Bomaderry (or even Lutanda)
developed
or had ever been diagnosed as having attachment disorders (or had
developed attachment disorders) or mental disorders, or ever developed
Borderline Personality Disorders.  The Home had been operated for receipt of
babies since 1930's and was still operating in 1940's.
 There was no evidence
presented that any GP in the area diagnosed any emotional problems, medical
problems of attachment or Borderline
Personality Disorders for any children at
the Bomaderry home.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Transfer to Lutanda</b>
<P>

165   	In April 1947 the plaintiff was transferred from
Bomaderry to "Lutanda" Children's Home at Wentworth Falls conducted by the
Plymouth Brethren.  She remained at that Home in Wentworth Falls until 1950
when it moved to Pennant Hills.  She stayed with the
Home at Pennant Hills
until discharged on 31 July 1960.  This information was provided to the
plaintiff in a letter from the then
Administrator, David Bryant dated December
1984.  The plaintiff was advised in that letter that Lutanda had no school
records but
that the plaintiff had attended Hornsby Girl's School possibly in
years 1955-1957.  I accept that the plaintiff was probably educated
to an
Intermediate level.  There is no evidence she suffered any detrimental problems
with her education let alone received any adverse
behaviour reports.  I would
note that a copy of the plaintiff's birth certificate and a copy of her
mother's application for admission
was enclosed.  The plaintiff was advised
that "no money was paid for keep" and that Lutanda "was unable to help with
pocket money".
<P>

166   	Had the plaintiff not been "transferred" to Lutanda in
April 1947 then unless she was discharged under s 11D(1)(h) or 11D(1)(i)
at the
age of eighteen, then in accordance with the Board's policy, the plaintiff ward
would probably have been transferred by the
Board to the Board's Aboriginal
Girl's Home at Cootamundra (a home constituted under s 11 of the Act) when she
turned twelve years
and probably would have remained there as her mother did
till the age fifteen.  She would whilst at Cootamundra, probably have been
trained to perform domestic or similar work till the age of fifteen.  Contrary
to the submissions of the defendants the "transfer"
in my view did not involve
s 11D(1)(h) or (i) of the Act, or reflect, an implementation of either of those
provisions.
<P>

167   	The circumstances surrounding the child's transfer to
Lutanda have been seriously disputed.  It appears that by about December
1946
(when the plaintiff was aged 4 years) the plaintiff's complexion was such that
the UAM Mission at Bomaderry were describing
her as having the appearance of a
white child.  Sister Saville of the Mission apparently knew of Lutanda in
circumstances I have
discussed.  In any event the Mission wrote to the Board
(the plaintiff was a ward of the Board on my findings) in December 1946 about
removing the "white child Eileen Williams".  The decision to transfer or remove
the child to Lutanda appears to have been one that
the Board approved, indeed,
consented to in its capacity, of having the plaintiff, as its  ward under its
control.  The mother also
consented to the transfer with full knowledge of
where her daughter was being placed and probably with knowledge of the reasons
therefore.
 I infer that the mother at the time (1947) probably also thought it
was in her daughters interests in terms of the choices available
to her. On the
evidence it cannot be said that the plaintiff was denied any opportunity of
being fostered or adopted. Further, there
is no evidence that at the time of
the plaintiff's transfer, or before, or even subsequent, that the mother even
requested the Board
to consider having the plaintiff adopted or fostered
out.
<P>

168   	Clearly there had been intervening correspondence because
the Board responded as follows in a letter from the Acting Secretary
of the
Board dated 22 April 1947 to the then Secretary of the UAM in the following
terms:
<P>

"Your letter of 9th April is acknowledged.
<P>

In connection with the child, Eileen Williams, I communicated with you about
ten days ago regarding the transfer of this child to
the Lutanda Children's
Home, Wentworth Falls, and no doubt you have now received that
communication.
<P>

Regarding the question of removing other children from the Bomaderry Children's
Home, I have to advise that this matter is receiving
attention. It is
anticipated that Mrs Inspector English will be visiting Bomaderry Home at an
early date and she will discuss this
matter with the Matron of the Home."
<P>

169   	Pausing at this point of time, it appears that between
December 1946 and April 1947 there had been communication between
the UAM and
Lutanda about taking the "white girl" plaintiff to Lutanda.  This accords with
the fact that Sister Saville knew someone
there.  I am also satisfied that
somehow and by some means between December 1946 and March 1947 some
communication was established
with the plaintiff's mother.  How she was located
or by whom is not clear.  Since Lutanda did not know her from previous dealings
perhaps she was located either by the UAM or the Board or perhaps both.  The
plaintiff was a ward of the Board on my findings and
on the probabilities the
Board knew the plaintiff's mother's whereabouts.
<P>

170   	The Board appears to have had to approve the transfer to
Lutanda.  It may have foreshadowed its willingness and approval
as early as
February 1947.  In any event the Application for Admission to Lutanda Form (Vol
A1 - p7) had already been stamped with
the Chief Secretary's Stamp on 6 March
1947.  The transfer took place on 16 April 1947.
<P>

171   	The letter of 9 April attributes several reasons as to
why the transfer was requested.  First, the plaintiff child (aged
four)
appeared then to be a white person in appearance (in an Aboriginal Home for
aboriginal children).  Second, the home at Bomaderry
was subject to strain to
the extent it might close down.  Third, by removal of the "white children" (and
there were "four other white
children who should go to Homes with children of
their colour") the train on Bomaderry facilities would be removed as "well as
the
children being placed in a more suitable environment".  Fourth, Sister
Saville was leaving Bomaderry to get married.  She knew of
Lutanda, and
believed it would be in the plaintiff's interests to be transferred there.
<P>

172   	Taking the letter at face value at least from the point
of view of the standard and values of the time, the UAM was of the
view that
infants such as the plaintiff and four other children who were "white children"
would be in a better and more suitable
environment if they were not in an
Aboriginal Children's Home but in a Home for white children and in the case of
the "white child"
plaintiff in the white children's home at Lutanda.  In my
view in the case of the plaintiff, the Board was in clear agreement.  The
Board
too had its own reasons.  There was a policy of assimilation of Aborigines (to
which I have referred) and inter alia, reflected
in the duty imposed on the
Board under s 7(1)(a) of the Act.  Clearly it perceived it also to be in the
best interests of the plaintiff
to go to a Home.
<P>

173   	That said, there was the problem of transferring the
child who was then a ward to Lutanda, a home regarded as being one for
"white
children" under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  The plaintiff was a ward
of the Board and not a ward under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  Nor
did she ever become one under that Act.  Indeed, to be placed at Lutanda did
not required the plaintiff to be a ward under
either of the two Acts.  It seems
to me that an arrangement was implemented as follows:  The UAM suggested a
transfer which was pursued
by Sister Saville.  The Board agreed to the transfer
of its ward.  I would infer that the mother's signature to the application form
obtained before the transfer was required by Lutanda as a "formality" or
administrative requirement to permit the transfer to be
implemented.  In my
view this accords with the nature of the application form for admission and the
different handwritings appearing
upon it.  The form is a pro forma form of the
"Lutanda" Children's Home.  The date of the application is not revealed.  The
plaintiff's
mother's signature appears on it as applicant.  That is not
surprising for reasons stated.  It appears that Lutanda required it as
an
administrative matter, as formality to permit of admission to the facility.
The defendants argue that the application was by the
mother and provides
evidence that there has been a discharge of the plaintiff to the mother's care
under s 11D(1)(h) and/or possibly
(i) of the Act.  I do not accept this
submission.  I find as a fact that the child was still a ward at the time of
the transfer,
the mother's signature was no more than a formal requirement
probably sought by Lutanda for "administrative" purposes.
<P>

174   	My reasons for so finding are as follows.  There had been
the occasional visit(s) to the plaintiff at Bomaderry but there
is nothing to
indicate that between 1942 and 1947 the mother sought the restoration of the
plaintiff ward, or that she was in a position
to do so, or wanted to do so, or
was ready, willing and able to do so.  Next, by signing the form in 1947, the
mother knew her daughter
was still a ward.  There is nothing to indicate that
she wanted her restored to her custody.  Her signature to the document for
admission
of the child to Lutanda would support a contrary view.  By so
applying the mother was indicating she did not want the child restored
to her
care (nor had she on the evidence done so in the past).  She indicated she
wanted the child to go to Lutanda.  She did not
indicate she wanted to see the
child.
<P>

175   	A submission that the form evidenced a restoration of the
child ward (as I have found) or even that the child was not even
a ward) is
thus one I cannot accept in terms of reality.  The mother's role appears to
have been a limited "paper involvement" one
required at least by Lutanda to
permit of admission to its Home.  That such a view is the probable one is also
supported by several
other matters revealed by the application form itself.
The form is a pro forma of Lutanda.  It contained the following:
<P>

"Name of Guardian			Aborigines Welfare Board
<P>

Address					Bridge Street, Sydney
<P>

being Admission is sought        "To take the child from the
<P>

Association of Aborigines as she is a fair skinned child".
<P>

176   	The reference to guardian (whatever be the true legal
description of the Board) made it clear that the Board "represented"
(perhaps
even "mistakenly") it was such.  The stamp of the Board further supports the
representation.  I am satisfied that in reality
the transfer from Bomaderry
involved the Board.  Next, the reference to whether the applicant is "to
contribute fees" was deleted
suggesting like at Bomaderry no fees were to be
paid by the Board or otherwise.  In my view the wardship under the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  established in 1942 continued on at
Lutanda between 1947 and 1960.  What I have said is consistent with the mother
playing no more
than in effect a "notional" formal signatory role in 1947.  In
my view the form is not evidence that the wardship had ceased.
<P>

177   	In my view, the Board was involved in the placement of
the plaintiff at Lutanda, approved the transfer for the purpose expressed
in
the application, participated in its implementation for the primary reason "to
take [her] away from association of Aborigines
as she is a fair skinned child".
It is also a proper inference that the plaintiff was kept at Lutanda until 1960
for the same reason,
which accorded with the view that it was a more suitable
environment, and it was better for white children to be with children of
"their
own colour" and because no adoption or fostering option was in fact available.
The plaintiff was sent there or placed there
for the best of motives in
accordance with law (as it then was) and for what was perceived for her to be
the best protection and
advancement and for her own good.  If this had not been
done at the age of twelve she would, absent fostering or adoption (and there
is
no evidence foster parents were available), probably have been sent to the
Board's Aboriginal Home for girls at Cootamundra till
the age of fifteen, and
further remained as a ward till aged eighteen.
<P>

<b>The Wardship of the plaintiff</b>
<P>

178   	In my view the plaintiff remained a ward of the defendant
whilst at Lutanda from 1947 to 1960.  She became a ward in September
- October
1942 on application by her mother to the board to admit the plaintiff to the
control of the board.  The Board admitted
the child and thereafter she became a
ward.  The Board has a duty to provide for the custody and maintenance of the
children of aborigines:
 s 7(1)(c).  The plaintiff was such a child.  The duty
to educate was removed in 1940.  The Board also had a duty to exercise a
general
supervision and care over all aborigines: s 7(1)(e).  In addition, it
had an assimilation duty under s 7(1)(a) imposed by law.  It
was also its
policy at all material times in practice after 1940.  Under s11D (introduced in
1943 after the plaintiff's birth) the
Board was given authority to do a number
of things as referred to in that/these sections including in relation to
custody.  The Board
not only had control whilst the plaintiff was a ward, it
also had the authority to discharge a ward from "supervision and control"
or
direct the restoration of the ward to the care of his parent or another
person.
<P>

179   	When the plaintiff was transferred to Lutanda the child
remained under its control and supervision albeit that the "custody"
location
was changed from Bomaderry to Lutanda.  Her status as a ward was not changed.
She did not cease to be a ward till 1960.
 There is nothing to suggest that she
was involved in or visited the child at Lutanda (and in 1947 I infer by her
signing the admission
form that she knew where the child was being taken,
namely, to Lutanda) or took any interest in seeing or communicating with her
at
all until 1956.  Section 13(1) did not bar her from seeing the child or
communicating with the child at Lutanda since Lutanda
was not a Board home
within the meaning of s 11 of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>.
The fact that the mother did not visit or make contact or seek to make contact
in 1956 knowing that the child was at Lutanda, (having
signed a form in 1947 in
relation to her admission to Lutanda) also supports the view that the plaintiff
ward status continued despite
the physical location where the plaintiff was in
residence of custody.  Indeed, what the mother did from 1947 to 1956 is
consistent
with a view that she did not wish the child's status or relationship
viz the Board to change from what it had been between 1942 and
1947 (when the
child was at Bomaderry), nor did she wish to have the child returned to her
care.
<P>

180   	That the mother was not in a position to take back the
care of the child or seek to have the child restored to her care between
1947
and 1956 is an inference to be drawn from her letter to the Board (Mrs English
of the Board) in December 1956.  This appears
to be the same Inspector Mrs
English who was with the Board in 1939 and who presumably knew or knew of the
plaintiff and the plaintiff's
mother.  That letter when the plaintiff's mother
was aged (36 years) is a sad letter.  It reveals that the mother had no one to
turn
to other than Mrs English.  The plaintiff's mother had been in hospital
and could not afford to pay the bill.  She had no money and
was living with her
sister.  She was seeking a job at or near Condobolin with no success.  She also
sought help in obtaining a place
on the Mission at Murray Bridge.  The
plaintiff's mother was in no position to nor sought the care of the child (in
the same way
as she had since 1942 or between 1947 and 1956).  Physically and
financially she was not in a position to do so.
<P>

181   	Significantly the mother did ask Mrs English "could you
please tell me if I could go and visit my daughter as I would like
to see her
now".  Whether the mother had forgotten that she had consented to the child
going to Lutanda or whether she believed any
visit to her wherever she was
required the Board's permission is not clear.
<P>

182   	This is the only direct evidence from the mother of her
wishing to see her child (and not obtain its care) at Lutanda since
1942.  Even
though the plaintiff's mother visited her at Bomaderry, there is no evidence
that the plaintiff's mother sought to see
her daughter between 1947 and 1956.
She knew in 1947 that the child was going to Lutanda.  There is no evidence of
visiting or communication
(or seeking to visit or communicate) with the child
at Lutanda or of contacting Lutanda direct (before or after the letter of
December
1956).  Whatever be the reason I find that the mother did not visit or
communicate with the plaintiff at Lutanda between 1947 and
1960, it is
important to note that there was no reason in law preventing her from doing
so.
<P>

183   	Criticism had been made by Mr Hutley of Mrs English's
response of 28 December 1956 to the plaintiff's mother's letter.  The
mother's
request about going to visit her daughter was in fact not dealt with by Mrs
English.  I do not impute bad or improper motives.
 Indeed one can well
understand reasons why she would not have done so including the fact that the
plaintiff's mother had not seen
the plaintiff between 1947 and 1956 (nine
years).  Nevertheless, the letter was not followed up, and no subsequent
request or contact
appears on the evidence to have been made by the mother to
Lutanda or otherwise.
<P>

184   	In 1973 it appears the plaintiff met her mother for the
first time through Link-Up.  In 1982 she visited Cowra where her
mother's
family came from.
<P>

185   	In my view the plaintiff was a ward of the Board from
1942 living firstly at the Mission Children's Home, Bomaderry till
1947 and
thereafter living still as a ward at Lutanda from 1947 to 1960.  As a ward she
was under the control of the board.  She
was not fostered out after 1943 under
the 1943 legislation.  There is no evidence that any person sought to foster
her, wished to
foster her even on a temporary and not permanent basis.  There
is nothing to suggest that a suitable matching foster parent could
be found
between 1943 and 1960 for the plaintiff or at all.
<P>

<b>The Lutanda  Home</b>
<P>

186   	The plaintiff was a resident at Lutanda from 1947 to
1960.  In 1930 the Lutanda Children's Home (church denominational home)
was
established at Wentworth Falls.  It was established by two women a Miss F. M.
Dalwood (known affectionately as "Aunty" and a
trained school teacher) and Miss
E. Sangwell.  Miss Dalwood's brother was involved and associated in the
provision of the Dalwood
Health Home for Far West Children's Scheme.  Clearly
the Dalwoods were caring citizens with an interest in the welfare of children.
Mr Dalwood was involved in the purchase of the property "Rennail" and provided
part of the finance.  The first children coming into
its care were orphans.
Later it took in other children.  The home was thereafter co-ordinated by
people of the Plymouth Brethren
faith.  Through their influence, the Home
attached importance to religious values and training standards.  A missionary
vision was
maintained.
<P>

187   	In 1938, a Miss Atkinson from Tasmania joined the work.
An assembly was commenced in 1944 (she retired in late 70s).  In
1944 demands
of the Child Welfare Department for a partial reconstruction occurred.  Clearly
from the very early days the then Child
Welfare Department had some association
with the Home and an awareness of its activities and the like.  Consideration
was given to
building a new home at Pennant Hills.  In April 1947, Miss Dalwood
died.  Before doing so, at the express wish of Miss Dalwood and
at the
invitation of the Trustees of the Home, Mr Murray accepted the position of
Superintendent of the Home.  The new Home was opened
at Pennant Hills in 1950.
Shortly prior to 1950 Miss Sangwell and a Mr Ritchie were married and they
retired.  About this time the
Trust was reconstituted including a F. L. Sattler
and F. G. Sattler.  In 1955 the Home was incorporated as a "Non Profit
Company".
 Mr Murray resigned in 1955.  At that time Mrs Buxton (nee Parker) of
Tasmania became Matron for three years.  She was succeeded
by Mr Middleton
taking on the role of Superintendent and Mrs Middleton.  They brought in the
words of Mr Sattler "fresh drive and
vigour" to the Home.  On their withdrawal
in 1959 the position of Superintendent was filled by Mr Reid.
<P>

188   	During the many years of Lutanda personal service was
given by other employees with needs being often heavy and met with
some
difficulty.  They provided charitable services and were unpaid.  The Home was a
denominational institutional home and was supported
by volunteers from the
Plymouth Brethren.
<P>

189   	In 1950 the New Home was opened at Pennant Hills, a
separate building for boys was completed in 1958.
<P>

190   	For many years a band of ladies regularly visited Lutanda
with help in domestic duties.  Physical work was also done by helpers.
 The
work being performed at Lutanda was perceived to have been very much as the
implementation of the "Lords" work and support:
 "Lutanda Children's Home ...
1930-1960".
<P>

191   	The Lutanda Children's Home produced Annual reports.  The
1946 report referred to "drab and difficult days when faith was
tested", and to
the importance of religion and prayer.  Miss Dalwood emphasised the finding of
Christian homes and suitable employment
for boys and girls as they reached the
age of leaving Lutanda.  The activities of the school, the support from
outsiders was described.
<P>

192   	Although Lutanda was not a home within the meaning of s
11 of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>,  tendered in evidence was a
license dated in 1955 showing that Lutanda was a licensed placed within the
meaning of Part V11 and
s 28 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act 1939</u></b>.  A
license under that section signified the approval of the Home as a place
established for the reception of children under the
age of seven years "apart
from their mother or parent".  It was not an institution within the meaning of
s 49 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  Section 28 was not a recent
amendment.  I infer that Lutanda had been licensed as such a place as at 1947
and thereafter.  A child
in order to be placed in the home did not have to be a
ward within the meaning of s 4 of  the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  A
child could be placed there by a parent without the child being a ward.
<P>

193   	Mr Hutley accepts that Lutanda was a licensed place under
s 28 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>,  and that the Board had a power
to board out a ward with the person in charge of any charitable home or hostel
which would include
Lutanda.  This concession makes it unnecessary to strictly
speaking explore the status of Lutanda any further.  That the child was
properly placed there is not in dispute.  A child did not have to be a state
ward to become an resident of such a place.  It is not
suggested that the
plaintiff's status as an AWB ward (which I have found she was) changed to that
of a ward under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  Upon receipt of an
application for a license the Minister was required to cause an inquiry to be
made and for a report to be furnished.
 A register was to be kept of every
child that entered such a place pursuant to the license.  Section 30 provided
for inspection
of the place by an officer accompanied if necessary by a medical
officer to make an inquiry and report for the purposes of s 28 or
to ensure
compliance with conditions.  Provision was made for cancellation of the license
upon breach of the conditions.  A register
was to be kept of each child
received into care
<P>

194   	According to the  Child Welfare Department Report 1955
(tendered by the plaintiff) as at 30 June 1955 there were 285 licenses
in force
under s 28 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act 1939</u></b>.  The number of
licenses in force remained fairly static "particularly in regard to large
denominational homes".  The 1955 report
referred to District Officers regularly
visiting both private and denominational homes.  Lutanda was apparently a
denominational
home.
<P>

195   	Indeed, I would infer that Lutanda was licensed under the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  at the time of the plaintiff's arrival in 1947
and for some years beforehand.  It is hard to imagine the UAM (at Bomaderry)
recommending
as it did a transfer to Lutanda indeed even taking steps to secure
a place at Lutanda unless it was licensed under the Act.  Likewise,
it is hard
to imagine the AWB approving such a transfer of its ward other than to there
custody unless it was licensed.  The history
of Lutanda shows it having had
dealings with the  Child Welfare Department: and the reference in 1944 to
"demands by the Child Welfare
Department for a partial reconstruction ... of
Lutanda".  Exhibit A1 at 251 f-h, also contains an extract from a register kept
by
Lutanda - see also reference to  Regulation 46 of the  <b>Child Welfare
Regulations 1940</b>.
<P>

196   	It cannot be said that these statutory provisions and
licensing conditions are not of significance.  The defendant's in oral
submissions, made submissions to the effect that if "Lutanda" was "good enough"
to be licensed by the Child Welfare Department it
would have been good enough
for the AWB.  A great amount of time at trial has been devoted to the nature,
quality and content of
care at Lutanda where the staff (unpaid) attended to the
care of the children including the plaintiff.  On the evidence I find that
the
women carers did so with charity, trust, devotion, care and within constraints,
with appropriate discipline (measured by the
standard of the day), kindness and
affection.  The difficult task of bringing up the plaintiff and other children
whose parents could
not or would not or were unable to do so themselves was
accompanied by religious instruction, support, appropriate discipline and
dedication.
<P>

197   	The license conditions indicated what was required to be
done by a licensee, to comply with such.  They should not be ignored.
 The 1955
license conditions reveal that the license that was issued specified the number
of children who could be received under
the age of seven years `apart from
their mother or other parent'.  Conditions of the license included conditions
that each child
be cared for to the satisfaction of the Minister for Public
Instruction (who was also the Minister for Child Welfare) and that structures
and buildings were to be maintained to the Minister's satisfaction.
Additionally the person in charge was required to notify the
Director of Child
Welfare of any child meeting with an accident or becoming ill.  If urgent
medical care was required, the licensee
was requested to give it to the child.

<P>

198   	The number of children were controlled.  The staff of the
place had to be maintained at the number and with like qualifications
as those
specified in the license.  Staff numbers and qualifications could not vary and
the licensee had to satisfy the Minister
as to the appropriate staff numbers
and qualifications to obtain the license.  The person in charge of the Home
under the license
had to maintain the qualifications specified in the
applicable license.  This too was an important matter in terms of the standard
of care at Lutanda.
<P>

199   	These are, inter alia, the conditions on the license.  As
I have said, the plaintiff entered Lutanda as a ward and remained
there as a
ward of the Board but in the custody of Lutanda.  Lutanda was subject to the
statutory provisions and conditions stated
in their license.  I do not find,
qua Lutanda, that these license qualifications (probably on foot for many
years) were breached
at any time during the plaintiff's stay.  I infer the
conditions were complied with and that the relevant license conditions can
be
understood as objective proof of the conditions prevailing at Lutanda during
the time of the plaintiff's residence.
<P>

200   	Mr Hutley did not seek to make out a case based upon any
activity of the Child Welfare Department in respect of Lutanda.
 However, he
disputed the entitlement of Mr Barry QC to rely upon evidence of what the Child
Welfare Department did or did not do
in relation to its inspections of Lutanda.
He submitted that there was simply no inquiry as to the conduct of Child
Welfare Department.
 He argued that this situation arose from the way Mr Barry
had conducted his case including either the rejection or non-pressing
of
certain materials in affidavits of Miss Moorhouse (at T 344), Mr Sattler (at T
145) and Mrs Simpson (at T 263).  He argued that
Mr Barry should not be entitle
to rely upon what the Child Welfare Department did or did not do in relation to
Lutanda and further
particularly in terms of whether its activities could be
said to be a discharge of the duty of the Board to the plaintiff.  This
said,
it does not preclude me from referring to the Act, Regulations or conditions as
the case may be and other objective matters.
 In fact it was Mr Hutley who
tendered as part of his case the 1955 license or if I am mistaken, did not
object to its tender by
Mr Barry.  Further, no objection was taken by Mr Hutley
to certain evidence led in relation to Child Welfare Department inspections.
 I
find no difficulty in dealing with this evidence, since the place being
licensed, would presumably have been and was inspected.
 It would be surprising
if it was otherwise.
<P>

201   	Mrs Reid recalled that during her years (from about 1958
until the early 1960's) whilst at Lutanda she could recall inspectors
from the
Department of Child Welfare coming to Lutanda and observing the general
operations of that home and how it was running.
 She said that they did not
come to check on individual children and usually came when the children were at
school.  Miss Moorhouse
in her affidavit referred to a Child Welfare Department
Inspector attending Lutanda during the time that Miss Dalwood was at Lutanda
(1930-1947).  Mrs Middleton, who worked at Lutanda from 1956 until 1959,
recalled inspectors from an unknown government department
coming to inspect
Lutanda.  Miss Oxborrow had vague recollection of "welfare people" visiting
Lutanda.  In my view the evidence establishes
that Child Welfare Officers or
Inspectors probably visited Lutanda from time to time to carry out
inspections.
<P>

202   	I note also the plaintiff's concession that no complaint
is made by the plaintiff as to the adequacy or otherwise of the
physical
facilities at Lutanda.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Affidavit Evidence</b>
<P>

203   	The plaintiff gave evidence during the course of the
trial by way of an affidavit (dated 20 November 1996).  The plaintiff
affirmed
a second affidavit by way of reply on the 20 February 1998 in which she
reaffirms many of the previous allegations made
in her primary affidavit.  Her
affidavit evidence is wide-ranging and covers many aspects of her life: at
Bomaderry, at Lutanda and
after she had left the care of Lutanda.  It includes
allegations, and appears, on a fair reading to have been prepared with careful
consideration given to the matters referred to in it.
<P>

204   	The plaintiff was not able to and did not give oral
testimony on any of the matters contained in those affidavits, nor was
she
cross-examined on them.  It benefits therefore to begin by setting out the
plaintiff's affidavit evidence in some detail.
<P>

205   	The plaintiff deposes to the following.  The plaintiff
was born at the Crown Street's Women's Hospital in Sydney on the 13
September
1942 under the name of Eileen Williams.  Her mother as appears on the birth
certificate was Dora Williams, then aged 18
years.  The plaintiff's birth
certificate does not show the plaintiff's father's name.
<P>

206   	The plaintiff was informed and believed that a matter of
hours after her birth she was removed from her mother under the
instructions of
the Aboriginal Welfare Board and soon after placed at Bomaderry Children's Home
which was an institution run by the
United Aboriginal Mission.
<P>

207   	The plaintiff stayed at Bomaderry from 1942 until about
April 1947.  Whilst at Bomaderry, the plaintiff has memories of a
lady who came
to visit her. The lady wore a blue dress and a belt with a shiny belt buckle
that was "shiny like marquisate".  Later
in 1973, having been reunited with her
mother the plaintiff asked her mother whether she ever came to visit her at
Bomaderry or Lutanda.
 The plaintiff's mother replied:
<P>

"Yes, in Bomaderry.  I visited you there until one day I came back to visit you
and the Matron told me you were sick and had to
be taken to hospital in Sydney.
That was the last I saw of you at Bomaderry." 
<P>

208   	Though unsure of the number of times she saw this belt
buckle, the plaintiff has no other recollection of visits from her
mother while
she was at Bomaderry.  I accept that the plaintiff was told by her mother that
she visited her at Bomaderry and that
her mother did in fact visit her
there.
<P>

209   	On the 16 April 1947, the plaintiff was transferred to
Lutanda Children's Home, run by the Plymouth Brethren at Wentworth
Falls.  The
plaintiff remembers Sister Saville taking her to Wentworth Falls and that at
the time she was wearing a blue coat and
a tartan skirt.  The plaintiff gave
evidence that all the other children at Lutanda who were there at the same time
as the her were
of European descent and white complexion.  In her early years
at Lutanda, the plaintiff believed herself to be a "white child and
an orphan".
The plaintiff was never told whether or not she was an orphan but thought she
must be.
<P>

210   	At Lutanda, the plaintiff alleges that all the children
were given a number and that the workers at Lutanda called the children
by
their number and not their name.  The plaintiff states that she was known as
`Girl 4', having `Girl 4' sewn on her clothes and
towels.  The plaintiff
relates on one occasion of meeting a girl from Lutanda many years later at
University saying that "I could
only remember her as Girl 1.  She couldn't
remember my name either but knew I was Girl 4".
<P>

211   	The plaintiff alleges in her first affidavit that at
Lutanda she was treated differently from other children. One passage
deserves
to be set out in full:
<P>

"While at Lutanda I was treated differently from the other children.  I rarely
went to private homes for Christmas and other vacations.
 At Christmas time I
was often the only child left in Lutanda and one or more of the staff would
remain to look after me or occasionally
take me home.  There were three
Christmas times when Aunty Amy (one of the workers) took me to other workers'
homes; one was in Adelaide,
one in Tasmania and one in Melbourne.  Over the
lengthy period I was at Lutanda, there was a significant turnover of staff and
other
children.  I became one of the longest term residents of the institution.
I had no visitors except later on Aunty Leila visited me
once every few years.
I was never offered placement with other families.  I suffered from periodic
bouts of depression, particularly
at times when the family and friends of other
children came to see them.  I felt that I was unwanted and that nobody
cared."
<P>

212   	The plaintiff alleges that at Lutanda she was raised to
look down on Aborigines.  This attitude she says was re-enforced
through her
education and through visits to La Perouse "where we'd throw money and all the
Aboriginal kids would dive in to pick
it up...  The Brethren used to have
special collections of money for the Aborigines who `can't look after
themselves and can't keep
themselves clean'".  The plaintiff states that at the
time, as a result of this attitude, she used to cross the road so that she
didn't have to walk next to or close to Aboriginal people.
<P>

213   	The plaintiff deposes that religious practice at Lutanda
consisted of Bible lessons at least twice a day during the week
and all day on
Sunday as well as regular Bible quizzes.  The plaintiff alleges that punishment
often consisted of learning a chapter
of the Bible, standing in a corner and
reading a Bible for one and a half hours and writing passages from the Bible
over and over
again.  The importance and significance of religious instruction
is itself a matter recognised and countenanced for example by the
<b><u>Aboriginal Protection Act</u></b> at s 11A(2): see also the 1940 Public
Service Board Report and the Board Report of 30 June 1947, indicating the
importance of religion
to the child under the control of the AWB.
<P>

214   	The plaintiff recalls that she was not allowed to dance
or play cards as dancing was "of the world".  The plaintiff remembers
also that
she was not allowed to wear lipstick.  On one occasion she remembers being
caught for wearing lipstick. She states:
<P>

"I remember I was caught once with Ruth Christie when we had lipstick on.  I
must have been about thirteen or fourteen years old.
 We were coming home on
the train and one of the workers saw us.  I was punished for wearing lipstick.
My punishment was that I had
to stand in the dining hall in front of the other
children as they processed in, naked. I had to stand there for about half an
hour.
 Even now I can't wear lipstick because of that time."
<P>

215   	The plaintiff remembers being constantly "passed over"
for baptism by the Brethren.  While the other children were baptised
at around
13 or 14 years old and moved to the older girls home, the plaintiff remained in
the main home with the young girls and
finally, she states, moved to the boys
home where she alleges that she had to look after them.
<P>

216   	As part of the routine at Lutanda, the plaintiff states
that every two weeks she had kerosene rubbed into her scalp to help
protect
against lice.  When taking a bath, the plaintiff alleges that the girls had to
line up naked with towels draped over their
arms.  The girls were then helped
to bath by the senior girls in a high sided bath.  Forms of punishment alleged
by the plaintiff
as occurring at Lutanda included "food deprivation" and on
other occasions being forced to eat all her food as well as being denied
the
use of salt and pepper.
<P>

217   	The plaintiff further alleges various forms of
mistreatment at the hands of workers at Lutanda.  She alleges that Sister
Dalwood used to beat her when she was little:
<P>

"I can recall one occasion in particular when she took my pants and hit me with
a stick and I wet all over the floor.  I remember
that time as does my friend
Ruth Christie.  It was near my birthday and I was given some jacks by the Home.
Ruth, Phyllis and myself
hid in the lounge room and were playing jacks.
Someone heard us laughing.  I was the only one who got dragged out and beaten.
After
that they gave me morphine to shut me up."
<P>

218   	The plaintiff remembers that Miss Atkinson used to "lock
me in the broom cupboard at Wentworth Falls with the mops and brooms.
 I
couldn't reach the light switch."  The plaintiff recalls that this punishment
upset her more than the rest as she felt closer
to Miss Atkinson that to other
workers.  Miss Atkinson used to let the plaintiff brush her hair.
<P>

219   	The plaintiff further alleges offences by Mr Murray and
Miss Simpson that they used to inter alia, assault the plaintiff
physically.
The plaintiff alleges that Mr Murray used to assault the plaintiff using a
razor strap and that Miss Simpson used to
assault the plaintiff using a butter
pat.  It should be noted that in the extensive hospital records from 1962-5
that no history
of the plaintiff ever being subject to corporal or physical
violence or punishment is recorded, nor is there in Dr Cooley's report
of 1960
any reference to such a history.  Likewise the parole officers report of Miss
Barnett contains no such record.  The plaintiff
further alleges offences by
Miss Simpson in the following terms:
<P>

"There was another occasion when Mildred Simpson threw me up against the
bathroom wall and broke my wrist and collarbone.  I was
11 or 12 at that time,
that is 1953 or 54.  I still have a scar from the nail that we hung our washers
on.  I was taken to the Plymouth
Brethren doctor, Dr Lovell at his Beecroft
Practice.  That was my first introduction to morphine.  From there I was taken
to have
my arm set at Hornsby Hospital."
<P>

220   	The plaintiff further alleges offences by Mrs Buxton (nee
Parker) in the following terms:
<P>

"Margaret Buxton (Parker), a worker, punished me for cleaning my glasses on my
apron.  She didn't like me cleaning my glasses on
my apron as it scratched the
glass and scrunched my apron.  Several times she made me stand in the corner
for hours facing the wall
with my glasses in my hands and both hands behind my
back.  She also made me hold my glasses above my head on other occasions for
4-5 hours."
<P>

221   	The plaintiff further alleges that she was often punished
by being made to clean the bathroom with a tooth brush.
<P>

222   	The plaintiff makes two primary allegations of sexual
abuse which are set out in terms:
<P>

"One of the Pennant Hills Primary School teacher used to tell me to be at the
school sometimes at 7:00pm at night and he used to
take me for drives.  He was
interested in me and he would sexually abuse me. I remember coming back late
one night after driving
and being caught coming in.  I got a horrendous beating
with both the butter pat and strap used. I could hardly walk afterwards.
 I
just remember being so small and wanting to run up to my hiding place."
<P>

223   	The second allegation is set out in the following
terms:
<P>

"Mr Reid was the superintendent after Mr Middleton.  When Mr Reid came to
Lutanda the superintendent's quarters moved from being
upstairs in the main
home to being in a cottage through the vegetable garden, up at the back of the
property.  Mr Reid never corporally
punished me.  He only ever sexually abused
me.  From what I can remember it happened about four times.  Always in the
storeroom.
 He used to ask me to "help carry something", usually biscuits.
Once we were in the storeroom, he sodomised me with hands and his
penis."
<P>

224   	The plaintiff admits to having run away from Lutanda on a
number of occasions because she was unhappy.  The first occasion
that it
occurred was when she was in primary school, around about sixth class which
would have been in 1953-4.  On one occasion,
when the plaintiff was 13-4, she
ran away after having spent the afternoon with a boy who was a friend of hers.
The plaintiff alleges
that as punishment for running away she was put in
isolation for a week.  On this occasion she states:
<P>

"That's when I had to write `God is love' thousands and thousands of times.
Every now and then Mrs Middleton, the Matron, would
come in to see if I had
repented.  In her view I hadn't and I'd have to keep writing.  It was at that
time that she said to me "You
have mud in your veins".  She also said things
about my mother.  Something like, "You're as bad as your mother" and something
about
my mother being "...drunk in the gutter".  I cut my veins after that to
see if there was mud in there like she said.  I still remember
the shock and
the look I must have had on my face when she told me.  From time to time after
this incident, during my stay at Lutanda
and on other occasions I cut myself to
see whether the colour of my blood was different form that of the other
children at the home."
<P>

225   	The plaintiff alleges further occasions when she ran away
because she found out that she was Aboriginal and because of her
up-bringing
felt that her Aboriginal blood made her bad.  On some occasions it seems, the
plaintiff attended at court for what the
plaintiff says were occasions when she
was charged with "Neglect, uncontrollable and exposed to moral danger."  On
each of these
occasion she alleges that she was sent back to Lutanda and got a
hiding and was put in isolation.
<P>

226   	The plaintiff alleges that after she left school she had
to look after the boys aged between 8-16 years old.  The plaintiff
alleges that
she was the victim of a gang rape.  She puts the allegation against certain
unnamed boys in the following terms:
<P>

"I hated looking after those boys.  They hurt me.  There were two older boys
who used to hurt me sexually.  The other boys would
hold me down.  It would
take about ten of them to hold me down.  The workers were all up in the main
house.  I never told anyone
except Aunty Leila (Miss Saville)."
<P>

227   	The plaintiff remembers that her only visitors during
those years at Lutanda were Aunty Leila (Miss Saville) and Uncle Sid
who kept
some contact with her.  After the plaintiff was discharged from Lutanda on 31
July 1960, the plaintiff became employed at
Parramatta District Hospital.  She
worked there for a period of months but no more than sixteen months.  The
plaintiff later worked
at Bethlehem Nurses Club and at the Lorna Hodgkinson
Centre as a nurses aide.
<P>

228   	The plaintiff sets out her history after Lutanda in the
following terms in her first affidavit:
<P>

"Soon after leaving Lutanda, I started associating with a lot of homeless
people.  I lived in many different places, mainly at the
Cross.  I started
abusing various substances and became involved in various criminal activities
and was convicted.  I got pulled
into a cult down at Kings Cross and did some
awful things through that.  A lot of people I was spending time with were
involved in
the cult also. The criminal offences I was convicted of are as
follows:  Offensive Behaviour 2.12.60, Offensive Behaviour 17.1.61,
Larceny in
a Dwelling (Victoria) 3.3.61, Attempted Bestiality 28.4.61.  As a result of the
last charge, I was in jail from 28 March
1961 until 2 November 1961.  Between
March 1962 and May 1965 I was admitted to Macquarie and Gladesville Psychiatric
Hospitals on
numerous occasions.  From 1966-68 I lived in Papua New Guinea with
Orest.
<P>

In my medical records from Macquarie Hospital, the entry dated 24.6.63 stated
that  "At the home she would deliberately do a misdemeanour
so that a privilege
she desired would be denied her. Wants continual punishment..."  I do not
recall ever doing things deliberately
wrong for punishment.  I may have done
things for attention.  Nothing I ever did pleased them at Lutanda.
<P>

From August to around October 1963 I was at Gladesville Hospital.  I realised
during that time that they were priming me up for
shock treatment so I shot
through and one of the nurses arranged for me to get a job at Rainbow Lodge at
Kurrajong."
<P>

229   	The reference in the above passage to homeless people is
not entirely accurate.  There is evidence of the plaintiff's involvement
with
`bad' company including persons who were criminals and those who participated
in black mass paganism including with Roslyn Norton:
see the Parole Report of
Miss Barnett dated 1 March 1962 and see also the Hospital Records as well as
the plaintiff's criminal records
in relation to the 1960 offence.
<P>

230   	The plaintiff's first daughter, Julie-Anne was born on 4
September 1962 while the plaintiff was a patient at Macquarie Psychiatric
Hospital.  Julie-Anne was taken away from the plaintiff at the end of July 1963
though the plaintiff doesn't say by whom.  The plaintiff
states that as a
result of this she became extremely depressed and cut her wrists.
<P>

231   	The plaintiff's second daughter, Rachel, was born on 13
June 1967 in Papua New Guinea.  The plaintiff returned with Rachel
to Australia
in November 1967 "after her father deserted us".  At times the plaintiff states
that she placed Rachel in the care of
Lutanda.  The plaintiff's son Ben was
born on 7 August 1973.  While at Lutanda, the plaintiff's mother did not visit
her.
<P>

232   	That was the extent of the plaintiff's primary affidavit
evidence.
<P>

<b><u>Submissions as to the effect of the Plaintiff's Evidence</u>:</b>
<P>

233   	The nature of the plaintiff's evidence reveals a number
of very serious allegations against the members and staff at Lutanda.
 The
plaintiff relies on these allegations for the purposes of her case against the
AWB.  A number of submissions were put to the
court on the use to be made of
these allegations in the plaintiff's case against the AWB.  It is necessary to
set out some of these
submissions since they seriously touch upon her
reliability and credibility as a witness.
<P>

234   	It should be noted that counsel for the plaintiff (at T
40) did not preface the reading of the plaintiff's affidavit with
any comment
as to its objective truth or otherwise.  Specifically, counsel did not stress
that the plaintiff's evidence or any part
of it to be read by affidavit, was
not to be relied upon as being objectively true.  Indeed her affidavits were
taken into account
by the experts called by the plaintiff and treated by them
as being objectively true.
<P>

235   	In her written submissions to the court, the plaintiff
dealt with the various allegations made in her affidavit evidence
in two
places.  Firstly, the plaintiff made primary written submissions in which she
addresses in a general way, the use to be made
of  her evidence.  Secondly, the
plaintiff prepared written submissions in reply in which the plaintiff deals
with the use to be
made of several specific allegations made in her affidavit
evidence.  It might be helpful to start with the submissions made in reply
first.
<P>

236   	The plaintiff submits (at p 26 of her submissions in
reply) that allegations of sexual abuse including allegations of sodomy
against
a particular male at Lutanda and allegations of gang rape by boys at Lutanda
cannot be pressed as the onus in  <b><u>Briginshaw  v  Briginshaw</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336</a> cannot be met:
<P>

"As the plaintiff bears the onus of proving that the events occurred and as the
plaintiff in these circumstances cannot discharge
the onus, the plaintiff
cannot properly submit that the Court can find that the incidents occurred."
<P>

237   	In relation to the allegation that the plaintiff was made
to stand naked in the dining room for having been caught wearing
lipstick, Mr
Hutley for the plaintiff notes (at p 28 of the submissions in reply):
<P>

"The inherent implausibility of the plaintiff's evidence about standing in the
dining hall naked is powerful evidence of her disturbed
mind.  Were she
consciously dissembling she is unlikely to have given evidence which is
obviously incredible."
<P>

238   	Turning to her principle submissions, the plaintiff notes
(at p 81) that there are significant disparities between the plaintiff's
evidence and that of the defendants' lay witnesses.  These disparities, the
plaintiff submitted, are to be explained on the basis
of:
<P>

"(a)	the plaintiff's lack of attachment;
<P>

(b)	the plaintiff's age at which the incidents which she describes 
<P>

occurred; and
<P>

(c)	her psychiatric disturbance".
<P>

239   	It is on this basis that the plaintiff submits that her
evidence should be "taken into account in assessing the plaintiff's
case".  At
page 81 of her submissions, the plaintiff states that:
<P>

"The fact that much of her evidence is "unreliable" should not lead the Court
to infer that she is lying or that what is described
is not what she genuinely
believes to have occurred.  Her [the plaintiff's] florid descriptions of
punishment and abuse are themselves
symptoms of a disorder."
<P>

240   	At page 83 of her submissions she continues:
<P>

"The plaintiff gives florid, exaggerated and, at times, objectively untrue
descriptions of punishment to which she was subjected
(<u>throughout her
affidavit of 20 November 1996</u>) whereas the other children at Lutanda who
were subjected to the same strict moral code respond differently." [my
emphasis]
<P>

241   	Having detailed the plaintiff's psychological condition
leading up to the giving of her evidence, it is submitted by Counsel
(at p 86
of her submissions) that:
<P>

"If the factors referred to above are taken into account, the plaintiff's
affidavit can properly be seen as a grossly distorted
view of reality.  Dr
Waters was of the opinion that at the time she gave the history to him "she
believed that that was the truth"
(tr. 86 lines 42-47).  The extent of the
distortions are indicative of the extent to which the plaintiff was suffering
from attachment
disorder."
<P>

242   	I assume here that the reference to attachment disorder
refers to the plaintiff's assertion that she was suffering from an
attachment
disorder at the time the events complained of occurred and it is this
attachment disorder and not the antecedent personality
disorder that is the
cause of these "distortions".  Accordingly the plaintiff lists the following as
examples of distortions put
forward as being a result of her attachment
disorder:
<P>

(i)	the allegation (at p 86 of her submissions) that she was required by Mrs
Buxton to stand in the corner for several hours as
punishment for cleaning her
glasses and the allegation that she was made to stand holding the glasses above
her head for 4-5 hours.
<P>

(ii)	the allegation (at p 86 of her submissions) that the plaintiff was known
by a number and not a name.
<P>

(iii)	the allegation (at p 87 of her submissions) relating to Miss Simpson
breaking her wrist and collar bone.
<P>

(iv)	 the allegation relating to being made to stand naked in the dining hall
for wearing lipstick.  This is described by the plaintiff
in submissions (at p
87) as "inherently and obviously implausible"
<P>

(v)	the allegation (at p 88 of her submissions) that the plaintiff was given
morphine to shut her up after receiving a beating was
called "incorrect".
<P>

243   	The principal submission of the plaintiff is that these
allegations, though not objectively true, represent and are evidence
of a
distorted recollection of events which are resultant from her suffering from an
alleged order of attachment at the time of the
occurrence of the events the
subject of her evidence.  I find there was no such disorder of attachment.
Next, the concessions made
in the preceding submissions are significant indeed.
The concessions made about the proper approach to the plaintiff's evidence,
that it was "unreliable" and it represents a distortion of the objective truth
of the circumstances of the plaintiff's youth at Lutanda,
and that the
plaintiff presents often "objectively untrue" and "exaggerated allegations
throughout her affidavit" reflect, in my
opinion, deleteriously on the
reliability and credibility of her evidence generally and in particular
respects.  While the plaintiff's
concessions go only to a number of specific
assertions in her evidence, for reasons I will expand on, I am convinced that
the force
of all these submissions also has a further consequence that the
plaintiff's evidence should be read with care.  The plaintiff's
Counsel has
addressed many significant specific allegations of the plaintiff conceding at
the end of the day and in the face of contradictory
evidence from Lutanda
witnesses which I accept, that they are not evidence of the objective truth of
Lutanda.  However the consequences
of the her concessions as to the use of her
evidence stretch beyond merely those specific concessions.  In my view they
adversely
affect her reliability and credibility save in respect of certain
matters later identified by me.
<P>

244   	During the course of the defendants' oral submissions I
put a number of questions to the plaintiff's counsel as to the reliance
placed
by the plaintiff on her affidavit evidence.  The following exchange is recorded
(at T 721-2) with Miss Adamson for the plaintiff
regarding the plaintiff's
characterisation of Lutanda as a "cruel and violent place":
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		I tell you the plaintiff will be hard-pressed to make good
that claim.  To the extent that it is so asserted that there was a numbers
regime I think there is difficulties on the evidence of the plaintiff there.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		Yes, for a person such as James Frame and many of the
witnesses you have see it was obviously a very happy caring place.  But your
Honour has seen what we have put in writing as to the effect on the
plaintiff.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Maybe her perception is absolutely totally wrong and she is
not reliable and credible on that at all for reasons which she stated.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		Her perception is not put forward in that regard as evidence
of the objective truth of Lutanda.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		The objective truth seems to be almost one way, or at least
in many respects.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		<u>All the Crown witnesses thought it was a lovely place and
felt that they were part of a family when they were there, that's correct</u>.
[my emphasis]
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Do you still make assertions of allegation of sexual
abuse?
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		In light of submissions we have put as to the plaintiff's
credibility we can't put those and we don't.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Indeed I think that is the most proper attitude, the
allegations of sexual abuse just cannot run.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		Certainly not in light of the expert evidence.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		You concede that.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b> 	Yes, your Honour.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		Indeed you have already conceded that. It is important when
having this discussion that sometimes the concession be heard by many
so there
can be no doubt to the form of the content of the concession and what is
conceded ie: that you don't maintain the allegation
of sexual abuse.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		No, your Honour."
<P>

245   	Again (at T 726), counsel for the plaintiff, Miss
Adamson, clarified this concession by saying that "the allegations of sexual
abuse" included all the allegations of sexual abuse asserted or alleged by the
plaintiff in evidence:
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		So the allegations of sodomy, gang rape and sexual
misconduct on the part of staff members, the sexual misconduct of staff
members,
they are not pressed any longer in terms of having occurred.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		That's right."
<P>

246   	Subsequent to this, counsel for the plaintiff was
singularly asked whether the plaintiff pressed the allegation relating
to
plaintiff being made to stand naked in the dining hall.  Miss Adamson, counsel
for the plaintiff replied:
<P>

"<b>ADAMSON:</b>		No, that is not pressed and that is in our written
submissions.  I don't know that I wish to say any more than what appears in the
written submissions.
<P>

<b>HIS</b> <b>HONOUR:</b>		I wouldn't accept her on that.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>		No it is obviously completely implausible and incredible and
it is not put forward by the plaintiff by her counsel as being objective
truth."
<P>

247   	Counsel for the plaintiff was singularly asked whether
they pressed the allegation relating to the use of kerosene for the
delousing
of hair and about the allegation that the plaintiff was injected with morphine
to sedate her.  Counsel conceded similarly
that neither was relied on as
objectively true.
<P>

248   	One final exchange is worth setting out between myself
and Mr Hutley for the plaintiff.  In oral submissions in reply the
following
exchange is recorded (at T 785):
<P>

"<b>HUTLEY</b>:		I am looking at the discussion between your Honour and my
learned junior at page 721 and 722 and I don't think it is any different
with
what I am putting to your Honour.
<P>

What we say is that I cannot and do not put that your Honour could find that
some of the sexual matters had to do with sexual assaults.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:	</b>	Let us hear the way you put it.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>		Some of the matters which were the subject of contest from
witnesses who denied specifically my client's version I would have thought
likely to conclude that my client's version is wrong.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:	</b>	An untruth?
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>		Untruth in the sense of being false, not perjured."
<P>

249   	In both their written and in their oral submissions,
counsel for the plaintiff concede that the plaintiff's evidence as to
various
allegations made in respect of life at Lutanda are not relied on as being to
use their words, "objectively true".  They are
not put as being objectively
true and, indeed, are conceded as being objectively untrue.  Some matters, as
are revealed above, are
the subject of specific concessions as being untrue,
while in general all matters are submitted as being in some sense distorted
by
the plaintiff's medical condition.  They are relied on instead as being
evidence of an attachment disorder suffered by the plaintiff
at the time the
events the subject of her recollection, occurred.  This attachment disorder, it
is submitted was subsequently to
develop into a borderline personality disorder
in the plaintiff's teens and later.  In this respect much of the plaintiff's
evidence
is affected by the plaintiff's concessions.  I reject each of these
submissions.
<P>

250   	It is appropriate to note that these concessions by the
plaintiff are made in respect of events that occurred over 40 years
ago.  The
plaintiff has had considerable latitude during the trial to tender evidence in
support of her case.  She has had every
opportunity to provide evidence for her
claims and I have taken an inclusive attitude to all evidence tendered. In this
respect it
is appropriate to note that, in relation to the allegations of
sexual abuse, despite a number of visits by the plaintiff to Dr Waters
between
July 1991 and 1997, the first occasion of there being recorded allegations of
sexual abuse was in October 1997.  Dr Waters
gave evidence that prior to that
time the issue had not been raised even though it was usually something about
which questions would
have been asked by a psychiatrist in obtaining a history.
Additionally, no allegations of sexual abuse were made during the eight
or so
visits to North Ryde Centre between 1962 and 1965.  This was despite every
opportunity to talk about it (see the extensive
notes from the hospital).
<P>

251   	In respect of the discipline and punishment of the
plaintiff at Lutanda, a relevant  history appears in the nurses notes
at North
Ryde in June 1963.  The entry shows that the plaintiff reported that punishment
at Lutanda consisted of learning a chapter
of the Bible, standing in the corner
and reading the Bible and the reduction of privileges.  At no time does she
make mention of
corporal punishment.
<P>

252   	In respect of the care received by the plaintiff at
Lutanda, the plaintiff told her parole officer, Miss Barnett, recorded
in her
report dated 1 March 1962, that she received good physical care but that the
rather rigid behavioural requirements and sharp
curtailment of school
activities to a limited area motivated her from the age of twelve to run away
from the home on several occasions.
 Miss Barnett considered (at p 3) that the
plaintiff showed a marked absence of socially accepted moral standards, showed
strong
resentment towards any form of authority and had mistrust and bitterness
towards the world which she believed had let her down. 
The plaintiff made none
of the serious allegations to Miss Barnett that she made throughout her
affidavit.  She had every opportunity
to do so.  Nor did she make any of these
allegations when she saw Dr Cooley from the Child Guidance Clinic in 1960.
Again, she had
every opportunity to do so.  I also reject the plaintiff's claim
that she received corporal punishment at Lutanda.
<P>

253   	The plaintiff cannot, by such a forensic submission,
avoid the result that in consequence of these concessions, the Court
should
receive the plaintiff's evidence with significant doubt as to its reliability
and give such weight to it as in the circumstances
is appropriate.  I turn to
my findings on the plaintiff's credit.
<P>

<b><u>Findings in Respect of the Plaintiff's Evidence:</u></b>
<P>

254   	The plaintiff's submissions accept that there are
significant disparities between the plaintiff's evidence on the one hand
and
that of the defendants' lay witnesses on the other.  These disparities between
the plaintiff's recollection of events at Lutanda
and the objective reality of
the situation are sought to be explained on the basis of the three matters
mentioned in submissions,
namely:
<P>

(a)	the plaintiff's lack of attachment
<P>

(b)	the plaintiff's age at which the events she described occurred;
<P>

and
<P>

c)	her psychiatric disturbance.
<P>

255   	The plaintiff goes on to submit that these matters should
be taken into account when assessing the plaintiff's evidence.
 Indeed they
have been considered by me.  In considering them I have come to the conclusion
that they do not have the effect urged
for by the plaintiff and I reject the
plaintiff's submissions.
<P>

256   	The plaintiff gave a lengthy history of her upbringing
and psychological health to Dr Waters in July 1991.  At that time
the
preparation of this case appears to have been on foot. Dr Waters, whose
evidence has caused me concern, knew he was being brought
in to assess the
plaintiff in connection with what he thought was a "stolen generations" test
case.  He said in cross-examination
(at T 94) that he had read newspaper
reports about this being one of the first "stolen generations" cases.  Dr
Waters gave evidence
(at T 86) that he did not really believe that the
plaintiff's evidence was the product of delusions.  While some of the
plaintiff's
history may have suffered from vagaries of memory, he said that he
believed that the history given by the plaintiff was what she
believed to be
the truth at the time it was given.
<P>

257   	It was on the basis of the substance of this history that
the plaintiff affirmed the contents of an affidavit dated 20 November
1996
which has already been set out in considerable detail.  There is nothing to
suggest that the plaintiff did not know what she
was affirming in the 15 page
affidavit.  Her evidence was well considered and detailed, and what was
asserted appears, as I have
said, to have been carefully asserted.  These same
remarks, in my view, apply a fortiori in respect of her further affidavit in
reply
affirmed on the 20 February 1998.  That affidavit, in terms, affirms the
allegations and evidence given in her principal affidavit.
 The affirmation of
her evidence in her second affidavit is considered affirmation, with the
plaintiff having given consideration
to the various rebuttal affidavit evidence
of the defendants' lay witnesses.
<P>

258   	I do not accept that the plaintiff can seek to avoid the
adverse consequences of incorrect assertions of such a considered
nature.  The
affirming of incorrect allegations in this case by the plaintiff adversely
impacts upon her credibility and reliability
both generally and in particular
respects.  Further, this consequence cannot be avoided by the submission that
the incorrect assertions
are to be seen as a product of her illness and indeed
further proof of her illness.  First she has relied upon the allegations as
objectively true.  When proved otherwise she seeks to avoid the consequences of
their rejection by the inventive argument that the
unproved allegations are a
product of a mental illness and or proof of it.  I reject this forensic
submission.  Further, even were
there to be alternatively a finding that the
allegations are the product of a disorder (which as I have said I do not find),
such
would in any event, cast doubt upon the reliability of the plaintiff's
evidence.
<P>

259   	I specifically find that these distortions were not a
product of an alleged attachment disorder (which she did not have).
 In so far
as these conceded allegations are not correct or objectively true in the
circumstances, the plaintiff cannot escape the
consequences of such a finding
in turn affecting her credibility and reliability generally.  Some of those
against whom many of these
serious allegations have been made, as the evidence
shows, are deceased or elderly persons.  In the circumstances, they and Lutanda
are entitled to a finding that preserves their good names and reputations.
<P>

260   	The plaintiff has further sought to explain away some of
these serious allegations by alternatively suggesting that if not
the product
of her borderline personality disorder, they are not pressed as true because
they were not proved to the level of the
 <b><u>Briginshaw</u></b>  (supra)
standards. I reject that attempt by the plaintiff to explain away the
"untruths" which I find impact on her credibility
and reliability.
<P>

261   	I do not find that the plaintiff lied in respect of these
allegations.  The fact that a witness is unreliable does not give
rise to a
view that a witness is lying.  As I have said, there is a distinction between
rejection or evidence of a person and a positive
finding that a person
deliberately lied:  <b><u>Smith  v  NSW Bar Association</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176 CLR
256</a> at 268-9.  I have not had the opportunity of seeing or hearing the
plaintiff as she was unable to give evidence at the trial.  The
fact that, on
the plaintiff's concessions, much of the plaintiff's evidence in respect of
Lutanda is "unreliable" does not lead to
the inference she was lying.  It
rather leads merely to the conclusion that in the circumstances what is
conceded to be objectively
untrue is not to be found as being untrue due to any
one or more of the matters submitted by the plaintiff as the source of her
distorted
memory, namely her lack of attachment, her young age at the time the
events complained of occurred or any alleged psychiatric or
psychological
disturbance.  Not having seen or heard the plaintiff, the principles in
<b><u>Abalos  v  Australian Postal Commission</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 167</a> and

demeanour do not arise.
<P>

262   	I stress again that the concessions made by the plaintiff
were in respect of several but not all of the plaintiff's evidence.
 Much of
the plaintiff's affidavit stands to be considered against the background of the
whole of the evidence and I will turn to
consider that in due course.
Notwithstanding this, my conclusion is that the plaintiff's evidence generally,
even where not openly
conceded as being untrue, should be treated with care.  I
accept the submission of the defendants that the plaintiff's evidence should
be
looked at with some care, particularly when it is not supported by other
evidence.  The plaintiff (at T 726) conceded that, if
I found that the
allegations of sodomy, gang rape and sexual misconduct, having not been pressed
as having occurred, were not the
product of a disordered mind, then the
affirming of those allegations could be utilised against her in respect of her
credit and
reliability.  Since I find that they were not a product of a
disordered mind, I find that these allegations reflect adversely on
the
plaintiff's credit and reliability including as a historian so far as she is a
historian giving a history to be relied upon as
both her evidence and by the
medico-legal experts qualified by her to give evidence.  That is my finding on
the plaintiff's evidence.
<P>

263   	Having said that, this does not alter my acceptance of
the plaintiff's history as to her conception and parentage relayed
to her by
her mother and repeated to Dr Waters in 1991 and reflected in her affidavit.
Nor does it alter my acceptance of the plaintiff's
memory of life at Bomaderry
as recorded in Dr Waters history and reflected in part in her affidavit or as
to her dealings with Sister
Saville and later Miss Atkinson.  I also accept her
history that her mother did visit her from time to time at Bomaderry, which is
supported by her affidavit claim that when she met her mother, her mother said
she had visited her at Bomaderry.
<P>

<b><u>The Lutanda Witnesses:</u></b>
<P>

264   	A large quantity of evidence was tendered throughout the
course of the trial both by the plaintiff and the defendants relating
to the
plaintiff's upbringing while she was at the homes, Bomaderry and Lutanda.  That
evidence consisted of affidavit evidence and
oral evidence in some cases.  Some
witnesses, because of age or distance, were unable to attend and their
affidavits were read in
the proceedings.  Many volumes of material, affidavit
and otherwise, were admitted into evidence in respect of these matters.
Included
in the evidence were numerous affidavits sworn by witnesses
particularly those involved with plaintiff whilst she was at Lutanda.
<P>

265   	The affidavit evidence can be broadly separated into two
categories.  The first category of evidence is the evidence of the
surviving
adult members of the staff at Lutanda.  The second category of evidence is
evidence that comes from children who are contemporaries
of the plaintiff and
who, with the exception of one witness, Ms Christie, on whom the plaintiff
relies, were all resident at Lutanda
during all or some of the period of the
plaintiff's care.
<P>

266   	It is appropriate to set out some of the history of those
who gave evidence.  The plaintiff was admitted to Lutanda on 16
April 1947.  At
that time Miss Dalwood was in charge of Lutanda and worked as Matron.  After
her death in 1950, Mr Murray assumed
the role of Superintendent at Lutanda,
having done so at the specific request of Miss Dalwood just prior to her death.
Mr Murray
remained the Superintendent until replaced by Mr Middleton in 1956.
Mr Middleton in turn held that position until 1959 when he was
replaced by Mr
Reid.  The plaintiff was discharged on the 31 July 1960.
<P>

267   	Miss Dalwood undertook in addition to the role of
Superintendent, the position of Matron from the time of the founding of
Lutanda
again until her death in 1950.  Mrs Buxton (nee Parker) acted as Matron from
1953-6 having prior to that, worked at Lutanda
as a housekeeper and as a carer
for the girls.  Evidence was given, which I accept, to the effect that Mrs
Buxton was a qualified
nurse. Evidence given in cross examination by Mrs Buxton
was that she held three certificates in nursing at the time she was Matron
at
Lutanda, being general, midwifery and infant welfare certificates.  Mrs
Middleton was Matron between 1956-9 during the period
in which her husband was
Superintendent.  Evidence was given, which I accept, to the effect that Mrs
Middleton was a registered nurse
during the period she served as Matron at
Lutanda.  Both Mrs Middleton and Mrs Buxton gave evidence by way of affidavit
and in oral
testimony.
<P>

268   	At this point I should make some brief comments on the
witnesses Mrs Buxton and Mrs Middleton.  These two witnesses, particularly,
on
the plaintiff's case, were the subject of "strong" submissions as to their lack
of reliability.  The plaintiff made submissions
(at p 103 of their written
submissions) that the staff at Lutanda were, inter alia, prejudiced by racial
bigotry, at least in the
case of Mrs Middleton and prejudiced by religious
beliefs which led them to "pseudo solutions" such as prayer, rather than
psychiatric
treatment.  I reject this submission that these witnesses or any
others were prejudiced in their attitude to the plaintiff because
of racial
bigotry or otherwise.  I further reject the submission in respect of their
being a preference of "pseudo solutions" as
being totally unfounded.  I will
return to the particulars of the contest of credit with Mrs Middleton later.
It need only be said
here that I have had an extended opportunity of hearing
and seeing these two witnesses, factors which I take into account in assessing
their evidence.  They were the subject of challenging and extensive
cross-examination.  They were cross-examined comprehensively
about their
attitudes and recollections and nothing I have seen leads me to disbelieve
their evidence or to make a finding such as
the one submitted. I feel that I
can safely rely on their evidence.
<P>

269   	Other carers also gave evidence.  Mrs Milton worked at
Lutanda from 1944-48 in performing general household work and in looking
after
the girls.  Mrs Hancock worked at Lutanda looking after the care of the boys
from about 1953 to 1955, part of that time also
being spent as the cook at
Lutanda.  Mrs Talbot worked at Lutanda from July 1953 to November 1957.
Initially she was in charge of
the boys group but due to her previous
experience in England with toddlers and babies she soon became responsible for
seven young
children.  Miss Simpson was a live-in worker in Lutanda from
December 1956 to December 1965 working in the kitchen and looking after
the
boys then later, the younger girls.  She returned in 1956, then with her
husband to work as a cook for a short period.  These
four witnesses gave
evidence at trial by way of affidavit and all but Mrs Talbot gave oral
evidence.  I accept these witnesses.
<P>

270   	In addition to these workers is the evidence of Lucy
Moorhouse.  Miss Moorhouse was placed into the care of Lutanda in January
1935
as a result of crippling arthritis suffered by her mother.  She remained at
Lutanda till she left in 1944 to pursue work.  While
working away from Lutanda
she made a habit of paying visits each Sunday to Lutanda and thereby maintained
a good knowledge of the
work and operation of the Home.  In 1954 Miss Moorhouse
returned for a period of eight months to serve in caring for the children
and
to relieve some of the staff.  The evidence showed that at that time she was a
trained nurse.  She worked, in part, in assisting
Mrs Buxton with the care of
the girls.  Miss Moorhouse has subsequent to her time spent at Lutanda prepared
documentation setting
out the history of Lutanda including a history of
relevant period of the plaintiff's residence.  Miss Moorhouse gave evidence by
way of affidavit and by way of oral testimony.  In the delivering of her
evidence Miss Moorhouse proved to be a highly credible witness
and a genuinely
compassionate lady.  Her accurate memory and clear recollection was
demonstrated in oral evidence by her ability
to accurately recall the detailed
history of the relevant period and the people who lived at Lutanda during that
time, some forty
years ago.  Her evidence is credible and reliable and I am
satisfied that I can safely rely on it and I accept it.
<P>

271   	Much has been said during the course of this trial and in
submissions about the women who worked at Lutanda and who undertook
the care of
the plaintiff. In appraising these witnesses, in my estimation from what I have
seen and heard of them, they appeared
to me under examination and
cross-examination as caring, devoted, considerate, religious and charitable
women.  They were unpaid
or relatively unpaid workers, dedicated to their roles
and to the task of bringing up other people's children in an institutional
environment with all the attendant problems arising from that situation.  In
many cases they had practical training and were concerted
in giving attention
to their responsibilities.  They sought to give warmth, dedication, trust,
kindness, affection and protection
to children in their care in undoubtedly
difficult conditions flowing from the constraints of caring for a child in an
institutional
home.  Discipline and religion was also appropriately
provided.
<P>

272   	Evidence was also given by other witnesses who were
resident at Lutanda at the same time as the plaintiff.  I will turn to
each
relevantly in due course.  One further witness that needs to be mentioned in Mr
Sattler.  Mr Sattler was one of three witnesses
in addition to the plaintiff
who gave evidence by way of affidavit but did not give oral evidence in the
course of the trial.  Mr
Sattler was appointed to the Board of Directors of
Lutanda in 1948 and served in that capacity until 1981.  He gave evidence, to
which I will refer to in due course, on which the plaintiff relies to support
several significant aspects of her case including her
contention that she cut
her arms in an act of self-mutilation during the period in which Mrs Middleton
was Matron.
<P>

273   	The evidence of the defence lay witnesses admitted at
trial is in direct contrast to that of the plaintiff.  In general,
their
evidence presents a distinctly happier and more favourable picture of life at
Lutanda than that which appears on the plaintiff's
case.  The plaintiff
presents a picture of life at Lutanda as, inter alia, a cruel and uncaring
place.  The plaintiff relies in part
on the evidence of Mr Sattler and Miss
Christie to support her view.  For reasons that will appear, I do not accept
the evidence
of Miss Christie or Mr Sattler so far as it is inconsistent with
the credible evidence of the defence lay witnesses.  It was conceded
by the
counsel for the plaintiff, Miss Adamson, that the general weight of the defence
lay witness evidence was that Lutanda was
not like the plaintiff had described,
as cruel and uncaring, but was considered by them as a caring environment akin
to a family.
 In response to a question from the bench, counsel for the
plaintiff Miss Adamson conceded that for people such as Mr Frame and many
of
the other witnesses, Lutanda "was obviously a very happy, caring place".  Miss
Adamson also conceded that all the Crown witnesses
(who I do accept) thought
that Lutanda was a lovely place and felt that they were part of a family when
they were there (at T 721-2).
 Further to these concessions, which I accept, I
would note that it is clear on the evidence that these witnesses specifically
reject,
in terms, all of the serious allegations made by the plaintiff.
<P>

274   	In considering the issues in this case, I have had regard
to all the evidence including that of the Lutanda witnesses.  I
have also had
regard to the evidence of the plaintiff, which, as I have said, I feel it
necessary to treat with some care.  In fairness,
in respect of a case of this
nature, concerning events so distant for the witnesses giving evidence, I have
had regard to the fact
that recollection of childhood events may be distorted
by various factors including the passage of time:  <b><u>Longman</u></b>
(supra).  All this said, I find that the evidence of the Lutanda witnesses was
generally credible and reliable and I accept it accordingly.
 In the present
section I turn now to their evidence, which I have relevantly set out, and,
where necessary, I have made findings
of fact on the various allegations made
by the plaintiff based on the whole of the evidence.
<P>

<b><u>Nature of the Plaintiff's Behaviour at Bomaderry:</u></b>
<P>

275   	One issue upon which both sides have made extensive
submissions was the characterisation of the behaviour of the plaintiff
during
the relevant years of her stay at both Bomaderry and particularly at Lutanda.
The plaintiff has sought to submit that the
even while at Bomaderry, from the
time when the plaintiff was one month old till she was four and half years, she
was a "troublesome"
child and known as such.  The nature of this submission for
the purposes of the plaintiff's case is set out in the following passage
in the
plaintiff's submissions (at p 36):
<P>

"Mr Sattler deposes to the circumstances that the plaintiff was known to be a
"troublesome child" even before she arrived at Lutanda
(see paragraph 3 of his
affidavit).  This is the only evidence of the plaintiff's behaviour at
Bomaderry.  The evidence of Dr Katz
is to the effect that it is likely that the
plaintiff had already suffered a disorder of the development of attachment
while at Bomaderry
and the childhood manifestations of the disorder were
reflected in the form of troublesome behaviour."
<P>

276   	This submission for reasons that appear is rejected.
<P>

277   	It was also part of the plaintiff's case, indeed a
significant part of it, that in light of her alleged troublesome behaviour
and
in consequence of these being "childhood manifestations" of disorder, the
plaintiff should have been referred to a Child Guidance
Clinic at an early
stage or at least certainly during her stay at Lutanda.  The expert evidence
led in the plaintiff's case presents
a scenario based on the effect of three
possible hypothetical visits of the plaintiff to a Child Guidance Clinic being
visits in
1947, 1953 and 1959.  Evidence is presented in the plaintiff's case
as to what the plaintiff would have done on those occasions had
a visit been
arranged, what the plaintiff would have said and what treatment would have
resulted.
<P>

278   	It is perhaps appropriate at this time to make fuller
reference to the nature and history of Child Guidance Clinics as it
appears on
the evidence. The significance of a potential referral to a Child Guidance
Clinic, on the plaintiff's case, is that after
such a referral she would have
received treatment which would have reversed her disorder which was undiagnosed
and unrecognised by
those who had her immediate care.  The Department of
Eduction/Public Instruction conducted Child Guidance Clinics in New South Wales
and had done so since 1936.  The Child Guidance Clinics developed from the
practises of the School Medical Service.  The history
of the Child Guidance
Clinic is found in the Annual reports of the Education Department.  The 1952
Report of the Director General
of Public Health (at Vol 18, p 4419) states
relevantly:
<P>

"A scheme of medical inspection of pupils in all schools administered by the
Education Department, and the majority of other schools
in the state, is
provided by the School Medical Service (a division or part of the Department of
Public Health)...  It may be said
that the primary object of the School Medical
Service is the medical examination of children to discover any departure from
normal
in the health of children, either physical or mental and to notify the
parent or guardian accordingly in order that the child may
be further
investigated to determine the need for treatment...  Treatment is accepted as
responsibility (sic) of the practising medical
profession."
<P>

279   	There is no evidence that Lutanda ever received a
notification of the type referred.  There is no evidence that the plaintiff
displayed at school a departure from normalcy in her health, either mental or
physical, in the eyes of her teachers or in the course
of a medical inspection.
There is no evidence of adverse reports on her behaviour nor any reports that
her education was suffering
in any way.
<P>

280   	The development of the Child Guidance Clinic was outlined
relevantly in the evidence as follows.  In 1936 the first Child
Guidance Clinic
was established in Sydney with a second following in 1939.  By 1945 there were
three Child Guidance Clinics in Sydney.
 In 1946 the fourth Child Guidance
Clinic was established with a fifth being established in 1954.  From 1946-48
some 2,000-2,500
new cases were seen annually and the Child Guidance Clinics,
and between 1954 and 1957 some 1,700-2,462 new cases were seen by Child
Guidance Clinics in Sydney. In 1953 of the total 1,757 cases seen at the four
Child Guidance Clinics administered by the School Medical
Service, 55% were
referred by either the Children's Court or Child Welfare Department.  Only 20%
of cases were by personal application
of parents and one seventh came "direct"
on referral by the Department of Education through teachers and school
counsellors whilst
others came from hospitals and social agencies.
<P>

281   	The 1974 Minister for Instruction Report indicated that
Child Guidance Clinics number 1, 2 and 4 examined children upon referral
from
various sources which included the Child Welfare Department (including
Children's Court), <u>teachers, school medical officers, parents</u>, other
branches of the Department, Soldiers, Children's Education Board, NSW Society
for crippled Children and other <u>social agencies</u>.  No. 3 Child Guidance
Clinic undertook the examination of boys admitted to the Metropolitan Boy's
Shelter and to Yasmar Hostel as
well as boys referred by the Children's
Court.
<P>

282   	The reports make clear that referrals could thus be by
persons other than parents (or institutions), namely, teachers or
school
medical officers.  In the instant case, there were no such referrals.  The
School Medical Services (after 1946 carried out
under the control of the
Director of Department of Public Health) had medical officers who visited
children in the schools.  The
Education Department itself provided educational
and vocational guidance tests.  Careers advisers also provided services within
schools.
<P>

283   	Evidence was also lead as to the nature and operation of
Child Guidance Clinics.  Mrs Bull who worked at a Child Guidance
Clinic as a
social worker during the relevant period (one of a team of three being a
psychiatrist, psychologist and social worker
who staffed each Clinic) worked in
one of the Clinics in which the attending child psychiatrist was a certain Dr
Jennings.  Mrs Bull
gave evidence in relation to the operation and activities
of the Child Guidance Clinics and of the role of a social worker in those
clinics.  The subject of Child Guidance Clinics and the role of the
psychiatrist, psychologist and social workers was also discussed
in Professor
Dawson's book  <b>"Aids to Psychiatry (1942)".</b>
<P>

284   	Dr Ellard, a psychiatrist, also gave evidence.  Though he
was not a child psychiatrist, it is clear from his evidence that
in the 1940's
and 1950's, and indeed even some time later, there were relatively few
specialist child psychiatrists.  Psychiatrists
who did specialise in child
psychiatry at that time were mostly not in private practice but rather worked
in the field of public
health, such as in Child Guidance Clinics.
<P>

285   	The Child Guidance Clinics that were in existence during
the 1940's and 1950's were all located in Sydney.  In the 1950's
the population
of New South Wales was said to have been about 3 million people.  The AWB used
the facilities of the Child Guidance
Clinics for children under its control
whether they lived in Sydney or in places remote from Sydney.  This occurred
when a judgment
decision was made by a responsible adult staff member that a
child should be referred to a Clinic.  One such referral, the evidence
showed,
occurred in respect of a child known as "K", to a Child Guidance Clinic in
1951-2 by the AWB because of a scholastic handicap.
<P>

286   	I propose to quote further, and at some length, from the
1952 Report of the Director General of Health.  I believe it accurately
reflected the situation with respect to the nature and operation of Child
Guidance Clinics.  It also indicates the respective roles
of the "team"
members.  The social worker's role is identified in terms of obtaining a
detailed history from the "parent" with regard
to the general family situation
and obtaining material relevant to the common mental background including
information regarding the
child's physical and emotional development.  It is
important to emphasise that the source of the history is the "adult carer", who
clearly has made value judgments and assessments of the child's behaviour.
<P>

287   	The 1952 Report is in the following terms:
<P>

"There are four Child Guidance Clinics administered by this Service.  One
clinic is located at the Yasmar Boy's Shelter for investigation
of boys
referred from Children's Court. Girl delinquents are referred to the other
three clinics.  These latter clinics also accept
cases referred from various
sources in the community.
<P>

The clinics have continued to function along the generally accepted lines of
child guidance clinic principles, as in former years.
 Each case is
investigated by the psychiatrist, the psychologist and the social worker
working as a team.  The clinic officers undertake
the investigation of children
and give appropriate advice and treatment where necessary.  Children are
referred for various reasons,
eg: maladjustment, delinquency, abnormal or
asocial behaviour.  Some of the cases referred to the clinic are not really
suitable
for clinic investigation, but due to lack of more adequate methods of
screening this appears to be unavoidable at present.
<P>

<u>In all clinics there is a waiting list, and because of this it is difficult
to arrange appointments in terms of their urgency</u>.  It is apparent that
consideration must be given to the establishment of additional clinics in the
metropolitan area, and clinics
also in the larger country centres.  The
situation could also be improved by the appointment of additional social
workers to each
clinic.  Steps have already been taken in this regard.
<P>

All children are submitted to intelligence test suited to their age and
maturity.  Observations as to the child's personality and
general demeanour are
made by the psychologist in the course of these tests. The social worker
obtains a detailed history from the
parent with regard to the general family
situation, and obtains material relevant to the environmental background,
including information
regarding the child's physical and emotional development.
The psychiatrist, armed with information from the psychologist and the
social
worker, is then in a position to interrogate the child and interpret his
problems to the parents in terms of suggested treatment
and attitudes.
Individual responsibility is encouraged in older children. "Follow-up" work is
necessarily restricted by the limitation
of the number of social workers, but
it must be accepted as an important function of a psychiatric clinic.  However,
in many cases
the social worker does make visits to the home and the school.
<P>

Parents and children are encouraged to revisit the clinic for further
discussion and report as to progress.  In some cases, where
the child is more
particularly involved emotionally and a neurotic pattern is well established,
parent and child report weekly for
continuing therapy.  In selected cases play
therapy is used as a medium for diagnosis and treatment.
<P>

A pleasing feature is the continuing number of personal applications made
privately by concerned parents, who are likely to be more
cooperative in their
attitude.  The use of the clinic by medical practitioners is a further
indication of their acknowledgment of
the value of child guidance clinics.  The
wide range, as shown in the age group, provides a good cross sampling of a
variety of problems
and enriches clinical experience.
<P>

Boys are referred to the Yasmar clinic from the metropolitan and country
Children's Courts.  They are on remand, and the majority
are detained in either
the Yasmar or Albion-street Shelter.  If they are not detained at a shelter
they attend the clinic from their
homes during the remand period.  A small
number not on remand are referred by the Child Welfare Department for
diagnostic interviews
and reports." [my emphasis].
<P>

288   	Where there is conflict as to Child Guidance Clinics
between Mrs Bull and Dr Katz, and the views expressed in the 1952 Report,
I
accept the contemporaneous evidence contained in the report.  It should be
noted that what appears from the 1952 report is that
there were waiting lists
for those who were considered by their carers to be in need let alone those who
were not considered to be
in need, such as the plaintiff.
<P>

289   	There is no evidence that throughout even her stay at
Lutanda, that any school teacher or School Medical Officer at any time
made
adverse reports in respect of the plaintiff's behaviour, or recommended or
suggested that the plaintiff should be seen by a
Child Guidance Clinic, or,
indeed, should be referred for "help" or assistance to a Doctor, psychiatrist
or anyone else in the behavioural
science area.  The practical, experienced and
trained Lutanda staff, particularly the qualified and trained nurses, Mrs
Buxton, Mrs
Middleton and Miss Moorhouse, individually did not consider that
the plaintiff's behaviour or conduct was such as warranted third
party
intervention whether by referral to the Honorary, Dr Lovell, or at all.  They
did not receive complaints in respect of adverse
behaviour or suggestions from
any school teacher or at all recommending either a Child Guidance Clinic
referral or referral to another
third party.
<P>

290   	As to practical matters, I would note that whilst the
plaintiff was at Lutanda from 1947 to 1950 a train trip to Sydney took
some two
an a half hours each way and Lutanda had no car.  When at Pennant Hills, the
trip to Sydney would have involved a walk of
some distance to Pennant Hills
railway station followed by a train trip to the city.  Indeed, to have
personally taken a child to
a Child Guidance Clinic midweek would have involved
the interruption of schooling for the plaintiff and presumably would have taken
one carer away from the rest of the children for the day for no apparent reason
on my findings.  Nothing is said as to what a child
who is a teenager might
have thought about being taken to a Child Guidance Clinic to see a
psychiatrist, psychologist and a social
worker.
<P>

291   	Returning to the plaintiff's submissions as to the
plaintiff's behaviour warranting a referral to a Child Guidance Clinic,
it is
the plaintiff's case that evidence of her lack of attachment was to be found in
her alleged troublesome nature even while she
was at Bomaderry.  Numerous
witnesses were cross-examined extensively by counsel for the plaintiff, Mr
Hutley as to the plaintiff's
behaviour and it was put to a number of witnesses
that the plaintiff was a troublesome child.
<P>

292   	The plaintiff seeks to support this claim by relying, as
I have said, on the evidence of Mr Sattler.  Mr Sattler's evidence
was that the
plaintiff was troublesome and the most difficult child he had ever known.  His
remarks come in the context of his recollection
of the plaintiff's arrival at
Lutanda.  Mr Sattler states at para 3 of his affidavit sworn in November 1997
that he can recall when
the plaintiff arrived at Lutanda in 1947 aged six
years.  It was his recollection that she was brought to Lutanda from a private
home and was left at Lutanda by a couple who he said had had care of her.  His
recollection was that they sent her to Lutanda as
they found her too
troublesome.  He didn't recall that she was brought to Lutanda because she had
fair skin.
<P>

293   	The facts of the plaintiff's arrival at Lutanda differ
substantially from Mr Sattler's evidence.  The plaintiff, as I have
said, came
not from a private home but was transferred from Bomaderry in 1947.  At that
time the plaintiff was four and a half and
not six.  Mr Sattler seems to be
unaware, upon his recollection of events, that the plaintiff spent time at
Bomaderry.  Additionally,
Mr Sattler did not recollect that one of the reasons
for the plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda was that she was "fair skinned".  In
a
letter from the then Secretary of the UAM, Miss Turner, to the then
Superintendent of the Aboriginal Welfare Board, Mr Lipscomb,
Miss Turner
expresses her earnest desire to have the plaintiff, in her words, "a white
child", transferred to Lutanda quickly.  The
application form for admission to
Lutanda also suggests that the reason for the transfer was in accordance with
the then policy of
assimilation, "to take the child from association with
Aborigines as she is a fair-skinned child".  Mr Sattler seems genuinely unable
to remember these details of why and from where the plaintiff was transferred
to Lutanda.  It is against this background that Mr
Sattler makes his statement
that the plaintiff was a troublesome child even before she arrived at
Lutanda.
<P>

294   	I do not accept his evidence that the plaintiff was known
to be troublesome before her arrival at Lutanda and so accordingly
I reject the
plaintiff's submission that it constitutes proof of the plaintiff's disturbed
state prior to her arrival at Lutanda.
 Mr Sattler's recollection about the
plaintiff's arrival at Lutanda in material and significant respects is contrary
to the established
evidence that I have accepted.  He makes no reference to
Bomaderry and indeed I infer that his view of her behaviour, which I do
not
accept, is not based on any specific knowledge he had of her stay at Bomaderry.
As I said, he appears, on his recollection, not
to remember her stay there.
<P>

295   	I reject also the suggestion by the plaintiff in
submission that Mr Sattler's evidence is the only evidence going to the
question of the plaintiff's behaviour at Bomaderry.  In a report prepared by
Miss English, an Inspector of the AWB, from visits taken
on 22 and 23 April
1947, just one week after the plaintiff left Bomaderry, no mention is made of
any children present or immediately
past who were troublesome.  I quote from
her report dated 18 June 1947:
<P>

"The Matron informed me that the conduct of the children was very satisfactory
and that there were no problem cases."
<P>

296   	From Mrs English's report, it appears that the Home at
Bomaderry was well respected in the nearby community to the extent
that it
received "gratifying financial support from outside sources".  Her report
presents a picture of a Home of clean, sufficiently
fed and clothed children,
making specific reference to their neat and tidy appearance. Mrs English was
also generally satisfied with
the good health of the children.
<P>

297   	Notwithstanding the plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda one
week earlier, the timing of the report by Mrs English, being in such
proximity
to the plaintiff's stay at Bomaderry, is such that I am of the opinion that is
it reasonable for me to infer that the report
reflects the conditions
prevailing with respect to the plaintiff at the time.  The plaintiff was not a
"troublesome" child in any
sense of the word.  As to the issue of behaviour,
the Matron, as stated, told the Inspector there were no "problem cases".  As to
health, the children, were all generally in good health, food was nourishing
and medical care was available.  Where necessary, specialist
medical treatment
would be provided by the Board on the referral of the regular general
practitioner.  Indeed, the very application
form for Lutanda completed on
behalf of the plaintiff stated the need for a Doctor's Certificate to be
obtained before any child
is admitted into Lutanda.  I infer that such was
given.  The plaintiff was accepted into Lutanda.  Neither medically, nor in
terms
of behaviour, am I satisfied that the plaintiff was a "troublesome" child
in the manner or of the type that under Dr Katz evidence
is suggestive of a
developmental attachment disorder.  She was not disturbed in my view at all.
She was, in my opinion, a normal
healthy child at the time of the transfer.
<P>

298   	I am made more confident in my view that the plaintiff
was not "troublesome" by the very act of transfer itself.  It was
Sister
Saville, a carer of the plaintiff at Bomaderry, and on all the evidence a
loving and kind lady, who pursued the transfer for
the plaintiff from Bomaderry
to Lutanda.  Sister Saville did so, it seems on all the evidence,  in the
plaintiff's best interests
and, it is reasonable to infer, did so on the basis
of her high regard for the child.  It would be incongruous, given the attitude
of Sister Saville in her pursuit of the plaintiff's transfer, to suggest that
the plaintiff was nevertheless, a troublesome child.
 I infer that Sister
Saville would conceivably not have taken the action she did if the child were
so problematic.
<P>

299   	It has to be borne in mind that a great motivation for
Sister Saville's act of securing the transfer of the plaintiff to
Lutanda was
the very fact that Sister Saville herself was leaving Bomaderry.  She sought
the child's best interests for the future
given the fact that she would no
longer be available to personally care for her.  There was in fact, as events
turned out and for
reasons which will appear, bonding and attachment and
interaction between the plaintiff and Sister Saville at Bomaderry, until both
left.  I will return to this matter in the following section.
<P>

300   	Of relevance, too, to this issue, are records from the
UAM's regular publication, <b>"The United Aborigine's Messenger"</b>.  A
relevant section appears in the edition dated 1 August 1948:
<P>

"Joy, four and a half years, with us from the age of four weeks, has recently
been placed in another Home.  We miss our little Joy:
she loved the Lord, and
often said so:  "I'm on the side of the Lord Jesus.  I don't want to be on the
devil's side."  Joy had understanding
beyond her years, and often surprised us
with questions and statements."
<P>

301   	From this extract it appears, in the eyes of the Matron,
Miss Darby, that Joy was a good child who loved the Lord.  It appears
additionally, that she was an intelligent and bright child.  No record is made
of her being "troublesome".
<P>

302   	All of this evidence weighs heavily in favour of the
view, as expressed, that the plaintiff, in her time before arriving
at Lutanda,
could not legitimately be described as a "troublesome" or "problem child" such
as to demonstrate to an observer that
the child was in any greater need of care
than any other child in care at Bomaderry.  I am not prepared to accept that
the plaintiff
demonstrated at Bomaderry behaviour which to an observer
obviously demonstrated a need for professional treatment.  I find that there
is
no basis to suggest that the plaintiff was in need of or should have been
referred to a Child Guidance Clinic either during her
time at Bomaderry, nor,
for reasons to be made clear, whilst she was at Lutanda.  To the extent that it
suggests otherwise, I reject
the evidence of Mr Sattler.  Indeed I generally
reject his evidence.
<P>

303   	I also reject the evidence of Dr Katz to the extent that
the plaintiff had a disorder of attachment including at Bomaderry.
 There in
nothing to suggest any signs of there being such an attachment disorder.  The
plaintiff's case in respect of Bomaderry
stands in the face of the evidence.  I
find that there were no symptoms or signs of a disorder of attachment at
Bomaderry as suggested
by the plaintiff's expert evidence.  There was no
warrant for referring the plaintiff to a Child Guidance Clinic in 1947 as again
suggested by Dr Katz.  His suggestion in 1999 doesn't accord with the facts in
evidence of the circumstances as they existed in the
1940's.  Further, it
cannot be assumed that any hypothetical history given at a hypothetical visit
to a Child Guidance Clinic or
to an AWB staff worker on a visit had one
visited, would be any different to that which is revealed on the facts and
which I have
outlined.
<P>

<b><u>Nature of the Care received at Bomaderry:</u></b>
<P>

304   	I have set out extensively my findings as to how the
plaintiff came to be at Bomaderry.  I have also set out the evidence
and my
findings in relation to that evidence with respect to the relationship the
plaintiff developed with Sister Saville and the
care she received from Sister
Saville.
<P>

305   	The thrust of the expert evidence, to the effect that the
plaintiff suffered from a deficiency in `attachment' at Bomaderry,
is not
supported on the plaintiff's case by evidence of the care or lack of care the
plaintiff received whilst at Bomaderry.  The
plaintiff submits in relation to
Bomaderry the following (at p 36 of her submissions):
<P>

"Aside from these documents concerning the entry and departure of the plaintiff
from Bomaderry and correspondence relating to overcrowding
at that institution
and the inferences to be drawn from Mr Sattler's affidavit there is no evidence
apart from the plaintiff's childish
recollection as to her circumstances at
Bomaderry.  There is some expert evidence to which greater reference will be
made below to
the effect that the plaintiff's memories of Bomaderry, and in
particular her memories of her mothers' visit there, may be in the
nature of
fantasy arising from the plaintiff's need for a mother."
<P>

306   	I reject this submission that the plaintiff's evidence be
given the meaning attributed to it by the expert evidence.  Further,
there is
the other evidence as to her circumstances at Bomaderry which I have accepted.
I have said already and repeat here that
I find the history of the plaintiff
give to Dr Waters in 1991 reliable where it records the plaintiff expressing
feelings to Dr Waters
that she had "comfortable, safe memories" of her time at
Bomaderry and that she felt that "someone was looking after me".  Further,
on
my findings, I have found that the plaintiff's mother did visit her at
Bomaderry.  This submission that I should read this lay
evidence of the
plaintiff in a way other than on its terms, as a form of fantasy is
speculative.  Such a submission instances the
difficult task the plaintiff's
evidence has presented me in this case.
<P>

307   	Notwithstanding this submission, the plaintiff concedes
(at p 40 of her submissions) that it does appear that the plaintiff
formed some
attachment to Sister Saville while she was at Bomaderry and refers to the
plaintiff's own evidence in accepting this
fact.  This is a finding I make and
have made on the evidence, that the plaintiff did form a bond and attachment
with Sister Saville
whilst at Bomaderry.  The plaintiff appears to have trusted
Sister Saville and found satisfaction and enjoyment in her relationship
with
her.  Indeed, it is a relationship it seems that was favoured by the plaintiff
even later in life where she refers to writing
letters to Sister Saville and to
receiving visits and phone calls from her.  I am further strengthened in my
view of the attachment
formed between Sister Saville and the plaintiff by the
care and concern shown by Sister Saville, as I have mentioned, in assisting
the
plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda, a good faith act, legitimately undertaken by
Sister Saville in the plaintiff's best interests.
<P>

308   	This finding that the plaintiff received care adequate to
achieve "bonding" between the plaintiff and Sister Saville is made
notwithstanding any suggestion of overcrowding at Bomaderry.  The care received
from Sister Saville is shown by the plaintiff's own
fond recollections of
Sister Saville, both from her time at Bomaderry and afterwards.  This finding
that the plaintiff received "bonding"
with Sister Saville strengthens me also
in my immediate finding that the plaintiff did not have a disorder of
attachment at her time
whist at Bomaderry.  I will return to the expert
evidence at a later point to address further concerns with the plaintiff's
submission
in relation to the plaintiff's psychiatric history generally and
with reference to her disorder of attachment.
<P>

<b><u>The General Conditions at Lutanda:</u></b>
<P>

309   	The plaintiff was admitted to Lutanda on 16 April 1947.
On the preponderance of the evidence that I accept it seems that
generally at
different times throughout the plaintiff's stay at Lutanda there were in the
order of 30-36 children resident at Lutanda
under its care.  I refer to the
evidence of Mrs Hancock, Mrs Tucker, Mrs Middleton and Mrs Oxborrow on this
point as to an accurate
recollection of the numbers of children in Lutanda at
the relevant times.  I accept their evidence.
<P>

310   	Further on the preponderance of the evidence I accept, I
find that at any one time during the period from 1947-60 there were
probably
six if not eight full time live-in workers corporately involved in the care of
the resident children.  The conditions of
licence for Lutanda under s. 28 of
the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  set out conditions with respect to staff
numbers.  The number of workers included the Superintendent and Matron, those
who cared
for the boys, those who cared for the girls, those who primarily
served as cooks, those who primarily served in housekeeping and
often a
groundsman.  In addition it seems that Lutanda and its residents benefited from
the kind service of many volunteers over
the relevant period, often people
associated with the Plymouth Brethren church, who gave of their time and skill
in various tasks
such as ironing and mending.  Mrs Talbot gives this evidence
in her affidavit, which I accept:
<P>

"Each week two ladies from the Gospel Hall Waitara came and did some ironing
and mending, and a gentleman came some weekends and
mended the children's
shoes.  Other friends also gave their time, for example they gave children
haircuts."
<P>

<u>311   	</u>Indeed it should be noted that all the staff
including the live-in staff worked in Lutanda on a voluntary basis.  None of
the staff
received a formal salary.  The construction of the new home in
Pennant Hills, opened in 1950, came about as the result of numerous
volunteers
contributing to its construction.  Even the original home in Wentworth Falls,
founded by Miss Dalwood and Miss Sangwell,
formed on little money and proceeded
in its establishment for the most part by relying on charity.
<P>

<b><u>Knowledge of the Plaintiff's Aboriginality and Alleged
Discrimination:</u></b>
<P>

312   	The plaintiff in her evidence asserts that  whilst she
was at Lutanda, all the other children at Lutanda were of European
descent and
white complexion.  It has not been asserted, nor could it be, that Lutanda had
a discriminatory policy of admission.
 Indeed, quite the contrary.  Evidence
given by Mrs Tucker (nee Frame) who was in care of Lutanda from 1952 and
evidence given by
Mrs Buxton  was that Lutanda took into its care people from
Asian, Polish and Dutch backgrounds.  Similar evidence is given by Mrs
Reid at
para 3 of her affidavit and by Mrs Hancock at para 6 of her affidavit.  More
generally, admission to Lutanda seemed based,
as originally intended by its
founder Miss Dalwood, on the relevant need of the applicant. Mrs Talbot gives
evidence in her affidavit,
which I accept, in the following terms:
<P>

"To my knowledge there was never any element of racial discrimination in
Lutanda's policy of accepting children.  Lutanda accepted
children needing care
whatever race or creed.  We endeavoured to provide a secure, caring homely
environment for every child placed
in our care."
<P>

313   	On the preponderance of the evidence that I accept, I
find that that indeed is what was achieved at Lutanda.  Those endeavours
were
put into practise and implemented.  Similar evidence, which I accept, is given
by Mrs Reid at para 3 of her affidavit (13 November
1997), Mrs Hancock at para
6 of her affidavit (24 November 1997), Mrs Buxton at para 3 of her affidavit (2
December 1997), and by
Mrs Simpson at para 3 of her affidavit (18 December
1997).
<P>

314   	In light of the foregoing evidence as to the various
ethnicities of children resident at Lutanda, the plaintiff's recollection
that
all the other children at Lutanda were of European descent and white complexion
should not be accepted.  The evidence presented
as to the appearance of the
plaintiff suggests that at the time the plaintiff resided at Lutanda her
appearance did not make obvious
to all her Aboriginality.
<P>

315   	Mrs Morsillo, who was resident at Lutanda from 1943 to
1950 testifies that the plaintiff had a darker skin tone than the
rest of the
children at Lutanda but that she did not realise until much later that Joy was
Aboriginal.  Miss Moorhouse gives evidence
(at  para 9 of her affidavit sworn 3
December 1997):
<P>

"I can remember Joy as a youngster.  She did not look like an Aboriginal.  She
had fair skin and hazel eyes.  I am not sure if I
knew at that stage that Joy
was an Aboriginal."
<P>

316   	Mrs Middleton who had charge of Joy when she was a
teenager gives the following evidence (at para 4 of her affidavit sworn
16
December 1997):
<P>

"I am not aware of any other Aboriginal children, fair skinned or otherwise,
who were at Lutanda.  I cannot remember whether we
even thought of Joy as
Aboriginal ...  She certainly did not look `real aboriginal' at the time.  When
she was very young, apart
from her beautiful curly hair, she hardly looked
Aboriginal at all - her skin was very fair.  It was only as she grew older that
she began to look more Aboriginal."
<P>

317   	In cross-examination Mrs Middleton affirmed this evidence
in the following answer (at T 224):
<P>

"<b>MIDDLETON:	</b>	I think in the back of our minds we realised she was from
an aboriginal mission, but it wasn't easy to, sought of, identify her as
an
aboriginal, because she was fair, she had curly hair, she was a happy
youngster.  But as she grew older, from teenage on, she
became more aboriginal
in appearance."
<P>

318   	Miss Goff gave evidence that her own skin was an olive
colour and that another girl resident at Lutanda named Carol Wade
also may have
been Aboriginal although she says was not sure at the time whether she knew
that the plaintiff was Aboriginal.  Indeed
it seems clear that a vast number of
those resident at the time did not know of the plaintiff's Aboriginal ancestry
during the plaintiff's
youth.  Mr Frame, Mrs Tucker, Miss Moorhouse, Mrs
Talbot, Miss Milton, Miss Simpson, Mrs Morsillo and Mrs Godfrey all testify to
not having known the plaintiff was an Aboriginal during the plaintiff's youth.
Most compelling of all though is evidence of Mrs Helies
who was the same age as
the plaintiff and under care of Miss Lewin with the plaintiff.  Mrs Helies by
virtue of her age spent a great
deal of time with the plaintiff whilst they
were both at Lutanda.  Evidence also indicates that she visited the plaintiff
many times
after she had left Lutanda while the plaintiff was still resident
there.  Mrs Helies gave the following evidence in her affidavit
of 14 November
1997:
<P>

"I never knew that Joy was Aboriginal when I was growing up. Joy was just Joy -
she was my friend. I cannot recall anything ever
being said about Joy being an
Aboriginal.
<P>

319   	It is clear on the evidence, however, that some witnesses
did know of the plaintiff's Aboriginality.  Mrs Reid, Mrs Hancock,
Mrs Buxton
and Mrs Middleton all gave evidence that they knew of the plaintiff's
Aboriginality.  In each case though they deny that
this knowledge led to
differential treatment of the plaintiff because of her Aboriginality.  Mrs
Middleton gave evidence (at para
5 of her affidavit) that:
<P>

"However none of us ever treated Joy differently because she was an Aboriginal.
I think that if anything Joy was actually favoured
above the other children
because she had been at Lutanda so long. When we thought of Joy I do not think
that we thought of her as
Aboriginal as such - she was just like any of the
other kids."
<P>

320   	I accept this evidence as well.
<P>

321   	Indeed, it appears from the evidence that it was not
general practice for the staff at Lutanda to discuss the background
of resident
children, whether in relation to the plaintiff or generally.  Again a list of
witnesses, including Mr Frame, Mrs Hancock,
Mrs Tucker, Mrs Talbot and Mrs
Oxborrow give similar evidence, which I accept, that generally the background
of children was not
discussed.
<P>

322   	James Frame gave evidence that his family and background
were not discussed with him till he was thirteen and that in general
he knew
little about the backgrounds of others as it never became a talking point.  Mrs
Tucker gave evidence at para 4 and 5 of her
affidavit (30 November 1997) that
the background of children was not openly discussed and that the workers at
Lutanda never raised
such a topic of their own initiative.  What little she
knew of the backgrounds of other children she said came from the children
themselves.  I note also that the evidence of general reluctance to discuss
children's backgrounds is consistent with the affidavit
evidence of Miss
Christie in her affidavit affirmed 20 November 1996.
<P>

323   	Against this view of the evidence is the evidence of Mr
Sattler that it was common knowledge that Joy was Aboriginal because
of her
dark skin.  Mrs Oxborrow also gives evidence to the effect that it was both
common knowledge and accepted that the plaintiff
was aboriginal though she was
unaware of any racism at that stage of her life.  Both Mr Sattler and Mrs
Oxborrow, however give most
emphatic evidence that even though they believed it
was common knowledge that the plaintiff was Aboriginal, it never became a
talking
point amongst those resident at Lutanda.
<P>

324   	In addition to the views of Mr Sattler and Mrs Oxborrow
is the evidence of Miss Christie.  Miss Christie did not live at
Lutanda but on
her own evidence lived half an hour's walk away.  She attended school with the
plaintiff and often visited Lutanda.
 Miss Christie gave evidence in two
affirmed affidavits (20 November 1996; 22 February 1998) that she was always
aware that the plaintiff
was Aboriginal though it was never discussed.  In her
affidavit in reply she reaffirms this statement saying she knew "since we were
very small".
<P>

325   	Miss Christie's oral evidence in cross-examination
discloses some confusion about the origin of her alleged initial realisation
that the plaintiff was an Aboriginal.  Miss Christie admitted, during the
course of her evidence, to having, for personal reasons,
engaged in a process
of self-exploration and a revisiting of her past so as to better understand
herself and her behaviour.  In doing
so, she testified that she has to her
mind, succeeded in `disentangling' herself from much of what she terms her
religious indoctrination.
 The witness shares with the plaintiff recriminations
against her religious upbringing.  For these reasons I find it necessary to
act
with caution in respect of her evidence.  I have had the benefit of hearing and
seeing the witness giving evidence and all my
observations confirm my
conviction to treat her evidence with utmost caution.  One is left with the
impression that her evidence
is subject to revisionism.  Having seen her and
heard her, I reject her evidence and do not act upon it.  Further, where there
is
conflict, I accept the Lutanda witnesses to which I have referred.
<P>

326   	In light of the vast number of witnesses who testify to
not knowing of the plaintiff's Aboriginality I do not accept the
mere
assertions by Mr Sattler, Mrs Oxborrow or Miss Christie that it was common
knowledge that the plaintiff was Aboriginal.  I do
not accept them preferring
the preponderance of other evidence to the contrary.  The fact that several
workers including Miss Simpson,
Miss Milton and Mrs Talbot did not know of the
plaintiff's Aboriginality coupled with a general reluctance amongst staff to
talk
about the background of children and coupled further, with the likely
possibility that few workers knew, in detail, of the plaintiff's
background and
arrival at Lutanda, all suggest the plaintiff's Aboriginality was not common
knowledge amongst the staff and children
in Lutanda at the relevant time.  That
is the state of the evidence which I consider should be accepted.
<P>

327   	Much was sought to be made of the fact that the plaintiff
was not told about her background or about her mother.  The plaintiff
submitted
in her written submissions (at p 103) that the staff at Lutanda were "affected
by a code of conduct" which saw that no
inquiries were made about the
plaintiff's mother.  There may have been good and valid reasons for not
disclosing this information
to a girl so young who was to their mind "fair
skinned" in appearance and who had been placed there for her betterment and for
the
purpose of giving her chance in life.  Indeed, one can but speculate as to
how the plaintiff (in the 1950's) would have reacted to
being given that
information in those circumstances.  What should also not be overlooked is the
Board's general policy which was
to assimilate the child in as far as, in the
instant case, the child was a fair skinned child nor should it be forgotten
that the
Board was under a duty in respect of assimilating the child plaintiff
under s. 7(1)(a) of the Act.  I would observe in passing, even
in the area of
adoption, it was not until the 1990's that adoption legislation was changed to
permit a child to know who his/her
parents were.  In the instant case we are
dealing with the standards of the 1940-50's, and not the respective standards
of the 1990's
retrospectively applied.  Knowing, the carers as I do from having
seen them and heard them, if information was withheld, I infer
it was done with
the best of motives and for the best of reasons, namely the perceived
protection of the child plaintiff.
<P>

328   	Turning to another matter to do with the identification
of the plaintiff, the plaintiff has made allegations that she was
known as Girl
4 whilst at Lutanda, that it was sewn into her clothes and that she was called
by a number instead of a name.  This
allegation has been conceded as being a
"distortion" by the plaintiff. I believe it is a "distortion" and that this
matter can be
dealt with shortly.  The relevant evidence, which I accept, is
that of Mrs Godfrey (nee Frame) who gives the following evidence in
her
affidavit sworn 11 March 1999 (at para 27):
<P>

"We were never called by number. We were called by name. But all our clothing
was numbered . My clothing number was 5, but I was
always called Jean.  he
numbering system was used so that we could keep track of our clothing."
<P>

329   	I note as far as it is relevant that this evidence is
supported by Mrs Hancock at para 14 of her affidavit (24 November 1997)
and by
Mr Frame at para 23 of his affidavit (26 November 1997).  Mr Frame also gives
oral evidence (at T 206) as to the fact that
numbers were used for his towel
rack and may have been used on his clothes.  He gave evidence that he was never
called by a number
instead of a name.  Mrs Buxton also gives oral evidence (at
T 372) that numbers were used for laundry and shoes but that the plaintiff
was
always called Joy Williams.  I accept their evidence.
<P>

<b><u>Attitude to Aborigines:</u></b>
<P>

330   	I reject the plaintiff's allegation that she was taught
at Lutanda to look down on Aborigines.  Mrs Middleton gave evidence
that the
children were never taught to look down on Aborigines at Lutanda.  In oral
evidence she denied (at T 228) making differentiation
between anybody, let
alone Aborigines.  Her attitude to Lutanda and the life lived there is best
summed up in the following exchange
(at T 224).  Mr Hutley in cross-examining
Mrs Middleton about a prior conversation that she had had with the plaintiff's
solicitors:
<P>

"<b>HUTLEY:		</b>Did they ask you this question, "Did Joy know she was an
aborigine?"  Do you recall being asked that question by these people?
<P>

<b>MIDDLETON:</b>		No, I don't recall that.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:	</b>	Do you recall, if you had said, "I don't know whether she
knew", would that have been correct?
<P>

<b>MIDDLETON:	</b>	It could have been, because we did not talk about it.  You
know, it was just not even an issue.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>		Did you tell anyone that, "No staff ever told her, because that
would have been degrading her", referring to her aboriginality?
<P>

<b>MIDDLETON	</b>	I think I have to refer to the same thing that I have been
saying; we knew she came from an aboriginal mission and we were, sort
of, I
suppose subconsciously aware that there was aboriginal in her, but it was never
an issue and it was never emphasised or she
was not - she was just one of us
and I had my own two children there too."
<P>

331   	I accept this evidence.
<P>

332   	Mrs Buxton also gave evidence (at T 373) that the
children were never taught to look down on Aborigines.  She said that if
there
was any talk about Aborigines it would have been when the mission perhaps
showed slides or someone visited.  She said that
the general teaching was that
everybody was equal in God's eyes and everybody was loved by God and certainly
not to be looked down
on.  I accept the evidence of Mrs Middleton and Mrs
Buxton.  In doing so I reject the submission from the plaintiff that the staff
were prejudiced by racial bigotry in fact or otherwise.
<P>

333   	The evidence suggests that very little direct reference
to Aboriginals was ever made at Lutanda.  It seems that at best reference
to
Aborigines and Aboriginality was sporadic.  Many of the those resident in care
at the time recall being taught very little specifically
relating to
Aboriginals.  Many remember only the words to a non-racial Sunday school song
they were taught in which they were admonished
to love all races.  Mrs Hancock
gave evidence that all the teaching at Lutanda was based on the Bible.  All the
other teaching was
left to the schools to which the plaintiff and other
children were encouraged to attend. I accept her evidence.
<P>

<b><u>Visitors:</u></b>
<P>

334   	It seems common ground that the plaintiff had few if any
visitors at Lutanda.  The plaintiff's mother apparently never told
anyone of
the plaintiff's birth.  She too had been under the Board's control from an
early age.  The father and his relatives were
never involved nor showed any
interest in the plaintiff's birth or her subsequent life.  His name did not
appear on the birth certificate.
 He was a soldier who may even have not
survived the war.
<P>

335   	In 1947, the mother knew that the child plaintiff was
going to Lutanda having signed the form for admission.  From 1947-1956
the
mother showed no interest in contacting the child plaintiff, in visiting her or
otherwise.  In so far as Lutanda was not a home
within the meaning of s 11 of
the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>,  the mother was entitled to visit
the plaintiff without permission if she had had wished to do so.  The evidence
of Lutanda carers
was that she would have been welcomed had she sought to visit
the plaintiff.
<P>

336   	It was not until 1956 when the plaintiff's mother, living
in the country in adverse circumstance of health and financial
well-being,
contacted Mrs English, a then inspector with the AWB, that the mother, inter
alia, sought to know where the plaintiff
was and whether she could visit her.
Mrs English did not advise on this matter, no doubt for reasons good and valid
to her.  As I
said, the plaintiff's mother had not sought to contact the child
plaintiff between 1947-56. Apparently no further attempt was made
by the
plaintiff's mother to see her or communicate with her and they did not meet
again until 1973.
<P>

337   	The evidence shows that the plaintiff did receive
occasional visits from Aunty Leila (Sister Saville) and her then husband
`Uncle
Sid'.  At some stage, when the plaintiff says she was 12, Miss Saville, then
known by her married name, moved with her husband
to Western Australia.  After
this occurred the plaintiff gave evidence that she received a phone call every
two years from Sister
Saville.
<P>

338   	It is also common ground that at least one day a month
was set aside for an open house to visitors.  That was, according
to Mr Frame
and Mrs Middleton, the first Saturday of the month.  Some children, like Miss
Goff remember getting visitors fortnightly
due to the persistence of her father
in coming to visit with his children.  Sadly, however, on the balance of the
evidence, it appears
that her experience and that of her siblings in having
such a regular visitor was somewhat unique.  This perhaps reflects the reality
of the problem of being in an institution where, because of there being no
parent, relative or friend available to care for the child,
very few visitors
are common or constant.  Miss Goff's sister, Mrs Oxborrow (nee Goff) confirms
this at para 3 of her affidavit sworn
6 January 1998 where she says that she
and her siblings were the only children at Lutanda who had a parent regularly
visiting them.
 Of those children who had occasional visitors, Mrs Middleton
gave evidence that even these children "would sometimes have no visitors
for
several months."  No evidence was tendered to show the development of
psychological damage to any of these other children in
care at Lutanda during
the period of the plaintiff's residence.
<P>

339   	The plaintiff was clearly not the only one to suffer from
the lack of a specific and regular visitor.  The Frame family comprised
of
witnesses, Mr Frame, Mrs Godfrey and Mrs Tucker, as well as two other brothers,
never received any visitors.  The attitude of
the staff at Lutanda to the
subject of visitors and of children who did not receive visitors is set out by
Mrs Talbot in two paragraphs,
which I accept, from her affidavit sworn 9
December 1997:
<P>

"Visiting was usually on a monthly basis.  Parents and relatives were welcome
to visit their children and spend time with them.
 Many came regularly, but
others never came and a number of the children including Joy never received
visits.  We always tried to
make up to those children with little treats on the
day, and by giving as much time to them as we were able.
<P>

The visiting of parents and relatives was encouraged by the Directors and
Superintendent also the staff. We would spend any opportunity
afforded us by
the children's visitors to engage in meaningful conversations in an effort to
try to help them understand just how
important it was that they continue their
contact with their children on a regular basis and what these visits meant to
their children."
<P>

340   	There is evidence that the staff at Lutanda endeavoured
to promote the welfare of the children by facilitating visits by
people from
church who took an interest in the children.  Those visitors who did come often
remembered to bring gifts for those who
had no visitors.
<P>

341   	Evidence is given by Mrs Oxborrow (nee Goff), sister of
Phyllis Helies (nee Goff) who had grown up with the plaintiff, that
the
plaintiff would occasionally join their family on an outing which occurred when
her father visited.  It was because this so boosted
her morale that the staff
at Lutanda allowed this to occur.  The attitude of the staff of Lutanda to
visitation, on the evidence,
in one in which, though not actively searching for
or enticing visitors to come and visit the children, they nevertheless did
everything
possible to preserve the opportunities for visitation that were
available to the children.  One clear example is Miss Moorhouse herself.
 The
evidence shows that Miss Moorhouse regularly visited Lutanda although she did
not have direct family there.  She visited those
who did not get visitors and
often brought gifts for the children and for their birthdays.
<P>

<b><u>Nature of the Plaintiff's Behaviour at Lutanda:</u></b>
<P>

342   	Evidence of the plaintiff's behaviour whilst at Lutanda
is extensive.  I will refer to some of the evidence I specifically
accept.  A
number of witnesses were pressed in cross-examination as to the emotional state
of the plaintiff.  Miss Milton, who was
a junior leader of the girls under Miss
Lewin, was asked (at T 162) whether she recalls the plaintiff having any
emotional problems.
 She said she did not. Mrs Middleton, a well qualified
carer in my view, was extensively cross-examined (at T 230) on her observations
of the plaintiff's emotional and mental health.  When asked whether the
plaintiff actions could be referable to her being a "disturbed
child" she
replied that the plaintiff wasn't a "disturbed child".  When asked whether it
had ever occurred to her that the plaintiff
suffered from symptoms of a
deprived childhood she replied, "No, emphatically no".  Later in
cross-examination Mrs Middleton (at
T 235) was pressed as to whether she
thought that the plaintiff needed professional help:
<P>

"<b>MIDDLETON:	</b>	No, and if you are talking about her being depressed, or
anything like that, she was not a depressive type.  She was a girl that
succeeded, and she would go off and have a few hours on her own.  But she would
bounce back as good as ever."
<P>

343   	I accept Mrs Middleton's evidence.  I am not satisfied
that the plaintiff demonstrated any emotional, psychiatric or psychological
problem warranting reference of the plaintiff to a third party.  I am satisfied
that had such a problem been discernible to the carers
they would have referred
her to a third party or to Dr Lovell for assistance.  Nor did the educational
authorities, the plaintiff's
school nor her school teachers make any report to
Lutanda or any other recommendation expressing concern about the plaintiff's
behaviour
at any time during her stay at Lutanda, nor did any school authority
apparently recommend referral to a third party such as a Child
Guidance Clinic.
More significantly, had the AWB been told anything by the Lutanda staff or
through its representatives, if visited
once a year or more and spoken to the
Lutanda hands-on carers and or even the plaintiff herself, the position
reported in respect
of the plaintiff would not in my view have been other than
as stated or understood by the Lutanda carers.
<P>

344   	A number of witnesses were further pressed with respect
to the plaintiff's behaviour being troublesome.  The plaintiff through
counsel
submitted that I should find that the plaintiff was an extraordinarily
troublesome child and an even more troublesome child
than any other child at
Lutanda with the exception of one child, Helen Frame, who was sent home from
Lutanda to live with her parents.
 Turning to the evidence a proposition was
put to Mr Frame that the plaintiff got into trouble more than anybody else.  He
replied
that (at T 200):
<P>

"<b>FRAME:	</b>	To my observation, she was in trouble pretty regularly, but I
couldn't say more than anybody else."
<P>

345   	When further asked whether it was a fair description of
the plaintiff that she was the naughty girl of Lutanda, he replied
(at T
204):
<P>

"<b>FRAME:	</b>	Not remembering everybody that went through Lutanda, I could
not honestly say.  I wasn't a worker, I was 10 years of age.  I couldn't
come
to that."
<P>

346   	Turning to the workers, Mrs Hancock when pressed said she
could not recall the plaintiff being in a lot of trouble (at T
215).  Miss
Moorhouse agreed with the proposition put to her (at T 356) that the plaintiff
was by far the naughtiest girl at Lutanda.
 Her answer is qualified by the
context of the questioning.  It deserves to be set out:
<P>

"<b>MOORHOUSE:	</b>	Yes, well, you know lots of teenagers get very rebellious
when you are teenagers and I know she was a naughty girl, but there were,
you
know, most teenagers get rebellious, they don't want to do what their mothers
tell them.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:	</b>	But she was by far the naughtiest girl at Lutanda, wasn't
she?
<P>

<b>MOORHOUSE:	</b>	I think so, yes, but as I said, her misdemeanours were not
elaborated to me."
<P>

347   	From the context and preceding passages it seems clear
that Miss Moorhouse was relying more on her impression of a general
attitude
held by the staff than on her own observations of the plaintiff.  Not having
had the misdemeanours elaborated to her refers
to the fact that she is being
asked about the nature of the plaintiff's behaviour having been a monthly
visitor to Lutanda and not
in relation to the time she spent working there.
Indeed, when asked about alleged violent behaviour of the plaintiff she replies
(at T 375) that she wasn't aware of it as she wasn't there at the time.
<P>

348   	Mrs Middleton described Joy (at T 234) as a "ringleader,
or the stirrer, or whatever".  When pressed (at T 230) as to the
plaintiff
being more trouble than the other children she replied:
<P>

"<b>MIDDLETON:	</b>	I suppose she caused us more concern than any of the
others, because no matter what you did for her she always seemed to have her
own way."
<P>

349   	Later on the same page, when asked why she thought the
plaintiff acted that way, she replied:
<P>

"<b>MIDDLETON:	</b>	That was just the way she was built.  That was Joy."
<P>

350   	Mrs Buxton, also a well qualified carer whose evidence I
accept, gave evidence that in her experience the behaviour of the
plaintiff was
perfectly normal for a 10 to 12 year old. She gave evidence (at T 389) that:
<P>

"<b>BUXTON:	</b>	She would try me out, like any child, and when she eventually
obeyed, that was fine."
<P>

351   	When it was suggested to her that the plaintiff was more
bad tempered than others, she said (at T 390):
<P>

"<b>BUXTON:	</b>	That didn't come through to me, but when you have got a group
of children of any sort, you are going to have some more and some less
disobedient, some more and some less sulky and so on.  One accepted the fact
that children were all different and accommodated it."
<P>

352   	Mrs Buxton (at T 378) gave the further following evidence
in examination in chief about the nature of the plaintiff's emotional
and
mental health:
<P>

"<b>BARRY</b>:		When you were looking after Joy did you think that she was in
need of any psychiatric treatment?
<P>

<b>BUXTON:	</b>	No.
<P>

<b>BARRY</b>:		Why not?
<P>

<b>BUXTON:	</b>	She wasn't clinically depressed.  She wasn't in need of
psychiatric care.  She was a normal teenager to my mind.
<P>

<b>BARRY:	</b>	Did you think that there was any need for outside intervention,
by that I mean from a psychologist, of a psychiatrist, or a doctor,
in relation
to her management when you were looking after her?
<P>

<b>BUXTON:	</b>	No.
<P>

<b>BARRY:	</b>	Why not?
<P>

<b>BUXTON:	</b>	Because she was, to my mind, a fairly normal teenager.  She was
a little bit more moody sometimes, but that's normal enough.  Children
get
moody in their teenage years.  She didn't stand out as a person who needed any
of that.
<P>

<b>BARRY:	</b>	Did you think that you were able to manage her?
<P>

<b>BUXTON:	</b>	Yes."
<P>

353   	Mrs Middleton and Mrs Buxton were very good and
impressive witnesses.  Both were trained and qualified nurses and had spent
a
great deal of time with the plaintiff observing her and caring for her.  Mrs
Buxton was a triple qualified nurse.  I would observe
in passing that when Mrs
Buxton was trained in, inter alia, infant welfare, in 1949, she was not
lectured on the subject of maternal
deprivation.
<P>

354   	I am not satisfied that any evidence of Mr Sattler, as
set out above, impacts on the reliability of the evidence of Mrs Buxton,
Mrs
Middleton or the other witnesses who testify about the plaintiff's behaviour.
Where there is conflict between Mr Sattler and
Mrs Buxton or Mrs Middleton, I
reject Mr Sattler.  Mrs Buxton and Mrs Middleton were medically trained and
their opinions, being
contemporaneous and arising from their daily care of the
plaintiff should be given great weight.  I am satisfied on all of the evidence
that the plaintiff was not an extraordinarily troublesome child whilst at
Lutanda.  I accept the defendants' submission that the
overall effect of this
evidence, while it showed that the plaintiff did present as a difficult child
with some management problems,
is that the plaintiff did not present as a child
who required outside intervention.  The plaintiff was in the care of
experienced
and trained carers.  I reject the plaintiff's submission that the
staff at Lutanda, and particularly Mrs Buxton  and Mrs Middleton
were
prejudiced by religious beliefs into preferring pseudo solutions over medical
assistance.  The evidence suggests, and I accept
this evidence, that both
dedicating caring Matrons would have sought the assistance of the honorary Dr
Lovell for a referral had
there been a perceived need for it.  There is no
evidence and I do not find that the plaintiff suffered from any emotional,
psychiatric
or psychological problem or disturbance whilst at Lutanda which
warranted reference of the plaintiff to a third party like a CGC
for
observation, treatment or therapy.
<P>

355   	I repeat that whilst at Lutanda at no time was apparently
a report made by the educational authorities at the plaintiff's
school or by
any other teacher expressing concern about the plaintiff's behaviour nor was
any direct referral to a Child Guidance
Clinic or any other third party
suggested or made by them.  Had such a visit to a Clinic occurred I am
satisfied that the history
given to the clinic by the staff at Lutanda would be
not substantially different from that given by the witnesses Mrs Buxton and
Mrs
Middleton in the instant case, namely, that the plaintiff was not unduly
troublesome and was not clinically depressed, nor suffering
from any
psychiatric problem or disturbance.
<P>

<b><u>Care and Treatment of the Plaintiff at Lutanda:</u></b>
<P>

356   	The plaintiff alleges that she was treated differently
from the other children while at Lutanda.  It should be noted that
in
particularising this allegation the plaintiff does so by referencing such
things as rarely going to private homes for Christmas
and other vacations,
being "often the only child left in Lutanda" at holiday times, being one of the
longest term residents at the
Home and generally having no visitors. I will
turn to these matters in turn.  She also makes reference to not being offered
placement
with other families by means of adoption and fostering out.  I will
return to this matter separately in the following section.
<P>

357   	It should be clear from the preceding section that the
fact that the plaintiff did not receive visitors was not a matter
unique and
particular to her alone and could not and is not the subject of any charge that
the plaintiff was discriminated against.
 It was simply not in the hands of the
carers at Lutanda to ensure visitors, nor could the defendant AWB ensure
visitors.  It cannot
be suggested on the evidence that the plaintiff was in
anyway disadvantaged or discriminated against because of this general
practise.
<P>

358   	The history of the plaintiff's care at Lutanda is
presented in her evidence as being both unusually long, the plaintiff spending
some thirteen years at Lutanda in the face of her best recollection that other
children only spent up to five years at Lutanda, and
unusually prejudiced in
the care she received.  The plaintiff makes the statement that she often felt
unwanted and that nobody cared.
<P>

359   	At all points, the whole of the evidence seems to be
against the plaintiff's claim.  It seems appropriate at this point to
lay out
the evidence of the history of care received by the plaintiff whilst at Lutanda
before turning to consider the particular
matters alleged by the plaintiff.
<P>

360   	When the plaintiff came into the care of Lutanda in 1947
she was placed in the care of Miss Lewin.  Miss Moorhouse gives
the relevant
evidence (at para 5 of her affidavit):
<P>

"By the time Joy came to Lutanda Miss Lewin was the person who cared for the
little ones.  She was a sweet gentle lady, who did
not enjoy good health, the
little ones loved her.  This was Miss Lewin's sole responsibility.  Joy was one
of the five children under
the age of seven that Miss Lewin cared for. I can
also recall another child Phyllis Goff, who was about Joy's age and whom Miss
Lewin
cared for.  She was a real mother to baby Phyllis, aged three and a half,
and later Joy, who was aged four and a half, when she joined
us.  Miss Lewin
was a very gentle lady."
<P>

361   	Miss Lewin, on the evidence, provided a loving
environment for both Phyllis and Joy. Phyllis Helies (nee Frame) who was,
with
the plaintiff, one of the youngest at Lutanda and in care of Miss Lewin
remembers her fondly.  Her words clearly convey a distinct
and different
version of the care she received under Miss Lewin than that asserted by the
plaintiff.  Mrs Helies swore in her affidavit
(at para 2) the following:
<P>

"In my early year at Lutanda Joy Williams and I were the youngest children
there. Miss Lewin ("Aunty Kath") took care of Joy and
me.  I loved Miss Lewin
dearly, she was the closest thing I ever had to a mother."
<P>

362   	Mrs Helies' sister Mrs Oxborrow (nee Frame) also gave
evidence concerning the care received by her sister under Miss Lewin.
In her
affidavit sworn on 6 January 1998 (at para 2) she refers to Miss Lewin as the
"sweetest, kindest and dearest lady I have ever
known".  Mrs Oxborrow recalls
that Miss Lewin kept in contact with both the plaintiff and her sister even
after Miss Lewin left Lutanda.
 Mrs Helies also gives evidence that Miss Lewin
would often take her to visit the plaintiff even after both Mrs Helies and Miss
Lewin
had left Lutanda.
<P>

363   	Evidence was also given by Mrs Milton, who was the
assistant to Miss Lewin, of the care and attitude of herself and Miss
Lewin
towards the plaintiff.  Mrs Milton said (at T 158) she loved the plaintiff and
that Miss Lewin had the same attitude as her.
 When asked what kind of a person
Miss Lewin was, Mrs Milton replied,  "A beautiful lady".
<P>

364   	No mention is made of Miss Lewin in the plaintiff's
affidavit, nor is mention made of the care received from her.  This is
naturally contrasted with the responses of Mrs Helies, who being around the
same age as the plaintiff, shared in the same care at
the hands of Miss Lewin
and, not only remembers her, but remembers her as the closest thing she had to
a mother.
<P>

365   	The plaintiff was also in care of Miss Atkinson for part
of her time at Lutanda.  The plaintiff makes much of this relationship
in the
course of her submissions.  The plaintiff submits by way of expert evidence,
which I have set out more fully elsewhere, that
Miss Atkinson was the best,
indeed the sole person identifiable who could have served to overcome the
plaintiff's deficiency in attachment
when young.  Relevant passages from the
affidavit of Dr Katz deserve to be set out.  At para 41 of his affidavit 13
April 1999, he
states:
<P>

"41.	A reasonably competent child psychiatrist or child mental health
professional would have realised that the presence of Sister
Amy (Miss
Atkinson) provided a therapeutic opportunity for reversing the disorder of the
development of attachment from which Ms
Williams was suffering.  Such a person
would have recommended to the person who accompanied Ms Williams to the
consultation and through
that person to those administering Lutanda that
<u>encouragement should be given to the development of the relationship between
Sister Amy and Ms Williams</u>.  Such a person would have appreciated that a
bond between Ms Williams and Sister Amy may have been established which was
sufficient
to fulfil the need identified in my earlier affidavit and have
prevented the psychological consequences of the lack of attachment."
[my
emphasis]
<P>

366   	Mrs Bull gives similar evidence at para 6 of her
affidavit sworn 12 April 1999:
<P>

"6.	A reasonably competent social worker at a Child Guidance Clinic, on
receiving the history set out above, would have appreciated
the following had
Ms Williams been referred to the Clinic in 1953 or thereabouts:
<P>

(m)	Since Ms Williams had identified Ms Atkinson as the person to whom she felt
closest, it was likely that the attachment which
was likely to be of greatest
benefit to Ms Williams was an attachment with Ms Atkinson;
<P>

(o)	It was desirable that Ms Atkinson, if she were willing, should be involved
in Ms Williams treatment in any way possible and
that she receive some
counselling from the staff of the Clinic when she came with Ms Williams for
weekly appointments.  The effect
of this involvement would be to put Ms
Atkinson in the role of <u>surrogate</u> <u>mother</u> to Ms Williams." [my
emphasis]
<P>

367   	It is the plaintiff's evidence that she was closer to
Sister Amy Atkinson than to any other person at Lutanda.  The plaintiff
has
expressed fondness for her and has specified actions like being allowed to
brush Miss Atkinson's hair as symbolic and demonstrative
of the caring
relationship the two shared.  Further, it is the plaintiff's submission that
such activity of encouraging a relationship
between the plaintiff and Miss
Atkinson and of placing her in the position of a surrogate mother would have in
the words of Dr Katz
"prevented the psychological consequences of the lack of
attachment."  I have a number of problems with this submission.
<P>

368   	Firstly, it does not follow that because Miss Atkinson
generally demonstrated care for the plaintiff that Miss Atkinson would
necessarily be ready, willing or able to pursue the role that the plaintiff has
urged in forming an attachment with the plaintiff
or that there could or would
be ongoing attachment of the plaintiff with her.
<P>

369   	Lutanda was a Home staffed by volunteers, albeit caring
volunteers, of which Miss Atkinson was one.  There was not a relationship
of
employment between Miss Atkinson and Lutanda or between Miss Atkinson and the
AWB that could form the basis for the AWB to encourage
a continuous
relationship between the plaintiff and Miss Atkinson of the type suggested.
Further, the plaintiff led no evidence as
to the willingness of Miss Atkinson
or other carers to engage in the travel so as to accompany the plaintiff to a
Child Guidance
Clinic, in respect of which I have found no such visit was
warranted.
<P>

370   	I am also satisfied that Miss Atkinson provided a
significant level of care for the plaintiff and provided some attachment,
interaction and bonding in fact.  On three occasions she took the plaintiff
alone on interstate trips to visit with friends at Christmas.
 Her specific and
special concern for the plaintiff was significant.  Yet it does not follow that
a relationship of the type suggested
by the expert evidence was wanted, desired
or possible on Miss Atkinson's behalf with all the responsibilities that would
go with
that relationship, nor was it practicable in all the circumstances.
<P>

371   	Secondly, and following from the first point, it might
perhaps be reasonably perceived as running contrary to common sense
and
understandings of human nature, human personality and emotions to suggest that
such a relationship of bonding and attachment
could be formed merely on a
desire or by compulsion, however well-intentioned, of third persons to the
relationship.  There is evidence
in Dr Bowlby's WHO Report of 1951 (a
significant report in the plaintiff's case) that bonding and attachment
involves learning to
know and trust a person, and involves a warm, intimate and
continuous relationship between the child and mother or permanent substitute
in
which both find satisfaction and enjoyment.  It is by no means inevitable,
given the best intentions in the world, that a relationship
of bonding of the
type and scope suggested by the expert evidence was at all possible on a
temporary or permanent basis between Miss
Atkinson and the plaintiff.  There
was simply no evidence, indeed, such an issue may not even be justiciable given
that the many
and various factors which precipitate in the forming of such a
bond are inevitably and naturally complex.  Any bonding or attachment
would
involve mutuality and would presumably require that the plaintiff too is ready,
willing and able to participate in terms finding
satisfaction and enjoyment.
In all this I say nothing as to the difficulties in a practical sense of time
or emotion of a carer seeking
to undertake such a role when responsible for a
number of children in an institutional setting.
<P>

372   	Thirdly, while Miss Atkinson remained at Lutanda for
approximately the full length of the plaintiff's stay it is not suggested
that
Miss Atkinson could not leave Lutanda at any time, her work their been
voluntary and charitable and unpaid.  Indeed, the evidence
was from Miss
Moorhouse that Miss Atkinson regularly took a "furlough" or holiday, at least
every year to return to Tasmania to visit
her family.  Starting in 1953 it
seems she took an extended furlough.  The possibility of her departure seems to
have been largely
ignored in the basic assumptions employed by Mrs Bull and Dr
Katz.  In a Home, carers come and go.  Mrs Bull in response to this
line of
questioning said that knowing Miss Atkinson could leave and did leave for a
period in 1953 would not change her views set
out in her affidavit. With
respect, I do not accept Mrs Bull's views expressed, inter alia, to accommodate
a different factual situation
assumed by her and similarly by Dr Katz.
<P>

373   	Fourthly, the evidence was that Miss Atkinson was an
elderly lady, somewhere in the order of seventy to eighty years of age
even at
the time of the plaintiff's arrival at Lutanda in 1947.  Mrs Hancock gives
evidence that whilst at Lutanda between the years
of 1953-6, Miss Atkinson was
in her 70's possibly getting close to 80.  Miss Moorhouse gave evidence that by
the late 1950's Miss
Atkinson did not assist full time with the care of the
children but assisted by arranging morning tea and other smaller jobs.  If
it
be accepted on the state of knowledge presented in the work of Dr Bowlby that
there was a need for a permanent mother substitute,
it seems, with respect,
that Miss Atkinson was not suited to that role.
<P>

374   	For these reasons, although I am satisfied that the
plaintiff received favourable care, and experienced attachment and bonding
with
Miss Atkinson as she did from Miss Lewin, I cannot accept the implicit
assumption of Mrs Bull and Dr Katz that a continuous
and special relationship
of bonding was reasonable, practicable or even possible between the plaintiff
and Miss Atkinson.  Such cannot
in life or in nature be compelled, although it
might otherwise occur.
<P>

375   	Turning to the matters particularised by the plaintiff in
her allegation that she was treated differently, the evidence clearly
shows
that a number of children, possibly the majority of children regularly remained
at Lutanda over Christmas and during holidays
such that, contrary to the
plaintiff's evidence, the plaintiff was never left alone there.  Miss Simpson
in her affidavit sworn 15
December 1997 gives the following evidence:
<P>

"Most children would remain at Lutanda over Christmas. Joy would never have
been the only on left at Lutanda.  We never had a totally
empty house over
Christmas or the holidays (except if we went to Toukley).  Christmas was lovely
at Lutanda.  On Christmas Day, early
in the morning there were "stockings"
filled with small gifts, and in the afternoon there was a Christmas tree and
gifts for all
the children."
<P>

376   	Mrs Talbot has similar fond memories of Christmas time
(at para 25 of her affidavit sworn 9 December 1997):
<P>

"As I remember most if not all of the children spent Christmas at Lutanda with
us, including Joy.  To my knowledge she was never
left alone whilst others were
away.  I have a vague recollection of an occasion when Joy was taken by Miss
Amy Atkinson for a holiday
in Tasmania.  She was going to visit some people
there, who were interested in her, whether this was at Christmas time I cannot
recall.
 I remember we all went on vacation to Toukley to camp near the
Tuggerah Lakes.  We all enjoyed the water and beaches there very
much,
including Joy, with happy memories for all."
<P>

377   	Mrs Middleton gives evidence that she remembers not some
but most of the children remaining at Lutanda over holiday periods.
 Children
would return to their families if their families were willing to take them in.
For the rest of Lutanda their would be Christmas
trips to Toukley by children
and staff such that "it was just like moving Lutanda."
<P>

378   	Mrs Buxton in her evidence-in-chief emphatically denied
that the plaintiff was ever left at Lutanda on her own over Christmas.
Responding the plaintiff's recollection that she was often left alone she
replied in the following terms (at T 373):
<P>

"<b>BUXTON:	</b>	Definitely wrong.  Very few children went away either because
they had no one to go to.  Some went to visit homes where they were
invited.
At Christmas time there was always a crowd of children and we had a beautiful
Christmas tree, toys, ham and everything that
made Christmas special for the
children.  She was there around those times."
<P>

379   	In accordance with Mrs Buxton's evidence it seems clear
that at times children did go to private homes for the holidays but,
again,
this was rare.  Miss Moorhouse gives evidence that during Joy's teenage years
people did take some children for a holiday
and that they selected the child
but that this was rare and most remained at Lutanda and went to Toukley.  James
Frame gives evidence
that some children went home with their family and some
were taken into families by those who volunteered to have them, usually from
the church.  On most occasions he can remember staying at Lutanda over
Christmas though he remembers that he spent one Christmas
with a family at
Tamworth.
<P>

380   	On this evidence I find and draw the inference that the
plaintiff was never the only child left at the Home over Christmas
and other
holidays.  The plaintiff's evidence on this matter also cannot be regarded as
representing the objective truth of her experiences
at Lutanda.  Her
recollection of events goes against the whole of evidence which suggests that
there were group holidays at Christmas
time and that relatively few children
ever spent holidays away from Lutanda.
<P>

381   	As to the plaintiff's claim that she was one of the
longest term residents at Lutanda, it is a matter of fact that she was
resident
there from her admission on 16 April 1947 until her discharge on 31 July 1960,
a period of just over thirteen years.  The
simple fact is that this was
unavoidable and reflected the realities.  It further reflects the fact that the
child plaintiff had
no other known or interested relatives at the time of her
birth.  Other than having the plaintiff spend a significant time at Lutanda,
the only other practical option for the care of the plaintiff would have been a
transfer to another Home or to the Cootamundra Girls
Home for Aboriginal
children where girls would have been sent from Bomaderry when they came of age
to be transferred (absent finding
foster parents or being adopted).  I will
turn to my reasons in due course, but it should be noted at this point that I
do not find
that the plaintiff was denied any opportunity or chance of being
fostered out or adopted.  It is not to be supposed that the plaintiff's
removal
to another home would not have caused their own significant disruptions to her
life and education.
<P>

382   	On the evidence it is clear that while the plaintiff was
at Lutanda for a number of years she was not the longest resident
child nor the
only child resident there for a considerable number of years. Mr Frame gave
evidence that he left Lutanda when he married
at the age of 21 after spending
seventeen years at Lutanda.  Mrs Tucker (nee Frame) stayed at Lutanda for 11
years.  Miss Moorhouse
was resident at Lutanda for 9 years as was Mrs Godfrey.
Various other witnesses gave evidence of being in Lutanda for 6 and 7 years.
It is undoubtedly true that these periods of years overlapped so that at any
particular time the plaintiff may well have been the
longest term resident but
it would seem from the evidence that this not because she was the only child
who spent considerable time
there.
<P>

383   	Again it is worth noting that no evidence was led to
suggest that any of these other children developed personality disorders
or
other psychiatric disorders despite their long stays at Lutanda.  The
concession has already been made by the counsel for the
plaintiff that for many
like James Frame, Lutanda was a lovely place to live and a family for them.
James Frame it should be remembered
was there for longer than the plaintiff and
never received any special visitors.
<P>

384   	It seems from the evidence that the plaintiff's longevity
at Lutanda was a source of some benefit to the plaintiff. Mrs Middleton
gave
evidence that, if anything, Joy would have been favoured above the other
children because she had been at Lutanda so long. Mrs
Reid, who was Matron
during the last years of the plaintiff's stay at Lutanda, and whose husband was
Superintendent from 1959 onwards
said (at para 6 of her affidavit 13 November
1997):
<P>

"Joy was not treated differently from other children at Lutanda.  If anything
Joy was favoured over the other children at Lutanda
and I can recall other
children complaining about this.  At one time, not long before Joy eventually
left Lutanda, my husband and
I arranged for Joy to learn the piano because we
thought she had musical talent.  Of course the home could not afford to allow
all
the children to take music lessons, so my husband paid for Joy's lessons
out of his own pocket.  He thought that Joy had a nice voice
and she should be
encouraged ...  Often Mr Reid was invited to speak to other churches and he
would sometime take Joy and a couple
of other girls along with him and
sometimes she would give solo performances at these churches." 
<P>

385   	Indeed the plaintiff's own evidence suggests that she
benefited from extraordinary attention and privilege being taken interstate
at
Christmas time by Miss Atkinson on no less than three occasions being to
Adelaide, to Tasmania and to Melbourne respectively.
 Miss Moorhouse gives
evidence that these were privileges, long trips and music lessons, that no
other child received.  There is
also evidence of special treatment flowing to
the plaintiff because of her presumed orphan status.  Under the false
impression that
the plaintiff was their only fully orphaned child, Mrs Buxton
says the plaintiff was treated with `special love, care and gifts'.
 Mrs
Middleton gave evidence that special time at prayer meetings was set aside for
those like Joy who "was by herself" and that
those who attended would often
bring things for Joy.  When parcels of charity arrived from the churches Miss
Middleton said that
things would often be earmarked specially for Joy. Evidence
given by Mrs Talbot at para 19 of her affidavit (9 December 1997) as
follows in
representative of the approach taken to the plaintiff:
<P>

"To my knowledge Joy was always treated the same as all the other children in
everyway.  She was included in every activity and
given the same care, support
and affection as the others.  I never witnessed anything that would have
suggested otherwise."
<P>

386   	Having looked at the allegations contained in the
plaintiff's affidavit, on all the evidence of the plaintiff's treatment
at
Lutanda and having in mind the state of the law and the conditions attendant
when the plaintiff was admitted into Lutanda, I am
not satisfied that any
prejudicial approach or discriminatory action was taken by the staff of Lutanda
against the plaintiff of the
type alleged by the plaintiff.  Nor am I satisfied
that any of the children in care of Lutanda acted in such a way or held such an
attitude.  Many, including Mrs Helies who had grown up with the plaintiff,
considered her a good friend.  Given the objective facts
that the children's
background was not discussed at Lutanda, that the plaintiff's Aboriginality was
not common knowledge and that
many children, like the plaintiff, had little
external family attention, it is inconceivable and I find as a fact that the
children
did not treat the plaintiff differently because of her Aboriginality
or for any other reason.  In the words of Mrs Morsillo at para
5 of her
affidavit (6 January 1998), as far as the children were concerned, they were
"all in the same boat".
<P>

<b><u>Adoption and Fostering and the Potential for Maternal
Deprivation:</u></b>
<P>

387   	As I have said, it was further alleged by the plaintiff
that she was not offered placement with families for the purposes
of adoption
or fostering out.  This is one of the matters particularised in her assertion
that she was treated with discrimination.
 An important allegation in the
plaintiff's case is that in respect of adoption and fostering, as well as
generally, the AWB failed
in its duty "to exercise reasonable care to protect
the plaintiff from the foreseeable risk of mental injury brought about by the
conditions in which she was reared and continued to be reared at all times from
1942 onwards".  In expert evidence it has been suggested
that it is by means of
maternal deprivation and due to a deprivation of attachment, that the plaintiff
has suffered mental injury.
 When assessing the validity of the plaintiff's
claim that she was denied, inter alia, adoption and fostering, and thereby
suffered
maternal deprivation, one must bear in mind both the objective
circumstances and the state of the law as it was at the time the plaintiff
was
in care at Lutanda.
<P>

388   	Under the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  there
was no provision for adoption of a "ward".  There was no counterpart provision
to the adoption provision of s 9 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  As
regards the matter of adoption of a child in New South Wales, the provisions of
Part XIX of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  applied.  Application had to
be made to the court or the Minister (s 163).  The court was required to make
an order.  Section 167
prevented the making of an order unless the court was
satisfied of a number of matters set fourth in s 167 including (d) that the
mother consented to the adoption of an illegitimate child.  The court could
order dispensation from compliance with consent obligations
if it was just and
reasonable to do so.  At common law there was no power to adopt.  As to
adoption generally see  <b><u>Attorney-General  v  Prince &amp; Gardner</u></b>
(supra).
<P>

389   	The view adopted by the Board (in a memorandum 17
September 1945) was that the Act "did not provide for the outright adoption
of
an Aboriginal child or ward of the Board".  Such a view was expressed in
connection with a child LL (DOB May 1943) then resident
at Bomaderry Children's
Home.  In respect of this child who was likewise to the plaintiff of fair
appearance, it appears that by
arrangement with the Department of Child Welfare
(July 1946) the AWB was informed that the Child Welfare Department was prepared
to proceed on behalf of the child "LL" to have the application of a Mrs B to
adopt the child LL approved. Mrs B appears to have been
of European descent and
prior to being approved to adopt LL was subject to n inspection as to her
suitability and home life.
<P>

390   	The evidence would suggest that the AWB would not as a
matter of "policy" or of duty under s 7(1)(a) of the Act participate
in the
adoption of a fair-skinned child to other than persons of European descent.  I
find on the state of the evidence that the
plaintiff was not at any time denied
any chance or opportunity of being adopted.
<P>

391   	With respect to the fostering out of the plaintiff, it
should be noted that prior to the 1943 amendments there was no express
power to
foster, nor do I consider that there was an implied power.  In 1943 the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  was amended to permit of boarding out
or the placing of a "ward" in the care of foster parents.  By this amendment
the position
of a child ward under the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>
was thereby brought into accord with the general position of a child under the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.
<P>

392   	The plaintiff was born in September 1942.  By October
1942 the plaintiff had already been admitted as a ward to the only
available
and suitable home being the UAM Aboriginal Children's Home at Bomaderry.  At
the time of the plaintiff's birth, the express
power of fostering out children
to foster parents did not exist and the child plaintiff could not have been
fostered. In any event
accepting as I do the history that the plaintiff's
mother did not tell her relatives of the birth of the plaintiff, and accepting
the disinterest of the father (assuming as a soldier at war he was still alive)
and his family, there was no prospect of the plaintiff
being fostered with
relatives or with the father or his relatives.
<P>

393   	Even in respect of the fostering of a ward under the Act
after 1943, no permanency with any foster parents could be guaranteed
even
assuming such a suitable person could be found. Apart from the absence of
equivalent provisions of ss 9 and 10 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>,
there were the provisions of s 11D(1)(h) and (i) of the Act relating to the
Board's authority.  Foster parents too could hand back
the care of the ward.
Fostering, like adoption, was a matter of some factual and legal complexity and
difficulty.  In 1952 the Board
in a letter to the UAM indicated its policy. I
quote:
<P>

"The policy of the Aborigines Welfare Board in relation to the maintenance and
training of Aboriginal children favours the system
of boarding-out, rather than
placing them in an institution.  It is felt that the aboriginal child reared as
an integral part of
a family, either white or aboriginal, gains a better chance
of ultimate assimilation.  In any case, training as one of a family group
has a
more beneficial effect on the character building of the child than the
conditions of life usually associated with an institution."
<P>

394   	As in the case of adoption, in respect of children
considered to be too fair there were placement problems confronting the
AWB due
to its standard policy at the time of assimilation and perhaps the provisions
of s 7(1)(a) of the Act.  For example, in a
memo of June 1954, Mrs English
observed "M, who was brought to this office today is too fair to be placed
either in Kinchela Home
or with aboriginal foster parents" [my emphasis].  In
consequence of his appearance, this child, M, was placed in the Burnside Homes
and was later moved to the Salvation Army Boy's Home.  There is nothing to
suggest that he was not available for suitable fostering,
or that potential
suitable foster parents were even interested in fostering him.
<P>

395   	Nothing is said in the plaintiff's case as to whether
aboriginal foster parents, assuming such were available, were interested
in
fostering such a fair child in any case.  There is also evidence that in the
Aboriginal Newsletter in the 1950's the Board was
actively seeking the
assistance of the aboriginal people in generally fostering children.  Indeed
there were problems from time to
time of there not being enough foster parents
available in the community to foster under the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act
</u></b> or even under the <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  There is no
evidence touching upon difficulties in fostering (or adopting) at different
ages, or as a child got older.
<P>

396   	There were also problems of matching potential foster
patents with a ward for the purposes of fostering.  I doubt that the
matter of
potential maternal attachment would even have been thought of as a
consideration in the 1940's-50s in the case of fostering
under the Act or the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  There were, as I have said, more considerable
practical difficulties with respect to fostering.  How one could determine in
advance
whether there would be an attachment or bonding to a foster parent or
adoptive parent (or a staff member in the alternative) is not
explained by the
plaintiff's experts.  There were, it appears, enough difficulties in finding
suitable foster parents with appropriate
fostering skills: see also the
<b>Regulations and Schedules [1944]</b>  and thereafter as to foster care
requirements.  Indeed in his 1946 and 1947 Reports, the Minister for
Instructions referred to the
fact that fewer and fewer citizens were willing to
foster children.  In his 1950 report he referred also to the fact that there
were
increasing numbers of children who were unsuitable for placement with
foster parents.
<P>

397   	I find that the plaintiff was not denied any chance or
opportunity of being fostered whether permanently, temporarily or
at all.
There was no real or practical choice in the present case, but to have placed
the plaintiff at Bomaderry and then transferred
her to Lutanda, and presumably
retaining her for her own benefit at Lutanda.  There is in any event no
evidence on the plaintiff's
case that the plaintiff was not considered for
fostering or was considered not suitable for fostering.  There is no evidence
that
suitable foster parents could be found in the instant matter for fostering
the plaintiff for short or long periods.  There was no
evidence offered to show
that, assuming potential foster parents had come forward, that they would have
come forward for good and
proper reasons or that they would have been
considered suitable to be foster parents for the plaintiff.  Importantly too,
given the
plaintiff's assertion of the her deprivation of attachment and of her
maternal deprivation, even had there been an acceptable and
suitable foster
family, who was willing to accept the plaintiff long term, there was no
evidence offered to demonstrate that there
would have been the attachment or
matching with the plaintiff that the plaintiff asserts she was denied.  It is
all speculative theory.
<P>

398   	In any event the deprivation of "attachment" or "maternal
deprivation", which it is alleged on the plaintiff's case that
the plaintiff
experienced, would not necessarily be solved by fostering or adoption.  As much
is stated in the 1951 World Health
Organisation Report prepared by Dr Bowlby
and tendered in the plaintiff's case.  In that report Bowlby points out, quite
significantly,
that even in a "good institution" carers can come and go and
attachment can be often broken.  Additionally he notes that "house mothers"
in
institutions or even devoted foster parents may not have the same sense of
obligation to a child which all but the worst parents
possess.  He made the
point that often when other interests and duties make demands on the foster
parent, the foster child takes
second place and "the child has therefore a
right to distrust them".  In so saying, he countenances that the fostering
relationship
may in fact quite legitimately be one characterised by some
mistrust and not the open mutuality that would seem to be required to
facilitate a relationship of the type sought by the plaintiff.
<P>

399   	Indeed, the potential impossibility of achieving bonding
or attachment (quite apart from the problems of providing proper
nurture) is
illustrated in evidence by Dr Waters (at T 133-4) where he discusses the
practical consequences associated with the fostering
of a child at four and a
half and at eight.  He states:
<P>

"<b>WATERS:		</b>What we know, even form the research, even in cases where that
happens [when children at the age of four and a half are taken out
of one home
and adopted or fostered into another home] by virtue of the death of the
parents where they appear to have had good parents
up until the age of four or
so, is that those children are more likely to be disturbed as adults.  They are
not as likely as if it
occurs at the age of eight, for instance after eight
years of satisfactorily being a happy family member."
<P>

400   	What appears from Dr Waters testimony is that even at the
age of eight, there can be no guarantee that the risk of deprivation
of
attachment can be eliminated so that it would not later mature into a more
severe mental disorder.  Whether a child by accident
or choice is left without
a bond with a parent seems to make no difference.  This seems to illustrate the
very problem raised by
Dr Bowlby, that often it is outside of one's control to
ensure a stable bond.  Bonds can be broken for many reasons whether it be
within a family home with "good parents" or in a good institution with
attentive carers.
<P>

401   	The evidence of Dr Waters also raises the issue in the
present case of the situation had the plaintiff been left with her
mother, on
the assumption that the plaintiff's mother could have been ready willing and
able to retain primary care of the child
plaintiff.  I quote from his
cross-examination (at T 133-4):
<P>

"<b>BARRY:	</b>	If the child, for example had been left with a mother who was
unable to cope for reasons of alcoholism or otherwise and the child
had been
given with its natural mother a disturbed upbringing, the child could also
develop a personality disorder of the kind you
believe the plaintiff has?
<P>

<b>WATERS</b>:		That's correct.
<P>

<b>BARRY:	</b>	You observed in relation to the plaintiff's mother that the
Kenmore records demonstrate a very long history of alcoholism?
<P>

<b>WATERS:	</b>	Yes
<P>

<b>BARRY:	</b>	So that if that be true and if the plaintiff had remained with
her mother, she could well have developed the same condition that
you had
diagnosed in any event?
<P>

<b>WATERS:	</b>	If the mother had been alcoholic at the time this child was
young, yes."
<P>

402   	It is known that in 1989 the plaintiff's mother was alive
but at Kenmore Hospital where Dr Heimer, a psychiatrist, was treating
her (see
his report Exhibit 3 - 15 December 1989).  Of significance is the history of
the plaintiff's mother given by Dr Heimer (at
para 2 of his Report):
<P>

"For most of her life she has been a heavy user of alcohol, with alcohol
related problems being a significant part of her current
problems, that is
moderately speech cognitive impatient with disorientation in time [sic], short
term memory recall, her gait abnormal
etc. In 1983 she had hallucinations and
delusions that persisted for some time after the alcohol was ceased. Probably a
diagnosis
of schizophrenia, although alcoholic hallucinosis would be more
accurate."
<P>

403   	A point to be made on this evidence is that if the
plaintiff remained with her mother, she could also have suffered maternal
deprivation or had inadequate bonding and attachment (or none at all). In such
a situation, the plaintiff would not have able to
sue her mother in respect of
these same alleged disorder: see  <b><u>Hahn v Conley</u></b>  supra.  On the
plaintiff's case it is perhaps submitted that the plaintiff may sue a third
party carer for not providing that, which
her mother may not have been able to
provide, and cannot be sued for.
<P>

404   	It appears that no guarantee of proper maternal care and
attachment sufficient to guard against later mental illness can
be guaranteed
in any circumstances.  On the facts of this case it is open to find that even
had the plaintiff been left with her
mother, there could be no guarantee of
attachment or bonding with the plaintiff.  Likewise, Dr Waters was asked in
cross-examination
whether, assuming the plaintiff had formed a satisfactory
bonding relationship with Miss Atkinson, that relationship was of a sort
which
would have assisted her in her psychological development.  He replied (at T
134):
<P>

"<b>WATERS:		</b>It would have reduced the risk of an adverse outcome.  It
wouldn't guarantee that there would [not] be an adverse outcome, but it
would
reduce the risk, yes."
<P>

405   	It would seem clear that, given the facts of this case,
there could have been no assurance of the plaintiff receiving suitable
maternal
care or attachment, even involving a natural mother.
<P>

406   	The point remains that adoption or fostering would not in
any event have solved the plaintiff's problem in the instant matter.
 She has
alleged she was discriminated against on the basis of not being considered for
adoption or offered places for fostering.
 She was not.  I reject that
submission for the reasons given and in light of the state of the law and the
attendant policy of assimilation
of the Board including that under statute.  I
find also, that the risk of potential maternal deprivation could not reasonably
or
practicably be guarded against or that any risk could with the exercise of
reasonable care be eliminated.
<P>

<b><u>Allegations of Abuse:</u></b>
<P>

407   	I have already noted that the allegations of sexual abuse
made against various people, the allegations of abuse against Mrs
Buxton and
the allegations against Miss Simpson are not urged by the plaintiff as being
evidence of the objective truth of life at
Lutanda.  The plaintiff has urged
that they be treated as evidence of a disorder of attachment.  As indicated, I
have rejected that
submission and found that it was not a product of any
psychiatric disorder.  I have dealt with that submission and with the
consequences
of its rejection as it relates to the credit of the plaintiff and
the reliability of her evidence.  I repeat here also what I said
earlier that I
find that these events alleged by the plaintiff did not occur.  Several
allegations however remain to be considered,
there having been no specific
concession by the plaintiff that they were not true.  I turn to consider
them.
<P>

408   	With respect to the allegations made against Miss
Dalwood, Miss Atkinson and Mr Murray, it should be noted that Miss Dalwood
and
Mr Murray are now deceased with the present condition of Miss Atkinson unclear
on the evidence before me.  In any case none of
these people gave evidence at
trial or were present to face the plaintiff's allegations.  The evidence was
that Miss Dalwood founded
the Lutanda home out of her genuine concern for
orphaned and needy children.  She ran the home in the role of Superintendent
and
Matron for just short of 20 years and was replaced in those positions only
after her death in 1950.  Miss Moorhouse gives Miss Dalwood
credit for
"handling her very well" and said she was a person who appealed to her sense of
humour.  She gave evidence at para 4 of
her affidavit sworn 3 December 1997
that Miss Dalwood was a very tolerant lady who taught everyone to have pride in
their work and
was a great motivator, but she was strict and could be
remote.
<P>

409   	The evidence was that Miss Atkinson loved and cared for
the plaintiff.  On her own evidence Miss Atkinson demonstrated intimate
care
for the plaintiff. Mrs Buxton gave evidence (at T 375) when asked whether she
was a cruel type of person, Mrs Buxton replied
that she was a "very kind gentle
quiet lady."  Likewise (at T 212), Mrs Hancock describes Miss Atkinson as a
"very gentle loving
old lady" and that she and the plaintiff were quite close
in their relationship.
<P>

410   	The evidence from Mrs Buxton (at T 375) was that Mr
Murray never used a strap as a routine form of punishment as is alleged
by the
plaintiff at para 43 of her affidavit.  Again it is worthy of noting that no
allegations of corporal punishment were made
to Dr Cooley in 1960 or in any of
the extensive hospital records from 1962-5.  Likewise, no allegation of
corporal punishment appears
in the report of the parole officer, Miss Barnett
in 1962.  Miss Moorhouse described Mr Murray in evidence as a "wonderful man"
(at
T 358) and a "real gentleman" (at T 339). Mrs Godfrey, who came to Lutanda
in 1952, described Mr Murray (at T 303) as "the gentlest
man I think I have
ever known".  Mrs Hancock described Mr Murray as a real English gentleman (at T
217).
<P>

411   	The plaintiff's allegations against these people are not
supported by independent corroboration.  Given the evidence of these
witnesses
and given that I have already expressed a need to treat the plaintiff's
evidence with care, I am satisfied that the plaintiff
is not objectively
correct in respect of the matters alleged in her affidavit as occurring in
respect of these three persons.  In
saying so I have regard to the inability of
those who are deceased to rebut the allegations made against them.  In the
light of my
findings as to the reliability and credibility of the plaintiff's
evidence, I reject these allegations of the plaintiff.
<P>

412   	With respect to the allegations against Miss Simpson that
she assaulted the plaintiff by throwing her against the bathroom
wall such that
she broke the plaintiff's arm and collarbone, these are conceded by the
plaintiff as being distortions and not objectively
true.  I find that the
plaintiff's evidence was not objectively true on that count.  Mrs Tucker gives
evidence (at para 21-2 of her
affidavit sworn 30 November 1997), which I
accept, that:
<P>

"I can remember that Joy's arm was broken in a fight with my sister Helen.
There was a raised path (about fifteen inches high) leading
outside from on of
the back doors.  Only one side of the path had a railing on it.  Joy and Helen
were having a physical fight as
they were coming out the backdoor and they both
fell over the unguarded side of the path.
<P>

I can also remember Joy breaking her collarbone one day when we were walking in
a paddock with Mr Murray.  There was a fallen tree
that was wet and slippery.
Mr Murray told us not to climb on it.  Nevertheless Joy and a few other girls
did so.  Joy slipped on
the trunk and broke he collarbone."
<P>

413   	With respect to the allegations against Mrs Buxton, these
are conceded by the plaintiff as being distortions of memory. 
I am satisfied
on the evidence that the plaintiff's memory on these matters is not objectively
true.  As regards the allegation that
the plaintiff was given morphine, I
reject that submission.  I accept Mrs Buxton's evidence (at T 374) that no
child was given morphine,
that it was a narcotic and was not kept in the
medical cabinet at Lutanda.  I find that she was never given morphine.
<P>

414   	With respect to allegations against Mrs Buxton that she
made the plaintiff stand with her hands over her head for 4-5 hours,
the
plaintiff concedes that these are distortions (at p 86 of submissions).  I find
the plaintiff is not credible in respect of that
allegation.  The allegation
was put to Mrs Buxton in examination-in-chief by counsel for the defendants, Mr
Barry QC, and the relevant
passages from the plaintiff's evidence read to her.
When asked whether she did as was alleged she replied (at T 375):
<P>

"<b>BUXTON:	</b>	I may have made her standing the corner, but the usual time
would have been fifteen minutes, twenty minutes at the most, certainly
not five
hours.
<P>

<b>BARRY:	</b>	With your nursing background, would it have been possible for a
child to hold his hand over his head for four or five hours?
<P>

<b>BUXTON:		</b>	Definitely not.  I think it would be very detrimental for a
child to have stood there for half an hour."
<P>

415   	Mrs Buxton was the subject of intense cross-examination
in which it was sought to persuade me to reject her evidence.  Notwithstanding
this, the length and intensity of the cross-examination has given me the
opportunity of seeing and hearing Mrs Buxton in the witness
box and I am
persuaded as a consequence of this that she is an honest, reliable and credible
witness.  Mrs Buxton's evidence as indicated
above is clear and I accept it.
<P>

416   	With respect to the allegation that the plaintiff was
caught and punished for wearing lipstick, I reject as unreal and incredible
the
allegation by the plaintiff that she was made to stand naked in the dining hall
as punishment.  I have already referred to the
plaintiff's submission on this
matter (at p 28 of their submissions in reply), specifically, that the
plaintiff concedes that this
allegation is "inherently implausible".  With
respect, I agree.  I agree with the submission of the defendants that this
"bizarre
description does not appear consistent with the values and beliefs of
a Christian home in Pennant Hills in the 1950's".  The plaintiff
offers no
independent corroboration of this allegation.  Indeed, even Miss Christie, whom
the plaintiff alleged was in her presence
at the time she was caught wearing
lipstick does not corroborate her presence.  She gave evidence that it was a
"horrible, horrible
incident" but that she was living at Epping at the time and
would not have been at the Home when the plaintiff was punished.  None
of the
other witnesses reference it.  I am prepared on the material before me to find
as a fact, and I do find as a fact, that no
such incident occurred.
<P>

417   	With respect to allegations made against Mr Reid, those
are not submitted as being objectively true.  I reject these allegations
and I
also reject the submission that this allegation is one founded on or the
product of any psychiatric disorder or consequence
thereof.  They are serious
matters as alleged, and the plaintiff as I have already said, should accept the
consequences as it impacts
on her credit and reliability from them being first
asserted and then being openly conceded as being untrue.
<P>

<b><u>The Assertions of Self-Mutilation:</u></b>
<P>

418   	The plaintiff has submitted that I should find on the
evidence before me that the plaintiff engaged in acts of self-mutilation,
namely that she cut her arms.  The plaintiff gave scant evidence on this matter
of cutting her arms.  She claims that Mrs Middleton
the Matron made
observations about her having mud in her veins.  From time to time after this
incident, during her stay at Lutanda
and on other occasions, she said that she
cut herself to "see whether the colour of her blood was different from that of
other children
at the Home."
<P>

419   	The plaintiff accepts that there was significant dispute
about whether the plaintiff engaged in self-mutilation.  The plaintiff's
submission particularly involves resolving a conflict between Mr Sattler and
Mrs Buxton.  The contest of credit between witnesses
in respect of whether the
plaintiff cut her arms consumed much time during the trial and is of great
significance to the plaintiff's
case.  The plaintiff does not resile from her
assertions that she cut her arms.  These assertions are pressed and the
plaintiff has
made strong submissions on the evidence before me to persuade me
that the plaintiff should be believed on this matter.
<P>

420   	In addition to the plaintiff's evidence, the plaintiff in
her submissions has placed heavily reliance on the evidence of
Mr Sattler to
assist her case. Mr Sattler, as I have said, served on the Board of Directors
of Lutanda from 1948 till 1981.  An affidavit
from Mr Sattler (sworn November
1997) was prepared on behalf of the defendants.  His affidavit was read in the
plaintiff's case.
 Mr Sattler gave evidence that he recalled that the plaintiff
cut her arms on a number of occasions and that he remembered having
seen
bandages on the plaintiff's arms.  The cuts, he said, were superficial and
never warranted outside intervention.  The plaintiff
relies on this to support
her argument that the plaintiff engaged in self-mutilation.
<P>

421   	The evidence led by the defendants on this matter
primarily comes from Mrs Middleton and Mrs Buxton.  Mrs Middleton was Matron
between 1956 and 1959 when the plaintiff was aged 14 to 17 years.  Mrs Buxton
was Matron immediately preceding Mrs Middleton, from
1953 to 1956 when the
plaintiff was aged 11 to 14 years.  Both Mrs Middleton and Mrs Buxton were
trained nurses at the time when
they held the position of Matron at Lutanda.
Mrs Middleton, in her affidavit sworn 16 December 1997, said that she could not
remember
Joy cutting her arms at any time.  She could not remember saying or
hearing any other person say that Joy had mud in her blood. 
She said (at T
235) that the cutting of the arms by the plaintiff never happened while she was
at Lutanda and that such a thing like
that would stand out in one's mind for
their entire life.  She said there was never any indication of that type of
behaviour.
<P>

422   	Mrs Buxton also testified (at T 397) that she never knew
the plaintiff to cut her arms.  She gave evidence that she alone
kept the key
to the medicine cabinet and would have had the responsibility to bandage the
plaintiff's arms, had the plaintiff done
what she claims, but that at no stage
did the plaintiff cut her arms.  She says emphatically (at T 398):
<P>

"<b>BUXTON:	</b>	I am being perfectly honest, and there was no cutting of her
arms in my time."
<P>

423   	Mrs Middleton (at T 237) gave further evidence that had
the plaintiff cut her arms she would have immediately taken her to
the
hospital.  Such an action as someone cutting their arms, she said, would have
raised to her concerns about their emotional well-being.
 Had such a thing
happened with the plaintiff, she would have been taken to the hospital or to Dr
Lovell for referral for further
help.
<P>

424   	In cross-examination, Mrs Middleton was questioned at
length about a conversation which she had with two then law students
from the
Kingsford Legal Centre in September 1994.  When pressed on the matter, Mrs
Middleton said she could not recall the conversation.
 Mr Hutley put to her
that she had said various things during that conversation.  It was suggested
that she said, inter alia, words
to the effect that,  "Nowadays they seem to
enjoy knowing they have it in their veins?"  and,  "The records said that she
was aboriginal,
but let's face it, they are different to us."  She denied
saying these things.  I admitted evidence of these two then law students,
now
solicitors, Miss Collier and Miss Levy over objection.
<P>

425   	The plaintiff claimed that Mrs Middleton had, by these
remarks, made prior inconsistent statements. In his lengthy submissions,
Mr
Hutley submitted that, on the basis of Mr Sattler's evidence and on the added
basis of the evidence and recorded notes of Miss
Collier and Miss Levy, that I
should find that Mrs Middleton should not be believed on matters concerning
racial discrimination (or
the alleged absence thereof) or when she makes
self-serving statements.  The plaintiff further submitted that Mr Sattler
should be
believed over all the other witnesses including Mrs Buxton and Mrs
Middleton on the issue of the plaintiff cutting her arms.
<P>

426   	For the reasons that appear, I reject these arguments and
the basis for such.  I further reject Mr Sattler's evidence so
far as the
plaintiff seeks to rely on it in respect of her allegedly cutting her arms.  I
have already commented on parts of Mr Sattler's
evidence in relation to the
plaintiff being a "troublesome child".  His evidence contained significant
errors as against the objective
background of the plaintiff's arrival and
residence at Lutanda.  The evidence of Mr Sattler was wrong in relation to his
recollection
of how the plaintiff came to be at Lutanda and about where the
plaintiff resided before coming to Lutanda. As I have said, he was
not involved
in the daily care of children at Lutanda.  He was on the Board of Directors and
the evidence from Mrs Godfrey (at T
314) was that Mr Sattler made visits once a
month to Lutanda over the period of his directorship.  Mrs Morsillo gave
evidence (at
T 210) that Mr Sattler was `interested' in the home but was not
deeply involved in the day to day running of Lutanda as, during the
time
Lutanda was at Wentworth Falls, Mr Sattler lived in Sydney.  It should also be
said that Mr Sattler, as opposed to Mrs Buxton
and Mrs Middleton is not
medically trained.  Unlike Mrs Buxton, he was not directly responsible for the
medical care of the plaintiff.
 It was the Matrons, in this case Mrs Buxton and
Mrs Middleton, who were in the best position to know whether the plaintiff cut
her
arms.  I accept their evidence that the plaintiff did not cut her arms and
for the reasons already stated I do not accept Mr Sattler
on the issue of the
plaintiff cutting her arms.
<P>

427   	I find that, in light of my findings as to the evidence
of Mr Sattler and in respect of the evidence of the plaintiff, the
plaintiff
did not cut her arms whilst at Lutanda.  This in turn carries with it the
consequence that the medical evidence of Dr Katz
and Mrs Bull to the extent
that it relies upon the views of Mr Sattler as to the plaintiff cutting her
arms, should not be accepted.
<P>

428   	Having said that an additional factor convinces me of the
unreliability of the evidence offered on behalf of the plaintiff
with respect
to the assertion that the plaintiff cut her arms.  In material respects the
evidence given by the plaintiff and by Mr
Sattler seems to vary in respect of
the nature and timing of the plaintiff allegedly cutting her arms.  The
plaintiff asserts (at
para 57 of her affidavit affirmed 20 November 1996) that
the incidents of cutting her arms began after a conversation that she had
with
Mrs Middleton.  During the time Mrs Middleton was at Lutanda between 1956-1959,
the plaintiff would have been between the ages
of 14-17 years old, making the
plaintiff's age at which that conversation happened no younger than 14 years.
Upon the evidence of
Mr Sattler however, the incidents of cutting of the
plaintiff's arms in para 18 of his affidavit sworn in November 1997 began from
time to time after the plaintiff was ten years old.  That would have placed the
start of the incidents of self-mutilation during
the time in which Mrs Buxton
was the Matron, not Mrs Middleton.
<P>

429   	The approach taken by the plaintiff through counsel to
these differing recollections is found at p 98 of the plaintiff's
submissions
where she states:
<P>

"In the case of all witnesses except Mrs Buxton the force of the denials must
be judged by reference to the limited opportunity
afforded to the witnesses of
observing the behaviour which occurred for some time after the plaintiff turned
<u>ten</u>.  The true conflict in the evidence is between Mr Sattler on the one
hand and <u>Mrs Buxton</u> on the other." [my emphasis]
<P>

430   	To the extent that plaintiff prefers the evidence of Mr
Sattler and asserts a conflict of his evidence with Mrs Buxton, I
unhesitatingly accept the impressive Mrs Buxton. Having seen her and heard her,
I thought that she was a witness who was reliable,
credible and seeking to tell
the truth as I believe she did.  She was a qualified carer devoted to the
welfare and advancement of
her charges.  I find on Mrs Buxton's evidence, the
plaintiff did not cut her arms during the time when Mrs Buxton was Matron, or
indeed at all.
<P>

431   	Alternatively, assuming a conflict between the evidence
of the plaintiff and Mrs Middleton in respect of the plaintiff cutting
her
arms, I accept the evidence of Mrs Middleton over that of the plaintiff.  In
submissions, Miss Adamson for the plaintiff stated
that the attack made by the
plaintiff on Mrs Middleton's credit is in respect of "one issue only and that
is to do with racial differentiation
or discrimination".  The submission was to
the effect that her views prevented her from recognising the import of the
plaintiff's
behaviour and that it blinded her in her assessment of the child's
behaviour.  I reject these submissions.
<P>

432   	I reject the submission of the plaintiff that I should
not believe Mrs Middleton in respect of racial discrimination or where
she
makes "self-serving" statements.  My impression after seeing Mrs Middleton was
that she was a credible and reliable witness trying
to be helpful and not
seeking to be evasive or over defensive.  My overall impression was that this
77 year old lady had been a responsible
dedicated carer (including a nurse) to
numerous children including the plaintiff and that she did not merit the
somewhat objectionable
criticisms made of her.  I consider that her overall
recall was good and that she was trying to be and was being forthright and
honest
in her testimony.  Upon the basis of the evidence of Mrs Middleton, I
find that the plaintiff did not cut her arms during the time
that Mrs Middleton
was Matron or at all.
<P>

433   	In respect of the evidence of Ms Collier and Ms Levy, the
evidence of Ms Collier was that she perceived this present case
as one having
racial overtones.  She said that as a new student allocated to the case at the
Kingsford Legal Centre she knew that
it was a "stolen children" case.  Before
she saw Mrs Middleton she was aware of the allegations of physical and
psychological abuse
being claimed and which have subsequently been admitted as
not objectively true.  She had never previously prepared witness statements
or
trained in interview techniques.  The notes taken by her did not always reflect
the questions to which answers were given and
her recorded answers were in
summary form.
<P>

434   	The so called record of interview (an inaccurate
description) was not sent by Ms Collier to Mrs Middleton to sign and confirm.
The record of interview was not a transcript of what was actually said.  The
evidence shows that two people sat down at one and the
same time to compile a
document based on separate memories and separate notes.  Ms Levy likewise did
not send the `record of interview'
to Mrs Middleton.  She too understood Mrs
Middleton to be an important witness and that the present case had racial
overtones.  My
impression was that the interview, the preparation of the notes
and the record of the interview was perhaps "somewhat amateurish",
that was my
note at the time.
<P>

435   	From what I have said, I am satisfied that nothing in the
evidence of Ms Collier or Ms Levy persuades me to reject Mrs Middleton's
evidence.  Having seen and heard Mrs Middleton who I regard as an impressive
witness, I prefer her evidence to that of Miss Collier
and Miss Levy.  I find
in general that the evidence of Mrs Middleton is reliable and credible.  I
accept the defendants' submission
that the evidence of Ms Collier and Ms Levy
is to an extent unreliable.  If I am wrong in this finding and even if there
were remarks
about Aborigines made by Mrs Middleton in conversations, that of
itself does not alter my view that Mrs Middleton's evidence is generally
honest, credible and reliable and can be safely acted upon.  Nor would it
suggest to me that this generally credible lady would have
allowed her views,
as suggested in the plaintiff's submissions, to blind her to her professional
responsibilities or make her unconscientious
in her duties in caring for the
plaintiff.
<P>

<b><u>Summary of Conclusions of Fact:</u></b>
<P>

436   	The plaintiff's case really fails on my findings of fact
and on the lay evidence.
<P>

437   	The defendants submit that the plaintiff's placement at
Bomaderry for control of custody by the AWB was lawful, being with
the consent
or at the request of the plaintiff's mother; that the plaintiff's legal
guardian was at all times the plaintiff's mother;
that the transfer of the
plaintiff to Lutanda was with the consent of the mother; that the transfer to
Lutanda was in accordance
with the Board's statutory duty; that the transfer
was for the purpose of giving the plaintiff a better chance in life than if she
had remained at Bomaderry.  The plaintiff concedes that the above conclusions
of fact "are appropriate".  Accordingly I make such
findings.
<P>

438   	The defendants submit that Lutanda was a caring
environment and staffed by persons who honestly acted in what they perceived
to
be the best interests of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff submits that this
conclusion cannot be made with respect to the plaintiff's
experience having
regard to the attachment disorder.  I reject the plaintiff's submission and
consider that the finding urged by
the defendants should be made.
<P>

439   	It is appropriate for me to make some list some further
findings of fact flowing from the evidence I have just outlined.
 I make the
following further findings:
<P>

1.	That the defendants in placing the child at Bomaderry was not acting
improperly or negligently;
<P>

2.	That the defendants placed the child at Bomaderry as a matter of policy or
further or alternatively this was the place where
it was reasonable and
practicable for the child to be placed to be cared for and raised;
<P>

3.	That, under the legislation, the Board had no adoption power.  It had no
fostering power until 1943.  In respect of fostering,
no permanency could be
guaranteed even assuming the availability of suitable and "matching" foster
parents at any time;
<P>

4.	That at no time was the plaintiff at Bomaderry (or later at Lutanda) denied
the chance of adoption or of fostering;
<P>

5.	That at no time did the plaintiff's mother consent to any adoption of the
plaintiff;
<P>

6.	That, whilst at Bomaderry, the plaintiff's mother visited her on occasions.
This finding is based on the hearsay account of the
plaintiff to Dr Waters in
October 1991, in turn based upon my acceptance of her claim of what her mother
"told" her;
<P>

7.	That at no time did the plaintiff's mother seek to obtain care, custody or
control of the plaintiff or restoration of the plaintiff
to her;
<P>

8.	That whilst at Bomaderry the plaintiff formed a particular attachment and
bond with a UAM sister, Sister Saville who displayed
to the plaintiff
particular individual attention care and affection;
<P>

9.	That Sister Saville and her colleagues on the staff were devoted caring and
"loving" adults voluntarily working in a home or
institution environment doing
the best they could in caring for children generally including the
plaintiff;
<P>

10.	The defendants had no staff employed at Bomaderry but oversaw Bomaderry
including having at least annual general inspections
and perhaps more by its
officers;
<P>

11.	That there was no evidence that Sister Saville or any member of the staff
at Bomaderry was ready, willing or able to participate
in forming any permanent
attachment to the plaintiff and that it was unreasonable or not practicable to
require that any such person
could be expected to do at all.  Nor could the
defendant AWB (or the UAM) be expected to require such a staff member or any
person
to form a human relationship of the type suggested by the plaintiff,
whether permanent or temporary.  I find that, quite apart from
any suggestion
by the plaintiff's experts that a permanent or temporary mother substitute
should have been available, not only did
reasonable care not require it, but
there is no basis for concluding that such a hypothetical mother substitute of
the type and with
the qualifications and credentials described by the experts
was available at the UAM Mission at Bomaderry in NSW or even that with
reasonable care, such a person could be found during the relevant period;
<P>

12.	That notwithstanding this, if bonding and attachment involved learning to
know and trust one individual and the presence of
a warm, intimate, continuous
relationship, that that is what the plaintiff in fact experienced with Sister
Saville at Bomaderry,
and followed up with to an extent, actual bonding and
attachment with Miss Atkinson at Lutanda;
<P>

13.	That during the plaintiff's stay at Bomaderry form 1942-1947 the plaintiff
displayed no abnormal or unusual behavioural problems
or disturbance that would
indicate the need for external assistance or intervention.  I infer and find
that her behaviour was normal
and that nothing occurred warranting her referral
for any conduct or behavioural problem to any "third party" for advice or
attention;
<P>

15.	That at the time of the plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda the plaintiff was
intelligent, religious and, I infer, well behaved
and apparently a "normal"
child;
<P>

16.	That in 1947 her behaviour was normal for a girl of her tender years with
nothing untoward in it marking or suggesting that
she was not a normal child,
displaying no abnormal, troublesome or unusual behavioural or psychological
other problems or problems
indicating a disturbed child;
<P>

17.	That at the time of her transfer to Lutanda a medical certificate as to her
health (as required by Lutanda upon admission in
1947) was probably provided
before she was admitted to Lutanda;
<P>

18.	That the transfer to Lutanda was not improper or negligent but was done in
good faith also in the perceived interests of the
plaintiff and for her
benefit.  It was also a transfer approved by the Board because of then current
policy and legislation and because
it shared their view that in the plaintiff's
interests that she be transferred;
<P>

19.	That there was no reason to take the plaintiff to one of the few child
guidance clinics in 1947 at or about the time of the
plaintiff's transfer to
Lutanda or shortly thereafter and that reasonable care did not require such;
<P>

20.	That at the time of the transfer the plaintiff was and remained a ward of
the Board as she had been pursuant to s 7(2) of the
Act.  That she remained a
ward as such until when aged 18 in 1960 she was no longer a ward by virtue of
her age under s 3 of the
Act;
<P>

21.	That Bomaderry was a caring environment and that in the circumstances she
received love, attention and care being the "next
best thing" to being raised
by her won mother had she been willing and able to do so;
<P>

22.	That the plaintiff in fact received some attachment and bonding whilst at
Lutanda including from Miss Atkinson;
<P>

23.	That had the plaintiff been taken to a child guidance clinic in 1947, 1953
or 1959, no psychological or psychiatric condition
would have been diagnosed
and no treatment by way of counselling or otherwise, for an indeterminate
period or otherwise would have
been recommended nor would advice have been
given to find a surrogate mother;
<P>

24.	That Lutanda was a licensed home pursuant to s 28 of the  <b><u>Child
Welfare Act</u></b>;
<P>

25.	That Lutanda was a caring home staffed by dedicated, qualified caring child
carers who sought to give "of their" best in the
upbringing of the
plaintiff;
<P>

26.	That even though the defendants did not visit the plaintiff at Lutanda as
claimed, the evidence showed that  Child Welfare Act
Inspectors did visit
Lutanda from time to time.  That the AWB, even if it had visited the plaintiff
at Lutanda "at regular intervals"
or at least "once a year" in the plaintiff's
early years as is alleged was required in the plaintiff's case, the AWB's
assessment
would not have been any different to the assessment of the Lutanda
carers.  That had they visited Lutanda they would have acquired
no more
information than was recalled and revealed in evidence by adult carers and
would have acted upon such and taken no further
action;
<P>

27.	There was no failure by Lutanda staff or more particularly the AWB staff to
take reasonable care in all the circumstances;
<P>

28.	Further or alternatively, although no action is brought against them there
was no "negligent" error on their part which could
or would constitute, in any
event, breach of any independent duty on the part of the AWB;
<P>

29.	Further or alternatively, that even had the plaintiff been interviewed by a
Board representative, the representative would have
acted no differently to the
way the Lutanda carers or the school authorities acted;
<P>

30.	That even if the plaintiff had been hypothetically taken to a child
guidance clinic in 1947, 1953 or 1959, or at any time, the
hypothetical history
given by the adult carers (who on all the evidence did not feel a need to take
her anyway) would have been to
the effect that her behaviour was normal and not
perceived to have been otherwise than as stated above and not abnormal or
revealing
signs of any psychological or psychiatric disorder;
<P>

31.	That had the plaintiff been taken to a Child Guidance Clinic at different
ages as suggested by Dr Katz (though I find there
was no reason to do so), it
would be highly speculative to suggest what she would have told them.  It would
be mere surmise.  Her
affidavits affirmed in 1990's provide no reliable guide
to what she would have said;
<P>

32.	That had the plaintiff been taken to see a Child Guidance Clinic before
1960, no diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder would
have been made or
treatment commended, whether by counselling on return visits or otherwise;
<P>

33.	That it has not been established that it was reasonable or practicable to
find a permanent (or temporary) surrogate or substitute
mother for the
plaintiff in the circumstances.
<P>

<b>Expert Evidence</b>
<P>

<b>The Law</b>
<P>

440   	The modern attitude towards expert evidence is less
exclusionary than it has been in the past.  The position is now also
dealt with
under s 76 and s 79 of the  <b><u>Evidence Act (NSW)</u></b>.  That said, where
experts who are called differ in terms of competing theories, care should be
taken to also assist in avoiding
that the focus of the trial shifts from
evidence of the facts in dispute to conflict between the competing theories of
the various
experts.
<P>

441   	An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the Court
with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience
and
knowledge of a judge or jury.  When one is speaking on matters of human nature
and behaviour it is also appropriate to remind
oneself of the observations of
Lawton LJ in  <b><u>R  v  Turner</u></b>  (1974) 60 Crim App R 80 when he said
(at 83):
<P>

"The fact that an expert witness has impressive scientific qualifications does
not by that fact alone make his opinion on matters
of human nature and
behaviour within the limits of normality any more helpful than that of the
jurors themselves; but there is a
danger that they may think it does".
<P>

442   	Matters within the range of human experience such as
general questions as to credibility and reliability of witnesses (subject
to
special exceptions) must be determined by the assessment of the jury (or
judge):  <b><u>Smith  v  The Queen</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2064%20ALJR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 64 ALJR 588.</a>
<P>

443   	The expert's paramount duty is to assist the Court
impartially.  Judges and juries decide cases, not experts.  The tribunal
of
fact, whether it be judge or jury in any particular case, makes the findings of
fact.  The question of whether there was or was
not negligence at the end of
the day is one alone for the court as the tribunal of fact.  Whether there was
a failure to exercise
reasonable care is a question of fact.  What is
reasonable care must be judged in the light of all the circumstances.  What is
reasonable
is also a question of fact exclusively preserved for the tribunal of
fact alone.  Causation too, is an issue of fact for the tribunal
of fact to
determine by reference to "common sense".
<P>

444   	In terms of admissibility of an expert's opinion, the
position at common law is that relevant expert or opinion evidence
is
admissible with respect to matters about which ordinary persons are "unable to
form a sound judgment ... without the assistance
 of [those] possessing special
knowledge or experience which is sufficiently organised or recognised to be
accepted as a reliable
body of knowledge or experience":  <b><u>HG  v  The
Queen</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 281</a> per Gaudron J at 288-289.  Sections 76 and 79
of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u></b>  provide that evidence as to opinion, and
evidence of opinions, to be admissible, needs to be brought within the
exception provided
by s 79.
<P>

445   	As the judgment of Gleeson CJ in  <b><u>HG</u></b>
reveals (at 288), there is a need on the part of trial judges to ensure that
opinions of expert witnesses be confined under s 79
to opinions which are
wholly or substantially based upon their specialist knowledge.  As his Honour
said:
<P>

"Experts who "venture" opinions (sometimes merely their own inference of fact)
outside of their field of specialist knowledge may
invest those opinions with a
spurious appearance of authority, and legitimate processes of fact finding
maybe subverted".
<P>

446   	It may be that an expert's opinion when properly
considered, may not on proper analysis, be based wholly or substantially
upon
that expert's specialist knowledge, but rather upon a combination of
speculation, inference, personal and second hand views
as to the credibility of
the plaintiff and a process of reasoning which goes beyond the field of
relevant expertise:  see  <b><u>HG</u></b>  at 287 per Gleeson CJ.
<P>

447   	When considering and evaluating the expert's opinion it
is appropriate to bear in mind the observations of Kirby P (as he
then was) in
<b><u>Ahmedi  v  Ahmedi</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 288.</a>  His Honour said (at
291):
<P>

"An expert's opinion is only as persuasive as the facts upon which it is based.
Many are the cases in which expert opinions must
be rejected because the
factual hypothesis upon which they are based are not made out in the evidence:
see generally  <b><u>Ramsay  v  Watson</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20108%20CLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 108 CLR 642</a>;
<b><u>Paric  v  John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2059%20ALJR%20844" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 59 ALJR
844</a> ....  Just as many opinions have been rejected because of the inadequacy of
the facts to support if <u>courts do </u>not have to accept an expert's opinion
simply because it is voiced by a person with expert qualifications.  Courts and
parties before
them are entitled to test the opinion expressed, scrutinising
the premises upon which it is based and evaluating its internal logic".
<P>

448   	Further, the principle which requires the Court to accord
appropriate weight to the trial judge's assessment of witnesses
he or she has
seen and heard, applies equally to expert witnesses, particularly when they are
in conflict:  <b><u>Ahmedi</u></b>  per Clark JA at 299, see also Mahoney JA in
<b><u>The Public Trustee  v  The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>  supra.
<P>

<b>The Expert Evidence in this Case</b>
<P>

449   	At trial, expert evidence was led by the plaintiff as to
the nature of the plaintiff's psychiatric history and as to the
development of
her primary condition of Borderline Personality Disorder.  Expert opinion
evidence was offered as to the psychiatric
experiences of the plaintiff as far
back as 1942 and forward throughout the period until 1960.  Consultant
psychiatrists, social
workers and treating psychiatrists were all called in the
plaintiff's case.  Expert evidence was also led by the defendant.  The
expert
opinion evidence sought to trace the cause of the plaintiff's psychiatric
condition and to give evidence about the symptomatic
signs of disorder which,
the plaintiff submits, should have been obvious warning signs to the defendant
of the onset of the plaintiff's
disorder.  Opinion was given about the state of
psychiatric knowledge that was known at the time, especially in relation to the
effect
of maternal deprivation on a child.  It was said by the plaintiff that
the knowledge was at such a state of advanced learning during
the 1940's and
50's that the defendant should have known the effect of maternal deprivation on
the plaintiff and acted accordingly.
 Opinion was also given about the
possibility of reversing the onset of the plaintiff's condition if the
plaintiff had been given
treatment that the experts asserted should reasonably
have been given in the circumstances, or would have been given at a Child
Guidance
Clinic if such help had been sought. 
<P>

450   	The expert evidence presented in this case has caused me
considerable concern and difficulty in terms of its proper analysis
and its
acceptance.  I have various reservations about it in a number of respects.
Indeed, the more frequently I have read the material,
the more discomfort I
feel with many aspects of the expert evidence relied on by the parties and
particularly the plaintiff.  Some
general comments can be made.
<P>

451   	The events in question in the instant case occurred, as
it is clear, over a period of some eighteen years between 1942-60.
 This
eighteen year period itself started fifty seven years ago and finished some
thirty nine years ago.  The evidence of the lay
witnesses which I have
described addresses that period and addresses the factual events as they
concerned the plaintiff. The lay
witnesses lived with the plaintiff.  They were
contemporaneous witnesses, present and aware of the events going on around them
with
respect to the plaintiff and with respect to the care and treatment she
received.  I have made findings of fact in relation to their
views.  Generally,
as I have said, I find the Lutanda lay witnesses who gave evidence to be
credible and reliable.  I have also made
findings in respect of the evidence of
Mr Sattler and the plaintiff herself and have found, on the preponderance of
the evidence,
that their evidence is not reliable as regards the objective
reality of life at Lutanda.  In addition I have made findings of fact
in
respect of the plaintiff's upbringing and life from 1942 to April 1947.  I have
made adverse findings on the reliability and credibility
of the plaintiff
including in respect of significant matters at Lutanda.  Where there is
conflict between the lay evidence that I
have accepted and the interpretation
of such by the experts, I accept the lay witnesses.
<P>

452   	The expert evidence in this case is offered in hindsight,
and reflects in some ways a retrospective analysis of events and
consequent
diagnoses of the plaintiff's condition going back as far as 1942.  The opinions
of the experts in the plaintiff's case
further proceed on an acceptance of the
evidence of Mr Sattler and the plaintiff who, I have said, I do not find
reliable in material
and significant respects.  I repeat again the concession
by the plaintiff in submissions (at 81) that much of the plaintiff's evidence
is "unreliable" in the sense of being not objectively true. 
<P>

453   	Broadly, I reject the plaintiff's expert evidence because
its acceptability is undermined by reason of the absence or inadequacy
of facts
to support the views expressed.  Pursuant to my findings in respect of the
plaintiff's evidence and the lay evidence generally,
the assumptions and
underlying hypotheses of the plaintiff's expert opinion evidence fails.
Ultimately, in my opinion, the factual
basis on which the plaintiff's expert
evidence is expressed is not made out and those expert opinions fall on the
facts.  In this
respect I refer particularly to the evidence of Dr Katz and his
opinions about the plaintiff's medical condition including whilst
resident at
Bomaderry from 1942-7, and to the evidence of Dr Waters whose opinion is relied
upon by the plaintiff, and indeed by
other experts, as establishing that the
plaintiff suffered from a borderline personality disorder by the time of her
late adolescence.
 I have made findings of fact including that the plaintiff
had no disorder, no manifestations of any disorder nor presented herself
as
being "disturbed" whilst at Bomaderry or Lutanda.  The threshold foundation for
the experts' opinions disappears for these reasons
in particular.
<P>

454   	Further or alternatively, I have difficulty accepting the
expert opinions in so far as I have found that the plaintiff's
experts have not
taken into proper consideration in expressing their opinions, the plaintiff's
turbulent experiences and conduct
between 1960-2 (or subsequently) and the
report of Dr Cooley in 1960.  This material includes a psychiatric assessment
of the plaintiff
by Dr Cooley of a Child Guidance Clinic at the very time that
the plaintiff contends the plaintiff's condition of Borderline Personality
Disorder crystallised.  The findings of that report, adverse as I find they are
to the plaintiff's case, were not considered by the
plaintiff's experts or not
satisfactorily explained.  The material relating to the plaintiff's conduct and
history during the years
immediately following her discharge from Lutanda, not
adequately pressed in consultation with the plaintiff and not considered in
his
assessment of the development of the plaintiff's psychiatric condition, is a
further reason for my not accepting the plaintiff's
expert evidence.  The
plaintiff's history from 1960-62 takes on particular significance given the
reliable report in 1960 of Dr Cooley
who furnished a contemporaneous
psychiatric assessment of the plaintiff.
<P>

455   	Thirdly, a matter of significant concern to me has been
the submissions made by the plaintiff in respect of the lay evidence.
 Despite
the findings of fact which I have made by reference to the lay evidence it is
submitted by the plaintiff, and one is left
with the distinct impression on the
plaintiff's case, that the lay evidence should be interpreted and findings
should be made so
as to accommodate the experts' opinions. These opinions
themselves are based upon hypotheses and assumptions as to the psychiatric
antecedents or psychiatric aetiology of the plaintiff's disorder and as to the
correct interpretation of historical fact and past
events. In effect, in one
sense, the submission is that the lay witnesses' evidence should be rejected or
perceived as perhaps a
misinterpretation of the actual nature of the
plaintiff's conduct or behaviour as observed from time to time, to the extent
that
it does not fit comfortably or cannot be reconciled with the experts views
on the development of the plaintiff's psychiatric condition.
 This submission
perhaps in part reflects an approach involving, post hoc reasoning, in order to
mount the argument that certain
findings of fact should be made in order to
give effect and accommodate the conclusions as to the plaintiff's psychiatric
condition.

<P>

456   	The case for the plaintiff is further advanced, in part,
by the experts on the basis of what, in retrospect, was conduct
said to be
reasonably expected from the defendant in all the circumstances.  While I have
already said that the factual basis for
their views was not made out, a further
point to be noted is that it is for the Court to determine what is reasonable
in all the
circumstances.  The evidence of the expert is not binding on it nor
should it, by mere appearance of authority, seek to subvert the
proper process
of fact finding which the tribunal of fact is required to and responsible to
undertake on the evidence:  <b><u>HG</u></b>  (supra)
<P>

457   	Finally, and generally, the court is not to be bound by
opinion expressed as expert opinion merely on the assumption that
it carries a
weight of "expert" authority.  Opinion evidence too must be reasonable and
specific, not vague and imprecise:  <b><u>Ahmedi</u></b>.  The court must test
the evidence including its reliability.
<P>

458   	As I have indicated I have reservations, indeed, some
discomfort in accepting the expert opinions on liability (and damages)
as urged
in the plaintiff's case.  I have also had significant difficulty in accepting
the evidence advanced by the experts as to
what is it is suggested was required
by way of reasonable care in the 1940's and 1950's, based (as their opinion is)
upon matters
of failed assumptions and hypotheses not accepted by me and upon
the state of knowledge in the 1940's.  These are but some of the
difficulties I
have been faced with with respect to the expert evidence in this case.
<P>

459   	I will return to these issues in due course but it is
appropriate first to set out some of the history of the psychiatric
assessments
made of the plaintiff and to deal with the issue of Dr Waters' "retrospective"
diagnosis and opinions.
<P>

<b>Dr Cooley</b>
<P>

460   	In September 1960, the plaintiff was assessed by Dr
Cooley of the Child Guidance Clinic (No. 4) in the context of preparing
a
report for a criminal proceeding in which the plaintiff was involved.  The
report was made pursuant to an order from the Children's
Court.  At the time
the plaintiff was aged 17 years and 11 months of age. Dr Cooley was a well
known and well qualified child psychiatrist.
 It appears that Dr Cooley was a
person known to the witness Mrs Bull during Mrs Bull's training.  Mrs Bull gave
evidence in the
plaintiff's case on the basis of work she had done as a social
worker in a Child Guidance Clinic.  Dr Cooley was a colleague of a
Dr Jennings
who (according to Dr Ellard, who was called in the defendants' case) also
worked in a Child Guidance Clinic, and who
delivered an important paper in 1953
on the subject initially addressed by Dr Bowlby in 1951, namely, on issues of
attachment and
bonding.  I am satisfied that accordingly, Dr Cooley probably
was as at September 1960, up to date with knowledge in her area of
speciality
including information contained in DSM-1TM (published in 1952) as well as with
the views of Dr Bowlby and Dr Jennings
on maternal deprivation.
<P>

461   	In her report of 1 September 1960, Dr Cooley, according
to Dr Waters, made no diagnosis with respect to the plaintiff of
any
psychiatric disorder.  Nor in her report does she indicate that the plaintiff
had then, or at any other time in her life, demonstrated
signs, symptoms or a
history of one. Her report makes no reference to Sociopathic Personality
Disorder, to any disorder of attachment
or to any other disorder.  Her report
was made following the subjection of the plaintiff to a series of tests,
presumably considered
appropriate in Child Guidance Clinics including a Binet
intelligence test.  The report was also made subsequent to the plaintiff
giving
her history to Dr Cooley.  Indeed her report does not suggest that during the
plaintiff's history the plaintiff was subject
to any of the numerous incidents
of corporal punishment or sexual abuse that have been the subject of
allegations in this trial and
are found in her subsequent history given to Dr
Waters.  This is significant in two respects.  Firstly, perhaps, it lends some
further
and independent support to my findings in respect of the lay evidence
that I have accepted and which I have also found to be reliable
and credible.
Secondly, this history given by the plaintiff in 1960 provides some indication
of what indeed may have been said and
of what conclusions may have been reached
had the plaintiff made a hypothetical visit to a Child Guidance Clinic in the
years 1947,
1953 or 1959, or indeed at any time prior to 1960, as is alleged
should have been done in this case.  I also observe that as regards
the
situation at Lutanda, the history that was given to Dr Waters in 1991 and
thereafter is different to what was told to Dr Cooley
in 1960.
<P>

462   	I propose to set out the report in full:
<P>

"This girl was seen at the above Clinic on 30th August.
<P>

Joye (sic) seemed to have a resigned attitude, which at times gives way to the
underlying resentment, about her illegitimacy and
lack of home and relations
and her own lack of success and self-esteem.  She has little motive or hope for
constructive satisfaction.
<P>

There is a history of resentful behaviour for some years at the Lutanda Home.
Her own discontentment and emotional problems seem
to have interfered with
adjustment in employment.
<P>

Joye was rated on the Binet as average in general intelligence.  She cooperated
but lacked persistence.  She gave as her Vocational
Choice live-in domestic
work in the country.  This may be a possibility, if she is placed in a home
where standards are not too high
and class distinction not too obvious.  She
needs the help of an adult who can given her genuine interest and
understanding.  She
may have some artistic talent (drawing or music) or
interest that could be used to give her satisfaction."
<P>

463   	In the context of this case, this report is significant,
in that, as I have already mentioned, it was made at or around the
time it is
urged on the plaintiff's own expert evidence that the plaintiff's condition of
borderline personality had crystallised.
 For example, Dr Waters (at T 135)
gave evidence that he felt comfortable in expressing the view that the
plaintiff's Borderline
Personality Disorder was manifested by the plaintiff's
adolescence or at least by the time she was eighteen.
<P>

464   	I am satisfied that Dr Cooley was an experienced Child
Psychiatrist, one of the few in New South Wales who worked in a Child
Guidance
Clinic during the period relevant and significant in this case.  It was
conceded by Dr Waters that Child Guidance Clinic
psychiatrists would have seen
more children in practice than a private psychiatrist treating children and
would have had a high level
of experience in diagnosing psychiatric problems
associated with children.  Dr Ellard, who trained in Australia in the 1940's
and
50's and whose views I accept on historical matters, said that there were
relatively few such speciality Child Psychiatrists and
those who were
specialists were found in public health.  The evidence was that these clinics
were busy and that they had waiting
lists. 
<P>

465   	I am satisfied that Dr Cooley was a doctor of integrity
and fully aware of her obligations and responsibilities and I find
no reason to
assume that she would not have fulfilled her duty to the court or to her client
in ensuring that her report was correctly
prepared and accurately made.  The
report was, as I have said, made pursuant to a series of tests which would also
perhaps suggest
that a child psychologist was involved. Presumably a social
worker and a psychiatrist was also involved in obtaining the history
as appears
in the evidence of Mrs Bull.  Even assuming this is not so, this does not alter
my views as expressed.  Importantly, Dr
Waters conceded that Dr Cooley was an
expert in the field when she made the report in 1960 and that the report did
not appear to
record any "diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder at all".  I
will return to the views of Dr Waters on the report of Dr Cooley in
a moment
but it is appropriate if I first set out his position as to the history of the
plaintiff's mental health.  I accept what
is recorded in Dr Cooley's report and
that the absence of recording of psychiatric disorders (past or present) was
because in her
opinion there was probably none to be found.
<P>

<b>Dr Waters</b>
<P>

466   	Dr Waters was called by the plaintiff and gave evidence
by way of testimony, by way of affidavit and in a series of reports.
 Dr Waters
was born in 1948.  He completed his medical degree in 1971 and further
completed a Diploma of Psychiatry from the University
of Ottawa in 1977.  Dr
Waters became a Fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of
Psychiatrists (FRANZCP) in 1982
. He became Foundation Professor of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry and was Professor of Psychiatry, University of New South
Wales
from 1985-1996. 
<P>

467   	In his affidavit (sworn 9 March 1999) he said that he
first saw the plaintiff on 16 July 1991 for the purposes of preparing
a medico
legal report.  He saw her from time to time thereafter and prepared reports
dated 22 October 1991, 13 May 1993, 19 November
1996 and 22 October 1997.  He
saw her again on 23 February 1999.  Significant in his report of 1991 and in
his evidence are the views
and history given to him by the plaintiff which are
largely consistent with the plaintiff's affidavit evidence.
<P>

468   	In his report dated 22 October 1991, Dr Waters concluded,
by way of retrospective analysis, that the plaintiff was suffering
from a
Borderline Personality Disorder between 1962-5.  He arrived at this
"retrospective" diagnosis after reviewing records of the
plaintiff's stay at
Macquarie Hospital during the period of 1962-5 to which hospital she was
admitted for care in respect of her
mental health during that time.  Dr Waters
in 1991 was also, as I have said, privy or became privy to the plaintiff's full
psychiatric
history up until 1991 and which later was to be a significant basis
for the plaintiff's affidavit evidence. 
<P>

469   	Dr Waters' "retrospective" diagnosis is made in respect
of a period beginning just two years after the report of Dr Cooley.
 In
evidence (at T 135) he goes further to suggest that the plaintiff's Borderline
Personality Disorder had crystallised by her late
adolescence.  His diagnosis
would thus put him in conflict with the findings of Dr Cooley in 1960.  On his
oral evidence it is clear
that his considerations and his reports were not
prepared with reference to or knowledge of the views of the well-qualified
Child
Psychiatrist Dr Cooley.  From his oral testimony it is clear that Dr
Waters did not know until cross-examined on the matter that
the plaintiff had
been assessed in 1960 by a child psychiatrist from a child guidance clinic.  He
was not aware that that report
indicated that the plaintiff had no psychiatric
disorder and that Dr Cooley did not think one was present.  Dr Waters was, as I
have
said, unaware of this report during the preparation of his four reports
tendered at trial and during his evidence given in examination
in chief. 
<P>

470   	In Dr Waters' report of 22 October 1991, he referred to
the series of the plaintiff's hospitalisations between 1962-5.  He
said (at
8):
<P>

"In retrospect, and after having reviewed contemporaneous hospital records, it
appears that the correct diagnosis was substance
abuse disorder and borderline
personality disorder." 
<P>

471   	The contemporaneous hospital records to which Dr Waters
made reference refer repeatedly to diagnoses in terms of sociopathic
personalities, prostitution and sexual deviations.  The plaintiff had eight
admissions to the North Ryde Psychiatric Centre between
25 March 1962 and 26
May 1965.  They provide information of considerable value to the Court in terms
of assisting it in arriving
at a decision on all the evidence.  It is for me to
give appropriate weight to all of her history and admissions as well as to the
expert views, both current and past.  The following summary is taken from a
report to the plaintiff's solicitors (dated 15 June 1989):
<P>

 <b>"Re: Joy Eileen WILLIAMS - 13.9.1942</b>
<P>

The above named has had 8 admissions to this hospital dating from 25.3.1962 to
26.5.1965.
<P>

Details of her admissions are as follows:
<P>

1.	25.03.1962 - 08.12.1962
<P>

2. 	01.01.1963 - 21.02.1963
<P>

3. 	18.05.1963 - 14.08.1963
<P>

4. 	28.08.1963 - 30.08.1963
<P>

5. 	11.12.1963 - 13.12.1963
<P>

6. 	04.03.1964 - 06.03.1964
<P>

7. 	11.03.1964 - 11.06.1964
<P>

8. 	19.05.1965 - 26.05.1965
<P>

Diagnosis at the conclusion of each one of these admissions was Sociopathic
personality, Prostitution and Sexual Deviation."
<P>

472   	A summary of the diagnoses is recorded in the Unit
Summary Sheet (A1- 209) as follows:
<P>

"1.	25.3.62 - 8.12.62		Sociopathic Personality Prostitution
<P>

							Dr Yeomans A. W. OL.
<P>

2. 	1.2.63 - 21.2.63		Sociopathic Personality Sexual 
<P>

deviation
<P>

							Dr Yeomans, Disch.
<P>

3. 	18.5.63 - 14.8.63		Sociopathic Personality Prostitution
<P>

					Sexual deviation
<P>

							Dr Yeomans, Disch.
<P>

4. 	28.8.63 - 30.8.63		Sociopathic Personality Prostitution
<P>

							Dr Chong Gladesville
<P>

5.	11.12.63 - 13.12.63	Sociopathic Personality Disorder
<P>

							Dr Hill, Disch.
<P>

6.	4.3.64 - 6.3.64		Personality Trait Disturbance other
<P>

							Dr Palme, Disch.
<P>

7.	11.3.64 - 11.6.64		Sociopathic Personality Prostitution
<P>

							Dr Hennessy, Disch.
<P>

8. 	19.5.65 - 26.5.65	      	Sociopathic Personality Prostitution."
<P>

473   	Having viewed these records and the corresponding notes,
what Dr Waters did was, perhaps in effect to "retrospectively" review
the
diagnoses so that the correct diagnosis was quoted above.  His approach to the
plaintiff's psychiatric diagnosis raises questions
as to the use of hindsight
and of the influence of advances made in psychiatry which Dr Waters admits.  In
offering his "retrospective"
diagnosis, Dr Waters made no reference to there
being a change in psychiatric nomenclature, rather he made his diagnosis in
retrospect.
 Perhaps at this point one might be excused in thinking that what
he was initially suggesting was that there had been an incorrect
diagnosis by
the different psychiatrists in connection with the plaintiff's eight admissions
between 1962 and 1965.  Dr Waters' approach
to the plaintiff's diagnosis was
confirmed in his report of 22 October 1997 (at p.3), where he says:
<P>

 "As I have indicated in my earlier reports, Ms Williams' early adulthood was
severely disrupted by numerous admissions to psychiatric
hospitals for what in
<i>retrospect</i> was the consequences of a Borderline Personality Disorder
associated with self-destructive behaviour." [my emphasis]
<P>

474   	In 1997, he again made no reference to any subsequent
change in psychiatric nomenclature between 1962 and today.  Later in
oral
evidence he stated that not only did he believe that the plaintiff had a
Borderline Personality Disorder in 1962-5, in contrast
to the diagnoses made by
psychiatrists at that time, but in addition, he says (at T 135):
<P>

"I'm quite comfortable going back and saying she had a Borderline Personality
Disorder <u>by the end of her adolescence</u>." (my emphasis).
<P>

475   	Having made this retrospective diagnosis, Dr Waters in
oral evidence offered an explanation for the differential diagnoses
made by the
psychiatrists at the Macquarie Hospital.  He stated his diagnosis of Borderline
Personality Disorder arose due to a change
in the psychiatric nomenclature
since 1962 and that what was diagnosed in the various admissions at that time
was consistent with
borderline personality disorder using current psychiatric
nomenclature.  He stated (at T 107):
<P>

"What they diagnosed I think were the - using the current nomenclature - that
(sic) make diagnoses that were <i>consistent with</i> borderline personality
disorder, and what descriptions there are of her behaviour I think now, if -
that's one of the reasons I wanted
to have a look at the full notes, because,
as I say, it would have verified what I'm quite sure is the case, that
sociopathic personality
for instance is closely allied to and overlaps with
borderline personality. At that time sociopathic personality was a much broader
diagnosis in the sense that it applied to more people, and probably - and
captured people with borderline personality.
<P>

As I say, some of the behaviours that brought her into hospital - in fact I
would say all the behaviour that brought her into hospital,
and what
observations there are about her conduct in hospital, are all consistent with
borderline personality." [my emphasis].
<P>

476   	Dr Waters testified that the term "Borderline Personality
Disorder" was first used in the 1950's but was largely used by
people of
psychoanalytic persuasion as they were the ones that constructed the
psychiatric classification system.  He said that the
term would have come into
official use in the 1960's and early 1970's.  Importantly however, he made this
comment (at T 108):
<P>

"It was part of the official classification.  I would have thought it was
unlikely that anyone at Macquarie Hospital would have
even been familiar with
the debate that was going on in the States at the time."
<P>

477   	When asked when he thought they would have become
familiar with it he stated that it would most likely have been when DSM-IIITM
came out in the 1970's.  It is accepted that DSM-IIITM was first printed in
1980. DSM-ITM, the first edition of the DSM series was
printed in 1952.
DSM-IITM, the second edition came to print in 1968 and after DSM-IIITM, the
final and current edition of the  <b>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders</b>, DSM-IVTM, was printed in 1994.
<P>

<b>The Retrospective Diagnosis as at 1962-5</b>
<P>

478   	The plaintiff's submission on the matter of the
retrospective diagnosis deserves to be set out in full.  Miss Adamson for
the
plaintiff said (at T 724):
<P>

"<b>ADAMSON</b>:	Your Honour will recall the evidence of Dr Waters and Dr Lal
that the diagnoses made in Fraser House [Macquarie Hospital] between
62 and 65,
although they had different labels attached, were <u>consistent with the
description of Borderline Personality Disorder in DSM-IVTM</u>, and that is the
evidence on which the plaintiff relies." [my emphasis]
<P>

479   	The plaintiff in terms relies upon the descriptions of
Borderline Personality Disorder described in DSM-IVTM as retrospectively
applied.  It is needless to say that between the printing of DSM-ITM, which was
the  <b>Diagnostic Manual</b>  current during the years 1952-68, and the
printing of DSM-IVTM released in 1994, there have been considerable
developments in psychiatric
learning.  As I understand it, that is the part of
the plaintiff's case as to why the diagnosis of Dr Waters should be accepted.
Dr Waters (at T 110) made the following comments as to the relevant psychiatric
advances, 
<P>

"<b>WATERS:		</b>In this area of personality, I think that  - I think that
perhaps to an outsider the advances have been of a fairly subtle nature.
Within the field, I think people would think that they have been <u>fairly
dramatic changes</u>." [my emphasis]
<P>

480   	What has occurred on the plaintiff's case appears,
perhaps on one view, to be the application of modern psychiatry, in terms
of
diagnosis and diagnostic criteria to events long since past.  It is one thing
to say that names change and that what once was
known as sociopathic disorder
is now known as Borderline Personality Disorder.  It is quite another thing to
assert negligence against
persons in the 1940's and 1950's to take reasonable
care in respect of scientific material that is contained in post-period
editions
of scientific journals. 
<P>

481   	Notwithstanding this I am willing to accept and I do
find, though not without concern or reservation, that as far as the
evidence of
Dr Waters goes, as to the plaintiff having in retrospect a diagnosis consistent
with the description of Borderline Personality
Disorder as at 1962-5, that such
a finding is consistent with the records of the Macquarie Hospital.  In saying
this I note I do
not understand Dr Waters to be testifying that what has
occurred in this case is merely a change in name alone.  He gave evidence
(at T
107) that Sociopathic Personality Disorder "was a much broader diagnosis in the
sense that it applied to more people and probably
- and captured people with
Borderline Personality Disorder."  I would further observe in passing that Dr
Waters did not indicate
whether the same criteria for diagnosing borderline
personality disorder was the same as or similar to that used to diagnose
sociopathic
personality disorder in 1962-5.  What is being presented is not
only a new name, but a new category albeit that the diagnosis of
Borderline
Personality is consistent with the former Sociopathic Personality Disorder.  It
is a diagnosis made at a different time
when diagnostic criteria and acceptable
treatments were different to what they are now known to be.
<P>

482   	Nevertheless, that finding does not require a finding
that that or any psychiatric condition existed or had manifested itself
in any
signs or symptoms prior to 1962.  On this point I accept Dr Cooley's views in
1960.  Nor does that finding require me to make
any findings of fact about the
plaintiff's history different to what I have made in respect of the lay
evidence.  Particularly it
should be noted that each of Dr Lal, Dr Waters and
Dr Ellard proceeded on the basis that the history obtained by Dr Waters in 1991
and the plaintiff's affidavit affirmed 20 November 1996 was accurate and
reliable particularly in relation to the nature of the plaintiff's
life at
Lutanda.
<P>

483   	In respect of Dr Waters' evidence and the history he
obtained from the plaintiff, Dr Waters is not, and has not been, the
plaintiff's treating psychiatrist.  He is, and has been, the medico-legal
expert supporting the case of the plaintiff since 1991
and prior to the
institution of the proceedings.  He understood when he first saw her in 1991
that he was seeing her in the course
of litigation and subsequent to the making
of his first report, he was aware that that litigation was believed to be a
test case
about "Stolen Children".  The history of the plaintiff's `removal'
from her mother which he obtained is to be viewed, as I have said,
in light of
my findings that the plaintiff was removed at the request of the mother: s 7(2)
of the Act.
<P>

484   	Upon taking the plaintiff's history, he did not feel it
was his obligation to verify the claims (some of them very serious)
made by the
plaintiff.  He accepted that perhaps he didn't qualify his conclusion as he
might have done because he anticipated that
the truth of the serious assertions
would be made evident by independent evidence at the trial. 
<P>

485   	He said that he was provided with the plaintiff's
affidavit of 20 November 1996 and that he broadly accepted the truth of
what
was recorded in relation to her experiences.  They were truthful as he
recollected.  He thought that some of the material was
the product of vagueness
of memory but that he did not think they were affected by delusions.  The
affidavit was not thought to be
the consequence of delusions.  Several
incidents in the affidavit he said had a ring of implausibility.  He admitted
he failed to
draw any distinction between that which he thought may be
implausible and those parts he thought to be true. 
<P>

486   	I have made findings on the evidence as to the
plaintiff's history and her affidavit.  I do not repeat here what I found
in
that respect except but to note that in significant respects the plaintiff's
evidence is found to be unreliable.  I except from
this finding of her
unreliability evidence from her about her recollections at Bomaderry and
evidence of what her mother told her
about the circumstances of her conception,
birth and parentage which I generally accept and other exceptions referred to.
The foundation
of fact upon which the expert evidence is based is unreliable.
Where that foundation is unproved on the evidence, as I find it is
in this
case, the expert evidence must be rejected so far as it expresses opinions on
matters arising from the plaintiff's history
and her affidavit which I find did
not occur: see  <b><u>Ahmedi v Ahmedi</u></b>  (supra) per Kirby P (as he then
was) at 291.
<P>

487   	These comments apply to all the plaintiff's experts in
this case and include also the expert for the defendant Dr Ellard
who relies on
the history given by the plaintiff and her affidavit.  Significantly, Dr Ellard
notes in his findings (at p 2 of his
report of 19 April 1999), that,
<P>

"A perusal of the available material - particularly that from Fraser House -
leaves no doubt that the diagnosis of borderline personality
at that time was
appropriate...  The environment [at Lutanda] can best be described as
<u>destructive</u> and I believe that her experiences there would be the
substantial part of the causation of her borderline personality disorder.
Another
important factor would be <u>the sexual assaults that she has described
in her documentation</u>." [my emphasis].
<P>

488   	I reject this part of his evidence as to the
"destructive" environment of Lutanda and as to the plaintiff's "sexual
assaults"
as it is based on the history given by the plaintiff which I have
rejected in accordance with my findings stated above.  I further
reject any
submission that would require me to make findings other than those I have made
in relation to the plaintiff's time at
Lutanda based as it is on the evidence
of the lay witnesses.  Accepting that the plaintiff had a disorder consistent
with borderline
personality disorder in 1962 does not require me to accept the
experts' assumptions about the truth of the plaintiff's allegations
of sexual
assault or about the "destructive" nature of her experiences.  Nor does it
require me to reject the evidence in relation
to Bomaderry and Lutanda that I
have accepted and made findings about and from which I do not resile.
<P>

489   	I have set out my findings and I do not find that the
sexual assaults occur as alleged, indeed, they were conceded by the
plaintiff
as being not objectively true.  I do not find that the plaintiff's time at
Lutanda was destructive for the reasons given
in respect of the lay evidence,
most particularly because of my acceptance of the Lutanda lay witnesses'
evidence.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Behaviour (1960-1962)</b>
<P>

490   	It is appropriate to set out some of the history of the
plaintiff's behaviour and life style.  Evidence as to the plaintiff's
behaviour
on leaving Lutanda is not really addressed on the plaintiff's case, indeed, it
is to some extent glossed over by her psychiatrists,
particularly Dr Waters.
This is perhaps because it is not in terms dealt with in any detail in the
plaintiff's own affidavit evidence.
 There is almost silence on the matter
beyond the plaintiff's reference (at para 74 of her affidavit dated 20 November
1996) that
she started abusing various substances and became involved in a cult
and in criminal activities. The reference is minimal.  This
is the case
notwithstanding that it is a period involving the plaintiff's criminal conduct
and involving her association with criminal
company and with members of Roslyn
Norton's "pagan" cult. All this activity occurred after her visit to Dr Cooley
in 1960.
<P>

491   	In respect of these events, which I consider to be
serious and significant events in the plaintiff's life, Dr Waters said
(at T
126-127) that "we" tried to talk about the things dealt with in Parole Officer
Barnett's Report of 1962, but "she didn't want
to talk about them".  He said it
was "too distressing" for her.  The matter was not pursued.
<P>

492   	The material contained in the Parole Officer's Report was
however known to Dr Waters having been furnished to him in the
preparation of
his reports for the plaintiff.  Broadly that report dealt with the plaintiff's
conduct and behaviour between 1960
and 1962 during which, as mentioned, she
associated with certain Kings Cross company, worked as a prostitute and
attended celebrations
of Black Mass with the cult of Roslyn Norton, as well as
engaged in criminal conduct.  One charge in relation to which the plaintiff
was
convicted was for the offence of attempted bestiality, which, Dr Waters
conceded, was conduct that is rare in the case of women.
 Little or no
reference was made to these matters in Dr Waters' reports, which is in
accordance with the slight reference made to
those matters in the plaintiff's
affidavit.  I have made more extensive reference to the evidence in Miss
Barnett's report in relation
to an assessment of damages.
<P>

493   	The circumstances surrounding the commencement of the use
(and abuse) of drugs, even of alcohol, does not appear to have
been fully
ventilated in the plaintiff's affidavit or explored by Dr Waters.  Dr Waters,
seemingly, has assumed that because he considered
that the plaintiff had a
history of "substance abuse" that this was caused by a psychiatric disorder
(which the plaintiff asserts
was caused by default or negligence of the AWB).
The same observation may be made with respect to the plaintiff's alcohol abuse.
The circumstances surrounding the commencement and use of substances was not
adequately explored.
<P>

494   	Additional to evidence of the plaintiff's behaviour
during this period, the plaintiff's mother's mental health was also not
explored with the plaintiff, yet the situation concerning her was or would have
been known to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff had been
reunited with her in 1973
and had from time to time thereafter lived with her.  There was a history of
alcoholism involving the plaintiff's
mother particularly during her
child-bearing years.  This too seems to have been relatively unexplored with
respect to the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Diagnosis of the Plaintiff prior to 1962</b>
<P>

495   	Dr Waters gave evidence that he was comfortable finding
that the plaintiff had a Borderline Personality Disorder by the time
of her
late adolescence (T 135).  By doing so he purports to go beyond his
retrospective diagnosis that, as at 1962, the plaintiff
could be said to have a
condition of Borderline Personality Disorder consistent with what was then
diagnosed by the psychiatrists
at Macquarie Hospital.  Assuming that by "late
adolescence" Dr Waters meant to refer to "late teens", that puts his
retrospective
diagnosis as early as 1959-60 when the plaintiff would have been
17-18.  By suggesting the disorder was present in 1960, Dr Waters
puts himself
in conflict with the evidence of Dr Cooley whose views I accept.
<P>

496   	Dr Waters during oral testimony sought to distinguish the
findings of Dr Cooley when confronted with them in cross examination.
 As I
have said, prior to being cross-examined on the matter, Dr Waters did not know
of the report of Dr Cooley.  He says the following
in respect of Dr Cooley's
report (at T 110):
<P>

"<b>WATERS:</b> 	Well I'm not surprised that there wasn't a diagnosis. It's a
matter of practice.  To some extent one would think that a doctor would
automatically make a diagnosis, but in child psychiatry, an issue for a long
time I think arising out of sociologically (sic) has
been a concern whether you
label people using diagnoses.  So some people are a bit reluctant to use terms
that might dog somebody
for the rest of their lives.  I don't agree with that
practice.  But I'm not surprised that there isn't a diagnosis."
<P>

497   	Later (at T 111) he continues in relation to the report
of Dr Cooley:
<P>

"<b>WATERS:		</b>And I think that that report talks about how she sees herself
and tries to identify some areas in which there may be - where there
may be
some reasons for hope.  As I say, the diagnosis of the antisocial behaviour
rather than motivation, she might be sort of consigned
to the incorrigible bag,
and so - I mean , I think that that report is quite possible to read that
report (sic), and I think reading
that is the interpretation I put on the
report, that there is a reluctance to use diagnostic terms for fear of how that
might guide
action afterwards.  And so it's a more descriptive approach."
<P>

498   	I reject Dr Waters' interpretation of Dr Cooley's report.
I further reject these and any other attempts by Dr Waters to explain
away the
findings of Dr Cooley.  I have said already that I find Dr Cooley to be an
expert in the field of Child Psychiatry.  Her
report is a contemporaneous
document.  Made in 1960, it involves an assessment of the plaintiff by a Child
Guidance psychiatrist
at or around the time at which Dr Waters says the
plaintiff's disorder had crystallised.  The report finds no such disorder.  The
report also reflects a different record of the plaintiff's history to that
given to Dr Waters in 1991, a history taken from the plaintiff
herself in
circumstances which would give the plaintiff even reason to be candid about her
history and Dr Cooley to be equally frank
with the Court.
<P>

499   	The report prepared by Dr Cooley was, as I said, a report
made for the purposes of court proceedings in which the plaintiff
was involved.
The report was to the court and for the benefit of the plaintiff in criminal
proceedings.  I do not accept that a qualified
psychiatrist would choose not to
make a diagnosis that could assist a client in receiving remedial assistance or
a fair and just
hearing. I do not accept that Dr Cooley's report would resile
from fully informing the court on the plaintiff's well-being.  It should
be
remembered that Dr Cooley was an expert child psychiatrist who worked in a
Child Guidance Clinic and so would have had more extensive
exposure to the
psychiatric care of children than any other specialist in child psychiatry.
<P>

500   	I do not accept the "retrospective" diagnosis of Dr
Waters to the extent that he suggests the plaintiff had a disorder consistent
with a Borderline Personality Disorder in 1960 or any psychiatric disturbance
at that time.  It is an opinion also based on matters
that I do not accept.  I
find his diagnosis to be unreliable as to the plaintiff's condition in 1960 or
during her late adolescence.
 I am not willing to find, as I must if Dr Waters
is accepted, that Dr Cooley was in some sense inaccurate in the views she
expressed.
 I do not accept that she would fail to disclose something so
significant as a disorder consistent with a Borderline Personality
Disorder
when it was in the plaintiff's best interest to do so.  The plaintiff had every
opportunity to give an accurate history
on that occasion and it was in her
interests to do so. Dr Cooley would have received that history and acted on it.
Dr Cooley administered
tests to the plaintiff in the course of her assessment,
all of which confirms my feeling that her report was exhaustive, accurate,
frank and reliable.
<P>

501   	Given its contemporaneity, I am prepared to give the
report of Dr Cooley significant weight as to the nature of the plaintiff's
mental condition as at 1960.  I am made more confident in making this finding
by the fact that Dr Cooley was accepted by Dr Waters
to be an expert in the
field and that she worked in a Child Guidance Clinic, one of the very
institutions it is submitted on the
plaintiff's case that the plaintiff should
have been taken for assessment.  Dr Waters was not qualified as a psychiatrist
till 1977
and was as I have said at no time the plaintiff's treating
psychiatrist, whether in 1960 or during the course of the 1990's when
he
prepared reports and a history in respect of the plaintiff.  Those reports and
history were made pursuant to a request by the
plaintiff and for the purposes
of the present litigation.  I do not accept his view that the plaintiff had a
disorder of the type
he contends at 1960.
<P>

502   	Further, or alternatively, even accepting Dr Waters' view
that the plaintiff had a disorder consistent with a Borderline
Personality
Disorder as at 1960, (and even assuming that there was an antecedent disorder
of attachment), that does not of itself
establish negligence or want of
reasonable care.  Experts only ever assist with their views.  Those views are
persuasive only to
the extent that the facts upon which they are based are
proved on the evidence:  <b><u>Ahmedi</u></b>  (supra) at 291.  I do not have
to accept expert opinion simply because it is voiced by a person with expert
qualifications.  See
also  <b><u>HG</u>  </b>at 288.  Indeed, essentially the
truth of the facts I have accepted particularly stands in the path of the
experts' views which I
reject.

<b>Plaintiff's Submissions as to the effect of Psychiatric Evidence on the Use
to be made of the Lay Evidence</b>
<P>

503   	The plaintiff has presented extensive psychiatric
evidence as to the aetiology of a Borderline Personality Disorder.  Evidence
from Dr Waters in his affidavit affirmed 9 March 1999 has been (at para 5) to
the effect that while the Borderline Personality Disorder
cannot be diagnosed
in its full form until the age of around eighteen, the antecedents of that
disorder are observable from adolescence.
 Dr Waters deposes that the causes of
the disorder are primarily "poor emotional care of the child including poor
parenting."  In
his opinion a child who is in a situation where it cannot form
a close, responsive bond with at least one adult is susceptible to
Borderline
Personality Disorder.
<P>

504   	Evidence from Dr Katz is to the effect that the plaintiff
suffered from a disorder of attachment in 1948 (para 16 - affidavit
sworn 10
March 1999) which was later to develop into a Borderline Personality Disorder.
Dr Katz makes this finding of a disorder
of attachment based on assumptions
taken from the plaintiff's affidavit evidence which in his opinion showed that
the behaviour of
the plaintiff was "stubborn, attention seeking, self-centred
behaviour".  Dr Waters confirms the view that the antecedent symptoms
of
Borderline Personality Disorder include behavioural symptoms such as. inter
alia. self-centredness, attention - seeking conduct,
selfishness,
aggressiveness, self-destructive behaviour and indiscriminate attachment.
<P>

505   	The case of the plaintiff is such that given the
conclusion that the plaintiff had a diagnosable Borderline Personality Disorder
or a disorder in 1962 which was consistent with a modern diagnosis of
Borderline Personality Disorder, that these antecedent behavioural
characteristics as elaborated by Dr Katz and Dr Waters should be expected as
the aetiological antecedents of that disorder.  Dr Katz
in cross-examination
(at T 476-7) seemed to doubt whether a Borderline Personality Disorder could
perhaps develop from anything other
than an antecedent disorder of
attachment.
<P>

506   	The plaintiff has also led evidence of the diagnostic
criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder from DSM-IVTM which she
submits
should be considered when making an assessment of the reliability of her
evidence.  In short, it is suggested by the experts
that given that it is known
that the plaintiff suffers from a known condition, the antecedents and
diagnostic criteria associated
broadly with that condition should form the
framework by which I should look at the plaintiff's case on duty and on
causation and
the way I look at the evidence.
<P>

507   	Accordingly the plaintiff has submitted that I should
find that on the evidence the plaintiff's behaviour at Bomaderry and
at Lutanda
was of such a kind and intensity as to be consistent with antecedent signs of
disorder which would eventually mature into
Borderline Personality Disorder.
Alternatively, she submits, to the extent that the defendant's lay witnesses
suggest that the plaintiff's
behaviour was normal whilst at Lutanda, I should
find that those witnesses misinterpreted the plaintiff's behaviour because of
their
ignorance of the psychiatric learning on the subject of attachment
disorders.  I reject these arguments.  The plaintiff submits (at
p 81 of
submissions) that:
<P>

"Had the AWB discharged its duty of care to the Plaintiff it would have visited
her at Lutanda at regular intervals of at least
once a year (and probably more
frequently in the earlier years).  The AWB representative would have
interviewed the Matron or Superintendent
and would have separately interviewed
the Plaintiff.  Had the AWB visited the Plaintiff at Lutanda at any time
between 1947 and 1960
it would have found a profoundly disturbed child."
<P>

508   	The plaintiff further alleges that had the defendant been
told of these matters an inference should be drawn that the plaintiff
would
have been sent to a Child Guidance Clinic for assessment and treatment and any
treatment would have reversed the plaintiff's
disorder.  It is submitted that
the plaintiff would have made complaints similar to those made in her affidavit
of 20 November 1996,
both to the Child Guidance Clinic and the AWB.  I reject
these submissions in the terms stated and repeat my finding that at no time
in
the period 1947-1960 would the defendants have found either a profoundly
disturbed child or a disturbed child.  I find that they
would not have found
the plaintiffs other than as a child that exhibited behaviour consistent with
descriptions by the Lutanda witnesses
which I have accepted.
<P>

509   	In some ways it might be thought that the evidence given
by various witnesses that the plaintiff's behaviour was "normal"
for a teenager
is challenged, inter alia, because it does not reflect the expected aetiology
of Borderline Personality Disorder.
<P>

510   	Mr Hutley, (at p 75 of the plaintiff's submissions)
submits:
<P>

"The plaintiff's bad behaviour was an incessant and counterproductive cry for
the attention which she had not received through attachment
to attain through
more acceptable means (sic).  The people who heard the cry misunderstood it
because of their ignorance of the then
current learning and the plaintiff's
circumstances of maternal deprivation."
<P>

511   	This challenge is and has been rejected in terms stated
and otherwise.  For reasons given and findings made, I reject the
argument of
there being any misunderstanding on the part of the Lutanda carers as to the
plaintiff's behaviour and I reject any suggestion
of ignorance on the part of
the Lutanda carers as to the plaintiff's circumstances.  I reject the
description of the plaintiff's
bad behaviour and what it represents.  One
should also avoid the potential for the "concertinaing" of the evidence of the
plaintiff's
behaviour into over-simplified descriptions.
<P>

512   	There is nothing in the expert evidence of Dr Waters, Dr
Katz or in the DSM-IVTM which prevails upon me to read the evidence
of the lay
witnesses in this case any other way than as I do read it, as both credible and
reliable.  I will not traverse anew my
findings as to the lay evidence.  I have
already set out the lay evidence in considerable detail as well as my findings
in relation
to it.  I have set out the evidence of the plaintiff as well as my
findings in relation to her credibility and reliability, findings
made in light
of some significant concessions by the plaintiff's counsel as to her
reliability.  It is sufficient to say that I am
convinced on my reading of that
evidence and in light of submissions that the plaintiff is not reliable in the
evidence that she
gives in significant respects especially as to events at
Lutanda.  In contrast I find that the evidence of the defendant's lay witnesses
is credible and reliable and that I can act on it.
<P>

513   	I am satisfied that nothing in the expert evidence
requires me to reject the evidence of the defendant's lay witness if I
find, as
I have, that it is credible and reliable for me to act on.
<P>

514   	The views of the Lutanda lay witnesses are human
observations of experienced able child carers at the time.  Their opinions
are
based on time spent with the plaintiff over a number of years and upon the care
they have given to her during that time.  Mrs
Middleton, Mrs Buxton and Mrs
Moorhouse were trained nurses and experienced, practical child minders,
qualified to observe and supervise
the health and behaviour of their charges.
I accept their opinions, for the reasons stated elsewhere, that the plaintiff
was not
a troublesome child and was not a depressed or disturbed child.  I
repeat the finding that nothing in the lay evidence leads me to
conclude that
the plaintiff exhibited behaviour and which reasonably suggested a need for
third party intervention or referral to
a third party.  I have rejected the
evidence of the plaintiff and Mr Sattler to the extent that they suggest the
plaintiff engaged
in self-mutilation and attention seeking behaviour and
otherwise as stated and for the reasons already given.  In the circumstances
these findings are not, and are not able to be impugned or brought into
question by the expert evidence.
<P>

<b>Dr Lal</b>
<P>

515   	Dr Lal, the plaintiff's current treating psychiatrist at
Shellharbour, considered in March 1999 that the plaintiff's condition
had the
likely label of "manic disorder".  As an alternate diagnosis he said that she
may also have been suffering from a substance
(namely, marijuana) induced
disorder. At that time he thought that a third conditional diagnosis was also
possible, namely that of
a brief psychotic episode.  In relation to marijuana
use, Dr Lal obtained a history of the plaintiff that she had been using
marijuana
daily for several years up until her admission.
<P>

516   	Dr Lal defined "manic episode" as a disorder of mood
involving persistent, sustained elevation of one's mood above normal.
 It could
often, he said, involved elation and behaviour that is markedly different from
one's usual behaviour.  While their is no
settled aetiology, Dr Lal said that
one cause of the condition is certainly hereditary factors.  Regular manic
episodes, he said,
are more properly labelled as a bipolar disorder which is
the modern term for manic depressive psychosis.  Psychosis, in turn, is
essentially a term meaning any disjunctive break with reality. In his opinion,
the overall label he gave to the plaintiff's current
condition was that of
"manic episode". He accepted that, on the basis of the information given to him
by Dr Waters, Dr Aarons (the
plaintiff's long time treating psychiatrist) and
the plaintiff's daughter, and having no first hand knowledge of the plaintiff's
condition prior to her current admission, that the plaintiff had a Borderline
Personality Disorder.
<P>

517   	According to Dr Lal, when a child is separated from his
or her mother, studies have found that harm can be caused to the
child and that
damage had been found in children much younger than 12 years of age.  The harm
that results to the child, he said
(at T 186), occurred irrespective of the
race or sex of the child.  Similarly, he said, the mechanism for separation
does not matter.
 Damage to a child from a breaking of an attachment bond could
occur regardless of whether the breaking of the bond occurs because
of the
death or illness of the mother or by their incapability of caring for the child
or even from the imposition of a jail term
on the mother.  While any separation
could bring about harm to the child, much would depend upon the subsequent
experiences of the
child.
<P>

518   	Dr Lal said (at T 188) that the two transfers in this
case, first by the mother, because of her inability to care for the
plaintiff,
to the AWB (involving going to Bomaderry), followed by further separation after
four and a half years, with the child
going to a new home (Lutanda), were both
capable of contributing to a Borderline Personality Disorder.  If there was a
further disruption
of the bonding process with a carer with whom the child had
formed some attachment at the second home, such might also he said contribute
to the development of a Borderline Personality Disorder.  Further, however, Dr
Lal said that one could only speculate as to why some
children develop
borderline personality disorder as adults and others do not.
<P>

519   	Dr Lal, while acknowledging that an institution per se
usually offers less care and nurturing support to a child that found
in a
private home, conceded that he had come across cases, as a clinician, of people
suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder
who did not come from
institutions.  He was asked as to whether a child, from the moment of birth has
a disposition to a Borderline
Personality Disorder.  He said (at T 191):
<P>

"<b>LAL:</b>	Everyone has a personality and everyone has elements of different
personalities.  Again this is very much a non expert opinion, but
my guess is
that people who ... all children if they are poorly raised, are vulnerable to
personality disorders. Some people will
debate that.  Certainly many people
will argue differently and say that it is constitutional genetic or
whatever...."
<P>

520   	I have found that the plaintiff was not poorly raised at
Bomaderry or Lutanda.
<P>

521   	When asked whether there was any general pre-disposition
to Borderline Personality Disorder, Dr Lal referred to the personality
structure of the individual and to some children having more resilient
personality structures than others.  He was asked about his
understanding as to
where personality comes from.  He said (at T 192):
<P>

"<b>LAL:	</b>Some argue and say it is predominantly genetic and others will
not.  I think it is like tabula rasa and I don't think there is a definitive
opinion on the subject.  It is a matter of continuing debate."
<P>

<b>Dr Katz</b>
<P>

522   	I propose now to deal with Dr Katz's evidence.  At the
threshold Dr Katz's evidence runs into a number of problems.  He did
not see
the plaintiff.  He had access to limited materials.  He made assumptions of
facts and expressed views on facts, hypothesis
and assumptions not proved.
Indeed, he has made assumptions contrary to findings made by me.  The findings
of fact made by me in
respect of accepting the Lutanda witnesses and in respect
of the plaintiff's situation at Bomaderry provide reasons for rejecting
his
views.  Indeed, my findings in relation to the reliability and credibility of
the plaintiff in respect of serious matters also
cause me to reject his views.
Further of alternatively, my later finding on the subject of state of knowledge
in the 1940's is inconsistent
with his views and also supports a rejection of
his views.
<P>

523   	Dr Katz swore several affidavits, including two in March
1999.  Dr Katz is a retired consultant psychiatrist born and initially
educated
in South Africa.  He saw war service and did further study in the United
Kingdom.  He graduated in South Africa as a child
psychiatrist and emigrated to
Australia in 1960.  He was initially employed as a psychiatric adviser in the
School Medical Service
(Victoria) and worked in Clinics.
<P>

524   	In 1964 he moved to Sydney to take up a position as
Associate Professor of Child Psychiatry and consultant to the Royal Alexandra
Hospital for Children.  This was, I would add, the first specialist position of
Associate Professor in Child Psychiatry in Sydney.
 Dr Katz was not in
Australia during the period between 1942 and 1960.  That is the period which is
relevant to the issue of liability
in this case.
<P>

525   	Dr Katz's post-war fellowship year in England was devoted
to establishing knowledge in his chosen field of child psychiatry.
 He said Dr
Bowlby was amongst "the first" to show the importance of "the development of
attachment early in life and show how disruption
of attachment leaves behind
many emotional disturbances".
<P>

526   	Before returning to Dr Katz's affidavit of 10 March 1999
it is quite clear that Dr Katz places great weight on Dr Bowlby's
report to WHO
(1951) where the prevalent theories and origins of mental disturbances were
summarised.  Dr Katz suggested that similar
ideas to those of Dr Bowlby were
found in the literature of the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's (see para 2 of his
affidavit of 30 March 1999).
<P>

527   	It appears from his first affidavit that Dr Katz was
asked to consider the hypothetical situation of what steps a reasonably
competent psychiatrist would have advised the person with responsibility for
the care of Ms Williams in 1942, in 1947, in 1953 and
in 1959 if the plaintiff
had made visits to Child Guidance Clinics at those times.  In expressing his
opinion he was asked to make
certain assumptions based upon what would have
been done by experts in or about these years.
<P>

528   	A number of paragraphs from Dr Katz's affidavit of 10
March 1999 are set forth:
<P>

"13.	Had it been necessary for whatever reason to remove Ms Williams from her
mother this step should have been delayed until a
willing "mother-substitute"
had been located.  The literature available to reasonably competent child
psychiatrist or child mental
professionals at or prior to the time of Ms
Williams' birth indicated the development problems which could occur,
particularly in
the development of attachment, if the child was deprived of a
caring adult with whom she could develop an attachment.  The literature
identified case studies of children who were subjected to maternal deprivation
and the grave consequences of such deprivation.
<P>

529   	I reject this view of Dr Katz.  He does not appear to
have considered the circumstances in which the removal took place including
in
wartime Sydney.  I do not see how in the circumstances the removal could be
delayed.  In my opinion there is a degree of unreality
about this view divorced
from time, place and the real circumstances of "the removal".  Further or
alternatively, I do not accept
that it would have been the prevalent expert
view at the time.  I do not accept that it was reasonable or practicable to do
as he
suggested or that reasonable care required an implementation of that
view.  I also do not accept it accorded with then state of knowledge.
 I do not
accept how one could in advance, or at all, understand how the hypothetical
willing mother substitute could have been found
before "a removal".  I find it
difficult to understand how in advance a willing mother substitute would be
reasonably located.  The
simple fact is the child had to be removed to the only
practicable place, Bomaderry.  The mother had to leave hospital where she
had
been for a month.  Dr Katz has not considered these real practical matters, or
considered them adequately.  In many ways Dr Katz's
views rather reflect
perhaps an ideal rather than what was real or reasonable.
<P>

530   	I thus reject Dr Katz's opinion in terms of what an
expert psychiatrist would have done at the time in 1942.  This is a sufficient
ground almost in itself for rejecting his views and opinions, which I do for
this and reasons already stated.
<P>

531   	It must be remembered that the issue of "reasonable" care
is for the court.  The reasonableness of a proposed course, its
practicability
or impracticability, are not matters that are to be resolved merely by medical
experts.  They are matters for close
consideration and decision by the court.
There are further problems with acceptance of Dr Katz's evidence (and indeed
Mrs Bull's)
including as to suggested hypothetical remedial care that may have
been given or suggested at different ages since they are inconsistent
with my
findings of fact and rejection of the plaintiff's reliability in respect of
significant matters.  The views of experts are
necessarily limited by the
information on which their decisions are made.  The point on reliability of
information from a patient
also in the area of psychiatry is well made by the
U.S. Supreme Court in  <b><u>Jaffe  v  Redmond</u></b>  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1996/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] USSC 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20518%20US%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 518 US 1</a> at
10:
<P>

"Treatment by a physician for physical ailments can often proceed successfully
on the basis of physical examination, objective information
supplied by the
patient and the results of diagnostic tests.  Effective psychotherapy by
contrast depends upon an atmosphere of confidence
and trust in which the
patient is willing to make a <u>frank and complete</u> disclosure of facts
emotions memories and fears."  [my emphasis]
<P>

532   	Several remarks should here be made.  First, Dr Katz's
view is predicated upon there being an onset of symptoms, or manifestation
of
symptoms (not signs) of which human carers would or should have become aware.
There were none or none have been proved.  Next
it assumes at different times a
disorder present and manifesting itself.  I do not accept any disorder in
attachment has been proved
to have been present at Bomaderry or Lutanda.  Next,
inadequate attention is paid to how an appropriate permanent relationship could
be found or whether it was reasonably achievable, let alone reasonably
practicable.  His statements as to appropriate treatment with
respect ignores
problems associated with its practical implementation and means of such.  As to
the counselling issue, it is again
a matter I reject.  There was on my findings
nothing to counsel, or justifying counselling.  There is no evidence as to the
nature
or extent of counselling required, or for how long.  The assumptions
made by him have either not been proved or have been rejected.
 I do not accept
that there was a childhood deficiency of attachment or one which could have
been reversed or minimised at any time.
 I reject his view as based upon
unproven hypotheticals.
<P>

533   	In his affidavit the following paragraphs appear:
<P>

14.	Although at the time of Ms Williams' birth and infancy it was recognised
that not all institutions had a necessarily deleterious
effect on the
development of attachment, reasonably competent child psychiatrists or child
mental health professionals recognised
at the time that the risk of a disorder
in the development of attachment was particularly high in institutions such as
orphanages.
 This was so because the usual structure of such organisations was
for relatively large numbers of children to be supervised and
cared for by
staff members as a whole.  This structure, although it may have had
administrative benefits, was antipathetic to the
development of a close
emotional attachment between an individual child and a specified adult and
exposed children in such institutions
to a high risk of disorder in the
development of attachment.
<P>

15.	A reasonably competent psychiatrist or child mental health professional
would have advised the Board that the risks associated
with placing Ms Williams
who had already suffered the trauma of removal from her mother when she was
very young would be greatly
increased if she was placed in an institution,
particularly if the institution was not structured to create small identified
family
units.  Such a person would have advised the Board that the childhood
antecedents of a disorder in the development of attachment
may not manifest
themselves in any recognisable form until the child was five or six.
Manifestation of such symptoms at the age would
I dictate that some damage to
the facility for attachment had already been done.
<P>

534   	I reject these views inter alia for reasons already
given.  I do not accept that such advice would have been given in 1942
nor that
reasonable care required that if the advice was given, it was reasonable or
practicable to implement it.  There was no real
practical choice but to place
the plaintiff in the one suitable institution available at Bomaderry.
<P>

535   	No treatment was called for on my findings, none would
have made any difference.  The measures suggested are not required
or
reasonable, let alone practical.  I find Dr Katz's views generally
unhelpful.
<P>

536   	There is nothing to suggest that in circumstances such as
those present at Lutanda, or anywhere that it was possible to find
a
"substitute" mother ready willing and able to bond with, and with whom in terms
of mutuality or reciprocity the child too would
bond, interact and attach to in
terms of deriving satisfaction enjoyment in a warm intimate relationship (Dr
Bowlby).  I reject Dr
Katz's views on this point.  I reject his view then there
were any childhood manifestations of disorder at any early age (or at all).
 I
reject the proposition that "Bomaderry contributed to the disorder".  In my
view on the findings I have made it did not.
<P>

537   	Further or alternatively, for reasons that I have set out
later, I have not accepted Dr Katz's opinion as to state of knowledge
in the
1950's.  As to state of knowledge see my later views.
<P>

538   	Dr Katz prepared a further 34 page affidavit (13 April
1999) in which he was asked to make assumptions based upon what was
said by Mr
Sattler.  I have made findings rejecting Mr Sattler's evidence.  Those
assumptions have not been proved, or more accurately
accepted by me.  He
assumed that the plaintiff demonstrated the misbehaviour described by Mr
Sattler (and I have not any) and that
that made fostering or adoption in 1948 a
matter of priority.  There is no evidence of any misbehaviour at the age of
six, requiring
either or both.  I repeat that I found the plaintiff experienced
no loss of opportunity to be adopted or fostered.  There is no evidence
about
how, if at all misbehaviour, or even age might impact upon adoption or
fostering prospects.  These are matters that are not
addressed by Dr Katz, but
are by me.
<P>

539   	I have said enough to indicate that I reject Dr Katz's
views for a variety of reasons.  I do not accept his views in respect
of the
situation, remedial or otherwise, in relation to the plaintiff's mental
condition at any age.
<P>

540   	Some of the problems with accepting his views also appear
in Dr Katz's cross-examination after the filing of a further affidavit.
 In
summarising what he said, Dr Katz accepted that:
<P>

1.	Each item identified allegedly in the second affidavit is to a certain
degree features of behaviour which one would see from
time to time in <u>all
children</u>;  [my emphasis]
<P>

2.	Views of what constituted "normalcy" vary from one adult person to
another;
<P>

3.	If the "assessors", the lady carers looking after the plaintiff, did not
take her for professional help, then according to their
feelings, professional
help was not required.  A neighbour school teacher might think they needed
help.  He didn't read any material
suggesting that a school teacher or other
person had recommended help (at T 476).  I have found that no such teacher ever
suggested
help was required.
<P>

4.	If the plaintiff's behaviour was so aberrant as he assumed he would have
expected it to be present at school.  (I find it was
not)
<P>

541   	It is interesting that Dr Waters too (T 130) also agreed
if the plaintiff had been as "disturbed" as she must have been for
his view of
her psychiatric state, he would "most probably have expected teachers to have
picked it up".
<P>

5.	A child is predisposed at birth to form an attachment to a figure.  If such
a figure is not available, then the child is likely
to develop a Borderline
Personality Disorder.
<P>

542   	In my view this type of evidence again highlights the
difficulty of guaranteeing the elimination of a risk of a disorder
developing,
particularly in an institutional setting.  On my findings, sadly perhaps for
the plaintiff, an institutional life was
unavoidable.
<P>

6.	Someone has to make up their mind whether or not to take a child to a
clinic.  If a parent or carer thinks there is nothing wrong
with the child or
the child's environment, then, a clinic never sees the child except when the
child is referred to a clinic by a
teacher.
<P>

7.	Between 1960-1965 he did not see very many children from institutions.
Those children that came from those institutions involved
usually as a result
of a third party intervention from a school, general practitioner or hospital
before he saw them.  If they came
directly from the institution, someone from
the institution referred that child.
<P>

543   	To sum up I do not accept the opinions proffered by Dr
Katz in respect of his assessment of, or suggestions of care for the
plaintiff
at different ages.  I also do not accept the validity of the history,
hypotheses or assumptions on which they are based.
 I do not accept his views
as to hypothetical actions or that suggested treatment at any time would have
made any difference.  I
accept the Lutanda carers' evidence as well as the
evidence as to Bomaderry.  Finally as to state of knowledge I do not accept his
views as to the state of knowledge as it existed in the 1950's.
<P>

<b>Mrs Bull  -  Social Worker</b>
<P>

544   	A Mrs Bull gave evidence both in affidavit form (sworn 1
April 1999) and in oral evidence.  She sought to be helpful as a
witness.
However, I am unable to accept or act upon her views.  Leaving aside the issue
of qualifications as a social worker: see
 <b><u>HG  v  The Queen</u></b>
supra, I reject her views essentially, but not exclusively, because of the
factual findings I have made.  Much of what I have said
in relation to Dr Katz
also applies to Mrs Bull's evidence as well.
<P>

545   	She was born in 1915, and held a BA degree from the
University of Sydney in Philosophy, English and History.  In 1946 she
was
awarded a Diploma of Social Work from Sydney University after a two year
course.  She held a Certificate of Psychiatric Social
Work from Edinburgh.  She
gave evidence of familiarity with certain academic works as a social worker,
some of which were listed
in an affidavit of Dr Katz sworn 30 March 1999.
<P>

546   	She followed a career as a social worker.  In 1944-45, as
a student, she worked with a Dr Sebire at the Child Guidance Clinic
No 2 at
Camperdown under the leadership of Dr Sebire.  She described Child Guidance
Clinics as operating as a team.  There were three
professionals consisting of a
psychiatrist, a psychologist and a social worker.  The team leader was the
psychiatrist.  An application
for assistance she said was usually received from
a worried parent or carer.  Mrs Bull gave evidence that she had met Dr Cooley
in
the course of her training.
<P>

547   	She also gave evidence as to what took place in terms of
the initial diagnostic interview at a Child Guidance Clinic.  The
social
workers would interview one or both parents or carers in a separate room with
the interview beginning with the social workers
explaining the need for a
detailed Social History.  If the parents or carer were willing, the social
worker would obtain details
such as those set forth in para 4 of her affidavit.
The interview would take place a week later with the psychiatrist interviewing
the parents/carer and the child both together and separately.  Treatment was
not to be undertaken unless the parents/carer agreed.
<P>

548   	Treatments were usually on "a weekly basis lasting for 45
minutes".  Casework treatment for parents was concurrent with the
child's
treatment session (although how such casework treatment involving a staff
member or carer from an institution or orphanage
would operate, was not
identified) and was aimed at enhancing parents' insight into their attitudes to
their child and to that child's
behaviour.
<P>

549   	The child attended the psychologist and psychiatrist with
sessions consisting of "play therapy" interpretations and discussions
with the
child.  Treatment sessions would continue weekly for as many times as necessary
but usually on average for "4 to 8 weeks".
 In the cases of seriously disturbed
children the psychiatrist would generally conduct the entire psychotherapy
often calling for
further psychological tests.
<P>

550   	Visits to the child's school and home was an essential
part of the Child Guidance Clinic's work which would enhance treatment.
 These
were done by the social worker.
<P>

551   	Children were referred to clinics by parents, teachers,
the courts' officers or the Department of Child Welfare, or institutions
in
which they resided.  At the end of every three weeks the team met to discuss
and review ongoing treatment cases.
<P>

552   	Mrs Bull's affidavit appears to be particularly directed
at the situation qua parent/carers.  It is hard to imagine carers
from
institutions attending (let alone it being reasonable) in the 1940's, 1950's
and 1960's with children for treatment absent good
and valid reason to do so.
In the instant case there was no such good reason.  They, like parents, too
were the evaluators of children
and of the need for appropriate intervention in
respect of child conduct.
<P>

553   	Mrs Bull had returned to Australia in 1952.  She said
that employment opportunities for psychiatric social workers included
working
with disturbed adults in established mental hospitals or in one of the two
Child Guidance Clinics then existing in Sydney
serving the whole of the child
population of Sydney.
<P>

554   	In October 1952 Mrs Bull chose to work in the Child
Guidance Clinic being appointed to Child Guidance Clinic No 1 under Dr
Alan
Jennings.  The clinic was run on similar lines to those in the United Kingdom
where she had done training.
<P>

555   	She said that one of the most serious conditions of
childhood which she met whilst working in a Child Guidance Clinic was
that of
children who had "been deprived of all who could love them and who never had a
chance to grow in attachment to love and trust
someone".  Such children were
generally deprived of parental care or an adequate substitute for parental care
for a variety of reasons.
 Such children had generally been placed in
institutions run by various church and charitable bodies and taken by the Child
Welfare
Department into government homes.  They would sometimes be referred for
clinic help.
<P>

556   	A further affidavit was sworn by Mrs Bull on 12 April
1999 (just before the trial).  In that affidavit she said that she
had read
affidavits of Joy Williams (20 November 1996) and of Mr Sattler.  I have made
adverse findings in relation to the evidence
of both.
<P>

557   	Mrs Bull was asked by the plaintiff's solicitor to give
an opinion as to what a reasonably competent social worker who worked
in a
Child Guidance Clinic such as the one at which she worked would have
recommended in relation to Joy Williams, had she been seen
at the age of eleven
or as a teenager.
<P>

558   	It is important to observe here that Mrs Bull was asked
to express views in terms of recommendations of what a reasonably
competent
social worker would do.  That is her expertise and her opinion is to be so
viewed in the context of an expert social worker.
 She is not in terms
qualified or able to speak on treatment that would in fact have been prescribed
by a psychologist or psychiatrist
in any individual case.
<P>

559   	Under the heading  <b>"Assumptions"</b>,  Mrs Bull
appears to have assumed a history of Ms Williams' background and circumstances
and behaviour in terms as contained in
the affidavit evidence of the plaintiff
and Mr Sattler.  That said, the assumptions upon which her views and hypothesis
are based
have been rejected by me.
<P>

560   	Mrs Bull had never seen the plaintiff or obtained her own
history, nor had she seen the plaintiff's 1962-1965 Psychiatric
Centre notes.
Upon the assumptions made, Mrs Bull said that had the plaintiff been referred
to a Child Guidance Clinic in 1953 certain
views would have been expressed by a
hypothetical social worker namely;
<P>

"(1)	Ms Williams would benefit greatly if she were permitted to form an
attachment with an adult within Lutanda Children's Home,
particularly if this
attachment were with an adult with whom she already had some rapport;
<P>

(m)	Since Ms Williams had identified Ms Atkinson as the person to whom she felt
closest, it was likely that the attachment which
was likely to be of greatest
benefit to Ms Williams was an attachment with Ms Atkinson;
<P>

(n)	That, in order not to prejudice the development of an attachment with Ms
Atkinson it was desirable that Ms Atkinson not be required
to administer
corporal punishment of any severe nature to Ms Williams; and
<P>

(o)	It was desirable that Ms Atkinson, if she were willing, should be involved
in Ms Williams' treatment in any way possible and
that she receive some
counselling from the staff of the Clinic when she came with Ms Williams for
weekly appointments.  The effect
of this involvement would be to put Ms
Atkinson in the role of surrogate mother to Ms Williams."
<P>

561   	Some of the recommendations appear on one view to fall
outside her speciality as a social worker performing social worker
duties as
they concern recommendations as to psychotherapy treatment.  More significantly
on my findings there was nothing warranting
taking the plaintiff to a social
worker or any one else in 1953.  As to these views I reject them for a number
of reasons.  First
what I have said in part in respect of Dr Katz applies;
second, there is no evidence of such an "attacher" being available;  third,
Ms
Atkinson (in her 70's) had left or was about to leave Lutanda; fourth, an
attachment could not be "compelled" with any person
whether at Lutanda or
otherwise;  fifth, there was no corporal punishment administered;  sixth there
was no reason for counselling
or taking the plaintiff to a clinic.  Mrs Bull
also raised the matter of the plaintiff having an insecurity that may have been
caused
by not being told the truth about her mother whilst at Lutanda.  With
respect this is a view expressed in 1999.  I reject her views
for reasons
stated.  I further reject them because the exercise of reasonable case did not
require such.
<P>

562   	Simply stated on my findings, no visits to a Clinic at
any time were reasonably required.  I have made findings inconsistent
with the
unproved hypotheses of Mrs Bull and Dr Katz.
<P>

563   	In her oral evidence Mrs Bull said that for a child aged
between five and eight years residing at Wentworth Falls there could
have been
practical difficulties in terms of bringing a child to Sydney to a Child
Guidance Clinic, even if symptoms of disturbed
behaviour or otherwise warranted
or justified it being done.  In my view to bring the plaintiff to Sydney would
also have required
an escorting adult and associated school interruptions with
no corresponding benefits to be found in the light of my findings.  As
to
children behaving in a "rebellious" way, Mrs Bull was asked how parents or
carers would determine whether that behaviour was better
dealt with by
appropriately rewarding or punishing the child rather than taking the child to
a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  Mrs
Bull said she didn't think that that
decision rested with parents alone, since the school would also have input.  As
I have said,
in the instant case there is no evidence of any school "complaint"
about behaviour of the plaintiff at Lutanda to the authorities.
 There is no
evidence that any school authority suggested that the plaintiff at anytime be
sent to a clinic.  There is no evidence
of any suffering or educational
detriment.  No staff member (including qualified nurses/carers) at Lutanda ever
suggested it.  Mrs
Bull also said there was a lot of prejudice about psychiatry
of any sort in the 1950's, perhaps rather suggesting that in that era
the
community tried to manage, and deal with children's problems without resorting
to professional assistance, which is perhaps a
situation different to that
prevailing in the 1990's.  She said there was a "jeering attitude in the
community" to psychiatry in
the 1950's.  A point I consider she was seeking to
make is that counselling did not have the role, that it now has.
<P>

564   	Mrs Bull accepted that people in the 1950's rearing a
child of pre-teenage or teenage years may well have thought that they
could do
more harm than good by taking them to a psychiatrist.  I would add in passing
that many parents might well reasonably hold
similar views even in the 1990's.
Mrs Bull said that it was very seldom that children of Aboriginal or part
Aboriginal background
were referred to Child Guidance Clinics for treatment..
The following question and answer appears (at T 73):
<P>

"<b>BARRY:	</b>	Did you have yourself any understanding at that time of
aboriginal culture ?
<P>

<b>BULL:	</b>.	I am ashamed to say I was like most Australians ... we just
didn't really see them.  We knew - mean the very fact that children
could be
separated from their parents somehow we ought to have known it but I doubt that
whether many of us did".
<P>

565   	I do not believe that Mrs Bull really fully understood
that the separation in this case was because the mother had asked
the Board to
take the plaintiff from her.  On my findings it was the plaintiff's mother who
was responsible for the separation.
<P>

566   	After a number of witnesses for the defendant had given
evidence, Mr Hutley sought to have Mrs Bull recalled to give evidence.
 In the
circumstances I considered it appropriate that he should be permitted to do so.
Her further affidavit sworn (28 April 1999)
was also read.
<P>

567   	Mrs Bull was further cross-examined during which she
agreed that teenagers as part of their development engaged at some time
in
"oppositional" behaviour, in order to test the limits, to see how far they
could go with adults.
<P>

568   	Mrs Bull also said that where there were loving parents
and a child ends up being rebellious or criminal that a "lot of the
appearance
of harmony might be a discordant underneath [sic].  There would always be some
relationship problem somewhere" (at T 468).
 With respect I do not find that I
am able to accept this view at least in the terms of the answer given.
<P>

569   	In the 1940's Mrs Bull said she did not see many children
from orphanages or institutions at the clinic.  The following question
and
answers appears (at T 468):
<P>

"<b>BARRY:		</b>How many children came from orphanages or institutions?
<P>

<b>BULL:</b>		Not many.  As I said before, there were not - I suppose the
knowledge of the clinic's existence might have been shut off from people.
 It
generally has some sort of religious affiliation of making them good
Christians, as seen in the affidavit earlier - Joy Williams'
affidavit.  So I
think there was not much readiness to think anything outside their care was
going to be of help.  But parents knew
where they were going and they welcome
it and that is when the clientele starts building up and is known to a wider
circle."
<P>

570   	This evidence does not accord with my findings.  I am
satisfied that the Lutanda carers if they thought help was required
would have
sought help from a third party (and probably so would the school or teacher).
There was a readiness to seek help if required
including if necessary from Dr
Lovell, the Honorary Medical Officer.  None was required on my findings.  Any
implied criticism of
Lutanda or its dedicated staff in this passage I reject as
not according with the evidence on my findings.  It is another reason
for
rejecting Mrs Bull's evidence as unhelpful.
<P>

571   	Mrs Bull further appears to have considered that Lutanda
was a place of "great strictness", the sort of place where the "average
child"
could not be very easily accommodated "without being punished, some of it might
suggest cruelty".  I reject these impressions
as being not founded on the facts
found or supported by the evidence.  I do not regard Mrs Bull's views as of
assistance or helpful.
<P>

572   	I would observe that as regards foster parents, Mrs Bull
said that finding them was the work of the Child Welfare Department;
that even
some foster parents were not good foster parents, and that there were a lot of
"problems".
<P>

573   	Mrs Bull gave evidence that by the standards of the
1940s, foster parents were sometimes temporary.  It could be hurtful
to a child
to move from one foster home to another.  In the 1940's and 1950's looking for
foster parents meant looking for married
couples.  Not until the 1960s was it
found that a single mother was able to cope with the duties of a foster parent.
As she said
"Society is changing too"!
<P>

<b><u>Illawarra Aboriginal Medical Service:</u></b>
<P>

574   	I have considered the report of the Illawarra Aboriginal
Medical Service (Dr G Jones) relating to his dealing with the plaintiff's
health since December 1991.  The consultations with various doctors at the
clinic include treatment for a variety of "organic" conditions
as well.  In
December 1991 there is reference to migraine and a past history of alcohol
dependency.  Over the years there are a variety
of complaints including back
pain, and weight loss.  Scripts for various drugs including Voltaren and
Rohypnol were sought.  On one
occasion (March 1998) Rohypnol was refused.  In
June 1998 there is a reference to loss of hearing.  In September 1998 there is
a
complaint of stress with weight loss and increased alcohol intake.  In
November 1998 there is a complaint of chest pain.  In February
1999 there is a
complaint of back pain.
<P>

575   	On the terms of that report it appears that the plaintiff
had been attending the Clinic since 1986 with a history including
a
hysterectomy, migraine, drug abuse, psychiatric illness and anxiety attacks.
According to the report, the plaintiff had been losing
weight over a period of
time with no cause being identified.
<P>

<b><u>Dr Ellard:</u></b>
<P>

576   	I have already discussed some of Dr Ellard's evidence.
Dr Ellard is a medico-legal psychiatrist called by the defendants.
 His
education and experiences actually span the period during which the events with
which we are concerned occurred.  His report
of 12 April 1999 (with enclosures)
was tendered.  He also gave oral evidence.
<P>

577   	In 1942 Dr Ellard became a member of the Australian Army
Psychology Service.  He performed the duties of clinical psychologist
at 14th
AGH, met most of the significant Australian psychiatrists of the 1940's and
gained knowledge of concern and relevant to psychiatric
thinking.  His firm
recollection was that at the time child psychiatry was mainly concerned with
problems of what was called "mental
deficiency and neurological disorders
generally".
<P>

578   	Dr Ellard began his medical training in 1946.
Psychiatric input was small.  There was little or no mention of child
psychiatry.
 The standard text book at the time was Professor Dawson's <b>
"Aids to Psychiatry"</b>.  Professor Dawson was a Professor of Psychiatry at
Sydney University in the period 1927-1951.  He was the only Professor of
Psychiatry
in Australia at that time.
<P>

579   	I will deal with the contents of that book in due course
when I discuss in greater detail some of the considerable volumes
of academic
material tendered in evidence.
<P>

580   	Dr Ellard made the point that Professor Dawson did not
place any emphasis on matters of "separation" or attachment (see Professor
Dawson's 1942 Book  <b>"Aids to Psychiatry"</b>.  In the material tendered that
appears to be so.
<P>

581   	Dr Ellard said that in the 1950's there was one medical
school in New South Wales and one professor of psychiatry - Professor
Dawson.
As at 1960, a Dr Jennings was a part time lecturer on child psychiatry.  Dr
Ellard was also on the staff.  Professor Katz
took up a position as Associate
Professor in 1964, four years after the plaintiff left Lutanda in 1960.  I
would here observe that
Professor Dawson (in his 1942 text)  said in respect of
children "It is possible that further undue emphasis has been laid on
hereditary
factors and too little attention given to faulty parental discipline
and to such factors as malnutrition and poor physical hygiene".
This passage
perhaps reflected the then current thinking by some practitioners in Australia
psychiatry in 1942.
<P>

582   	Dr Ellard also said that a standard text book of the day
was said to be  "<b>Leo Kanner's Textbook of Psychiatry"</b>.  Dr Kanner was
Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the John Hopkins University.  The first
printing was in 1948, the Fourth Edition
in 1955.  The Table of Contents did
not mention "separation", nor did the Index to it.
<P>

583   	Dr Ellard's evidence was that for many years whilst at
North Shore Hospital, what is now regarded as child psychiatry was
performed by
paediatricians.  He referred to a publication by Dr W. H. Arnott a psychiatrist
employed at the Royal Alexandra Hospital
and to Dr Arnott's review in the
<b>Medical Journal of Australia</b>  of 271 cases seen at the Child Guidance
Clinic of that hospital.  Seventy six per cent had organic central defects and
twenty four
per cent had psychological causes.
<P>

584   	Dr Ellard was of the view that the issue of "separation"
and its effects on child development entered psychiatric thinking
in the
1950's.  It was associated with Dr John Bowlby.  There is some support for this
view since the Child Welfare Department Annual
Report 1952 commences with a
reference to the report of Dr Bowlby.  Indeed that Child Welfare Report
indicates the Child Welfare
Department was keeping itself abreast of learning
and thinking in relation to children including overseas developments.  Dr
Jennings
(from one of the Clinics) gave a lecture on "separation" at a  WHO
seminar in 1953.
<P>

585   	Dr Ellard believed that information in relation to
"separation" became available to the psychiatric community in the 1950's.
 I
would add that this view is not to deny that there were materials dealing with
the subject that had been published before in the
1940's.  I believe that the
point sought to be made is that it rather became part of general psychiatric
knowledge in terms of significance
only after Dr Bowlby's views were
expressed.
<P>

586   	As regards the general issue of separation, Dr Ellard
said that it came into psychiatric prominence after Dr Bowlby's works.
 He did
not think that before then it was really discussed in Australia.  As regards
the matter of Borderline Personality Disorder,
Dr Ellard accepted it was
related to a very difficult upbringing, but there could be another component in
the complex disorder -
cerebral organic disorder.
<P>

587   	Dr Ellard considered that the focus of child psychiatric
practice was the Child Guidance Clinic.  Dr Ellard considered that
child
psychiatry was not an organised and prominent speciality in New South Wales
until the 1960's, and that there were not many
child psychiatrists (a view
which seems to have some support in the evidence).
<P>

588   	In his letter of 19 April 1999, Dr Ellard expressed a
number of views from a perusal of the available material particularly
from
Fraser House (North Ryde).  The first was that the diagnosis of Borderline
Personality Disorder at that time was "appropriate".
 I should add this was not
in terms the diagnosis at the time.  According to Dr Waters' evidence, it was
his view in retrospect,
or at least by description reached by later changes in
psychiatric nomenclature, and later criteria for such diagnosis that the
plaintiff
had a Borderline Personality Disorder.  Secondly, Dr Ellard said, on
the basis of the plaintiff's assertions and history that the
plaintiff's
environment at Lutanda "was destructive" and that her experiences there would
be a substantial part of the causation
of her Borderline Personality Disorder.
There was no evidence everyone who went to Lutanda developed "Borderline
Personality Disorder".
 Dr Ellard also had regard to allegations of sexual
assault made on the plaintiff's evidence.
<P>

589   	As to these matters I have found that the plaintiff's
evidence should be rejected in terms of sexual assaults and of her
description
of Lutanda.  I reject Dr Ellard's view that the environment at Lutanda was
"destructive" for the reasons stated, and
not supported by my findings.
<P>

590   	He also said not everyone subject to a disadvantaged
early environment would develop a Borderline Personality Disorder. 
In fact
(there is no evidence any Lutanda child resident did so.  Indeed, he said that
some children can without early deprivation
developed the condition later in
life.  Many Borderline Personality patients also moved out of it.  He accepted
that the diagnosis
of Borderline Personality Disorder was not "now" in relation
to the plaintiff an appropriate conclusion.  It had remitted a decade
ago  He
did not state that any disorder had been present or had manifested in the
plaintiff before 1962.  He said the plaintiff's
present "psychosis" could have
a number of explanations, perhaps more than one, including chronic
schizophrenic illness, intermittently
felt for decades, undiagnosed physical
disorder (marked weight loss), the use of prescription medicine since 1991 and
drug abuse.
<P>

591   	The text,  <b>"Menders of the Mind"</b>  (A History of
the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, 1946-1996)
reveals a history in Australia including
the following matters.
<P>

592   	In 1946 an Association of Psychiatrists was formed.
Professor Dawson was elected President.  Three of the primary psychiatrists
were women including Dr Sebire.  Over the years there was an increase in
numbers to 208 members by 1956.  The early stance and outlook
of the
Association differed widely "from that which the Society would be likely to
adopt today" in that its earlier stance involved
a judgmental stance closely
linked with notions of exigencies.  In May 1950 most psychiatrists welcomed the
continuing growth of
psychiatrist numbers which was welcomed because most
psychiatrists were seeing Australia as containing "a vast amount of untreated
psychiatric disorder".  Even as at 1981 the history records show an imbalance
between psychiatrists in general practice in all specialities
with all
sub-specialities being seriously "short of manpower".  The increase in
psychiatric numbers had been uneven.  As at 1981
fifty one per cent of
psychiatrists in Australia were employed in the public sector.  Indeed, in 1981
the report showed in most states
the majority of children and adolescents with
psychiatric disorders were seen in the public sector.  There was said to be no
obvious
remedy for the imbalance.
<P>

593   	In a further report Dr Ellard addressed the question "of
what should have been done".  I quote:
<P>

"By the middle of the century any reasonable adult with common sense would know
that it was better to grow up in a loving home than
in an institution.  One did
not need to be a psychiatrist to realise that.  Granted that, it did not follow
that every child in an
orphanage was a candidate for intensive psychiatric
treatment, even if it were apparent that the plaintiff needed it when she began
to cut herself at the age of 8."
<P>

(I have also rejected the plaintiff's claim of cutting herself at Lutanda at
any time.)
<P>

"The full significance for early deprivation did not become generally realised
until the publication of Dr Bowlby's first book as
described in my report of
12/4/99.
<P>

In the environment in which she was, her behaviour may well have been
attributed to sin, rather than unhappiness."
<P>

(I have already made findings as to the situation at Bomaderry and more
significantly at Lutanda.  Her behaviour was not attributed
to sin.)
<P>

"Again, even if the advised management had been available, there is no
guarantee that it would have been successful.  My previous
report gave a
general picture of the resources at the time - they scarcely existed.  It being
noted that the College's Manpower Committee
Report of 1981 stated that all the
subspecialties were seriously short of manpower, even more so in rural areas,
and it further being
noted that the Child Psychiatry Section concluded that in
1982 there was "a severe and critical shortage of child psychiatrists in
Australia which would take 15 to 20 years to remedy the situation", the state
of affairs in mid century can be seen in perspective.
<P>

The chance of the kind of psychotherapy described in the affidavits being made
available to a child in an orphanage in the Blue
Mountains did not exist"
<P>

<b>State of Knowledge</b>
<P>

594   	The plaintiff does not as I understand it advance a case,
nor could she, that the Board was under a duty to exercise a higher
degree of
skill or skill such as that of a psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker:
see  <b><u>X (Minors)  v  Bedfordshire County Council</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 633</a>
per Lord Browne Wilkinson at 766.
<P>

595   	The plaintiff's argument in a general way also advanced
(at T 39) is that it was clear to the Board or ought to have been
clear to the
Board, as it was clear to other government departments, that "the position and
relationship between a child and parent
or parent figure was vital to the
emotional well-being of a child".
<P>

596   	For the defendant it was submitted that there was a
distinction between state of knowledge to be expected from, for example,
medical practitioners who may have thought that children in institutions had a
propensity to develop personality disorders and knowledge
of such by a lay body
such as the AWB.  The defendants argued that it would not be appropriate to
suggest that the Board would have
the kind of psychiatric knowledge that is
suggested in the affidavits of Dr Katz or Dr Waters or the kind social work
knowledge contained
in the affidavit of Mrs Bull.  It was said that it was
unrealistic to expect that a Board of "lay people" would have had that same
knowledge.  Further it was contended that in any event there was a "yawning gap
between the evidence in relation to state of knowledge
and the reasonable
expectations (having regard to other obligations and responsibilities under the
Act) that could be had about a
government Board of that kind".
<P>

597   	Next, it was submitted by the defendants that, relevant
to the most recent amendments pleaded in the further amended statement
of
claim, the standard of knowledge, even of an expert, was not necessarily to
have read "all the literature".
<P>

598   	Having regard to the massive amount of material put
before me, and to Dr Ellard's evidence on the subject of literature,
materials,
articles and knowledge, I can well understand, the defendant's submission.  Mr
Barry relied upon the decision of Cox J
in  <b><u>Gower  v  State of South
Australia &amp; Perriam</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2039%20SASR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 39 SASR 543</a> at 562.  His Honour when
speaking in the context of a professional negligence case, observed (at
562):
<P>

"However it was at a time, when the study of the topic was at its early stages,
and a considerable amount of the work was being
done in another speciality.
The matter had not then entered the general corpus of knowledge of which all
experts in the defendant's
field could be expected to be aware".
<P>

599   	In the instant case it is to be remembered that the Board
had responsibilities extending beyond the custody and maintenance
of the
children of Aborigines.  That said it had special duties for their custody and
maintenance.  It cannot avoid having knowledge
or being imputed with such
knowledge that goes with the discharge of such duties.  It would also have
acquired knowledge through
differing expertise of members of its own Board (s
4), and from dealing with other government departments.  These remarks still
leave
open the question of what requisite knowledge was known or reasonably
required to be known, at different times during the period
with which I am
concerned.
<P>

600   	For the plaintiff it was argued that the state of
knowledge during the relevant period regarding the conditions which were
necessary to permit a child's personality to develop, appears from evidence of
text books and other publications in the public domain
during the relevant
period, evidence from practitioners who worked in the field of child guidance
or child psychiatry at the relevant
time, including Dr Katz and Mrs Bull, and
Government publications such as Annual Reports of the AWB, the Child Welfare
Department,
and the Department of Public Instruction and Health.
<P>

601   	The plaintiff submits that based on the available
information, the methods at Lutanda were at odds with learning on child
psychology as to how a child who had been subjected to total maternal
deprivation (including at Lutanda) should be cared for, and
that the State
should have been aware that many institutions were not staffed or had no
training in "modern child psychology".
<P>

602   	The plaintiff asserts that the learning stressed the
importance of parental and significant bonds in the development of children
which tended to be absent in children in institutions; the fact that absence of
these bonds manifested itself in behavioural problems
of children; that unless
steps were taken to address such problems the child was likely to be harmed;
and that there were means available
of addressing such problems through free
State Child Guidance Clinics.
<P>

603   	The plaintiff asserts that the effects of maternal
deprivation were referred to in the literature and that there was, in
effect, a
responsible body of educational thinking on the subject not only in the 1950's
and 1960's but also in the 1940's.  As I
have already indicated, it is not
suggested by the plaintiff (and it could not really be so) that the AWB was
under a duty to exercise
a degree of skill of professional persons such as
psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers or others in the field.  As I
understand
it, it is rather put that the Board had by the 1940's and 1950's
access to a state of knowledge giving effect to such professionals'
views
similar to or the same as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and
those involved in the child care field.
<P>

604   	As to the state of knowledge, particularly significant is
the reference made in the 1952 Annual Report by the Minister of
Education (the
Minister in charge of the Child Welfare Department) to Dr Bowlby's report to
World Health Organisation ("WHO") in
1951  <b>"Maternal Care and Mental
Health"</b>.  Both parties' experts have referred to Dr Bowlby's prominence in
the field.  I have already referred to it at some length but return
to it again
because of the importance also to be attached to his views in terms of "state
of knowledge".  Indeed, I have found his
report to be a most helpful document
in terms of setting forth the state of knowledge as at the time of its
publication in 1951.
<P>

605   	The plaintiff alleges that the Board had access to the
relevant state of knowledge through the Department of Education and
Public
Instruction which were based upon and run in accordance with the then state of
knowledge regarding the child's personality.
 She alleges that they had access
to such knowledge since 1936.  The Child Guidance Clinics as I have said grew
from the School Medical
Service:  see  Annual Reports of the Department.  Next,
it is said, there was knowledge available to the Board through the Child
Welfare Department "which regarded itself as essentially concerned with the
protection and care of children where homes are non-existent
or inadequate and
which safeguards their education and general welfare":  see the Annual
Reports.
<P>

606   	The plaintiff, relying upon several matters, asserts that
the relevant knowledge was available to the Board.  Subject to
the question of
what the knowledge was and when it was known I believe that the Board would
have had knowledge that the Education
Department and the Child Welfare
Department would have had.  First, the AWB was an instrument of the Crown.
Next, as will be seen
the 1940 amendments to the Act gave effect to Public
Service recommendations including recommendations that there should be
appointed
to the Board persons with certain qualifications and knowledge and
full use was to be made by the Board of specialised services available
to the
Department including the Child Welfare Department.  Third, the Act, amended in
1940, required that officers from the Department
of Health and Public
Instruction were to be appointed, and in fact were appointed to the Board; the
Minister for Instruction (Education)
had responsibility for the Child Welfare
Department and the AWB through its ex-officio board member of the activities of
both departments;
and the Annual Reports of the AWB make reference to
assistance to the Board by other Departments.  Fourth, there was a relationship
between the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  and the  <b><u>Aborigines
Protection Act</u></b>  in that the Children's Court exercised functions under
both.  Action taken in respect of adoption of children under the Board's
control involved action under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  and liaison
with the Child Welfare Department.  Again there was regular communication
between the Board and the Child Welfare Department.
 The Board sent its welfare
officers (eg Mr Felton) to a course on Child Welfare conducted by the Child
Welfare Department.  There
is also some evidence of some wards of the Board
being sent by the Board to Child Guidance Clinics at least in the 1950s.
Finally,
the Act makes reference to the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  and
to Children's Court powers under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  For all
these reasons I am disposed to accept these arguments of the plaintiff on the
issue of knowledge as being knowledge of
the Board, still leaving to be
resolved the question of what state of knowledge was known or ought to have
been known particularly
before 1951.
<P>

607   	I have carefully considered the rival submissions of the
parties as to state of knowledge.  The matter is not in my view
simply to be
seen in terms of the same state of knowledge before 1951 and same state of
knowledge thereafter.  I have carefully considered
the materials but have
concluded that in determining the state of knowledge question, considerable
significance should be given to
the timing of Dr Bowlby's WHO report,
"<b><u>Maternal Care and Mental Health</u></b>" and to the views of Dr Bowlby
on the development of knowledge, to which reference has been earlier made.
<P>

608   	The evidence would suggest that the Child Welfare
Department quickly became aware of  Dr Bowlby's monograph shortly after
its
publication.  Having regard to the evidence, I am prepared to accept that at
the same time as the Child Welfare Department acquired
knowledge of that report
and the thrust of it, so probably did the AWB, at least it ought to have done
so.  In the Annual Child Welfare
Department Report (1952) the conclusion of Dr
Bowlby was stated under the heading "Dependent Children".  This report would
suggest
that the Child Welfare Department was keeping and had kept pace with
contemporary knowledge.  The Child Welfare Department however
noted by way of
reporting that world authorities were placing more and more emphasis on home
values and keeping the child in the
home environment and in the home circle
(the thrust it appears to me of the Bowlby report).  It reported if home
conditions were
impossible, adoption or foster home care, in that order, "was
the next best thing".  That said, it was also reported (a matter relevant
to
reasonable care standards in the 1952 New South Wales community) "that the
public at large still nourish the outmoded method of
institutional care", at
that time.  The report acknowledged that there were difficulties in finding
suitable homes for fostering,
that fostering was not alway available, and that
some children were not suitable for fostering.
<P>

609   	I am satisfied that the Board (for reasons including
close relationship with the Child Welfare Department) was or ought to
have been
aware of Dr Bowlby's report in 1952.  His conclusion in 1951 was stated in the
Report as follows:
<P>

"The proper care of children of a normal home life can now be seen to be not
merely an act of common humanity, but to be essential
for the mental and social
welfare of a community.  For, when their care is neglected, as happens in every
country of the Western
world today, they grow up to reproduce themselves.
Deprived children, whether in their own homes or out of them, are a source of
social infection as real and serious as are carriers of diphtheria and typhoid.
And just as preventive measures have reduced these
diseases to negligible
proportions, so can determined action greatly reduce the number of deprived
children in our midst and the
growth of adults liable to produce more of
them.
<P>

The break-up of families and the shunning of illegitimates is accepted without
demur.  The twin problems of neglectful parents and
deprived children are
viewed fatalistically and left to perpetuate themselves."
<P>

610   	As to the Board's knowledge of Dr Bowlby's report and of
the views of the Child Welfare authority there can be little doubt.
 In a
letter from the AWB to the United Aborigines Mission (17 September 1952) and
signed by Mrs English, an inspector of the Board,
the following passage
appears:
<P>

"The policy of the Aborigines Welfare Board in relation to the maintenance and
training of Aboriginal children favours the system
of boarding-out, rather than
placing them in an institution.  It is felt that the aboriginal child reared as
an integral part of
a family, either white or aboriginal, gains a better chance
of ultimate assimilation.  In any case, training as one of a family group
has a
more beneficial effect on the character building of the child than the
conditions of life usually associated with an institution".
<P>

611   	Thus I infer that the AWB from the time of receipt of Dr
Bowlby's report in Australia was aware of his views.  That still
leaves extant
the matter of the Board's knowledge (actual or constructive) before the
publication of Dr Bowlby's monograph in 1951.
 To some extent the Board's
knowledge is also partly dependent upon the knowledge of such bodies as the
Child Welfare Department.
<P>

612   	It is to be remembered that the plaintiff was born in
1942, well prior to the 1951 report.  The extract from pp 11-12 of
Dr Bowlby's
report (see earlier) is revealing as to the state of knowledge in respect of
the quality of mother (or permanent mother
substitute) care.  I accept it
reflects the state of knowledge situation as well and the evolving of views in
the 1940's ie "in the
past decade".
<P>

613   	It is appropriate, apart from noting again the earlier
references in Dr Bowlby's report to the development of evidence during
the
"past decade" and to "new knowledge", to observe that Dr Bowlby's basic
principle is stated in somewhat general terms.  There
is in the proposition a
degree of vagueness and imprecision in its scope and content.  It is difficult
to see how it could be regarded
as being a statement giving rise to some type
of legal duty to implement such either by a parent, particularly a mother in
relation
to a child or even a mother substitute.  There is reference to the
notion of "mutuality".  How and by what means such mutuality can
be achieved is
not addressed.  Some of the views are not really clarified and his terms are
not readily defined.  In an event the
finding of a "<u>permanent</u> mother
substitute" is also not something that is readily apparent in terms of how it
may be reasonably or practicably achieved.
<P>

614   	I accept that prior to the report of Dr Bowlby (ie
including in the 1940's) the general components of knowledge contained
in his
report were in effect still evolving for those persons, parents or authorities
responsible for child care generally and even
for those expert in the area.
<P>

615   	His views emphasised home values and the retention of the
child in the home environment.  Under the heading  <b>"The Purpose of the
Family"</b>  he said (at p 67):
<P>

"The demonstration that maternal deprivation in the early years has an adverse
effect on personality growth is a challenge to action.
 How can this
deprivation be prevented so that children may grow up mentally healthy?
<P>

It was said at the beginning of the first chapter that what is believed to be
essential for mental health is that the infant and
young child should
experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or
mother-substitute), in which both
find satisfaction and enjoyment.  The child
needs to feel he is an object of pleasure and pride to his mother, the mother
needs to
feel an expansion of her own personality in the personality of her
child: each needs to feel closely identified with the other. 
The mothering of
a child is not something which can be arranged by roster; it is a live human
relationship which alters the characters
of both partners.  The provision of a
proper diet calls for more than calories and vitamins: the need to enjoy our
food if it is
to do us good.  In the same way the provision of mothering cannot
be considered in terms of hours per day but only in terms of the
enjoyment of
each other's company which mother and child obtain.
<P>

Such enjoyment and close identification of feeling is only possible for either
party if the relationship is continuous.  Much emphasis
has already been laid
on the necessity of continuity for the growth of a child's personality.  It
should be remembered, too, that
continuity is necessary for the growth of a
mother.  Just as the baby needs to feel that he belongs to his mother, the
mother needs
to feel that she belongs to her child and it is only when she has
the satisfaction of this feeling that it is easy for her to devote
herself to
him.  The provision of constant attention day and night, seven days a week and
365 days in the year, is possible only
for a woman who derives profound
satisfaction from seeing her child grow from babyhood, through the many phases
of childhood, to
become an independent man or woman, and knows that it is her
care which has made this possible.
<P>

It is for these reasons that the mother love which a young child needs is so
easily provided within the family, and is so very very
difficult to provide
outside it.  The services which mothers and fathers habitually render their
children are so taken for granted
that their magnitude is forgotten.  In no
other relationship do human beings place themselves so unreservedly and so
continuously
at the disposal of others".
<P>

616   	This was the view of Dr Bowlby in 1952.  In terms of
state of knowledge those involved in the welfare of children without
parents
would then have had knowledge of such as did the Child Welfare Department, and,
I infer, also the Board.
<P>

617   	The United Nations Department of Social Affairs (1952) in
its report  <b>"Children Deprived of Normal Home Life"</b>  referred to Dr
Bowlby's report.  It recognised that it was generally accepted that the best
environment for a growing child was
a "normal home".  The United Nations 1952
report acknowledged that long term care was nevertheless provided in both
foster homes
and in institutions, and the latter was a traditional method of
long term care.  The report concluded:
<P>

"100.		Institutions may be organised on a closed or open basis.  In the closed
institution all activities, including education,
take place within the
institution and the children have little, if any, contact with the outside
world.  In open or semi-open institutions
the children usually attend local
schools and have some other ties with the local community.  In general
authorities in all countries
agree that children in institutions should be
permitted to have as much communication with the outside world as possible."
<P>

618   	In the instant case, the "open institution" was the
situation at Bomaderry and Lutanda.  As to the state of knowledge in
the 1940s
I also generally accept the views of Dr Ellard.  He was in Australia in the
relevant period and was well qualified to express
views as to the position in
respect of Australian psychiatric knowledge and standards.  His evidence also
however supports the state
of knowledge urged by the plaintiff after receipt
into the Australian Community of Dr Bowlby's 1951 WHO report.  That is a
different
matter.  I also have regard to  <b>"Menders of the Mind"</b>  supra
and accept the contents of the history contained in the text as to the general
state of psychiatry in this country indeed
in New South Wales in that period.
Much of Dr Ellard's evidence is consistent with that history, including his
views that discussion
of attachment became prominent after Dr Bowlby's
report.
<P>

619   	Next, in terms of state of knowledge at 1942 Professor
Dawson (<b>"Aids to Psychiatry"</b>) whilst discussing the subject of
"psychiatric examination of children" and mental hygiene appears to have made
no reference to the
matter of maternal deprivation or attachment in terms or
even under a different nomenclature (p 313).  Dr Ellard made the point that
Professor Dawson did not place any emphasis on matters of separation or
attachment in his 1942 book.  On the material tendered before
me, that appears
to be generally the situation.
<P>

620   	It is worth repeating that Mrs Buxton (of Lutanda) gave
evidence (at T 406-407) that she went to Lutanda when she was 25
in about 1952.
She said in cross-examination she was a qualified nurse having general,
midwifery and infant welfare certificates.
 Infant welfare concentrated on the
care of babies from birth to kindergarten age.  In respect of her training Mrs
Buxton, a very
fully trained nurse with considerable practical experience in
tending to and caring for children, said in cross-examination by Mr
Hutley for
the plaintiff (at T 407):
<P>

"<b>Q.	</b>	Were you lectured upon the importance of the mother/child bond?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	It was mostly difficult feeders and the care and feeding of the
infant more than mothering bond.  That wasn't recognised, I don't
think, for
some years after that, the very great importance of a mothering bond.
Certainly not in my training time.
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

<b>Q.	</b>	Were you lectured in it?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	Was I lectured in that?  Not that I recall
<P>

<b>Q.	</b>	Were you lectured in situations where, for example, no mother, for
one reason or another, was available ---
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	Not that I recall.
<P>

<b>Q.	</b>	-- to look after the child?
<P>

<b>A.	</b>	No, your Honour.  We were lectured more on the health of the infant
and the feeding of the infant.  It was Truby King form of training,
in which we
were lectured in the feeding of the infant more than the mother/child
relationship and we had children in that place
that were removed from their
mother because they were difficult feeders and so on.  <u>We didn't have
psychology lectures or those sort of things in our course</u>."  [my
emphasis]
<P>

621   	She was a lady well qualified to speak.  She is a
practical experienced nurse and child carer, whose evidence on state of
knowledge I accept as well.
<P>

622   	To summarise, in terms of state of knowledge of
psychiatrists in the 1940's with respect to issues of parental care, bonding,
attachment and disorders, maternal care and associated issues, I accept the
evidence of Dr Ellard.  In terms of nursing and training
of nurses in infant
welfare I accept the evidence of Mrs Buxton from Lutanda.  I also accept the
position in the 1940's as to Australian
psychiatry as that being stated in the
documentary material including Professor Dawson's works on these matters.  I
prefer their
evidence to that of Dr Waters (who did not qualify in medicine
till 1977), or that of Professor Katz who came from South Africa to
Victoria in
1960 and to Sydney in 1964 (after the relevant period of events).  No child
psychiatrist was called by the plaintiff
in respect of that period.
<P>

623   	It would appear to me that the views and material I have
accepted as to state of knowledge in the 1940's generally accords
with those
which are described as evolving in Dr Bowlby's WHO report.
<P>

624   	In my view the relevant state of knowledge began in 1951
after Dr Bowlby's report, and I have found that the AWB was aware
of it..  That
said I would find it difficult to see how it could provide a reasonable basis
for finding a duty, let alone a breach
of any duty based upon it, and
particularly before its publication.
<P>

<b><u>A brief history of Aborigine Protection Legislation and Background to
1940 and 1943 Amending Legislation:</u></b>
<P>

625   	The Act of 1909 covered an area far more extensive than
that covered by the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act 1939</u></b>.  It is appropriate
if I set forth a brief history of legislation and regulations for the
protection of Aborigines.  Such history
will also provide some understanding of
the then current values and standards as well as community attitudes, as they
are reflected
from time to time, by the community through its elected members
of Parliament.  The annual reports of the Aboriginal Welfare Board
to which I
will also refer, fall into a similar category of reflecting community attitudes
as well as providing some assistance and
understanding of contemporary views,
values and standards.  They also show that Governments, the Parliament, and the
Board had a
long history of activity in the area of securing the protection,
welfare and advancement of Aboriginals.
<P>

626   	In particular in the Aborigines Protection Report and in
Recommendations of the Public Service Board of New South Wales tabled
in
Parliament in 1940 ("PSB Report"), there  is to be found much information and
history (including legislation) of dealings with
the aboriginal community.  I
shall deal with it and at the same time consider in greater detail the relevant
legislation.  The report
itself led to amendments to legislation dealing with
aborigines in 1940.  That report has been tendered in evidence.  It was tabled
two years before the plaintiff was born.
<P>

627   	The PSB Report commenced by indicating that on 16 June
1939 (just before Word War II broke out and towards the end of the
Depression
years) the relevant Minister, the Chief Secretary, stated that he was concerned
with regard to the question of the protection
and development of the aboriginal
population of the State and that it was "the desire of the Government to give
early consideration
to the matter generally with the object of ensuring that
the best arrangements in the interests of all concerned are made".  The
then
significant Public Service Board agreed to undertake the investigation.  The
Board detailed the inquiries it had made which
included consideration of
evidence given before the Parliamentary Select Committee appointed in November
1937 to inquire into the
administration of the Aborigines Welfare Board.  It
also had regard to the proceedings of conferences and inquiries held in New
South
Wales and elsewhere including the provisions of legislation in other
States and countries.  It should also be noted that in 1937
the
Commonwealth/State conference had established a national policy of assimilating
Aboriginal people into the broader community.
 That was the Australia policy
then, no doubt perceived to be appropriate despite its clear lack of
acceptability by modern contemporary
standards and values.
<P>

628   	The report revealed that in 1881 the Government appointed
a Protector of Aborigines who was accommodated in the Chief Secretary's
Department to distribute "necessary aid".  In 1883 a Board of Protection was
established.  The Aborigines Protection Board functioned
without statutory
force till 1909 when the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909</u></b>  was
passed.
<P>

629   	The  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909</u></b>  was
passed to provide for the protection and care of aborigines.  "Aborigine" was
initially defined to mean "any full blooded aboriginal
native of Australia and
any person apparently having admixture of aboriginal blood who applies for and
is in receipt of rations or
aid from the Board or is residing on a reserve".
(The Act was subsequently amended in 1936 to define "aborigine" as meaning "any
full-blooded or half-caste aboriginal who is a native of Australia and who is
temporarily or permanently resident in New South Wales").
 Under the 1909 Act
the "Board for Protection of Aborigines ("APB") was established consisting of
the Inspector General of Police
and ten members.  The Board was designated as
the authority for the protection and care of aborigines.  Under s 7, duties or
a number
of duties were imposed on the Board.  One duty under s 7(c) was to
provide for the "custody, maintenance and education of children
of aborigines".
Under s 7(d) a duty was also imposed to exercise a general supervision over all
matters affecting the interests and
welfare of aborigines.  To advance a ward's
interests, pursuant to s 11, the Board could also apprentice a child of any
aborigine,
or neglected child of any person apparently having an admixture of
aboriginal blood.  The words "neglected child" were given the
same meaning as
assigned to them in the  <b><u>Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders
Act</u></b> (a predecessor of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  What is
clear and will become clear is that historically, aboriginal children and
non-aboriginal children were treated differently
and covered by different
regimes of child welfare.  Regulations under the Act were made in 1910 and were
not substantially altered
as at 1939.
<P>

630   	In 1916 the APB, which then consisted of eleven members
including four members of Parliament, was reconstructed by replacement
of the
ten member board by a Board comprising the Under Secretary of the Chief
Secretary's Department, the Director General of Public
Health, the Chief
Inspector of Schools, a member of the Legislative Assembly and others.  The
point is that a variety of relative
Government Departments were given
representation with an opportunity for their views and interests (including
from the Departments
of Health and Instruction) to be reflected in Board policy
and decisions.  Parliament too was represented as I have observed.
<P>

631   	The PSB Report (1940), revealed that as at the time of
reporting, there were three members of the Legislative Assembly on
the APB and
one member of the Federal House of Representatives.
<P>

632   	The PSB Report 1940 summarised the then powers and duties
of the APB as including powers and functions:
<P>

"(III)		to provide for the custody, maintenance and education of the children
of aborigines and welfare of aborigines and;
<P>

(XI)		it may assume full control and custody of the child of any aboriginal, if
after due inquiry, it is satisfied that such a course
is in the interest of the
moral or physical welfare of the child".
<P>

633   	The PSB Report stated that it was estimated that 10,593
aborigines were subject to the provisions of the Act comprising "849
full-bloods and 9,744 half-castes etc".
<P>

634   	Also noted was that whilst the number of full-bloods was
gradually reducing, the number of persons within the Aborigine Board
administration was increasing.  At page 12 of the PSB's report (p 1438) the
following appeared in terms of identifying "the problem":
<P>

"Shortly the problem to be faced today is the method to be adopted in dealing
with what the <u>man in the street probably considers to be the problem</u>,
viz those persons with a preponderance of aboriginal blood but with a
constantly increasing number of persons who are half-castes,
or who have a
lesser proportion of aboriginal blood".  [my emphasis]
<P>

635   	It also reported that it appears to be "<u>the consensus
of opinion of those best qualified to speak that</u> the only satisfactory
solution of the problem is so to mould the administration so as to ensure as
early as possible, <u>the assimilation of these people into the social and
economic life of the general community</u>".  [my emphasis].
<P>

636   	I have underlined various passages to highlight what was
perceived to be the problem and solution to the problem in accordance
with the
contemporary values and standards of the times, beginning in the 1940's.
<P>

637   	The PSB noted and agreed that a considerable part of the
difficulty associated with the problem was caused by the "then antipathy
of the
fully white community to those possessing aboriginal blood".  The current
contemporary word to describe such might be fairly
called straight out
"prejudice".  The point is that the Board and the political leaders were
addressing the problem against this
background of antipathy and prejudice
according to the perceived standards of the time.  The matter identifying and
resolving problems
was clearly not easy against this background.  The PSB felt
that before the problem, including the antipathy, could be overcome,
every
effort should be made to utilise the services of public-minded citizens and to
obtain the organised interest "of the <u>churches</u> in the aborigines".  [my
emphasis]
<P>

638   	The PSB report also discussed the assistance then being
rendered by the State to Aborigines.  It noted that in relation to
schools the
then present system of education of children left much to be desired and made a
number of recommendations including that
the Department of Public Instruction
gradually take over the education of children, working closely with the
Aborigines Protection
Board.  The Board commented that there was room for more
social work amongst Aborigines than at present (there was a shortage of
staff)
including co-operation with inspectors of the Child Welfare Department.
<P>

639   	The PSB observed that the Aborigines Protection Board's
efforts had largely been confined to the improvement of conditions
of life of
persons within its control.  The PSB was sympathetic with the APB in the
difficulties it was experiencing in its work.
 The Board it was said had
endeavoured whilst providing improved conditions to carry out duties in "a
manner most economical to the
Government".  The members of the Board (occupying
responsible public positions) were "all honorary".
<P>

640   	The PSB expressed the view that whatever was done to
re-constitute the Aborigines Protection Board, the "Board form of control
at
present existing is the correct one".  They nevertheless suggested that a
person who was an expert in sociology "the science of
social relations" and/or
anthropology (the study of characteristic cultures etc of mankind)" should be
appointed to the APB.
<P>

641   	The PSB made other recommendations including (p 28) a
greater use of the powers conferred on the APB to assume control and
custody of
the child of an aborigine if, after due inquiry, it is satisfied that such a
course is in the interest of the moral and
physical welfare of the child.
<P>

642   	I turn to the summary of the Public Service Board's views
and recommendations (p 30) based upon its inquiries.  Such presumably
also
reflected contemporary views, standards and thinking.  They may not be correct
or enlightened by today's contemporary values
and standards.  That is not the
point.  The recommendations were significant, and legislative changes in 1940
policy are also to
be seen against such background.  These are the significant
changes of relevance that were recommended:
<P>

(a)	The ultimate aim of the administration should be the gradual assimilation
of aborigines into the economic and social life of
the general community.
<P>

(b)	Recommendations to change the Board to include representatives of the
<u>controlling</u> Department (the Chief Secretary's), the Department of
Education and Health, an expert in social or anthropological work, an executive
member to be the principal officer of the Board staff devoting full time duties
to the task.
<P>

643   	I would observe in passing that in the PSB's report there
was no mention of fostering children out as a recommendation. 
The Act as it
then stood conferred no power in terms of fostering out children who were wards
under the Act or at all.  Likewise
there was no provision, at least in express
terms, in respect of the matter of adoption of Aboriginal Children or children
of Aborigines.
<P>

644   	In respect of staff organisation it was recommended that
the Act be altered to bring all employees under the one control,
the
<b><u>Public Service Act</u></b>.
<P>

645   	Turning to the matter of facilities, the PSB observed
that the maintenance of an institution such as Kinchela a training
home for
boys run by the AWB, was "essential" with some reorganised methods.  The same
view applied in respect of the girls' training
school at Cootamundra.  No
recommendation was made in respect of Bomaderry.  The Board recommended
statutory changes.  Some of these
significant changes were taken up by the
legislature in 1940.  Before turning to these amendments I would note that in
1936 a number
of amendments were made to the Act including the powers to
arrange and monitor apprenticeships without the consent of child or parents,
and other amendments were made touching upon the position of children and their
families: ss 13 and 13A.
<P>

<b><u>The Assimilation Policy and Legislative Amendments of 1940</u></b>
<P>

646   	The  <b><u>Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act No 12
1940</u></b>  (assented to in June 1940) contained some significant amendments.
The 1909 Act, as amended by the 1940 provisions, was the Act on
foot at the
time of the plaintiff's birth on 17 September 1942.  After her birth
significant legislative changes were further brought
about by the 1943
legislation, to which I will refer in due course.
<P>

647   	As I have said, the 1937 Commonwealth-State conference
established a national policy of assimilating aboriginal people into
the
general community.  The 1940 report of the Public Service Board made a similar
recommendation.  The legislation was passed to
accord with and, inter alia, to
reflect those aims.  Indeed, not only did this legislation have a historical
context it also presumably
reflected and gave effect to the contemporary values
and views, standards and attitudes of Parliament representing the New South
Wales community.
<P>

648   	New duties were imposed upon the constituted AWB
including under s 7(1)(a), a duty of that Board:
<P>

"(a)	to apply moneys voted by Parliament or funds in its possession for the
benefit of aborigines or otherwise for the purpose of
assisting aborigines to
become assimilated into the general life of the community".
<P>

649   	Whatever may be thought today of that duty and the policy
behind it, the fact is that Parliament imposed it upon the Board,
and the Board
had a duty to implement that which was set forth in s 7(1)(a).  The policy of
assimilation as earlier discussed was
given statutory emphasis by
Parliament.
<P>

650   	In  <b><u>Aborigines Welfare Board  v  Saunders</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20NSWR%20917" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) NSWR 917</a>, Walsh J (at 922) came to the conclusion that the powers
granted under the 1909-1943 legislation placed the AWB in the same category
of
a body independent of the Government with powers and functions in relation to
which it acted with a substantial degree of independence
and in accordance with
its own discretion.  The functions entrusted to the Board were considered to be
of the kind normally to be
regarded as falling within the province of
Government.
<P>

651   	In respect of s 7(1)(c), it is important to observe that
in 1940 the earlier sub-section was amended so that the words of
the
sub-section read "custody and maintenance".  The duty of education was removed.
This was a significant change and relevant to
the relationship between the
plaintiff and the Board.  The removal of that duty to provide for education was
not noted in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  and the remarks of Kirby P at 511
that the Board "was in the nature of a statutory guardian" should be perhaps
considered in context
of his Honour's "assumption" that there was also a duty
to provide education in s 7(1)(c).  Perhaps the removal of the duty to educate
was done to give effect to the PSB's recommendation that Aborigine children
should be educated and absorbed into ordinary schools.
 However, one cannot be
certain about this.
<P>

652   	Other amendments included the abolishment of the Board
for Protection of Aborigines and the reconstitution of the Aborigines
Welfare
Board ("the AWB").  The Board was reconstituted to consist of eleven members,
with the chairman being the Under Secretary
of the Chief Secretary's
Department.  The Board was to consist of one each from the Department of Public
Instruction (the precursor
of the Department of Education with the Minister
also being the relevant Minister for Child Welfare as well) the Department of
Public
Health.  Other members included a member of the police force, the
Superintendent of Aborigines Welfare, one an expert in agriculture;
one an
expert on "sociology and/or anthropology; and three persons appointed by the
Minister.
<P>

653   	At the time a new definition of "child" was introduced
providing that "child" meant an Aborigine under 18 years of age. 
A new
definition of "ward" was introduced.  "Ward" meant a child who has been
admitted to the <b><u>control of the board</u></b> or committed to a home
constituted and established under s 11 of the Act [my emphasis].  This
definition and its meaning has given
rise to considerable argument and
discussion  in which "ward" was given a statutory meaning for the purposes of
the Act.  There was
no reference to or definition of a guardian in s 3.  A
child became a ward only when the child has either been admitted by the Board
to its control under (s 7(2)), on the application of the parent or guardian; or
committed to a home constituted and established under
s 11 of the Act (a
"committal" by a Children's Court established under the  <b><u>Child Welfare
Act</u></b>  under s 13A(1) of the Act).  As to the nature of wardship and
wardship proceedings, and whether care and control is but one aspect
of
custody, and whether custody is co-extensive with guardianship;  see
<b><u>Wedd  v  Wedd</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAStRp/1948/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1948] SAStRp 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%20SASR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] SASR 104</a>;  <b><u>Fountain  v

<P>

654   	I would note in passing that s 5 of the amending Act of
1940 provided that the Governor might, under the  <b><u>Public Service Act
1902</u></b>,  appoint a Superintendent of Aborigines Welfare "and such other
officers and employees as may be necessary for the administration
of the Act,
with such persons being subject to that Act during tenure".
<P>

655   	In 1941, Regulations were made pursuant to the provisions
of the Act to take effect from September 1941.  The Regulations
dealt with a
number of matters, see Exhibit A5 (pp 1380-1386).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/fr219/" class="autolink_findacts">Further Regulations</a> were
made in May 1942.  In May 1943 a Regulation was made providing for travelling
allowances to members of the Board.
<P>

<b>The Provisions of the  <u>Aborigines Protection Act</u> 1909  -  1943 (A
summary as at 1943)</b>
<P>

656   	The <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909</u></b> was next
amended by the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act 1943</u></b>.  The
plaintiff was born in 1942 before these amendments including those permitting
fostering out and those amending the provisions
of s 11D.  The 1943 amendments
did not resolve what might be regarded as the somewhat obscure status of the
AWB with respect to wards.
 The 1940 legislation was somewhat silent as regards
the Board's position.  The fact that the duty to educate was dropped in 1940
and amendments passed in 1943 might militate against the view that a
guardian-ward relationship or even one in the nature of a statutory
guardian
was created or intended.
<P>

657   	A consolidated version of the  <b><u>Aborigines
Protection Act 1909</u></b>,  as amended, applicable in the period from 1942 to
1960 inclusive, may be found in Volume 1 of the  <b>New South Wales Statutes
1824-1957</b>  (Red Statutes).  The language of the Act is obscure in terms of
identifying the legal status and legal relationship between the
AWB and a ward.
Under the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  there is no similar
analogous, or counterpart provision to s 9 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act
1939</u></b>,  whereby the Minister became a guardian of any child or ward.
Next, no definitions of "guardian", "care or "maintenance" appear
in the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>.  The relevant provisions of the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909-1943</u></b>  (as at 1943) may be
summarised:
<P>

(i)	Section 3 defines "aborigine" to mean any full-blooded or half-caste
aboriginal who is a native of Australia and who is temporarily
or permanently
resident in New South Wales.
<P>

(ii)	Section 3 defines "Adopted boarder" to mean, inter alia, a child allowed
by authority of the  Aborigines Welfare Board to remain
a foster parent.
<P>

(iii)	Section 3 defines "boarded-out" to mean placed in the care of some foster
parent for the purpose of being nursed, maintained,
trained or educated by such
person or in such person's home.
<P>

(iv)	Section 3 defines "child" to mean an aborigine under 18 years of age.
<P>

(v)	Section 3 defines "foster parent" to mean any person with whom any child is
boarded-out or placed as an adopted boarder.
<P>

(vi)	Section 3 defines "reserve" to mean an area of land reserved from sale or
lease under any Act dealing with Crown lands or given
by or acquired from any
private person for use of aborigines.
<P>

(vii)	Section 3 defines "stations" to mean stations on reserves.
<P>

(viii)	Section 3 defines "ward" to mean a child who has been admitted to the
control of the Board or committed to a home constituted
and established under s
11 of the Aborigines Protection Act.
<P>

(ix)	Section 4(1) creates the Aborigines Welfare Board.
<P>

658   	As foreshadowed s 4(1) provided that the Board should
consist of eleven (11) members, the chairman being the Under Secretary
of the
Chief Secretary's Department with appointed members being the Superintendent of
Aboriginal Welfare, one each from the Department
of Instruction (The Minister
was the Ministerial head of the Child Welfare Department), and Department of
Public Health.  The others
consisted of a member of the police force above the
rank of Inspector; an expert in agriculture, an expert on sociology and/or
anthropology,
two (2) persons to be nominated by the Minister and under a new
sub-paragraph s 4(vii) two persons who were aborigines at least one
of which
was to be a "full-blooded" aborigine.
<P>

(x)	Section 4A(1) provides that the Board shall be a body corporate with
perpetual succession and a common seal and that it may
sue and be sued in its
corporate name.
<P>

(xi)	Section 7(1)(a) provides, inter alia, that it shall be the duty of the
Board to, with the consent of the Minister, apportion,
distribute and apply any
moneys voted by parliament and any other funds in its possession or control for
the relief or benefit of
aborigines or for the purpose of assisting aborigines
to become assimilated into the general life of the community.
<P>

(xii)	Section 7(1)(c) provides that it shall be the duty of the Board to
provide for the custody and maintenance of the children
of aborigines.
<P>

(xiii)	Section 7(1)(e) provides that it shall be the duty of the Board to
exercise a general supervision and care over all aborigines
and over all
matters affecting the interests and welfare of aborigines, and to protect them
against injustice, imposition and fraud.
<P>

(xiv)	Section 7(1)(f) provides that it shall be the duty of the Board to
arrange for the inspection at regular intervals of each
station and training
school under the control of the Board.
<P>

(xv)	Section 7(2) provides that the Board may on the application of the parent
or guardian of any child admit such child to the
control of the Board.
<P>

(xvi)	Section 11 provides that the Board may establish homes for the reception,
maintenance, education and training of wards.
<P>

659   	Again it may be noted that s 11B(1) permits the plaintiff
to be placed in a home pending apprenticeship or employment.
<P>

(xvii)	Section 11D(1)(a) provides that the Board shall be the authority to
admit a child to its control.
<P>

(xviii)	Section 11D(1)(d) provides that the Board shall be the authority to
direct the removal or transfer of any ward, other than
a ward committed to an
institution.
<P>

(xix)	Section 11D(1)(e) provides that the Board shall be the authority to,
inter alia, board-out or place as an adopted boarder
any ward, other than a
ward who has been committed to an institution.
<P>

(xx)	Section 11D(1)(f) provides that the Board shall be the authority to
approve of persons applying for the custody of wards and
of the homes of such
persons.
<P>

(xxi)	Section 11D(1)(g) provides that the Board shall be the authority to
arrange the terms and conditions of the custody of any
ward.
<P>

(xxii)	Section 11D(1)(h) provides that the Board shall be the authority to
direct the restoration of any ward (other than a ward
who has been committed to
an institution) to the care of his parent or of any other person.
<P>

(xxiii)	Section 11D(1)(i) provides the Board shall be the authority to direct
the absolute discharge of any ward (other than a ward
committed to an
institution) from supervision and control.
<P>

(xxiv)	Section 11D(2)(a) provides that the Board may, under s 11D(1), board-out
any child to the person for the time being in charge
of any charitable depot,
home or hostel and may make payments to such person.
<P>

(xxv)	Section 11D(2)(b) provides that where payments are made in accordance
with s 11D(2)(a), an officer appointed for the purpose
may, at any time inspect
such charitable depot, home or hostel and make such examinations into the state
and management thereof and
the conditions and treatment of the children and
young persons (being inmates thereof) in respect of whom the payments are so
made,
as he thinks requisite, and the former person shall afford all reasonable
facilities for such inspection and examination.
<P>

(xxvi)	Section 11D(2)(c) defines "charitable depot, home or hostel" for the
purpose of s 11D(2) to mean a depot, home or hostel
established or maintained
by a charitable organisation and used wholly or in part for the purposes
analogous to the purposes referred
to in s 21(1) of the  <b><u>Child Welfare
Act</u></b>.
<P>

(xxvii)Section 11D(3) provides that the Board may, on terms, place a ward as an
adopted boarder in the care of a foster parent.
<P>

(xxviii)Section 11E provides that the Board may remove any child from any
charitable institution, depot, home or hostel supported
wholly or in part by
grants by the Consolidated Revenue Fund and cause him or her to be, inter alia,
boarded-out or placed as an
adopted boarder.
<P>

(xxix)	Section 12(1) provides that if any ward placed in a home established
under s 11, or any ward placed in employment or apprenticed,
is absent without
the leave of the Board or a duly authorised officer of the Board, any police
officer or officer of the Board may
apprehend such ward and convey him to such
home or back to his employer.
<P>

(xxx)	Section 12(2) provides that any magistrate or justice may issue a warrant
for the arrest of any ward who has absconded or
been illegally removed from his
proper custody.
<P>

(xxxi)Section 12(3) provides that where any such ward is arrested, he shall be
brought before a Children's Court.
<P>

(xxxii)Section 12(4) provides that any ward who absconds from his proper
custody is guilty of an offence under the Act and such
court may order one or
more of the methods of punishment referred to in Part II of the Child Welfare
Act, 1939 or exercise any of
the powers in subs 83(1), (2) or (3) of the Child
Welfare Act, 1939 with certain qualifications therein stated; or return the
ward
to his former custody.
<P>

(xxxiv)Section 13A(1) provides that a justice may, upon oath being made before
him by an authorised officer of the Board, or by
a member of the Police Force,
having made due inquiry, if he believes any child to be a neglected or
uncontrollable child, issue
his summons for the appearance of such child before
a Children's Court established under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>, or
issue a warrant for the apprehension of the child.
<P>

(xxxv)Section 13A(2) provides that any person having the care, custody or
control of a child may apply to a Children's Court established
under the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>,  to commit the child to the control of the
Board or to a home established under s 11 of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection
Act 1909</u></b>  upon the ground that he or she is an uncontrollable child.
<P>

(xxxvi)Section 13A(3) provides that the expressions "neglected child" and
"uncontrollable" are to have the same meanings as under
the  <b><u>Child
Welfare Act</u></b>.
<P>

(xxxvii)Section 13A(7) provides that the provisions of ss 81 and 82 of the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act 1939</u></b> shall apply, mutatis mutandis, in respect
of proceedings against the child under s 13A, provided that where the court
decides to
exercise its power under s 82(d) of that Act, it shall commit the
child to the care of the Board to be dealt with as a ward admitted
to the
control of the Board; and where the court decides to exercise the power under s
82(e) it shall commit the child to a home
established under s 11 of the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act 1909</u></b>.
<P>

(xxxviii)Section 18B provides, inter alia, that in any legal proceedings, if
the court does not consider that there is sufficient
evidence to determine
whether a person is or is not an aborigine, such court, having seen such
person, may determine the question
according to its own opinion.
<P>

(xxxix)Section 18C(1) provides that the Board may, upon application in writing,
issue a certificate to any aborigine or person apparently
having an admixture
of aboriginal blood, who, in the opinion of the Board, ought no longer be
subject to the provisions of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>,  in
or to the effect of the prescribed form exempting such aborigine or person from
the provisions of the Act.
<P>

(xl)	Section 19A(1) provides that the Board may, from time to time, by
resolution delegate to any person either generally or in
any particular case or
class of cases, such of the powers, authorities, duties or functions of the
Board as may be specified in the
resolution, provided that no such delegation
shall have any force or effect unless and until it has been approved by the
Minister.
<P>

(xli)	Section 19A(2) provides that a delegate while acting within the scope of
any such delegation shall be deemed to be the Board.
<P>

(xlii)	Section 19B provides that the Board shall, as soon as practicable after
1 July each year, submit to the Minister a report
of its proceedings during the
preceding year and that the Minister shall cause such report to be laid before
both Houses of Parliament.
<P>

660   	The statute thus provided in s 19B its own machinery for
seeing that the statutory purposes and duties were achieved.
<P>

661   	The amendments to the Act in 1940 (and the earlier
provisions) did not in terms permit fostering of a ward by the AWB.  Under
the
new provisions in 1943, fostering was provided for with definitions in s 3 of
"adopted boarder"; "boarded out" and "foster parent".
 Under s 11B(1) the Board
could place a ward in a Home for the purpose of being maintained, educated and
trained.  It may also be
noted that s 11A(1) permitted the Board to place a
ward into indentures or employment, and to sue for wages for the benefit of the
ward (s 11A(4)), but where an apprenticeship agreement or employment agreement
was to be cancelled, the Board had to obtain the "approval
of the employer or
<u>guardian</u> of the ward". [my emphasis]  This last provision appears to
contemplate, for example, the wardship of a child in another person other
than
the Board, such as possibly the mother of an illegitimate child:  <b><u>Lawson
v  Youngman</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 457</a>;  <b><u>Ex parte Vorhauer;  Re
Steep</u></b>  (1968) 88 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 135.
<P>

662   	Importantly the new section 11D(1) conferred an authority
upon the Board to board out any child to the person for the time
being in
charge of any charitable depot, home or hostel and to make prescribed payments
to them.  Whilst such payments were made,
that person in charge came under an
obligation to afford all reasonable facilities for inspection and examination
into the state
and management of the charitable depot, home or hostel.
"Charitable depot, home or hostel" was defined as meaning a depot, home or
hostel established or maintained by a charitable organisation and used wholly
or in part for purposes referred to in s 21 of the
 <b><u>Child Welfare
Act</u></b>.
<P>

663   	Section 11D(3) conferred upon the Board a right (not a
duty), upon terms and conditions prescribed, or as it may in any special
case
approve, to place a ward as an adopted boarder in the care of a foster parent.
Section 11D(4) dealt with limitation on the payment
of foster parents.  Mere
forcing out did not suggest that the child ceased to be a ward.  The Act
imposed no duty on the Board in
the 1943 amendment to seek out and find foster
parents.
<P>

664   	Under s 11E the Board was given power to remove a child
from any charitable institution, depot, home or hostel supported
wholly or in
part by grants from Consolidated Revenue Funds and cause him or her to be
apprenticed, boarded out or placed as an adopted
boarder.
<P>

665   	Pursuant to the amendments in 1943, additional
regulations were gazetted on 21 April 1944.  These included Regulations headed
"Boarding-out of Aboriginal Wards Placing of Wards with Foster Parents".
Regulation 39 provided that an application for admission
of a child to the
Board's control as a ward should be in accordance with Form 11 in the Schedule.
Regulation 40 provided that a person
desiring to undertake the care of a ward
as a boarded out ward or as an adopted boarder shall furnish the particulars in
Form 12
of the Schedule.  Regulation 40(2) required certain particulars to be
given, including references from a Magistrate, Justice Peace
or Clergyman as to
an applicant's fitness to be "entrusted with the care of a ward or wards".
<P>

666   	Indeed, the Board (by the 1943 legislation) was given a
discretion as opposed to a duty to "cause to be visited and inspected
any child
who has been a ward for any period after the date upon which such child attains
the age of 18 years".
<P>

667   	Regulation 41 dealt with a copy of the list of clothing
issued to a ward to be provided to each foster parent.  A foster
parent with
whom a ward was boarded-out or placed as an adopted boarder had certain
obligations under the regulations including a
requirement "that the ward's
<u>moral and religious training</u> shall be cared for by the foster parents".
Clearly in the 1940's there was a perception of the clear importance of
religion and its
note in the then Australian society.  The regulations dealt
with obligations in respect of medical and dental treatment.  Any welfare
officer or visitor appointed might in the performance of his duties visit any
ward at the home of his or her foster parents.  The
reference to religious
training in the Regulations provides some background for the placement of
children in homes.
<P>

668   	It is hard to see how Form 11 (Regulation 39) would apply
to a child which had already prior to 1943 been admitted to the
Board's
control.  That said, the form required information including amongst other
things, a reason for making a request.  That such
was required for an admission
to the Board's control was not surprising since s 7(2) involved a discretion to
admit the child to
its control.
<P>

669   	In  <b><u>Coe  v  Gordon</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 419</a> Lee
J (at 426) said the whole purpose of the Act is "the orderly settlement and
supervision of Aborigines for their own benefit and
for the benefit of the
community under the control of a public authority established under the
Act".
<P>

<b>The Provisions of the Child Welfare Act 1939-1956</b>
<P>

670   	A consolidated version of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act
1939</u></b>,  as amended, applicable in the period from 1939 to 1956
inclusive, may be found in Volume 1 of the  <b>New South Wales Statutes
1824-1957</b>  (Red Statutes).  The relevant provisions of the  <b><u>Child
Welfare Act 1939-1956</u></b>  are:
<P>

(i)	Section 4(1) defines "admitted to State control" to mean admitted to the
control  of the Minister for the purpose of being apprenticed,
boarded-out,
placed-out or placed as an adopted boarder.

<P>

671   	Part XIX of the Act (to which I have earlier made
reference) dealt with the adoption of children.  The court was given powers
to
make orders (s 164).  Applications had to be made to the court by persons
described (s 163) under s 167.  An order could not be
made except where there
was an order dispensing with consent (s 168) or, in the case of an illegitimate
child, where there is the
consent of the mother or, if the child has a
guardian, where the guardian consents.
<P>

<b>The Law</b>
<P>

<b>Trespass</b>
<P>

672   	As regards the action in trespass, the plaintiff only
maintains such an action in respect of Bomaderry in the event that
I were not
to find that the UAM took control of the child under s 7(2) of the Act on the
mother's application: see also the defendant's
submission (at T 540).  I have
already found that the Board did take control of the child at the mother's
request before the child
was taken to Bomaderry in October 1942.
<P>

673   	Further, in her written submissions in reply the
plaintiff stated that she accepted that any claim for trespass could not
be
maintained once the plaintiff's mother gave her consent to the plaintiff's
transfer to "Lutanda" in 1947.  The mother's signature
(and this is not
disputed) appears on the Application Form for entry of her daughter to Lutanda
in 1947, thus at the very least she
"consented" to the plaintiff going to
Lutanda.  This accords with the plaintiff's submission (at T 539-540).  The
case of trespass
was advanced by the plaintiff upon the alternative were I to
find that the Board took control of the plaintiff without legal justification.
Indeed, the plaintiff accepts the conclusions urged by the defendants that the
plaintiff's placement at Bomaderry and/or control
or custody by the AWB was
lawful being with the consent, or at the request of, the mother and that the
plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda
was with the consent of her mother and in
accordance with the AWB's statutory duty.
<P>

674   	The cause of action in trespass does not arise on the
facts and should be rejected.
<P>

<b>Statutory Count</b>
<P>

675   	Next, the plaintiff advances a case of breach of
statutory duty.
<P>

676   	The plaintiff's argument is advanced in a short paragraph
only in her submissions in reply.  The argument is put as follows:
<P>

"... The primary relevance of the provisions of the Act is that they impose
duties on the Board and concomitant powers to perform
the duties.  The
statutory duties were exercised by the Board in the instant case to create a
relationship with the plaintiff which
attracts common law duties of care and
fiduciary duties".
<P>

677   	No authority is quoted in support of this submission.  In
one sense this submission might be understood as being an assertion
that the
Board having the requisite statutory powers was liable to the plaintiff at
common law for negligence in respect of the performance
of a statutory function
including a negligent failure to perform it:  <b><u>Romeo  v  Conservation
Commission</u></b>  supra per Kirby J at 472.
<P>

678   	I am left with the impression that the plaintiff's
argument advanced in support of the reliance upon the statutory count,
is not
regarded by Mr Hutley as being a strong one.  The statutory cause of action was
not pleaded in the original statement of claim
in 1993 nor is it the subject of
any ruling by Studdert J in the extension of time proceedings (judgment 25
August 1993).  The matter
does not appear to have been raised or dealt with in
the Court of Appeal where the damages sought were for "negligent breach of duty
and wrongful imprisonment", and "a claim for equitable compensation for an
alleged breach of fiduciary duty":  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  supra per
Kirby P at 500.
<P>

679   	The Further Amended Statement of Claim (22 March 1999)
alleges that the defendant owed a statutory duty to the plaintiff:
<P>

(a)	to provide for her "custody, maintenance and education"; and 
<P>

(b)	to exercise a general supervision and care over all matters affecting her
interests and welfare and to protect her against injustice,
imposition and
fraud.
<P>

680   	It is said that the duty referred to in (a) arose by
reason of s 7(1)(c) of the Act.  It is appropriate if I here repeat
that whilst
in the Court of Appeal in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>,  Kirby P (at 511)
referred to the words "custody maintenance and education".  As at 1942 and
thereafter the word "education" did
not appear in s 7(1)(c) of the Act, having
been removed by the amending legislation of 1940.  Indeed, to this extent I
would observe
at this point in passing, that the absence of a further duty to
"educate" distinguishes some of the Equity cases to which I was referred
from
the instant case.  The views of Kirby P in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  in
one sense are expressed in the context of an understanding of the presence of
the words "custody, maintenance and education".
 Next, in respect of the duty
alleged under (b) of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, such is said to
arise from s 7(1)(e) of
the Act.
<P>

681   	In my view there is no actionable statutory duty at all:
see  <b><u>O'Connor  v  S. P. Bray Pty Ltd</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2056%20CLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 56 CLR 464</a>;  <b><u>X
(Minors)  v  Bedfordshire County Council</u></b>  supra;  see also
<b><u>Stovin  v  Wise</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 923.</a>  The alleged statutory duties do
not arise.  The provisions were not intended to give a right of action in tort.
On a proper statutory
construction "no inference" arises that a right of action
is conferred having reference to the nature, scope and terms of the Act.
 As I
have said, in  <b><u>Coe  v  Gordon</u></b>  supra, Lee J at 426 referred to
the whole purpose of the Acts as being for the "orderly settlement and
supervision of Aborigines
for their benefit and for the benefit of the
community under control of a public authority established under the Act".  In
<b><u>Aborigines Welfare Board  v  Saunders</u></b>  supra, Walsh J referred to
the Board as a body with powers and functions to which it acts with a
substantial degree of independence
and in accordance with its own
discretion.
<P>

682   	It is submitted that there is no action for breach of
statutory duty unless the legislation confers a right of the injured
person to
have the duty performed.  If no right is conferred the general rule is that
there is no liability in damages: see  <b><u>Northern Territory  v
Mengel</u></b>  (1995) 185 CLR 307 at 343-344 and the cases cited by way of
footnotes.  In my view the provisions do not impose upon the defendants
any
special statutory duty or liability to the plaintiff enforceable by an action
for damages independently of the ordinary principles
of the common law of
negligence:  <b><u>Sutherland Shire Council  v  Heyman</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR
424</a> per Deane J at 500 where his Honour also dealt with the matter of "assumed
legislative intent".  Next, it is well settled that a
public authority may be
subject to a common law duty of care when it exercises a statutory power or
performs a statutory duty.  Indeed,
there may be separate and concurrent causes
of action arising from breach of a statutory duty and common law negligence, so
that
the breach of statutory duty may both itself give rise to a separate cause
of action and be evidence of negligence at common law:
see Mason J at 459-461.
In  <b><u>Leask Timber Hardware Pty Ltd  v  Thorne</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20106%20CLR%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 106 CLR 33</a>
at 44-45, Kitto J referred to the scope and purpose of the Act as the test for
determining whether the statutory provisions conferred
private rights and
whether the statute created correlative rights to have them observed.  In
<b><u>Stovin  v  Wise</u></b>  supra, Lord Hoffman observed that whether a
statutory duty gives rise to a private cause of action is a question of
construction
also involving an examination of the policy of the statute.  The
question of whether Parliament has conferred a private right of
action depends
on the interpretation of the statute:  <b><u>Heyman</u></b>  supra, at 482-483,
per Brennan J at 480-484.  Breach of statutory duty is a cause of action
distinct from the cause of action for
common law negligence.  The former is a
creature of statute; the latter of the common law.  However, the same set of
circumstances
may give rise to either cause of action:  <b><u>Pyrenees Shire
Council  v  Day</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20192%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 192 CLR 330</a> per Brennan CJ at 442.
<P>

683   	Some of the recent authorities dealing with actions for
breach of statutory duty were considered by O'Loughlin J in
<b><u>Cubillo</u></b> supra in the context of a strike out argument where his
Honour noted the competing arguments in relation to the  <b><u>Northern
Territory Ordinance</u></b>.  There O'Loughlin J considered in the
circumstances of the particular strike out application before him, (which was
one involving
a claim that the plaintiffs were allegedly removed from their
families without their consent or that of their mother, and thereafter
detained
in institutions against their will, a totally different case and one removed
from the facts of the present case), that prima
facie the plaintiffs had
private rights of action for breach of statutory duties available to them.  His
Honour held that the allegations
were sufficient to sustain an argument that
their cases rested on a misuse or abuse of statutory power for the
implementation of
an improper purpose (which cannot be said about this case).
With respect I therefore, do not find his Honour's arguments (at 33)
persuasive
or binding upon me in this case.  His Honour distinguished  <b><u>X (Minors)  v
Bedfordshire County Council</u></b> supra.  That said in this case I cannot see
that the distinction has force, or why the views of Lord Browne Wilkinson at
737, 738,
747 and 751 are not applicable.  In  <b><u>X (Minor)'s</u></b>  case
Lord Browne Wilkinson was prepared to assume that the plaintiff was a member of
a class for whose protection the statutory
provisions were enacted.  That said
he could find nothing in those provisions which demonstrated a parliamentary
intention to give
that class a statutory right of action for damages,
particularly where the legislation left so much to be decided by the local
authority.
 In the instant case the Act is one concerned with the establishment
of welfare and protection and advancement of interests of Aborigines
where
difficult decisions have to be made.  In such a context, in my opinion, clear
statutory language would be required to indicate,
a legislative intention to
create a private law duty.  There is no express provision for civil recovery as
found in the statute.
 It does not appear that there is any private cause of
action available for contravention of some statutory requirement:  see
<b><u>Pyrenees Shire Council</u></b>  supra at 342.
<P>

684   	Having regard to the general nature of the statutory
duties relied upon, I find it difficult to see how it can be properly
submitted
that a breach of such duties (either or both) was intended sub-silento by
Parliament to give rise to a private claim for
damages.  The statutory duties
relied upon are in the nature of public law functions.  To suggest they give
rise to a private law
remedy in damages could in effect involve the court in an
act of judicial legislation and not of legislature construction:
<b><u>Newcastle City Council  v  GIO General Limited</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2072%20ALJR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 72 ALJR 97</a>
per McHugh J at 110.  For this further reason I do not consider that such an
action for breach of statutory duty is available.
<P>

685   	As to the situation in New Zealand, in  <b><u>E  v
K</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20NZLR%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 NZLR 239</a> at 245 it was held that s 4 of the  <b><u>Children
and Young <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1974120/" class="autolink_findacts">Persons Act 1974</a></u></b>  (requiring that any person exercising any
power conferred by the Act should treat the interests of the child as the first
and paramount
consideration) did not contain legislative language normally used
to impose a statutory duty but was a principle for the exercise
of a statutory
discretion.  In this case the defendants also submit that the Further Amended
Statement of Claim does not allege which
statutory power, if any, the Board was
exercising when the alleged breaches of statutory duty occurred.  With respect
I do not regard
this point as being decisive.  The court in  <b><u>E  v
K</u></b>  also held (at 149) that the paramount principle in s 4 of the Act
did not disclose a statutory duty to the public: see also  <b><u>Coe  v
Gordon</u></b>  supra, per Lee J at 426.  In one sense, the present legislation
may be thought to be somewhat of the type of legislation considered
in
<b><u>O'Rourke  v  Camden London Borough Council</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] UKHL 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 188</a>, which
Lord Hoffman, in his reasons, described as involving a scheme of social welfare
intending to confer benefits at public expense
on the ground of public
policy.
<P>

686   	I now turn to the more recent New Zealand Court of Appeal
decision in  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  supra.  In that case, the cause of action
for breach of statutory duty was struck out.
<P>

687   	The court considered the operation of the  <b><u>Adoption
Act 1955</u></b>  and whether, inter alia, the Crown could be liable in tort or
equity for the "errors" of those social workers exercising statutory
powers
under that Act and another Act.  The question of statutory cause of action was
not pressed on appeal but, nevertheless, in
the Court of Appeal, there appears
reasoning which could suggest that even in respect of the breach of statutory
cause of action,
had it been the subject of an appeal it would not have
succeeded.  As the majority observed (at 275) it would be inconsistent with
the
policy and scheme of the Act to allow individual claims in respect of
particular acts or omissions in the carrying out statutory
functions.  They
said that statutory powers must be exercised in accordance with the policy and
purpose of the legislation and (at
276) that there was nothing in the
legislation to indicate a parliamentary purpose to create an actionable
obligation.  I would therefore,
not regard the New Zealand case of
<b><u>Prince</u></b>  as supporting the plaintiff's reliance upon a breach of
statutory duty, in fact it is to the contrary.
<P>

688   	I turn now to the English decisions.  I have already
referred to the decision of Lord Browne Wilkinson in the
<b><u>Bedfordshire</u></b>  case.  That decision was considered by the House of
Lords in  <b><u>O'Rourke  v  Camden London Borough Council</u></b>  supra.
<b><u>O'Rourke</u></b>  concerned the question of whether there was available a
private cause of action for damages to a plaintiff who claimed to be homeless
with a priority need, on the basis that the housing authority failed to provide
accommodation pending inquiries.  It too involved
welfare legislation.
<P>

689   	In  <b><u>O'Rourke</u></b>,  Lord Hoffman in delivering
the judgment of the House of Lords also accepted the approach of Lord Browne
Wilkinson in  <b><u>Bedfordshire</u></b>  in terms of the test of whether there
was a legislative intention to a private right of action.  His Lordship (at
193) in referring
to a number of indicators noted that the legislation
contained a scheme of social welfare intending to confer benefits at public
expense on grounds of public policy.  Public money was spent not simply as a
matter between a private claimant and the housing authority
or as a private
benefit, but also upon grounds of general public policy and interest.  Next, he
concluded that the existence of the
duty to provide accommodation depended on a
good deal of judgment on the part of the housing authority.  His Lordship (at
196) examined
the issue of "legislative intention" and the various
considerations, in determining whether or not a statute was intended to create
a duty in private law sounding in damages.  The action for breach of statutory
duty was dismissed.  The decision in  <b><u>O'Rourke</u></b>  does not assist
the plaintiff.
<P>

690   	In the more recent decision  <b><u>Barrett  v  Enfield
London Borough Council</u></b>  supra, the House of Lords did not suggest that
statutory duties to exercise quasi parental care in the upbringing of children
gave
rise to a statutory cause of action for damages if breached.  Indeed, in
the House of Lords it was conceded they did not, this concession
accepted as
having been correctly made.  The approach in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  is also
supportive of the conclusion that the breach or breaches of statutory duty
which the plaintiff complains give rise to no
cause of action in private
law.
<P>

691   	In the present case the defendants have also submitted
that if it is a matter of inference as to whether or not the statute
gives rise
to a cause of action in tort, then the same policy that denies a duty in tort
compels a denial of the relevant "inference"
of legislative intention when
construing the statute.  I reject this submission in the terms stated.
<P>

692   	In  <b><u>X (Minors)'s</u></b> case,  Lord Browne
Wilkinson observed (at 198) that it is impossible to impose a common law duty
of care which is inconsistent with
or fetters a statutory duty.  However, there
is no reason to deny a common law duty of care which would otherwise exist just
because
there is a statutory scheme addressing the same problem: see
<b><u>Heyman</u></b>.  The mere fact that the defendants' relationship with the
plaintiff in the instant case arose from the exercise of a statutory power
does
not prevent the plaintiff from claiming that the AWB owed her a common law duty
of care.  Indeed, the statutory enablement may
itself facilitate the existence
of a common law duty.
<P>

693   	Finally, for reasons given and to be given, there was
further or alternatively no breach of any alleged statutory duty if
there be
one
<P>

694   	The cause of action for breach of statutory duty should
be rejected.
<P>

<b><u>Fiduciary Duty:</u></b>
<P>

695   	The action for breach of fiduciary duty is a novel
one.
<P>

696   	The parties accept that it is appropriate for me to find
that from the time of the plaintiff's birth (in 1942) until the
time the
plaintiff left Lutanda (in 1947), the plaintiff's legal guardian was at all
times her mother.  I have found that the plaintiff
was the illegitimate
daughter of a relationship between her Aboriginal mother and an Irish father or
father of Irish descent.  They
were unmarried at the time the plaintiff became
pregnant and never did marry.  I have accepted as correct the parentage history
given
by the plaintiff's mother to her daughter and set forth in the
plaintiff's affidavit.  Its accuracy was not challenged or brought
into
question.
<P>

697   	Next, I have accepted that the plaintiff was admitted to
the control of the AWB pursuant to s 7(2) of the Act on the application
of the
mother thereby becoming a ward within the meaning of the Act.  I again mention
that the plaintiff could also have become a
ward (not by order of the Equity
Court) but by a committal order made by a Children's Court pursuant to s 13A of
the Act in circumstances
involving a "neglected" or "uncontrollable" child.  In
terms of considering the issue, the s 13A committal procedure method of
becoming
a ward ought not to be overlooked.  In the instant case, it is perhaps
difficult to imagine that if the plaintiff's mother had not
had her application
under s 7(2) accepted, that the "child" would not have probably become the
subject of an order under s 13A. 
It would not have been left "neglected".
However, it is not necessary to decide this.  The point is that if there be an
issue of
fiduciary relationship and fiduciary duty there is no obvious reason
why such could arise under s 7(2) but not under s 13A of the
Act, or why the
position in terms of creating a statutory "ward" would be different to that
under s 13A.  Such a comparison perhaps
also identifies some of the possible
problems or difficulties arising from the creation of an alleged fiduciary
relationship and
associate fiduciary duty of the type asserted in the instant
case.  It is also to be remembered that under s 13A, a Children's Court
may not
merely commit a child to the control of the AWB to be dealt with as a ward, but
may specifically commit a child to a home
under s 11 of the Act, and also for a
fixed period of time:  see  s 13A of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection
Act</u></b>  and s 82 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.
<P>

698   	In  <b><u>Tito  v  Waddell (No 2)</u></b>  supra, it was
held that none of the statutory duties under consideration in that case was
sufficient to impose any enforceable statutory
obligation of a fiduciary
nature.  Megarry VC observed (at 228, 230, 239) that, in relation to one such
duty, under discussion, that
it operated in the sphere of government, and not
by way of imposing any fiduciary obligation and that before a fiduciary
obligation
(apparently drawing a distinction between fiduciary relationship and
the obligations arising therefrom) could arise from a statutory
duty, there
must be something to show that the imposition of such an obligation was a
matter of intention or implication: ("the argument
must thus require that some
fiduciary obligation should be imposed upon the statutory obligation").
<P>

699   	As I have observed earlier, I am not bound by the views
of Kirby P or Powell JA as expressed in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>, a case
decided at the same time as the Court of Appeal's decision in  <b><u>Breen  v
Williams</u></b>  supra.  In that latter decision Kirby P was in dissent.  The
majority decision in  <b><u>Breen</u></b>  was upheld on various grounds by the
High Court in  <b><u>Breen  v  Williams</u></b>  supra, a case of some
considerable importance to which I will again return.
<P>

700   	It is appropriate for me to refer briefly to the
different approaches of Kirby P and Powell JA in  <b><u>Williams [No
1]</u></b>.  Kirby P considered that the action for breach of fiduciary duty
was not hopeless, rather that it was arguable, with the decision
being left for
determination by the trial judge.  On the materials before him (and those
materials have now changed considerably
as have the plaintiff's pleadings) and
in the context an extension of time application, his Honour considered that the
Board was
in "<u>the nature of a statutory guardian</u> of Ms Williams, and
that the relationship of guardian and ward was one of the established fiduciary
categories".  To repeat, his
Honour was of the view that the Board "was
arguably obliged to act in her interest and in a way that truly provided in a
manner apt
for a fiduciary, for her "custody, maintenance and education" (s
7(1)(c)).  Pausing at this point with respect, it is appropriate
to again
repeat that s 7(1)(c) of the Act had been amended in 1940 with the deletion of
the words "and educate".  His Honour's decision
is thus to be seen as having a
statutory background different to that stated and relied upon before me.  The
duty is in terms of
"custody and maintenance".  His Honour, also in reliance
upon Canadian decisions considered it was "distinctly arguable that a person
who suffers as a result of want of proper care on the part of a fiduciary may
recover equitable compensation for losses occasioned
by want of care".
<P>

701   	In  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  (where no fiduciary duty or
the statutory duties were relied upon) the relevant statutory provisions were
described by Lord Browne
Wilkinson (at 81) in terms of being "statutory duties
to exercise <b><u>quasi parental care</u></b> in and about the upbringing of
the plaintiff" [my emphasis].  There was no suggestion there was or could be a
fiduciary duty, or
even a fiduciary relationship.  Nor do I understand his
Lordship to suggest that "quasi parental care" obligation of itself, provides
a
basis for finding a fiduciary relationship or fiduciary duty.
<P>

702   	In  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  Powell JA approached
the matter in terms of an assumption that a person or body, who, or which
adopts the role of a parent, or guardian,
in relation to an infant, could be
regarded as being in a fiduciary relationship.  It is important to understand
that his Honour
did so only as an assumption, the correctness of which is in
actual issue in the instant case.  His Honour having made the assumption
rather
addressed the matter in terms of what duties "by reason of that relationship"
would be imposed.  His Honour said (at 519):
<P>

"...  I am unable to see the slightest reason, or justification, for seeking
further to extend the range of fiduciary duties cast
upon a person, or body,
adopting the role of a parent, or guardian, so as to constitute as breaches of
fiduciary duty - conduct undertaken
in furtherance of a statutory duty, and in
the belief - join up what were then, even if they are not now, the accepted
standards
of the time - that they were in the best interests of, and for the
furtherance of the welfare of, the person fulfilling the role
of the child in
the relevant relationship".
<P>

703   	With respect there is much force in the views of Powell
JA, albeit that I am not bound by them.  In many ways they perhaps
reflect in
part my own ultimate independent views.  It seems to me, that even assuming a
fiduciary relationship is established, there
is no fiduciary duty of the kind
urged by the plaintiff, or that further or alternatively, that no action for
breach of fiduciary
is available in any event.  Indeed, in light of my finding
and reasons, no breach of such duty has in the event been established
<P>

704   	In Canada there has been a greater willingness to find
fiduciary relationships duties and obligations than in Australia and
in New
Zealand, with the reluctance to extend the doctrine even more marked in
England:  see also  <b><u>Breen</u></b>  supra in the Court of Appeal per
Mahoney JA at 566.  In  <b><u>Norberg  v  Wynrib</u></b>  (1992) 92 DLR (4th)
449 at 499 McLachlin J considered that fiduciary principles were capable of
protecting not only narrow legal
and economic interests but could also serve to
defend fundamental human and personal interests (a view not supported by
English Australian
authority).  In  <b><u>M (K)  v  M (H)</u></b>   <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992scr3-6/1992scr3-6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 96
DLR (4th) 289</a>, a case involving an intentional tort of assault and battery by a
father against his daughter, and not a breach of a common law duty
of care as
in negligence) there was also a claim of breach of fiduciary duty.  The Court
accepted that there was a fiduciary relationship
and was prepared to recognise
equitable protection of interests of a wider than economic type by expanding
them in effect, to include
the fiduciary duty of loyalty in a family.  In
<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  Kirby P, in reliance upon Canadian authority,
sought to suggest that equitable duties (the content of which included a
responsibility
to take proper care in performing a task) could be utilised to
protect non-economic interests.  With respect to the views of Kirby
P (as he
then was), I do not consider having regard to authority, that even if there be
a fiduciary relationship between the AWB
and the plaintiff, in respect of all
or some parts of the AWB's activities, that any action lies for breach of the
duty of the kind
urged in the instant case.  Indeed, a person may be in a
fiduciary relationship position of some parts, but not other parts.  If
a
fiduciary relationship has been established it is still necessary to have
regard to the particular transaction impugned.  Thus
in each case it is
appropriate to examine all of the facts and circumstances to see whether a
fiduciary relationship exists, and
if so, whether it applies to the particular
transaction in question:  <b><u>Breen's</u></b>  case supra per Kirby P at 544.
In  <b><u>Re Coomber, Coomber  v  Coomber</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%201%20Ch%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 1 Ch 723</a> Fletcher
Moulton LJ at 728-729 warned against "assuming that every kind of fiduciary
relationship justifies any interference" and
that in "the nature of the
fiduciary relation must be such that it justifies the interference".
<P>

705   	Even if a case falls within an established category of
fiduciary relationship and a party stands in a fiduciary relationship
to
another, nevertheless there still remains the need to ascertain the particular
obligation or obligations owed by one party to
the other in order to further
consider what acts or omissions amount to a failure to discharge those
obligations.
<P>

706   	I have found the views of Professor R Austin (as his
Honour then was) in  <b>"Moulding the Contents of Fiduciary Duties"</b> -
Oakley, Trends in Contemporary Trust Law (1996) of assistance.  Professor
Austin (at 154) in discussing the matter of the content
of fiduciary duties,
quoted from a decision of Frankfurter J in  <b><u>SEC  v  Chenery
Corporation</u></b>  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1943/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1943] USSC 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%20318%20US%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 318 US 80</a>, 85-86 that to say that a person is a
fiduciary "only begins the analysis".  He also referred (at 155) to the
decision of the High
Court in  <b><u>Warman International Ltd  v  Dwyer</u></b>
(1995) 182 CLR 554 as exemplifying a trend in case law in which the fiduciary
concept was coming to designate "specified duties rather
than an entire
relationship":  see also  <b><u>Paramasivam  v  Flynn</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1711.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1711</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20160%20ALR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 160 ALR
203</a> at 218.  Such an approach thus involves a consideration of whether a
fiduciary concept embraces a specific duty of the type urged
in the instant
case.  In my view it does not.
<P>

707   	The authorities suggest that actual fiduciary duties
imposed by equity upon a fiduciary are those which in the particular
circumstances are called for so to prevent an abuse of the relationship:
<b><u>Re Coomber</u></b>  supra: as applied in  <b><u>Warman Industries</u></b>
supra and by Powell JA in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>.  The scope of the
fiduciary duty must be moulded according to the nature of the relationship and
the facts of the case:  <b><u>Hospital Products Ltd  v  United States Surgical
Corporation</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a> per Mason J at 102.  Similarly in
<b><u>Mabo  v  Queensland (No 2)</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 1</a> Toohey J (at 204)
considered that the content of a fiduciary obligation would be "tailored by the
circumstances of the specific relationship".
<P>

708   	For the purpose of determining the relationship between
the parties one must also turn to the statutory provisions under
the Act.
<P>

709   	The situation is quite unlike that under s 9(1) of the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act 1939</u></b>  passed shortly before the 1940 amendments
to the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>.  The draftsman of the 1940 Act
would have been aware of its provisions.  By way of contrast, under s 4 of the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  a ward included a child admitted to the
control of the State or committed to an institution.  However, significantly
under s 9(1)
and s 10, the Minister became the statutory guardian of the ward
to the exclusion of the parent or guardian of the child and subject
to the
provisions of the Act the Minister had the care of all wards, except where
inter alia they were boarded out or placed as adopted
boarders of foster
parents: see  <b><u>Green &amp; Anor  v  Minister for Child Welfare</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%201%20NSWLR%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 1 NSWLR 314</a>;  <b><u>Minister for the Interior  v  Neyens</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 71</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20113%20CLR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964)
113 CLR 411</a>;  <b><u>Quinn  v  Minister for Youth and Community Services</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 716</a> at 720.  This is not the situation under the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>.
<P>

710   	There were no counterparts to s 9 and s 10 introduced
into the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  in 1940, nor subsequently.
A definition of "ward" was introduced for the purposes of the Act, but it did
not include the concept
of "guardian".  There was no provision such as s 9
which made the Board a guardian.  Section 11B(2) in referring to the need for
approval of a guardian to cancel an indenture, itself suggests that it was
someone other than the AWB that was the guardian, and
provides support for the
view that control, under s 7(2) and/or custody and maintenance of children
under s 7(1)(c), did not create
an actual ward/guardian relationship under the
Act.  In  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  Kirby P (at 5) did not suggest it did,
at least in terms.  In  <b><u>Youngman  v  Lawson</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 439</a>,
Street CJ (at 445) referred to guardianship as a relationship which as long as
it subsists is recognised as conferring rights on
the guardian in respect of
custody and upbringing (educational as well as in respect of the religion of
the child).  The authorities
since the 17th Century reveal that Courts of
Equity have consistently expressed views that guardians have duties including
ordinarily,
a duty to educate:  <b><u>Duke of Beaufort  v  Berty</u></b>
<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1721/306.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1721] EngR 306</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1721%5d%2024%20ER%20579" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1721] 24 ER 579</a> at 580.  As I have said in 1940 the Act deliberately removed
from s 7(1)(c) of the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  the duty to
educate.  There was no such duty in respect of the plaintiff.  Thus, it might
be fairly that absent adopting comparable
provisions to ss 9 and 10 of the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>,  the  <b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>
neither makes the AWB a guardian of a ward, or one in the nature of a statutory
guardian and that it was not intended by Parliament
by its 1940 amendments to
the Act to create a ward/guardian relationship with the Board.  Indeed, further
or alternatively, it might
be fairly argued that in the context of the
<b><u>Aborigines Protection Act</u></b>  control does not mean, or equate, with
guardianship as such.
<P>

711   	As to the nature of the relationship between a ward and
the AWB under the Act, the decision of the Federal Court in the case
of
<b><u>Cubillo</u></b>  does not assist.  That Federal Court decision not to
strike out was in the context of very wide powers including a provision that
the Director under the 1918 Ordinance, was under s 7, a legal guardian of every
Aboriginal.  Whilst it is not necessary for me to
decide in any event I would
not follow  <b><u>Cubillo</u></b>  to the extent that it even suggests that a
fiduciary relationship might give rise to a fiduciary duty of the kind urged in
the instant
case:  see  <b><u>Breen  v  Williams</u></b>  in the High Court: cf
<b><u>Paramasivam</u></b>.  Nor does the trial judge's decision in
<b><u>Bennett  v  The Minister for Community Welfare</u></b>  (1988) Aust Torts
Reports (80-210) assist.  In that case s 10 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act
(WA)</u></b>,  by its very terms, made the Director of the Department of
Community Welfare the "guardian and to have the care, management and
control of
the persons and property of wards" perhaps reflecting a statutory provision
closer in type to the statutory provisions
of ss 9 and 10 of the  <b><u>Child
Welfare Act  (NSW)</u></b>.
<P>

712   	As I earlier said, the plaintiff in this case became a
ward under s 7(2) of the Act.  The mother made application to admit
the
plaintiff to the AWB's control.  The Board "voluntarily" made an administrative
decision to admit the child to its control. 
On admission to the Board's
control, the child then became a ward within the meaning of the Act.  Under s
13A the situation would
not be one of a creation of a statutory guardian
situation by the Act but by a committal by a Children's Court order, not even
one
by the Equity Court.  If a guardianship situation is created then it is one
by virtue of court committal imposed upon the Board and
not a guardian or a
statutory guardianship in fact of the kind to be found in s 9 of the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.  It might be thought arguable that a
Children's Court committal can no more place the AWB in the position of being a
"guardian",
or in the "nature of a guardian", or create a fiduciary
relationship with obligations, any more than it can be put in such a position
by the operation of the provisions of s 7(2) of the Act.
<P>

713   	In  <b><u>Ex parte Vorhauer; Re Steep</u></b>  supra
(applied in  <b><u>Green</u></b>  supra) it was held that where the Minister
discharged himself under s 23 (a provision similar in terms to s 11D(1) of the
<b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b><u>)</u>  from his statutory guardianship, then
the person entitled to the custody of the child is the mother.  In
<b><u>Youngman  v  Lawson</u></b>  supra, a case involving (as is the instant
case) an illegitimate child, Street CJ (at 443) considered that in the case of
an illegitimate
child, all of the rights that are customarily incidents of
legal guardianship in the case of a legitimate child adhere to the mother,
although equity might give custody to the father of an illegitimate child.  In
<b><u>AMS  v  AIF</u></b>  (1999) 73 ALJR 927 the High Court, when discussing
the custody of ex-nuptial children, referred to Chancery doctrine eventually
prevailing under the general law of England, said that the desire of the mother
of an illegitimate child as to its custody was primarily
to be considered, if
to do so would not be detrimental to the interests of the child.  However, the
authorities suggest that legal
custody is in the mother, a position as I have
earlier said apparently accepted by the parties in the instant case as being
one that
was appropriate for me to adopt.
<P>

714   	Under the present  <b><u>Aborigines Protection
Act</u></b>  it may well be that once a child became a ward, not only did the
mother remain the legal guardian, but her situation as a guardian
was at all
times subject to the Act so that she could not do anything or exercise parent
or guardian rights inconsistent with the
provisions of the Act: see also s
11B(2).
<P>

715   	The word "custody" used in s 7(1)(c) of the Act is
perhaps, used in the broad sense of "control ..... preservation and care
of a
child's person physically, mentally or morally": see  <b><u>Wedd  v
Wedd</u></b>  supra;  <b><u>Fountain  v  Alexander</u></b>  supra.
<P>

716   	Even postulating that a guardian/ward relationship arises
in any instant case, it is by no means clear that in any event
the relationship
of guardian and ward is "one of the established fiduciary categories".  In
<b><u>Hospital Products Ltd  v  United States Surgical Corporation</u></b>
supra, Gibbs CJ (at 68) discussed the established categories of fiduciaries and
concluded that whilst he did not include the category
of guardian and ward
relationships the categories were not closed.  In the same case Mason J (at
96-97) listed the traditional or
accepted categories of fiduciary relationship,
but did not include in that list the relationships of parent and child, or of
guardian
and ward.  In  <b><u>Maguire  v  Makaronis</u></b>  supra, the views
of Gibbs CJ in relation to the established categories of fiduciary relationship
was cited with approval by the
whole Court.  In that case the Court considered
(at 463) that it was not necessary to specify criteria by which it might be
determined
whether parties "not being within the accepted categories referred
to by Gibbs CJ stand in a fiduciary relationship" because the
solicitor in the
case was classically a "fiduciary to the client and owed certain duties in each
case".  Indeed, as was made clear
(at 474) the case was one in which the
trustee notion of disloyalty on the part of non-trustee, fiduciaries was
regarded as an important
consideration in the case of "delinquent fiduciaries
such as solicitors".  Further  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  was a case involving a
case of economic interests in contradistinction to the instant case.
<P>

717   	It is not strictly necessary for me to determine whether
or not under the provisions of the Act the plaintiff and the AWB
were in a
relationship of guardian and ward, or whether the AWB was in the nature of a
statutory guardian of the plaintiff  (<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  at 511) or
even whether the relationship of guardian and ward is one within the accepted
categories.  I have some reservations in
respect of each of these matters but
do not need to finally determine or resolve them.  The present case is not one
where there is
a need to specify criteria by which it may be determined whether
the parties, not being within the accepted categories referred to
by Gibbs CJ
stand in a fiduciary relationship:  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  at 463.
<P>

718   	Since the judgment has been reserved, I have had drawn to
my attention by counsel the recent decision of the Court of Appeal
in
<b><u>Brunninghauser  v  Glavanic</u></b>  (NSWCA, 23 June 1999, unreported).
The plaintiff relies upon a passage (at p 14) to support her argument that the
relationship of
"guardian and ward has always been one which gives rise to
fiduciary duties".
<P>

719   	Before turning to the relative passage several things may
be said about  <b><u>Brunninghauser</u></b>.  That case concerned the question
as to whether a sole effective director owed a fiduciary duty to the other
shareholder in the
purchase of shares, and whether he breached this duty by his
non-disclosure of the negotiations of the companies' assets before the
purchase
of the respondent's shares.  It was a case concerning fiduciary duty in
relation to once again economic interests, and not
interests of the type
involved in the present case, nor involving a fiduciary duty of care of the
type here asserted.  In the circumstances
of  <b><u>Brunninghauser</u></b>
there was a "special vulnerability" of the other shareholder, as well as
presence of traditional matters relevant to the existence
of a fiduciary duty
and its content, that is, of a relationship of trust, confidence and of the
need to avoid conflict between duty
and interest including interest in the
particular economic interest transaction.  The case is thus totally different
to the instant
case.  In fact, even if in the present case I were to find a
fiduciary relationship,  <b><u>Brunninghauser</u></b>  would not help the
plaintiff in terms of establishing a fiduciary duty of the scope or extent
presently urged.
<P>

720   	As to the existence of a fiduciary relationship, the
Court said (at 14):
<P>

"Some of the traditional fiduciary relationships such as partners, principal
and agent, solicitor and client and priest and penitent
are created by the more
or less free choice of the parties ....  Other relationships such as guardian
and ward, parent and child
and trustee and beneficiary arise by operation of
law or from acts of others".
<P>

721   	With respect, in that case it was not necessary to decide
whether the relationship of guardian and ward, or parent and child
is a
fiduciary relationship, or one in all or any particular circumstances.
<P>

722   	As I have said, in  <b><u>Hospital Products Limited  v
United States Surgical Corporation</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a>, Gibbs CJ (at 68)
did not include guardian and ward or parent and child within his classes of
fiduciary relationship, nor did Mason
J do so (at 96) in his analysis of
accepted fiduciary relationships.  In  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  the High Court
(at 463) applied the views of Gibbs CJ at 463 as to the categories or classes.
Further or alternatively, even if
the situation be stated as in the Court of
Appeal, the establishment of a fiduciary relationship is in any event but the
first step
in the exercise  -  its scope and content still need to be examined.
That the relationship of guardian and ward may in some cases
give rise to
duties typically characterised as a fiduciary, appears to have been recognised
in  <b><u>Flynn</u></b>  at 218: see also the assumption by Powell JA in
<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>.  Nevertheless, that said the fiduciary concept
is still only ever concerned with specific duties rather than an entire
relationship.
<P>

723   	In my view  <b><u>Brunninghauser</u></b>  does not of
itself determine or establish the existence of a fiduciary or its scope or
content in such a case as the present.  The
parties have referred to further
additional authorities since I reserved including the decision of the House of
Lords on 17 June
1999 in  <b><u>Barrett  v  Enfield London Borough
Council</u></b>  supra.  In that case no cause of action for fiduciary duty for
breach was pleaded, raised or alleged.  Apart from the fact that
the plaintiff
pleaded a cause of action for breach of statutory duty (which, it was accepted,
did not exist) there is nothing in
their Lordships' reasons to even hint at or
suggest that in the circumstances a fiduciary relationship might have existed
between
the local authority and the child in care, or that it was, further or
alternatively open to find a fiduciary duty of the type here
asserted, let
alone that the scope of such a content of a fiduciary duty would support an
action of the present type for breach.
 Nor was it suggested that control or
statutory provisions, whilst such might help to determine the existence of a
duty of care,
would or could give rise to a fiduciary relationship.  True these
matters were not at issue, but that is because in my view English
law (like
Australian law) does not in circumstances such as the present suggest (even
assuming there is a fiduciary relationship)
that there is a fiduciary duty of
the type here asserted with further or alternatively, an action lying for
breach of it.
<P>

724   	All this said, I am prepared to assume (without finally
deciding) as did Powell JA in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  (at 19), that the
relationship between a person or body who or which adopts the role of a parent
or guardian in relation to an infant
may be regarded as a fiduciary
relationship: see also  <b><u>Flynn</u></b>  (at 218) and
<b><u>Brunninghauser</u></b>  (at 14)  In doing so, I leave extant the question
of the scope of such a duty in the instant case to which I now turn.
<P>

725   	In  <b><u>Paramasivam  v  Flynn</u></b>  supra the Full
Federal Court said (at 218):
<P>

"A relationship such as that alleged, of guardian and ward, may give rise to
duties typically characterised as fiduciary - not to
allow duty and interest to
conflict and not to make an unauthorised profit within the scope of the
relationship (although one might
need to know more about the relationship than
presently appears in order to ascertain the ambit of any such duties arising in
this
case).  Similarly, it is likely to be a relationship giving rise to a
presumption of undue influence affecting transactions, particularly
but not
exclusively voluntary transactions, entered into by the ward and conferring
benefits on the guardian.  Equally, of course,
breach of a fiduciary duty, and
breaches of other equitable obligations, are not remediable only by injunction
or by a proprietary
or restitutionary remedy: a plaintiff who has suffered loss
resulting from breach of such a duty is entitled to compensation for
that loss.
There is no room for doubt about any of those propositions, and it is
unnecessary to cite authority for them.  Nevertheless,
the judge was right in
regarding the appellant's claim as, under Australian law, novel.  That is so
because of two of its aspects:
 the nature of the alleged breach and the kinds
of loss or injury which the appellant claims to have suffered and for which he
seeks
equitable compensation".
<P>

726   	In  <b><u>Bristol and West Building Society  v
Mothew</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/533.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] EWCA Civ 533</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%202%20WLR%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 2 WLR 436</a> at 439 Millett LJ referred to a distinguishing
obligation of a fiduciary being the obligation of loyalty.  His Lordship
observed
that a fiduciary must act in good faith; they must not make a profit
out of their position; they must not place themselves in a position
where their
duty and interest may conflict.  A fiduciary, his Lordship said, may not act
for their own benefit or the benefit of
a third party without the informed
consent of their principal.  These matters he consider indicated (albeit not
exhaustively) the
general nature of fiduciary obligations.
<P>

727   	I have already stated that the establishment of the
fiduciary relationship is but the beginning of the problem since the
scope and
content of the fiduciary duties arising from that relationship will vary and be
tailored by the nature of the relationship,
the circumstances of the specific
relationship from which it arises and the circumstances of the case.  I have
already stated at
common law generally, that as regards a parent and child the
matter of upbringing is perceived to be a moral duty and not a legal
duty:
<b><u>Hahn  v  Conley</u></b>  supra.
<P>

728   	In the instant case Mr Hutley did not suggest according
to my understanding, that were I to find a fiduciary relationship
between the
plaintiff and the AWB (which I have assumed without finally deciding) that the
content or scope of duties to be found
in that relationship were those to be
found in the case of an "express" trust case as outlined in  <b><u>Re
Dawson</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%202%20NSWLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 2 NSWLR 211</a> or in a traditional trustee type fiduciary
case.  Further or alternatively, I do not see why any fiduciary relationship
should in
any event, give rise to greater duties than those involving
protecting economic interests.  In a case such as the present if there
is a
duty of care it should exist at common law.  Further, if the common law does
not impose a duty of care for a variety of reasons,
one or more, it is
difficult to see why equity should intervene or that there is a necessity to do
so in the circumstances.
<P>

729   	In my opinion assuming that there is a fiduciary
relationship, the decision of the High Court in  <b><u>Breen's</u></b>  case
supports a number of propositions.  First, that it is an error to regard
fiduciary duties as attaching to every aspect of a
fiduciary's conduct and that
every duty owed by a fiduciary is fiduciary in nature.  Next, (as also appears
from  <b><u>Paramasivam</u></b>  supra) a fiduciary relationship is not really
concerned with negligence or the assertion of a fiduciary duty of the type here
involved
and asserted.  On this basis in my view, the Canadian authorities
dealing with fiduciary duties are not to be followed in Australia
contrary to
what was perhaps suggested by Kirby P in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>.
<P>

730   	In  <b><u>Breen</u></b>  supra, the High Court held that
though a doctor might commonly owe fiduciary duties to a patient, those duties
did not include the
type of duty in effect asserted in the instant case, namely
an action for equitable compensation for personal injury resulting from
an
alleged breach of fiduciary duty for "want of proper care on the part of a
fiduciary"  (<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  at 511).
<P>

731   	In the course of their judgments in  <b><u>Breen</u></b>,
members of the High Court made clear their disagreement with several aspects of
Canadian approaches to the development of the law
of fiduciaries:  see Brennan
CJ (at 83);  Dawson and Toohey JJ (at 110-113) and Gummow J (at 132).  Nor is
anything to be found in
 <b><u>Breen</u></b>  to support the proposition that
fiduciary principles may be invoked to protect other than economic interests.
There was no suggestion
that a fiduciary duty would or should protect personal
interests of the type postulated in the instant case, as has been perhaps
suggested in the Canadian cases.  For these further reasons, in my view the
Canadian cases have no application in the present case.
<P>

732   	In  <b><u>Breen</u></b>,  Dawson and Toohey J (at 94)
suggested that the law of negligence and contract governing the duty of a
doctor to a patient left
no room for the imposition of fiduciary obligations.
At 110, Gaudron J and McHugh JJ also spoke of the interrelationship between
common law obligations and the fiduciary principle.  Additionally, there is no
warrant for adopting or applying the obiter views
of McHugh J in  <b><u>Bennett
v  Minister of Community Welfare</u></b>  supra.  That was a case particularly
concerning common law causation.  The plaintiff had pleaded an action for
common law negligence
and not for equitable compensation.  That is how the case
was litigated notwithstanding the reference by the trial judge to a breach
of
fiduciary duty.  Importantly, that case involved damage to an economic interest
of the plaintiff with the claim in negligence
being for the loss of a legal
chose in action.  <b><u>Bennett's</u></b>  case is in my view distinguishable
in these various respects and does not assist in the resolution of the present
problem.
<P>

733   	In the decision of the Full Federal Court in
<b><u>Paramasivam</u></b>  supra (a case concerning alleged sexual assaults of
a ward by a male guardian and breaches of fiduciary duty), the Court applied
<b><u>Breen  v  Williams</u></b>  and declined to follow  <b><u>Williams [No
1]</u></b>  and the Canadian case of  <b><u>M (K) v  M (H)</u></b>  supra.  In
<b><u>Paramasivam</u></b>  the Court (at 218-219) held that in Anglo-Australian
law the interests which the equitable doctrines invoked by the appellant
namely,
fiduciary duties, have hitherto protected are economic interests.  Any
extension of the law to protect other than economic interests
had to be
justified in principle with regard to the particular interests protected by
equitable doctrines.  In my view no such principle
exists to warrant extension
into a case such as the present
<P>

734   	I consider that the law is correctly stated in
<b><u>Paramasivam</u></b>.  However, even if the Equity Law is not viewed in
terms of protecting only economic interests, such does not in any event
necessarily
warrant a finding of fiduciary duty (or breach) in terms of that
which is asserted in the instant case.  In  <b><u>Paramasivam</u></b>  the
conduct was held to be within the purview of tort.  By such a finding the
Court, whilst recognising (at 220) that a fundamental
aspect of a parent's
obligation was to refrain from inflicting personal injuries upon a child,
thought that the conduct complained
of in that case did not warrant the view
that the obligation was a fiduciary one, or that any other equitable
intervention was necessary
or appropriate.  At the same page the Court
recognised that the question arose (as it did in  <b><u>Williams [No
1]</u></b>) because a limitation statute barred proceedings at law but not in
Equity.  Indeed, as was said in  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  supra (at 463), the
courts and legislatures have tended to save from the imposition of arbitrary
time limits complaints of breach
of trust or other fiduciary duty.  Why such an
approach should continue to be the case where the fiduciary duty allegedly
breached
is of a non trustee type and arises from the same circumstances and
particulars relied upon to support a tortious or contractual
liability is by no
means clear.  Indeed, it might be thought to be anomalous, and a way of
unjustifiably circumventing limitation
periods in cases where the relationship
properly gives rise if at all, to contractual or tortious liability.  If I am
wrong in my
decision in this case or laches or delay does not operate to "bar"
any equitable remedy, there remains a case for the legislature
to consider the
matter as I have earlier mentioned.
<P>

735   	Indeed, in my view in the circumstances where similar
facts could possibly give rise to a claim in negligence and for breach
of
fiduciary duty, if there is in the circumstances an action available it should
be according to the common law and not otherwise.
 In my opinion fiduciary
duties should not be found, additional to common law duties, merely for
forensic purposes in order to avoid
or circumvent limitation periods which
would apply to common law actions (on the same facts), or to fill a "gap" where
such common
law actions fail or are not available for good and/or valid
reasons.  Nor in my view should fiduciary duties be imposed to circumvent
the
non-imposition of a common law duty, which is denied, for example, for policy
reasons, or to support a claim for relief where
no breach of any common law
duty of care has been established on the merits.  Indeed, I see no reason why
there should be a concurrent
fiduciary obligation or duty to enable a plaintiff
in a particular case to even avoid or circumvent an obligation to mitigate
damage,
to avoid common law principles of causation, novus actus intervenes or
to circumvent other common law principles.  As to a discussion
of these
matters:  see Mr Justice Gummow (writing extra judicially) in  <b><u>Youdan,
Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts</u></b>  at 75.  Further, at the same page, his
Honour also dealt with equitable matters of delay, laches and acquiescence
which in this
case are further or alternatively, relied upon by the defendant
in respect of the fiduciary duty cause of action to deny equitable
compensation
(but not common law damages) in the event that an action lies in breach of
fiduciary duty.
<P>

736   	The recent decision of the Court of Appeal in
<b><u>O'Halloran  v  R. T. Thomas &amp; Family Pty Ltd</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/596.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 596</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR
262</a> can perhaps be seen as an application of  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  in that
it was appropriate to adopt the equitable approach to "causation" applicable in
the case of a trustee of a traditional trust,
to the case of a company director
improperly dealing with company assets which were in the nature of "economic
interests".
<P>

737   	In  <b><u>O'Halloran</u></b>  the Chief Justice (at 275)
also emphasised that every fiduciary relationship (when found to exist) must
still be carefully analysed
to identify the particular breaches found. In my
view there is nothing to support the existence of a fiduciary duty of the kind
asserted
in the instant case, indeed the reasoning in the authorities would
suggest otherwise.  There is no case in United States law suggesting
a
fiduciary duty of the type here asserted to which I have been referred.
<P>

738   	What I have said about the absence of fiduciary duty of
the kind asserted in the instant case is supported by New Zealand
authority and
English authority.  In  <b><u>Prince  v  Attorney General</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%203%20NZLR%20733" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 3
NZLR 733</a>, an action involving an alleged negligent adoption in which the
grievance essentially asserted was that the plaintiff claimed to
have ended up
with unsatisfactory parents who brought him up badly and damaged his life's
prospects, the trial judge struck out a
cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty.  This striking out of the fiduciary duty cause of action was not
challenged on appeal:
 see  <b><u>Attorney-General  v  Prince &amp;
Gardner</u></b>  supra.  In  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  (at first instance) Anderson
J observed at 746:
<P>

"It would seem that the inclination for plaintiffs to plead negligence on the
part of someone who could recompense life's misfortunes
is now being emulated
by the inclination to allege breach of fiduciary duty".
<P>

739   	The case law in the United Kingdom is against the
existence of any such duty or obligation of the kind asserted.  Indeed,
a
review of the authorities in the United Kingdom shows that no fiduciary duty
case of the present kind or analogous to it has even
been advanced either by
itself, or at the same time as the assertion of common law causes of action
arising upon the same or similar
facts or particulars:  cf  <b><u>Stubbings  v
Webb</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC 498</a> (action in assault by a woman against her
stepfather for sexual abuse);  <b><u>X (Minors)  v  Bedfordshire CC</u></b>
supra (local authority's duty to safeguard and promote welfare of children
including preventing child abuse).  In  <b><u>X (Minors)'s</u></b>  case Lord
Browne Wilkinson (at 739) considered and applied the decision of the House of
Lords in  <b><u>Henderson  v  Merrett Syndicates</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1994/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 145</a>
<P>

740   	In  <b><u>Henderson</u></b>  supra, Lord Browne Wilkinson
recognised that the cogency of a plea alleging a breach of fiduciary duty
depends not only on the existence
of a fiduciary relationship and the nature of
the duties which it imparts but also upon whether the acts complained of amount
to
breach of the fiduciary duties themselves or simply occurred during the
subsistence of a fiduciary relationship.  His Lordship said
(at 205):
<P>

"The liability of a fiduciary for the negligent transaction of his duties is
not a separate head of liability but the paradigm of
the general duty to act
with care imposed by law on those who take it upon themselves to act for or
advise others.  Although the
historical development of the rules of law and
equity have, in the past, caused different labels to be stuck on different
manifestations
of the duty, in truth the duty of care imposed on bailees,
carriers, trustees, directors, agents and others is the same duty: it
arises
from the circumstances in which the defendants were acting, not from their
status or description."
<P>

741   	At the same page his Lordship again re-emphasised that
the phrase "fiduciary duties" was a dangerous one giving rise to "a
mistaken
assumption that all fiduciaries owe the same duties in all circumstances".  His
Lordship considered that the extent and
nature of the fiduciary duties owed in
any particular contract case fell to be determined by reference to any
underlying contractual
relationship between the parties.
<b><u>Henderson</u></b>  supra provides no support for the plaintiff's
assertion of duty of the kind argued for in the instant case.  Nor do I
understand
the passage to support a view that were the common law to deny a
duty of care for one or more valid reasons, equity would be satisfied
in
intervening.  In  <b><u>Bristol and West Building Society  v  Mothew</u></b>
supra (referred to in  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  at 474), Lord Justice Millett
(at 447-449) stated that "not every breach of duty by a fiduciary is a breach
of a fiduciary duty".
 Further, Lord Justice Millett (at 448) considered that
it was not appropriate to apply the expression "fiduciary duty to the
obligation
of a trustee or other fiduciary to use proper skill and care in the
discharge of duties".  He applied the passage from  <b><u>Henderson's</u></b>
case supra, quoted by me, as well as applying the remarks of Ipp J in
<b><u>Permanent Building Society  v  Wheeler</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2014%20ACSR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 14 ACSR 109</a> at
157:
<P>

"It is essential to bear in mind that the existence of a fiduciary relationship
does not mean that every duty owed by a fiduciary
is a fiduciary duty.  In
particular a trustee duty to exercise reasonable care though equitable, is not
specifically a fiduciary
duty".
<P>

742   	It seems to me that if there is no duty of care arising
at common law in circumstances such as involve a parent and child,
then I see
no reason why regard may not be had to that situation in determining whether
there may or should be a fiduciary duty of
care in equity in a situation such
as the present.  The moral duties of conscientious parenthood do not at common
law provide a child
with any cause of action arising from their neglect.  The
liability in tort, if any, on the part of the parent to the child arises
as I
have said, from a particular situation, not from the mere relationship:
<b><u>Hahn  v  Conley</u></b>  supra, per Barwick CJ particularly at 283-284,
287 and 294.  As noted by Professor Fleming in  <b>The Law of Torts</b> (8th ed
1992):
<P>

"There is a consensus that the parents' duty to feed, clothe and maintain and
generally care for their child is not enforceable
in tort, whatever its moral
or other legal (for example criminal) sanctions".
<P>

743   	Where an action (if a good one or made good) is within
the purview of the common law dealing with situations when wrongful
conduct is
to be compensated then there is no obvious advantage (quite the contrary) to be
gained by equity providing a further action
on the same facts even where the
common law may in the result might deny the existence of a duty of care or
liability for breach.
 The plaintiff's claim in the present, (if a good one) is
within the purview of the common law dealing with situations when wrongful
or
intentional conduct is to be compensated if at all.
<P>

744   	Perhaps an issue that I should briefly address is that
arising in consequence of my view that in the circumstances no common
law duty
of care was owed, and further or alternatively, there was no breach of duty.
Putting to one side questions of equity following
the common law, it seems to
me that if there be a finding that for example,  because of policy reasons
there is no common law duty
of care, such reasons ought similarly to operate to
deny the existence of a fiduciary duty of care (assuming there be one) arising
from the same circumstances and facts.  The same considerations ought equally
to deny a duty in equity.  Further, the same considerations
for denying a
breach of a common law duty of care similarly apply to deny a breach of a
fiduciary duty even if there be a duty, which
there is not.
<P>

745   	In the instant case there is no allegation in terms of
good faith, omission, nor is there any loyalty question or issue of
conflict
between duty and interest arising.  Additionally, as I have said there are no
economic interests at stake.  In such circumstances
I further do not see why a
fiduciary duty should be found to convert an unsustainable claim at common law,
based on the same facts,
into a sustainable one in equity.
<P>

746   	For reasons given or further to be given in respect of
the negligence issue (assuming there be a fiduciary duty), in my opinion
there
was no breach of any such duty.  Further or alternatively, there is no
equitable "causation" for the same or similar reasons:
 <b><u>Target Holdings
Ltd  v  Redferns</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 421</a> at 432;  <b><u>O'Halloran</u></b>
supra
<P>

<b>Laches  Prejudice  and  the Acquiescence of the Plaintiff</b>
<P>

747   	I finally turn now to the defendant's submissions in
respect of laches and delay.  It is necessary to consider these matters,
despite the limited regard had to them by the plaintiff, in the event of my
extensive views on fiduciary duty, breach and causation
being wrong, or that I
be incorrect in rejecting the plaintiff's action for breach of fiduciary
duty.
<P>

748   	The principles in respect of the equitable defence of
laches going to whether relief should be granted are discussed in 
<b><u>Orr  v
Ford</u></b>  supra by Deane J at 340-341.  Equity and good conscience also
come into play in considering the matter.  At common law, time does
not begin
to run against an infant until after majority.
<P>

749   	The delay in the instant case has been very inordinately
long.  The alleged wrong occurred before 1960.  Action in respect
of that wrong
was not brought until 1993, although there is evidence of some "preparation" as
early as the late 1980's.
<P>

750   	The court may take into account the length of the delay:
<b><u>Fitzgerald  v  Masters</u></b>  supra.  The delay in respect of this case
is substantial in respect of the claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  The claim
for breach
of fiduciary duty cannot however be met by a defence under the
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></u></b>,  in respect of which there is no suspension of
the running of the limitation period pursuant to the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></u></b>:  see  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b> supra;
<b><u>Makaronis</u></b> supra  (at 463).  There is nothing to prevent in law
the pleading of a fiduciary duty, and its breach, based on the same facts
giving
rise to the common law count.  I have already referred to this anomaly.
If I am wrong in my view that the fiduciary cause of action
is not available in
the present case, there is in the circumstances, a potential for injustice
unless laches, prejudice and delay
can be successfully relied upon to answer or
to defeat the equitable cause of action.  Thus if the plaintiff seeks to use to
his/her
advantage the pleading of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary to
avoid limitation problems, there is no unfairness to the plaintiff
for the
defendant to plead or raise laches, prejudice or delay.  There is no reason,
subject to notions of equity and good conscience,
why lengthy delay or
prejudice should not be a bar to relief.  Some of the remarks of Powell JA in
<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  at 520C-F are further particularly apt, when
considering the "defences" of laches and delay.
<P>

751   	The court may further take into account the prejudice to
the defendant flowing from delay for example, the loss of evidence
or the death
of witnesses:  <b><u>Hourigan  v  Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co
Ltd</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2051%20CLR%20619" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934) 51 CLR 619</a>;  <b><u>Hughes  v  Schofield</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NSWLR%208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1

<P>

752   	Some of the cases dealing with delay in respect of
limitation periods and delay generally are referred to in the unreported
judgment of Studdert J in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>.  To the common law
cases referred to should be added the decision of the High Court in
<b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority  v  Taylor</u></b>  supra per
McHugh J (a case concerning discretion to refuse to extend a limitation period
for a common law cause of action).  His
Honour's observations are on point on
the question of delay generally.  His Honour said (at 551):
<P>

"The discretion to extend time must be exercised in the context of the
rationales for the existence of limitation periods.  For
nearly 400 years, the
policy of the law has been to fix definite time limits (usually six but often
three years) for prosecuting
civil claims.  The enactment of time limitations
has been driven by the general perception that "[w]here there is delay the
whole
quality of justice deteriorates".  (21)  Sometimes the deterioration in
quality is palpable, as in the case where a crucial witness
is dead or an
important document has been destroyed.  But sometimes, perhaps more often than
we realise, the deterioration in quality
is not recognisable even by the
parties.  Prejudice may exist without the parties or anybody else realising
that it exists.  As the
United States Supreme Court pointed out in Barker v
Wingo (22), "what has been forgotten can rarely be shown".  So, it must often
happen that important, perhaps decisive, evidence has disappeared without
anybody now "knowing" that it ever existed.  Similarly,
it must often happen
that time will diminish the significance of a known fact or circumstance
because its relationship to the cause
of action is no longer as apparent as it
was when the cause of action arose.  A verdict may appear well based on the
evidence given
in the proceedings, but, if the tribunal of fact had all the
evidence concerning the matter, an opposite result may have ensued.
 The longer
the delay in commencing proceedings, the more likely it is that the case will
be decided on less evidence than was available
to the parties at the time that
the cause of action arose".
<P>

753   	Applying the approach of McHugh J to the equitable claim
it seems to me that there is substance in the defendants' argument
that
equitable relief, even if available, should be denied.  I see no reason why his
Honour's remarks do not necessarily apply to
consideration cases of laches
raised as a defence to a claim for equitable relief in the circumstances of a
case such as the present.
 The plaintiff, faced with the equitable "defences"
really made no attempt to meet them, save advancing argument that "no relevant
prejudice has been identified and that delay of itself is insufficient to
establish the defence of laches".  In the instant case,
it is common ground
that relevant material documents are missing, there are few records remaining
from Lutanda; school records have
not been produced; these are minimal records
from the Women's Hospital; there are few records from Bomaderry; and incomplete
records
exist from the AWB.  Furthermore, important witnesses are dead or not
available including Mr Murray from Lutanda; Mr Reid who is
dead; Miss Atkinson,
a person to whom it is said there could have been an "attachment" in 1953, and
Dr Lovell who was an Honorary
medical officer for Lutanda and from whom no
records were obtained.  What is also known is that the plaintiff's mother
(albeit in
ill health) was alive in 1989.  The plaintiff had met her in 1973,
lived with her for part of the time and obtained information for
the purposes
of her case from her.  Indeed, as to the merits of the case I have had to draw
certain inferences from disputed facts
as to the circumstances of the
plaintiff's birth in 1942, how the plaintiff came to become a ward, and as to
the circumstances surrounding
the plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda in 1947.  No
direct evidence from her was tendered in the trial.  In saying this I am
dealing
with the matter of delay.  I am not finding nor am I asked to draw
<b><u>Jones  v  Dunkel</u></b>  type inferences.
<P>

754   	There is well established authority that a plaintiff's
delay may also be operative as laches where evidence has been lost
which would
be important to the defendants' case:  see  <b><u>Hourigan</u></b>  supra.
Delay may be operative as laches where for some reason "other than delay" the
defendants' ability to resist the plaintiff's
claim has become prejudiced:
<b><u>Neylon  v  Dickens</u></b>  <a href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZCA/1987/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] NZCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20NZLR%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1 NZLR 402</a> at 408-409.  A claim for
breach of fiduciary duty is subject to the equitable doctrine of laches.  A
plaintiff's claim to equitable
compensation for breach of fiduciary duty may
also be barred by the acquiescence of the plaintiff:  <b><u>Nocton  v  Lord
Ashburton</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281914%29%20AC%20932" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1914) AC 932</a> at 958.
<P>

755   	Had it been necessary to decide, I would have found
considerable merit in the defendants' submissions that equitable relief
should
have been denied assuming a fiduciary duty and breach had been established.
<P>

756   	I reject the plaintiff's case based upon the claim of a
fiduciary duty and breach thereof.  I reject it on the ground of
causation as
well.
<P>

<b><u>Negligence:</u></b>
<P>

757   	Negligence at common law is still a fault based system.
For reasons given, to be further given and on the facts as I have
found them to
be, no negligence would have been established even assuming a duty of care had
been proved.  It is appropriate to repeat,
that the events that I am being
asked to judge and evaluate commenced in 1942 and finished in 1960.  Thus in
1999 I am asked to judge
that which took place 39 to 57 years ago (over a half
a century)!  I repeat again that these are events that occurred in a different
Australia, a society with different knowledge, and with different moral values
and standards.  To apply attitudes of the present
community to a period
commencing so long ago would be to apply the standards of today not those of
the 1940's and 1950's.
<P>

758   	The problem of determining negligence is further made
difficult by the fact that one is looking not at a particular occasion,
happening or incident but rather at alleged general negligent conduct, in
effect continuing unabated throughout a period of eighteen
years, from 1942 to
1960.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Submissions on Negligence</b>
<P>

759   	I trust I do not do the plaintiff's case a disservice by
summarising their submissions in a general way.  In so summarising,
I am not to
be taken as ignoring any argument advanced.
<P>

760   	The plaintiff's case is that the plaintiff became a ward
of the Board under its control in consequence of the mother's application
under
s 7(2) of the Act in 1942.  Thereafter, it is submitted the plaintiff remained
a ward and under the AWB's control till she
turned eighteen.  During that
period the Board, it is submitted, had a non-delegable duty or perhaps as was
submitted by Mr Hutley,
a personal duty "which may not be applied with its full
rigour here.  That is that the Board would not be liable for casual acts
of
negligence.  We make that concession"  (at T 549)
<P>

761   	In the plaintiff's case, on the state of knowledge during
that period it is alleged that the Board would have known, or ought
to have
known, that the relationship of child and parent or parent figure was vital to
the emotional well being of the child.  The
AWB would have known, or ought to
have known, of the risk of psychological damage during the period 1942-1960 as
a result of "inadequate
parenting", so that its minimum duty required it to
take steps to monitor her progress and take reasonable care in a number of
respects
having regard to information obtained or that could have been obtained
through monitoring, visiting, sending her to Child Guidance
Clinics or other
experts.
<P>

762   	It is alleged that the Board (or its representative) did
not visit her at Lutanda between 1947-1960, and that, had it done
so, it would
have obtained reports that warranted her being treated for mental or emotional
problems; she would have been referred
to a Child Guidance Clinic, would have
been successfully counselled and treated and given remedial care; she would not
have developed
an attachment disorder which itself developed into an alleged
Borderline Personality Disorder; and she would have progressed to a
normal
happy life different to that experienced by her presently.  In effect she would
have been "a different person" to that which
she turned out to be.
<P>

763   	It is asserted that the Board during her upbringing
failed to provide a substitute surrogate "mother" ("parent") or to attach
her
to a suitable person at Bomaderry and/or Lutanda.  The plaintiff's alleged
Borderline Personality Disorder it is claimed, did
not develop or was not
diagnosable until she was an adolescent or aged 18 or so, hence there was time
and opportunity to correct
it; and a breach of duty in failing to prevent its
occurrence.  Argument is advanced that the condition of poor attachment is
reversible.
 The plaintiff also relies upon a claim of negligence on the part
of the Board in failing to visit.  Other allegations of negligence
earlier
detailed are also alleged and relied upon.
<P>

764   	The plaintiff has also submitted that the staff at
Lutanda had "perceptions" about the plaintiff that were inter alia, clouded
by
"ignorance and prejudice".  I reject this submission as being one that is
without justification.  I have made findings and I say
no more on this point,
save to repeat that the plaintiff sent, at least her own daughter to Lutanda in
the early 1970's.
<P>

765   	The plaintiff argues that a parent/child relationship
provides no analogy to the circumstances of the present case and that
the
common law's reluctance to respond to an actionable duty owed by a parent to a
child has no bearing on the existence of a duty
or breach in the circumstances
of this case.  I propose to find that the parent/child relationship is relevant
in considering a duty
in the instant case, but that if I am wrong, it is not in
any event decisive or critical, to my ultimate decision.  The plaintiff
argued
that where the Board had control and placed the child in the control of others
it had a duty to ensure from time to time that
the situation was appropriate
for that child and that the child was not harmed.  Even if there was no
guardian-ward relationship
there was a duty of reasonable care arising by
virtue of the statutory provisions under the Act.  As I understand the way the
plaintiff's
case is put, the duty of care arose from the very situation in
which the statute placed the authority on the AWB.  Parliament having
conferred
both control upon the AWB by virtue of s 7(2) and duties by virtue of s 7(1),
it was not a contradiction of such a conferral
of powers that they be exercised
with reasonable care.  It was argued that the general rule is that when
statutory powers are conferred
they must be exercised with reasonable care so
that if those who exercise them could by reasonable precaution have prevented
an injury
which has been occasioned and was likely to be occasioned by their
exercise, there may be a liability in negligence.  It is submitted
that unless
the statute manifests a contrary intention, a public authority which enters
upon an exercise of statutory power may place
itself in a relationship to
members of the public which imports a common law duty to take care:
<b><u>Heyman</u></b>  per Mason J at 459.
<P>

766   	The fact that the defendants' relationship arises from
the exercise of a statutory power does not itself prevent the plaintiff
from
claiming that the defendants owed her a common law duty of care which it
allegedly breached.  Thus a public authority which
enters upon the exercise of
statutory powers with respect to a particular subject matter may place itself
in a position in relation
to others which imports a common law duty of care to
be discharged by the continuation or additional exercise of those powers.  The
foundation for the Board's duty of care to the plaintiff (if there be one) is
to be found in the statutory powers, including that
of control arising under s
7(2) and the performance of duties under s 7(1).  When a public authority
enters upon the exercise of
its statutory powers it must do so carefully, see:
<b><u>Heyman  v  Sutherland Shire Council</u></b>  supra;  <b><u>Pyrenees Shire
Council  v  Day</u></b>  supra and  <b><u>Romeo  v  Conservation Commission
(NT)</u></b>  supra.  That said, I do not understand the plaintiff to cavil
with the proposition that no duty to exercise a statutory power and
to exercise
it with care can be imposed by the common law on the repository of the power
when the statute, operating in the particular
circumstances, leaves the
repository with a discretion whether or not to exercise it:
<b><u>Romeo</u></b>  per Brennan CJ at 443 or in respect of policy decisions as
opposed to operational decisions (a difference, not always easy to draw):
<b><u>Romeo</u></b>  at 491-492.  If a common law action lies it will lie
because careless performance of the act will amount to common law negligence
and not because the act is performed under statutory authority:  <b><u>X
(Minors)</u></b>  supra.  The statutory enablement of the Board it is argued
facilitates the existence of a common law duty of care.
<P>

767   	The plaintiff's case is that any matter of difference or
distinction between policy decisions and operational decisions do
not arise in
the circumstances of this case.  Indeed, she submits that for example, the
failure of the Board to visit the plaintiff
at Lutanda was not (contrary to the
defendant's submissions) indicative of a policy of assimilation (itself a
policy which it does
not appear to challenge) or alternatively, an omission due
to the application of s 7(1)(a) of the Act.  She also further argues,
for
example, that alleged neglect and failure by the AWB to make contact at Lutanda
with a child over whom the Board had control
from 1947 to 1960 could not be
converted into a policy decision to "assist" in assimilation.
<P>

768   	The plaintiff did not sue the State of New South Wales in
respect of any activity of the Child Welfare Department (Lutanda
was a licensed
place under s 28 of the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  and subject to
licensing conditions, obligations and inspections under that Act and in respect
of which it is not suggested there
was any breach or non compliance or failure
to comply as such with Child Welfare Department standards).  The plaintiff
submits no
regard can be had to possible visits by the Child Welfare Department
in respect of the plaintiff.  It is no part of any case that
the plaintiff came
under the control of the Child Welfare Department.  Further, the plaintiff
submitted that it was not open to find
that the actions of the Board of
Education constituted a satisfaction of any duty by the AWB.  The plaintiff
argues that duty of
care, proximity, foreseeability and causation have been
established, that no policy considerations of any kind would prevent a duty
of
care arising at common law, or proceedings lying for breach.  As will be seen
in a case involving such as the present, where a
new novel category of duty is
being alleged, the matters of foreseeability and proximity are not necessarily
decisive: see the recent
decision of the High Court in  <b><u>Frank Perre  v
Apand Pty Ltd</u></b>   <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 36</a> (12 August 1999)
("<b><u>Apand</u></b>").
<P>

769   	The plaintiff does not appear to argue against (nor
submits that I cannot accept) the defendants' submissions that the plaintiff's
placement at Bomaderry and/or control or custody by the AWB was lawful being
with the consent or at the request of her mother; that
the plaintiff's legal
guardian was at all times her mother; that transfer to Lutanda was with the
consent of her mother; that transfer
was in accordance with the Board's
statutory duty; or that the transfer was for the purpose of giving the
plaintiff a better chance
in life than if she had remained at Bomaderry.  I
have made findings in relation to these.  Nor is any argument advanced that the
plaintiff's transfer to Lutanda "was improper or negligent" (written reply p
52).  Nor would I find that such transfer was other
than in good faith,
perceived to be for the benefit of the child and further or alternatively
properly done reflecting inter alia
the provisions of s 7(1)(a) and/or a policy
decision of the Board properly exercised pursuant to its discretionary
powers.
<P>

<b><u>The Defendants'  Submissions:</u></b>
<P>

770   	For the defendant a number of arguments have been
advanced which I summarise.  I trust in summarising them I do no more
disservice
to them than I have done to the plaintiff's submissions.  Again in
summarising, I am not to be taken to have overlooked any argument
in so far as
it is not specifically mentioned.
<P>

771   	The defendants' argue that there was no duty of care to
the plaintiff, no breach and no relevant causation.  It also argued
that the
statutory duty covered the field to the exclusion of the common law.  The last
proposition in some ways is reflective of
the approach of Lord Hoffman in
<b><u>Stovin  v  Wise</u></b>  supra at 952-953 where his Lordship appears to
have considered that if the policy of the Act is not to create a statutory
liability
to pay compensation, that policy should in the same circumstances
ordinarily exclude the existence of a common law duty of care.
 I do not accept
this as applying to the circumstances of this case: see  <b><u>Heyman's</u></b>
case, particularly per Mason J.  Next,  <b><u>Stovin's</u></b>  case has been
recently considered by the High Court in  <b><u>Pyrenees Shire Council  v
Day</u></b>;  and  <b><u>Romeo  v  Conservation Commission (NT)</u></b>: see
also "in terms" the recent decision of the House of Lords in
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>.  The High Court cases were cases involving established
categories of negligence and did not involve "novel categories of negligence"
issues as does the present case.  I do not see these High Court authority as
endorsing in terms the views of Lord Hoffman at 952-953
or suggesting the
applicability of his views to a case such as the present.  In
<b><u>Day</u></b>,  Brennan CJ (at 346) accepted that if a decision not to
exercise a statutory power was a rational one, then there could be no common
law duty to exercise the power.  That is not the present case as it seems to
me.  Next, the observation of Lord Hoffman may be misunderstood.
 In Australia
a breach of statutory duty is a cause of action distinct from the cause of
action for common law negligence.  The former
is a creature of statute, the
latter of the common law.  "However, the same set of circumstances may give
rise to either cause of
action"  <b><u>Day</u></b>  at 342.  Nevertheless, in
<b><u>Day</u></b>  (at 422) Kirby J accepted that some statutory powers are not
susceptible to providing a foundation or evidence of a concurrent common
law
duty.  That said, I would not conclude that the statutory provisions with which
I am concerned fall into the class considered
in  <b><u>Stovin</u></b>, or that
<b><u>Stovin</u></b>  requires me to reach a different view.
<P>

772   	The defendants argue that I should also find that Lutanda
was a caring environment run and staffed by persons who honestly
acted in what
they perceived to be the plaintiff's best interests.  A similar argument is
advanced in respect of Bomaderry.  Having
regard to the evidence I accept these
submissions.  I have already made findings and they are not repeated.  I am
also urged to find
the plaintiff's behaviour in her early teenage years was
"normal".  I accept this submission as well, and make such a finding.
<P>

773   	Next, in the instant case in my view there are no
established categories of negligence which provide any analogy for the
development of the novel cause of action in negligence urged by the plaintiff.
Furthermore, were the common law to be extended by
the creation of a new
category of negligence it is unclear where the new boundaries should be drawn.
That there are consequences
not merely affecting this case, have already in
part been addressed.  There are also considerations impacting in the area of
social
welfare law and in relation to the upbringing of children past, present
and future which are also relevant to a consideration of
the recognition or
otherwise of a duty of care.
<P>

774   	In England, the House of Lords in  <b><u>Caparo
Industries PLC  v  Dickman</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 AC 605</a> applied in  <b><u>X
(Minors)</u></b>  supra at 751, considered that in deciding whether to develop
novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally
and by
analogy with decided cases.  In the same way as in the present case, the House
of Lords in  <b><u>X (Minors)</u></b>  was not referred to any category of case
in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is analogous to the duty
sought in
that case.  Lord Browne Wilkinson (at 762) also indicated that there
was no category of case with which the duty of care sought in
that case could
be imposed by analogy.  As to novelty however, in the context of a strike out
application see the recent decision
in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  to which
reference has already been made and which dealt with public policy
considerations in terms of whether it would be fair,
just and reasonable to
impose a common law duty of care on a local authority in respect of upbringing
of a child in care.  In my
view neither the incremental or analogy argument
requires me to find a duty of care in this case.  The three stage test in
<b><u>Caparo</u></b>  and in particular the third test of fair, just and
reasonable (in terms) has not been accepted by the majority of the High Court:
see  <b><u>Apand</u></b>  supra
<P>

<b><u>Policy:</u></b>
<P>

775   	In England in respect of what was said to be the "child
abuse cases" ("novel categories of negligence") the House of Lords
in  <b><u>X
(Minors)</u></b>  supra, for the purposes of determining whether an action lay
at common law, and the extent of the duty of care owed by local authorities
"prior to children being taken into care", applied the three considerations
test in  <b><u>Caparo Industries PLC  v  Dickman</u></b>  supra.  This "test" I
might add, reflects the approach adopted by Kirby J in  <b><u>Pyrenees Shire
Council  v  Day</u></b>  supra at 419-420;  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  supra at 476
and recently in  <b><u>Apand</u></b>  supra.  It is not an approach supported
by authoritative statements of the other High Court judges, or reflects the
majority view
of the Court in that case.  As to the three considerations, the
first consideration is:  were the damages reasonably foreseeable,
the second
is:  was the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant sufficiently
proximate.  The third consideration is:
 is it just and reasonable to impose a
duty of care.  This last consideration was described by Kirby J in  <b><u>Romeo
v  Conservation Commission</u></b>  supra  and<b><u>  Pyrenees Shire Council  v
Day</u></b>  supra in terms of whether it is "fair, just and reasonable for the
common law to impose a duty".  That third consideration also
appears to perhaps
"mask", or reflect questions of policy, as well..  That said, in  <b><u>X
(Minors)'s</u></b> case the reasons of Lord Browne Wilkinson at 749-750 reveal
reasons as to why his Lordship did not consider it just and reasonable
to
impose or superimpose a common law duty of care on the local authority in
relation to the performance of its statutory duties
to protect children.  Those
considerations, I believe, are relevant to be considered in the instant case.
The reasons were stated
as follows:  First, that a common law duty of care
would cut across the whole statutory system for the protection of children at
risk.  Second, the task of the local authorities and its servants in dealing
with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate. 
Next, if liability were
imposed it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and
defensive approach to their
duties.  Finally, there is the consideration that
there was no analogy for the novel category of negligence urged.  Lord Browne
Wilkinson
said (at 751):
<P>

"Finally, your Lordships' decision in the  <i>Caparo  case</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 A.C.
605</a> lays down that, in deciding whether to develop novel categories of
negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy
with decided
categories.  We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of
care has been held to exist which is in
any way analogous to the present cases.
Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty
of care in
relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme.
Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society
(children) from
harm done to them by others.  The scheme involves the administrators in
exercising discretions and powers which could
not exist in the private sector
and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the
general law, are responsible
for the child's welfare".
<P>

776   	These considerations (with appropriate modifications to
meet the circumstances of this case) are in my opinion, matters relevant
to be
considered for determining whether a duty of care should be found in the
present case.  They are particularly relevant to determining
whether policy
should deny the existence of a duty of care of the type claimed.
<P>

777   	At (752) his Lordship referred to the need for courts to
hesitate long before imposing a common law duty of care in the exercise
of
discretionary powers or duties conferred by Parliament for social welfare
purposes.  The recent decision of the House of Lords
in  <b><u>Barrett  v
Enfield London Borough Council</u></b>  supra, particularly looked at issues of
policy in the context of the third criteria referred to in the three criteria
test in  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>  test.
<P>

778   	In  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>,  (a strike out case, a point
of some distinction) the plaintiff, when ten months old in 1973 was placed in
the care of the defendant
local authority and remained in care until the age of
17.  He claimed damages for personal injury arising out of negligence by the
authority.  He claimed that the authority, under statutory duties imposed by
the  <b><u>Children's Act</u></b>,  was obliged to exercise "quasi-parental
care" in and about the upbringing of the child plaintiff.
<P>

779   	The case was considered by Lord Slynn (at 98) as one of
ongoing failure of duty to be seen as a "whole", including whether
the
cumulative effect of the allegations "if true" could have caused "the
injury".
<P>

780   	In  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>,  it had also been pleaded that
breach of the statutory duties in themselves gave rise to a cause of action for
damages.  That said,
the plaintiff accepted before the Court of Appeal and the
House of Lords that he had no statutory cause of action.  It was not suggested
that such a cause of action may have been available.  As I said previously, he
did not at any time allege a fiduciary relationship
or breach of fiduciary
duty.  The plaintiff alleged that the relationship between him and the council,
arising by reason of the care
order, was such as to create a common law duty of
care owed by the defendant to him.  He alleged that in breach of such duty of
care
the defendant negligently failed to safeguard his welfare and that by
reason of the defendant's negligent treatment of him, he attained
the age of
eighteen without family or attachments and suffering from a psychiatric illness
leading to his having an alcohol problem
and a propensity to harm himself.
What he said was that the combination of all or some of the alleged acts of
negligence produced
that result.
<P>

781   	In the Court of Appeal Lord Woolf MR ,applying the three
stage test in  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>  concluded it would not be just and
reasonable to impose a duty of care on a local authority for the careless
exercise of statutory
discretions applicable to children in care.  Further,
Lord Woolf held that the decision in  <b><u>X (Minors)</u></b>  applied to
cases of children being taken into care, and that the plaintiff's case
substantially rested on allegations of the Council
acting negligently contrary
to statutory discretion.  Evans and Schiemann LJJ reached a similar conclusion,
placing more emphasis
on the inability of the plaintiff to show any causative
link between any negligence capable of being proved and the psychiatric
damage.
<P>

782   	However, in the House of Lords, Lord Browne Wilkinson was
of the view that not all careless acts or omissions of a local
authority in
relation to a child in its care were actionable.  If "certain careless conduct
(operational) of the local authority
is actionable and certain conduct (policy)
is not" it would then become necessary to divide the decisions of the local
authority
into two categories.  His Lordship said (at 83) "... unless it can be
said ... that operational carelessness could not have caused
the damage alleged
in the present case it would be impossible to strike out any part of the
claim".  He considered that causation
was quintessentially a matter of fact and
that damage capable of being caused by negligence in making an operational
decision was
recoverable.
<P>

783   	His Lordship also considered that the plaintiff's
statement of claim should not be struck out "in this confused and developing
area of the law".  He observed that the "erroneous dictum" of his in  <b><u>X
(Minors)</u></b>  (a striking out application) had given rise to a
proliferation of claims against psychological services provided by local
authorities
in dealing with those suffering from reading disability.  This, he
considered, emphasised the importance of deciding "these cases"
on the actual
facts and not on mistaken hypotheticals.
<P>

784   	What also emerges in Lord Browne Wilkinson's judgment (at
85) was the importance of the need to consider (as Australian Courts
do not)
provisions such as Article 6 of the  <b>European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</b>  and the impact of the European
Court's decision in  <b><u>Osman  v  United Kingdom</u></b>  (ECtHR, 28 October
1998, unreported.  A factor in not striking out the plaintiff's statement of
claim was that, because of  <b><u>Osman</u></b>,  it was difficult to foretell
what would be the result if the House of Lords upheld the striking out order.
It sees to me that as
 <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  reveals, the application of
conventions may sometimes have unforseen consequences in terms of impact upon
the applicability of domestic
law on private litigation involving citizen and
citizen, or citizen and State.
<P>

785   	With respect these matters are not on point in cases such
as this.  Nor do I see why in an appropriate case the striking
out process
would not necessarily be suitable or even deemed appropriate to determine as I
have said the existence of a duty.  Such
could avoid potentially lengthy and
costly trials.  However, this case is not concerned with strike out law, and I
move.
<P>

786   	In some respects,  <b><u>Barrett's</u></b>  case is an
example, or further example of what may be considered to be a development in
Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom
of a class of social welfare type
negligence cases involving issues of alleged psychiatric personality or
behaviour type injury or
damage, the product of events long since passed.
Indeed, the potential for "floodgate problems" with social and economic
consequences
cannot be ignored when one is dealing with these novel type cases.
As Lord Browne Wilkinson recognised, some observations of his
had apparently
given rise to a proliferation of claims against local authorities by those
suffering reading difficulties.  What also
appears from the decision in
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>  is that it was considered important to have the facts
proved to see whether the action was justiciable, and further whether it was
fair, just and reasonable ("policy") to impose a duty of care, which was not to
be decided in the abstract but on the basis of what
had been proved.  With
respect it is by no means clear why in a case such as the present, the
establishment of actual facts at a
lengthy trial is required in order to
determine whether a duty of care is owed.
<P>

787   	Next, in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  it was held that public
policy considerations did not have the same force in respect of decisions taken
once the child was already
in local authority care.  Their Lordships did not
consider that the "bar" on a child suing his parents for negligent decisions in
its upbringing applied in a case such as the one they were dealing with where a
local authority had to take decisions which a parent
never had to take and
which had trained staff to advise on such decisions.  With respect to those who
hold contrary views, it is
not clear why this distinction is made or is a valid
one.  If there be a public policy reason for not permitting a child to sue a
parent for "bad upbringing" or in respect of upbringing generally, I do not see
why the same public policy reason ought not to apply
where the upbringing is
done by another (whether voluntary or compelled).  If the parent has only a
moral duty (not a legal duty)
of upbringing, with a liability to a child
essentially only arising from a specific particular situation occurring and not
from the
relationship of parent-child itself, one can see good reason for
concluding that such should similarly be the situation in an upbringing
relationship of the type presently under consideration, however it be
described.  Were it to be otherwise, a higher duty would or
could be imposed on
the third party (whether it be the Board, a State charitable institution, or a
voluntary charitable religious
home or even an adopted or foster parent)
bringing up the child, than on the natural parent.  Further, in matters of
bonding or attachment,
in matters of maternal satisfaction the natural mother
has a benefit denied to a third party "substitute", being that of the force
of
nature and of natural parenting.  The substitute third party (if there can be a
true substitute) suffers from the detriment of
not being the natural parent by
nature and therefore not being able to give what a natural parent can provide.
I am not bound by
the decision in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  in a strike out
application or at all.  I find the views of the English Court of Appeal in
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>,  of the majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in
<b><u>Prince</u></b>,  the views of the High Court in  <b><u>Hahn  v
Conley</u></b>  at 283 and of Powell JA in  <b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  in
the context of discussing fiduciary duty as being particularly, helpful on the
question of whether there is or should be a duty
of care in the present case.
As to the matter of the Board having "trained staff advising" it should be
remembered that this case
concerns events in the period 1942-1960.  In any
event in the area of personality and emotional development there are issues of
nature
and nurture as well and whether trained staff can be "true substitutes
or surrogates" for natural parents, particularly a mother.
<P>

788   	Again, in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  Lord Slynn said (at
95):
<P>

"It is obvious from previous cases and indeed is itself evident that there is a
real conflict between on the one hand the need to
allow social welfare services
exercising statutory powers to do their work in what they as experts consider
is the best way in the
interests first of the child but also of the parents and
of society, without a unduly inhibiting fear of litigation if something
goes
wrong, and on the other hand the desirability of providing a remedy in
appropriate cases for harm done to a child through the
acts or failure to act
of such services.
<P>

It is no doubt right for the courts to restrain within reasonable bounds claims
against public authorities exercising statutory
powers in this social welfare
context.  It is equally important to set reasonable bounds to the immunity such
public authority can
assert".
<P>

789   	With respect, how the courts are to implement the
"restraint" or how the relevant principles are to be necessarily balanced
is
not fully made clear by  Barrett.
<P>

790   	Further, whilst the competing social issues are readily
stated they are not always capable of resolution by the courts. 
The point is
also made in  <b><u>Breen  v  Williams</u></b>  supra by Mahoney JA at 558 in
the Court of Appeal in observing that where the question is "a competition
between compelling social
claims" the matter is best left to Parliament.  In
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>  according to Lord Slynn (at 96-97) policy and
operational factors have a role to play in determining whether "the particular
issue
is justiciable".  His Lordship also considered that in deciding whether
particular issues are justiciable and whether if a duty of
care is owed, and it
has been broken "the court must have regard to the statutory context and the
nature of the tasks involved. 
The mere fact that something has gone wrong or
that a mistake has been made, or that someone has been inefficient does not
mean there
was a duty to be careful or that such duty has been broken".  His
Lordship's approach I regard as being helpful to me in arriving
at my decision
that no duty of care is owed in the circumstances of this case.  Perhaps a
somewhat similar approach may be found
in the views of Mahoney JA in
<b><u>Public Trustee  v  Commonwealth</u></b>  supra, when he distinguished
between on the one hand error and on the other negligent error.  In the present
case, apart from there
being no error, there was no negligent error in any
event to be found involving the Board.
<P>

791   	In  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>,  Lord Woolf, in the Court of
Appeal did not consider that many of the allegations of the kind in the present
case alleged were even
justiciable.  Such a view was also taken by the majority
in  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  at 277, inter alia, in the context of fair trial
considerations but also specifically in terms of causation.  That said, Lord
Slynn
in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  (at 99)  appears to have shared the view that
the question of whether it is just and reasonable to "impose a liability in
negligence
... is to be decided on the basis of what is proved at a trial".
With respect, I do not necessarily accept that to determine whether
a duty lies
that such should or must involve a full trial in all cases involving "novel"
claims.
<P>

792   	Next, in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  in dealing with the
matter of causation, whilst not supporting a striking out the matter Lord Slynn
accepted that the plaintiff
"faced considerable difficulties" in proving their
case of causation: see also Lord Hutton (at 115).
<P>

793   	There is nothing in the decision of the House of Lords
strike out application in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  binding upon me.  It is a
decision that I have some difficulty with in a number of respects.  In this
case the law is for me to
determine on the facts proven.
<P>

794   	In both  <b><u>X (Minors)</u></b>  and in
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>  the matter of standard of care was addressed.
<P>

795   	In  <b><u>X (Minor)'s</u></b>  case, Lord Browne
Wilkinson said (at 761) when discussing "educational" decisions, observed that
even if they were made carelessly,
the claims would fail "unless the plaintiff
can show that the decisions were so careless that no reasonable education
authority could
have reached them".  His Lordship said (at 766) in the context
of discussing educational well-being of a child that "the headmaster
and
advisory teachers were not under a duty to exercise a higher degree of skill
such as that of an educational psychologist.  Nor
would they have been in
breach of any duty of care if they held and communicated a reasonable view of
dyslexia shared at that date
by a responsible body of educational thinking".
<P>

796   	It is appropriate to also mention in passing Lord
Hutton's views on the subject of standard of care in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>
and the approach to be adopted in England under English common law.  He
considered that the standard of care in negligence must be
related to the
nature of the duty to be performed and to the circumstances in which it is to
be so performed.  He said (at 115):
<P>

"Therefore the standard of care to be required of the defendant in this case in
order to establish negligence at common law will
have to be determined against
the background that it is given discretions to exercise by statute in a sphere
involving difficult
decisions in relation to the welfare of children.
Accordingly when the decisions taken by a local authority in respect of a child
in its care are alleged to constitute negligence at common law, the trial
judge, bearing in mind the room for differences of opinion
as to the best
course to adopt in a difficult field and that the discretion is to be exercised
by the authority and its social workers
and not by the court, must be satisfied
that the conduct complained of went beyond mere errors of judgment in the
exercise of a discretion
and constituted conduct which can be regarded as
negligent".
<P>

797   	An application of such a test to this case that I am
dealing with, would further lead me to the conclusion that there was
no breach
of that standard in any event.  That is however, a further issue different to
that of whether there is a duty of care to
be found in cases such as the
present.
<P>

798   	In  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  supra, the majority of the
Court of Appeal (at 277) denied the existence of a duty of care in an adoption
type case relying upon
public policy reasons, including the public policy
reason supporting the absence of an action lying at the suit of the child
against
a parent for in effect bad parenting.  I acknowledge that in New
Zealand, the courts in effect give effect to the two stage tests
in  <b><u>Anns
v  Merton London Borough Council</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 728</a> and the decision in
<b><u>Prince</u></b>  is to be seen against such a background.  That said, the
policy point I believe is a relevant matter to consider on the existence
or
otherwise of a duty of care.  A similar policy argument by reference, inter
alia, to the parent/child analogy (based on the trial
judge's decision in
<b><u>Prince</u></b>)  was advanced in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  supra and
accepted by the English Court of Appeal.  Other policy reasons for denying the
duty of care in  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  particularly in point, were
considerations mentioned by the majority.  The New Zealand Court of Appeal
majority said (at 277):
<P>

"The second set of policy considerations pointing against recognising a duty of
care can be summarised very shortly.  They are less
significant in the overall
assessment than the considerations to be drawn from the adoption legislation
which we have been discussing,
but they are still important in public policy
terms.  If a principal cause of the child's problems as they emerge over the
years
can be ascribed to bad parenting it is incongruous to allow a suit
against a secondary party but not against the parents, whether
adoptive or
natural - and it was not suggested that the child could bring such a suit in
negligence against parents.  And if for
public policy reasons a child cannot
sue the social worker and the department there could be no policy justification
for allowing
the natural mother to sue on learning of the child's problems
while leaving the adoption unchallenged.  Further, the imposition of
the duty
of care contended for could not sensibly be confined to social workers and the
department.  Others involved in the adoption
process (apart from the Court
which is the effective decision maker) could scarcely be excluded.  The
consequences for the public
interest would in our view be unacceptably
expansive.
<P>

As well, there are fair trial considerations.  Disentangling factors that
contributed to the decision of the adoption Court, usually
long after the
event, and determining to what extent the adoption Court was influenced by the
alleged negligence of the social worker
would be difficult, if not often
impossible.  Causation, including weighing the respective influences of nurture
and nature in shaping
the child and affecting his or her life prospects, and
quantification of any loss are likely to be highly speculative, if indeed
justiciable.  Finally, there are other systems of accountability for
performance by social workers of their professional responsibilities
and for
maladministration of the department.  Standard public law remedies apply in
respect of the exercise of statutory powers.
 Departments are subject to
ministerial and parliamentary oversight.  Social workers are subject to
departmental disciplinary regimes.
 Complaints may be made to the Ombudsman.
<P>

For these reasons we would hold that the claims in negligence as pleaded by Mr
Prince and Ms Gardner do not lie and should be struck
out."
<P>

799   	The Court also accepted that in determining new
situations in which a duty may lie, policy considerations were relevant .
 The
majority said (at 268):
<P>

"<u>Determining in new situations whether a claim in negligence may lie</u>.
<P>

The issue is whether a claim in negligence may lie.  The ultimate question is
whether in the light of all the circumstances of the
case it is just and
reasonable to recognise a duty of care by the defendant to the plaintiff.  That
depends on consideration of all
the material facts in combination.  It is an
intensely practical question.  For almost 20 years, and drawing in  <i>Anns  v
Merton London Borough Council</i>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 728.</a> We have found it helpful to
focus on two broad fields of inquiry.  The first is the degree of proximity or
relationship between the
alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered
damage.  That is not a simple question of foreseeability as between parties.
It
involves consideration of the degree of analogy with cases in which duties
are already established and reflects an assessment of
the competing moral
claims.  The second is whether there are other policy considerations which tend
to negative or restrict - or
strengthen the existence of - a duty in that class
of case  <i>(Fleming  v  Securities Commission</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%202%20NZLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995 2 NZLR 514</a> at pp
527-528).
<P>

Three distinct claims in negligence require consideration.  What may be termed
the 1969 claims by the child and the mother respectively
are outcomes of the
adoption process.  The complaint to the department in 1983, which gives rise to
the other claims by the child,
calls for close consideration of the Children
and Young <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1974120/" class="autolink_findacts">Persons Act 1974</a>.
<P>

800   	Speaking for myself, I find the approach of the majority
of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  and that of the
English Court of Appeal in  <b><u>Barrett</u></b>  reflects valid policy
considerations, and gives appropriate recognition to the decision of the High
Court in  <b><u>Hahn  v  Conley</u></b>.  Indeed, I consider the reasoning
helpful.
<P>

801   	In Australia, policy reasons have been held to deny the
existence of a duty of care at common law even where proximity and
foreseeability are both present.  In  <b><u>Jaensch  v  Coffey</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984)
155 CLR 549</a> at 583 Deane J dealt with policy considerations when stating that
it was not the common law that the reasonable foreseeability of
risk of injury
to another automatically meant that there was a duty to take care with respect
to that risk of injury.  His Honour
considered that "reasonable foreseeability
on its own indicates no more than that such a duty will exist if and to the
extent that,
it is not precluded or modified by some applicable overriding
requirement or limitation".  The policy of the law may impose a limitation
in
particular circumstances or in classes of case to limit or confine the
existence of a duty to take care.  In the end (particularly
"where a new
category is suggested") policy considerations will set the outer limits of the
tort:  <b><u>Hill  v  Van Erp</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 159</a> at 179.  The outer
boundary of liability in negligence will be fixed by reference to inter alia
policy considerations:  <b><u>Day</u></b>  per Kirby J at 419.  In  <b><u>Gala
v  Preston</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172 CLR 243</a> at 260 it was held that no duty was
owed, apparently, at least on the part of some members of the High Court, for
public policy reasons.
<P>

802   	The effects of imposing a duty in a case such as the
present for past events occurring in the 1940's-1950's could presumably
have
social, economic and resource consequences.  Apart from this. the imposition of
a duty of the type urged in the instant case
could affect not merely the Board
but also have financial consequences for other child caring bodies whether
conducted by the State
or by religious, voluntary or other charitable
institutions, the very bodies to whom the very children sought to be protected,
turn
to and rely upon for assistance.  Indeed, foster parents and adopting
parents could also be affected as well.  The social consequences
as well need
to be considered in terms of the provision of child upbringing services.  Would
there be, or could there be a reduction
in the availability of services?  These
matters or effects are difficult to measure.  Nevertheless, they are practical
considerations
of a type which seem to have been addressed in
<b><u>Romeo</u></b>  by Brennan CJ at 446-447.  To impose a duty measured
solely by reference to foreseeable risk of injury and proximity without more,
might impact upon the provision of child care services which society
unfortunately requires for the upbringing of children, whose
parents are unable
or unwilling to bring up their children themselves, or provide appropriate
care.  A factor also relevant to the
existence of a duty of care in the
circumstances is whether extending liability would reduce the supply of
services, increase their
cost or reduce standards to the detriment of the
public:  <b><u>Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd  v  Peat Marwick Hungerfords
(Reg)</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241.</a>  Questions of legal policy reflect the need
to limit the imposition of a duty of care if foreseeability and proximity alone
take
the law into imposition of duties of care which are unfair, unreasonable
and unrealistic: see  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  per Kirby J at 476-477:
<b><u>Apand</u></b>  supra per McHugh J at 80.  Further as McHugh J said the
existence (or non existence) of insurance, and of loss spreading is not
a
guiding rationale for the law of negligence.
<P>

803   	In  <b><u>Esanda</u></b>,  McHugh J (at 283-284) referred
to the public interest not to overlook the impact of the imposition of a duty
on the administration
of the court system: see also  <b><u>X (Minors)</u></b>
per Lord Browne Wilkinson at 761-762.  Before leaving the matter of policy and
turning to consider further the correct approach for
determining questions of
duty ("perhaps none is possible") I would observe that a public authority is
not under a duty of care in
relation to decisions which involve or are dictated
by financial, economic, social or political factors or constraints.  Whilst
these
are matters going to the existence of a duty:  <b><u>Heyman</u></b>  at
469;  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  at 492, there are perhaps views that such matters
are to perhaps rather be regarded in determining what should be done to
"discharge
a duty of care": cf  <b><u>Day</u></b>  per Gummow J at 394.
<P>

804   	The recent decision of the High Court in  <b><u>Frank
Perre &amp; Ors  v  Apand Pty Ltd</u></b>  illustrates some of the difficulties
associated in determining whether a duty of care is owed, the tests for such
and some of the
difficulties associated with questions of reasonable
foreseeability and proximity as the tests for negligence.
<P>

805   	The  <b><u>Apand</u></b>  case concerned the questions of
liability of an alleged tortfeasor in negligence for financial loss,
unconnected with any injury
done by a tortfeasor to the person or property of
the plaintiff.  In his decision Gleeson CJ (at 2) in referring to the
"expansive"
application which had given to the concept of reasonable
foreseeability in relation to physical injury to person or property, concluded
that the duty to avoid any reasonably foreseeable financial harm needs to be
constrained "by some intelligible limits to keep the
law of negligence within
the bounds of common sense and practicality".  I consider that such a view duly
modified to apply to a case
such as the present supports the denial of the
existence of a duty of care.
<P>

806   	His Honour referred to the solution as not being found in
the three stage "test" said to have been formulated by Lord Bridge
in
<b><u>Caparo Industries Pty Ltd  v  Dickman</u></b>  supra.  Lord Bridge
(617-618) referred to the necessary ingredients of foreseeability, proximity
and a situation in which the court
considers it fair, just and reasonable that
the law should impose a duty.  In  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>,  Lord Bridge said (at
617-618):
<P>

"The concepts of proximity and unfairness ... are not susceptible of any such
precise definition as would be necessary to give them
utility as practical
tests, but amount in effect to little more than convenient labels to attach the
features of different specific
situations, which, on a detailed examination of
the circumstances the law recognises pragmatically as giving rise to a duty of
care
of a given scope."
<P>

807   	Lord Bridge also quoted with approval the observations of
Brennan J in  <b><u>Heyman</u></b>  supra (at 481) in determining whether a
duty of care arose.  In  <b><u>Heyman</u></b>  Brennan J said that it was
preferable for the law to develop novel categories of negligence incrementally
and by analogy with established
categories.  In my view the incremental and
analogy arguments do not point to a duty of care existing in the instant
case.
<P>

808   	In his judgment in  <b><u>Apand</u></b>,  McHugh J
observed that there was a danger that the  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>  test would be
used as the test of duty in every case where duty is in issue.  He said that
the three stage test in  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>  had been adopted by Kirby J in
<b><u>Pyrenees Shire Council</u></b>  supra at 419-420.  That said, he thought
the  <b><u>Caparo</u></b> test suffered from three stated defects.  He
considered that proximity had no more content under the  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>
test than before the decision, and that Dawson J was correct in  <b><u>Hill  v
Van Erp</u></b>  when he said (at 176-177) that proximity is neither a
necessary or sufficient criterion for the existence of duty of care.  McHugh
J,
earlier (at 22) whilst considering that proximity may not have been the
talisman for determining a duty of care, neither the High
Court or the English
Courts had "entirely abandoned" the used of proximity as a factor in
determining duty.  He also considered that
since the "fall of proximity, the
Court has not made any authoritative statement as to what is the correct
approach for determining
the duty of care situation.  Perhaps none is
possible".  With respect, the instant case that I am deciding may well be a
very good
illustration of the point made.
<P>

809   	His Honour also considered (at 24) that "almost every one
would agree that the courts should not impose a duty of care on
a person unless
it is fair, just and reasonable to do so".  Next, (at 25), McHugh J referred to
"notions of current ideas of justice
or morality" as being a criteria of last
resort in determining the duty question.  With respect, I agree.  Endorsement
appears to
have given to the view that whatever formula be used, "the outcome
in a grey area has to be determined by judicial judgment".  Further,
his Honour
observed that the two stage test for duty in  <b><u>Anns  v  Merton London
Borough Council</u></b>  had been rejected by the High Court and in England.
Applying the consideration of judicial judgment, I would also find in the
circumstances
that there is no duty of care.
<P>

810   	At 27, his Honour repeated his view that the two stage
test in  <b><u>Anns</u></b>  and the three stage test in  <b><u>Caparo</u></b>
were each defective, and that proximity was not the unifying test for
negligence.  At 29-30, he discussed a conceptual framework
for determinants of
duty as including established categories, a considerable body of case law and a
useful concept of reasonable
foreseeability.  He thought that the best solution
was to proceed "incrementally from the established cases and principles".
McHugh
J said (at 30):
<P>

"The law should be developed incrementally by reference to the reasons why the
material facts in analogous cases did or did not
found a duty by reference to
the few principles of general application that can be found in the duty
cases."
<P>

811   	The present case that I am considering is novel in terms
of categories.  That is not the end of the matter.  That said, if
the court
does not think it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty such should not
be imposed.  I do not consider it should
be imposed in the circumstances of
this case.  Likewise, even if the case is in a "grey area" with the outcome to
be determined by
judicial judgment, the courts' judicial judgment is against
imposing a duty.  In saying this, in addition  I also rely upon the other
reasons as stated in reaching such a decision.
<P>

812   	In his reasons for decision in  <b><u>Apand</u></b>,
Gummow J referred to case law advancing from one precedent to the next.  His
Honour discussed the situation where a case did not
fall within a recognised
category and was one for the creation of a new category.  His Honour referred
to `salient features" which
combined to constitute a sufficient relationship to
give rise to a duty of care "with" allowance for the operation of "control
mechanisms".
 As a matter of policy in this instant case the "control
mechanisms" are called for and should on his Honour's approach be applied.
<P>

813   	At p 96, Kirby J observed that even if it be accepted
that to some extent considerations such as "foreseeability" and proximity
are
labels masking deeper policy choices "they were rational labels".  His Honour
also appears to have agreed that whilst the references
to "fair, just and
reasonable" (as considerations relevant to the existence of a duty) may not
constitute a "rule" or "test" as such,
they did provide an approach of
methodology which obliges the decision maker to face squarely considerations of
policy questions".
 His Honour appears to have placed weight on the importance
of undertaking the policy analysis required at the third stage of the
<b><u>Caparo</u></b>  approach, reiterating that his approach (and that of
<b><u>Caparo</u></b>) provides a methodology for deciding whether a duty of
care exists in negligence cases (see also at 101-102 and further at 107).
 His
Honour referred to the matter of "floodgates" and also (at 113) identified the
policy reasons he regarded as excluding a duty
of care, ultimately concluding
that legal policy did not deny the existence of a duty of care in
<b><u>Apand</u></b>.
<P>

814   	In his reasons Hayne J (at 127-128) observed that to
search for a single unifying principle lying behind what is described
as a
relationship of proximity is then "to search for something that is not to be
found".  His Honour considered that because of
the lack of definition of terms
like "proximity" and "fairness" that the law "in this area" should develop
incrementally: see  <b><u>Heyman</u></b> at 481;  <b><u>Caparo</u></b> at 618;
<b><u>X (Minors)</u></b> at 633.
<P>

815   	In  <b><u>Apand</u></b>  there thus appears to be general
acceptance that it is preferable for the law rather to develop novel categories
incrementally.
 Such further view when applied to this case further leads me to
the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case no duty of
care should be
found.
<P>

816   	There are no American or Canadian cases to which counsel
has pointed suggesting a duty "of care" in circumstances such as
the present.
The Canadian case of  <b><u>M (K)  v  M (H)</u></b>  referred to in
<b><u>Williams [No 1]</u></b>  was a case concerning an intentional tort of
trespass and fiduciary duty "of care" in Canada.  The decisions in
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>  (in the Court of Appeal but not in the House of Lords)
and  <b><u>Prince</u></b>  draw on principles arising in the relationship of
parent and child.  Next, the defendant advances an argument by reference to the
moral duties of conscientious parenthood arguing that in cases concerning such
support, policy or public interest militate against
imposing, or  it is not
just and reasonable to impose, a duty.  In my view the analogy with the
parent-child relationship should
not be ignored.  In fact, I consider it has
relevance, despite views to the contrary in the House of Lords in
<b><u>Barrett</u></b>.  Even if I am mistaken, such a view of itself would not
cause me to deny the existence of a duty of care.  I see no reason why in
a
case such as the present one, why the Board should be necessarily under a
higher or different duty to that of a parent in similar
circumstances,
involving upbringing of a natural child.
<P>

817   	At common law the duty to bring up a child to support and
maintain has long been regarded as a moral one or even described
as a "moral
duty of imperfect obligation":  <b><u>Bayely  v  Forde</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281863%29%20LR%202%20QB%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1863) LR 2 QB
539</a> at 569.  Further, in the instant case there was no duty under the Act to
educate the plaintiff, a matter already discussed.  The
law in Australia in
respect of parent and child is set forth in  <b><u>Hahn  v  Conley</u></b>
supra per Barwick CJ (at 283):
<P>

"... I think that the view for which there is most judicial support and the
view which commends itself to me is that the moral duties
of conscientious
parenthood do not as such provide the child with any cause of action when they
are not, or badly performed or neglected".
<P>

818   	Apart from motor vehicle cases, there may be cases of
intentional wrong, for example, of assault by a father on a child:
the Canadian
case of  <b><u>M</u></b>  or against an adoptive father:  cf  <b><u>Stubbings
v  Webb</u></b>  supra.
<P>

819   	The case of the negligent motor accident case involving
child and parent situation is one not arising from a mere "blood
relationship"
of parent and child but because of the facts that exist in the particular
situation.  As I have earlier said (but it
is worth repeating in the particular
context).  The common law position in respect of torts within the family is
discussed by Professor
Fleming in  <b>Fleming on Torts (Seventh (ed))</b> at
644:
<P>

"There is a consensus that the parents' duty to feed, clothe, maintain, educate
and generally care for the child is not enforceable
in tort, whatever its moral
or other legal (for example sanctions criminal) sanctions".
<P>

820   	The duties which the relationship cast on a parent to
care for and protect the child are moral duties not enforceable by
action in
tort.  The occasions when a child can sue its parent in tort are the result of
specific situations in which the parties
find themselves:  see also <b><u>
McCallion  v  Dodd</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20NZLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] NZLR 710</a> per McCarthy J at 270 and
<b><u>Rogers  v  Rawlings</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20Qd%20R%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] Qd R 262.</a>
<P>

821   	Thus the duty which a parent owes in a child's upbringing
and its incidents of feeding, clothing, educating, looking after
and guiding or
indeed, giving a child love and affection, involves not a legal duty, the
breach of which gives a right of action
against a parent.
<P>

822   	Where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of
ordinary parental discretion or conduct or decision making with respect
to
bringing up the child and how in what manner such is to be done then ordinarily
the law does not interfere.  In my view there
is nothing in  <b><u>Bennett  v
The Minister</u></b>  supra that is inconsistent with the view stated.  In
<b><u>Bennett</u></b>  the action ultimately had as its source the defendant
committing a negligent act in one of its institutions where the plaintiff
was
being cared for resulting in the loss of a chose in action to the infant for
his injury.  The action sprang out of a particular
situation.  In one sense the
case arose (on a "tracing back") to a specific particular situation of the type
accepted by the common
law and illustrated in  <b><u>Hahn</u></b>.  The duty
arose in a more limited context involving an actual obligation to ensure the
plaintiff suffered no economic loss by not
being advised of his rights, and the
loss of a chose in action.  It was not such a case as the present of an action
arising from
in effect an ongoing "upbringing" relationship extending over
eighteen years.
<P>

823   	In my view, if there be an analogy, with the parent-child
relationship, (and my decision does not turn on this) such is further
or
alternatively, an additional reason for denying a duty of care.  That decision
does not ultimately of itself turn upon this analogy
argument, although it
assists in reaching my decision.
<P>

824   	For all the reasons given in my judgment, no duty of care
should be imposed.  The plaintiff's case in negligence thus fails
because of
this absence of a common law duty of care for reasons stated.
<P>

<b><u>Breach of Duty of Care:</u></b>
<P>

825   	It is necessary to address the issue of breach of duty in
the event that I am in error in concluding that there is no common
law duty of
care and for reasons given, and to be given there was no breach of duty in any
event.
<P>

826   	The plaintiff asserts that at common law there is a
non-delegable duty of care arising out of a special relationship between
the
defendants and the plaintiff.  That said, Mr Hutley does not appear to suggest
that this is so in absolute terms or applies in
all cases.  He relies upon such
cases as  <b><u>Burnie Port Authority  v  General Jones Pty Limited</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 520</a>;  <b><u>Kondis  v  State Transport Authority</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984)

of completion of authority I would add the views of Toohey and McHugh JJ in
<b><u>Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd  v  Harris</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 313</a> in
also basing their judgment on the presence of a personal or a non-delegable
duty.  The matter of whether there is or would be
a non-delegable duty in the
circumstances is by no means clear.  The plaintiff's mother asked the Board to
take control of the plaintiff
under s 7(2).  The plaintiff may have become a
ward under s 13A by a Children's Court committal.  With respect to the
plaintiff,
the Board has a power to board out under s 11D(2) and place a ward
in a foster parent home.  The Board may place a ward in an apprenticeship
or in
employment under s 11A(1).  The Board may keep or place the ward in a home
under s 11 of the Act.  That was not the situation
in this case.  The Board may
discharge its obligations in different ways  In the circumstances of this case
where there was placement
at Bomaderry and Lutanda I thus have some
reservations as to whether it can be said that there was necessarily a
non-delegable duty
created and remaining on foot for all purposes and in all
circumstances.  Further, in terms, the special relationship cases do not
seem
to apply to that of parent or child, or between a person in loco parentis and a
child ward (or at least for all purposes) or
a body adopting the role of a
parent or guardian in relation to the child.  The non-delegable duty cases
arise from special relationships
arising in particular situations such as
hospital and patient, school and pupil, employer and employee and in the
further category
found by Toohey and McHugh JJ in  <b><u>Harris</u></b>.  They
have not as I have observed, extended to a child-parent relationship situation,
or to one such as the present.  It has not
been affirmatively held that a
parent-child category is to be assimilated to traditional categories of special
relationships giving
rise to non-delegable duties, although the groups are not
fixed:  <b><u>Harris</u></b> per McHugh J.
<P>

827   	It is not necessary finally to determine whether there
was a non-delegable duty of care in the circumstances because of my
view about
there being an absence of duty and further or alternatively, in any event
absence of breach of any duty.  However, despite
my reservations I am prepared
to assume that there is a non-delegable duty of care for the purposes of, in
the alternative, a consideration
of breach of duty.
<P>

828   	I have made certain findings in respect of the state of
knowledge in respect of the ten year period 1942-1952.  On one view
it might be
considered that those findings are particularly relevant to the matter of the
existence or otherwise of a duty of care
in respect of the period 1942-1952 so
far as perhaps denying the existence of the element of foreseeability of injury
in respect
of that period.  The matter has not in terms been so formulated by
the defendant.  The proposition advanced by the defendants is
that, not only do
the facts not support any such claim, but that there has to be a foreseeable
risk of injury.
<P>

829   	Were it necessary to determine the matter consistent with
my earlier finding in respect of "state of knowledge" in the period
1942-1952 I
would be disposed to the view that there was, for this further reason, no duty
of care in that period.  A finding of
no duty in respect of that period would
have consequences in terms of also considering issues of breach and causation
as well, as,
perhaps damages, if there was an entitlement to recover such.
<P>

830   	That said, in this case, the state of knowledge (or its
absence) argument appears to be capable of being treated as particularly
relevant to the matter of breach of duty (if a duty exists) and on the issue of
reasonable care.  In  <b><u>Maloney</u></b>  supra Barwick CJ particularly made
the point that "retrospect, increased knowledge or experience embraced in
hindsight has no role
to play in determining what is reasonable".  Accordingly,
in this case it seems to me that my finding as to state of knowledge in
the
period 1942 to 1951, should rather be taken into account on the issue of breach
of duty as opposed to existence of a duty as
such.  In saying this I do not
misunderstand the argument that if there is no duty to take the relevant care
because of lack of relevant
and reasonable knowledge, then it is difficult to
conceive how there can be a breach.  Nevertheless, that said, it seems to me
that
at the end of the day treating the absence of knowledge (in part) as being
particularly relevant to breach in practical terms achieves
a similar
result.
<P>

831   	The plaintiff's case is essentially of negligence by
omission.  Under the Act the statutory duties are stated in general
"permissive" terms, or in terms of duties.  The scope of the duty of care there
is (if one) imposed by the common law will be that
of reasonable care.  The
projected scope of the duty must be tested not by hindsight but by foresight.
In defining the measure of
the duty of care a court is not only determining an
element essential to the ascertainment of the rights of the parties, it is
giving
effect to the standards which persons or bodies must reach and possibly
even insure against:  see  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  per Kirby J at 479 applying
<b><u>Cekan  v  Haines</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 296.</a>
<P>

832   	What constitutes reasonable care is an objective and
impersonal test.  It is the "standard of the reasonable man" per Fullagher
J in
<b><u>Anderson's</u></b>  case supra cited in  <b><u>Cook  v  Cook</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%20376" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 376</a> at 382.  What is a reasonable standard of care will be
influenced by differing community standards depending upon when the events
took
place.  In this case I am concerned, and so much is accepted by the parties
with standards of the 1940's and 1950's.  A duty
to act reasonably is not that
of an insurer.  What is reasonable must be judged in the light of all the
circumstances.  Under the
law, the gravity of the injury that might be
sustained, the likelihood of such an injury occurring and the difficulty and
cost of
averting the danger will loom large.  These matters bear upon what the
reasonable response of the defendants may be to the fact that
the injury is
reasonably foreseeable.  Whilst there are a number of factors that go towards
judging what reasonable care on the part
of particular defendants required, in
the end what is reasonable is a question of fact (for the jury or judge) to be
judged in all
the circumstances of the case.
<P>

833   	The point as to reasonable care is made by Barwick CJ in
<b><u>Maloney  v  Commissioner for Railways</u></b>  supra to which some
reference has already been made:
<P>

"It is, in my opinion, proper to remark at the outset that the respondent's
duty was to take reasonable care for the safety of his
passengers.  It is easy
to overlook the all important emphasis upon the word "reasonable" in the
statement of the duty.  Perfection
or the use of increased knowledge or
experience embraced in hindsight after the event should form no part of the
components of what
is reasonable in all the circumstances.  That matter must be
judged in prospect and not in retrospect.  The likelihood of the incapacitating
occurrence, the likely extent of the injuries which the occurrence may cause,
the nature and extent of the burden of providing a
safeguard against the
occurrence and the practicability of the specific safeguard which would do so
are all indispensable considerations
in determining what ought reasonably to be
done.  Of all these elements, evidence is essential except to the extent that
they or
some of them are within the common knowledge of the ordinary man.  The
fertile but unqualified imagination of counsel or judge can
never be a
substitute for such evidence."
<P>

834   	It is to be remembered that events "long in the past were
once in the future".  These events took place in the 1940's-1950's.
 The
happening of the "accident" fixes the relevant time for the examination of the
requirements necessary to satisfy the ("employer's")
duty of care:
<b><u>Quigley  v  The Commonwealth</u></b>  supra.
<P>

835   	In  <b><u>Maloney</u></b>, Jacobs J noted on the
circumstances of that case, the absence of any evidence as to the extent of the
burden which provision of
sliding doors would place on the defendant and of the
practicability of installing them in all the circumstances including the
maintenance
of a railway service.  His Honour also referred to the need to
measure the degree of risk against the standard of care expected of
the
Commissioner to eliminate or minimise that risk.  There was no such evidence.
No attempt was made to prove how frequently persons
fell from moving trains.
As his Honour observed the case for the appellant assumed that the degree of
risk was not immaterial, proceeding
on the basis that because there was a risk
there was a duty to take positive steps to eliminate it.  In some ways this has
been the
approach adopted in the instant case by the plaintiff.
<P>

836   	In the present case when it comes to measuring the
standard of care of the AWB, it is appropriate to observe that no attempt
was
made by evidence to prove how frequently if at all, babies more or less on
birth, voluntarily given up by their mothers and placed
initially in Bomaderry
and then transferred to a such as Lutanda, or even to a Board Home under s 11
of the Act, or placed in a charitable
depot or home under s 11(2) of the Act,
or even as a fostered boarder in the care of a foster parent under s 11(3) (or
any of these
combinations) had ever developed an alleged disorder of attachment
or alleged Borderline Personality Disorder or otherwise at any
time, or at all.
No evidence was led as to the number of children from Lutanda (if any) who had
developed either or both disorders
or other disorders.  Former children whose
evidence I accept, were called.  They gave evidence of good care and of
proceeding through
life in a normal way (without any mental or psychiatric
disorders).  What evidence was adduced would suggest that no Lutanda child
in
its many years of operation (apart from the plaintiff's allegations) had
developed either or both disorders or any psychiatric
disorder.  On the
evidence Lutanda had been operating for many years as a children's place of
care under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>  since 1930.  Both in respect
of Lutanda, and in respect of the Home at Bomaderry, which was also in
existence in the 1930's, no
evidence of any child suffering from any disorder
or either of the disorders alleged by the plaintiff was lead by the plaintiff.
The weight to be given to an "accident free history" involves a question of
fact to be determined in the light of all the circumstances.
 In this case I
give it considerable weight:  <b><u>Bankstown Foundry Pty Ltd  v
Braistina</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 301</a> at 309.
<P>

837   	My findings of fact, my reasons generally negative any
breach of duty.  Further, what has not been addressed by the plaintiff
is the
cost that would have been incurred in the measures necessary to prevent all
equivalent accidents of like kind and risk:  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  per Kirby J
at 481.  Similarly, I have also discussed the evidence in terms of the
elimination of the alleged risk relied upon by
the plaintiff and, in effect the
lack of availability in terms of reasonableness or even practicability, of such
means for completely
eliminating the risk (even in a case involving a natural
mother).
<P>

838   	It is appropriate to consider the test for ascertaining
whether a breach of duty of care of the defined scope has occurred.
 In
<b><u>Wyong Shire Council  v  Shirt</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20146%20CLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 146 CLR 40</a> Mason J at 47-48
stated the relevant test.  His Honour said (at 47-48):
<P>

"In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal
of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable
man in the defendant's
position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the
plaintiff or to a class of
persons including the plaintiff.  If the answer be
in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a
reasonable
man would do by way of response to the risk.  The perception of the
reasonable man's response calls for a consideration of the magnitude
of the
risk and the degree of probability of its occurrence, along with the expense,
difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating
action and any other
conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have.  It is only when
these matters are balanced out that
the tribunal of fact can confidently assert
what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in
the defendant's
position.
<P>

The considerations to which I have referred indicate that a risk of injury
which is remote in the sense that it is extremely unlikely
to occur may
nevertheless constitute a foreseeable risk.  A risk which is not far-fetched or
fanciful is real and therefore foreseeable.
 But, as we have seen, the
existence of a foreseeable risk of injury does not in itself dispose of the
question of breach of duty.
 Magnitude of the risk and its degree of
probability remain to be considered with other relevant factors."
<P>

839   	In  <b><u>Public Trustee  v  The Commonwealth of
Australia</u></b>  supra, Mahoney JA said:
<P>

"However, in a practical sense, when a claim for damages comes before a court
for determination, the court knows - it will be identified
in the plaintiff's
claim and established by evidence - the act or default which is said to
constitute the breach.  In such a case,
the court looks back to that act or
default and must decide whether that act or default was a breach of duty
because a reasonable
man: in truth, the court: see Davis Contractors Ltd  v
Fareham Urban District Council  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20AC%20696" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] AC 696</a> at 728 per Lord Radcliffe;  would
not have done it.  See generally  Phillis  v  Daly   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 15 NSWLR 65</a> at 72,
76-7.  Accordingly, in the ordinary case coming before the court, what the
court must, in a practical sense, decide is:  whether
the defendant did what he
is said to have done:  and (if he did) whether that act or default is a breach
of his duty to take care."
<P>

840   	His Honour also observed a tendency in practice to equate
error with negligent error, but noting the distinction between
the two.  In the
instant case I have found no error or even negligent error on the part of the
Board.
<P>

841   	In  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  Kirby J said (at 480):
<P>

"Insufficient attention has been paid in some cases ... to the practical
considerations which must be balanced out before a breach
of the duty of care
may be found.  It is here, in my view, that courts have the authority and
responsibility to introduce practical
and sensible notions of reasonableness (I
would add whatever may be the views of experts and others) that will put a
brake on the
more extreme and unrealistic claims ....  It is quite wrong to
read past authority as requiring that any foreseeable risk of injury
however
remote must be guarded against ...."
<P>

842   	This passage perhaps also reflects the views in
<b><u>Maloney</u></b>  supra.
<P>

843   	As to the subject of the expense of the taking of
alleviating action, it has also been increasingly recognised that courts
should
bear in mind as one factor that resources available for the "public service"
are limited and allocation of resources is a
matter for bodies accorded that
function by law: see  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>  per Kirby J.
<P>

844   	Under s 7(1)(a) of the Act the matter of general use of
moneys voted by Parliament, and other funds and how such are to be
disbursed is
a matter stated in terms of duty.  Section 5 also deals with appointment of
staff to administer the Act for the benefit
of all persons covered by it and
not merely children.
<P>

845   	For all these reasons, if there be a duty of care, no
breach of duty has been established.
<P>

<b><u>Causation:</u></b>
<P>

846   	It is necessary to consider the issue of causation in the
event that I am wrong in my conclusion that there is no duty of
care and no
breach of duty of care.  Having regard to what I have said, and propose to say
the plaintiff fails on the issue of causation
as well, no claimed Borderline
Personality Disorder or any other psychiatric disorder. injury, harm or damage
was caused by any default
or negligence of the AWB.
<P>

847   	Causation is a question for the tribunal of fact to
determine, applying common sense to the facts of the particular case:
see
<b><u>March  v  E. M Stramare Pty Ltd</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506</a>;
<b><u>Bennett  v  Minister for Community Welfare</u></b>  supra;  <b><u>Chappel
v  Hart</u></b>  (1998) 72 ALJR  1344;  <b><u>Romeo  v  Conservation
Commission</u></b>  supra.  In reaching their decision as well in the matter of
causation, a trial judge must have regard to all the facts, to all the
circumstances, to all of the evidence and not merely to the views of the
experts.  In a case such as the present where the plaintiff
is claiming damages
for negligence occasioning personal injury, causation is in effect proved by
adopting a hypothesis that the injury
would not have been suffered by the
plaintiff without the negligence of the defendant.  In  <b><u>Romeo</u></b>
Kirby J said (at 482):
<P>

"Where a breach of duty has been shown it is still necessary for the plaintiff
to prove on the balance of probabilities that such
a breach caused or
materially contributed to the damages.  The plaintiff must show that if the
defendant had fulfilled its duty as
defined, doing so would have resulted in
the avoidance of the damage and loss to the plaintiff.  The question is
hypothetical."
<P>

848   	As Kirby J also noted it is easy to be wise after the
event and to conceive of precaution that could have been taken.  The
common
sense answers will differ according to the purpose for which the question is
asked.  Thus commonsense answers to questions
of causation will often arise for
the purposes of attributing responsibility to someone to make the guilty of an
offence to blame
them for something that has happened, or to make them liable
in damages:  cf  <b><u>Environment Agency  v  Empress Car Co</u></b>  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20WLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2
WLR 350</a> (per Lord Hoffman), a decision also applied in  <b><u>Chappel  v
Hart</u></b>  supra.  Causation in equity for breach of a fiduciary obligation
involves a different test:  see  <b><u>O'Halloran</u></b>  supra.
<P>

849   	In seeking the cause of any event the purposes of the
law, both civil and criminal, is to attribute legal responsibility
to some
person.  The question of causation for the tribunal of fact is not a
philosophical or scientific question, but a question
to be determined by the
tribunal of fact applying its commonsense to the facts as it finds them.
<P>

850   	In  <b><u>Prince's</u></b> case, the majority of the New
Zealand Court of Appeal observed (at 277):
<P>

"<u>Causation</u> including weighing the respective inferences of nurture and
nature in shaping the child and affecting his or her life's prospects
and
qualification of loss are likely to be <u>speculative</u>, if indeed
<u>justiciable</u>."  [my emphasis].
<P>

851   	The same issues arise in the present case.  In my view,
my decision in the instant case confirms the correctness of this
view and the
difficulty associated with questions of causation in cases such as the
present.
<P>

852   	On the issue of causation, where the damage has resulted
from a negligent failure to act, or an omission in a general sense,
there may
be greater difficulty in proving causation:  see  <b><u>March</u></b>  supra
per Mason CJ at 514.  It is often difficult to demonstrate what would have
happened in the absence of alleged negligent conduct
on the part of the
defendant, causation being a question of fact for the court, is an issue the
court alone has to address.  Further
as a general rule a failure to act is not
negligent unless there is a duty to act:  <b><u>Heyman's</u></b>  case per
Gibbs CJ.
<P>

853   	In  <b><u>St George Club  v  Hines</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2035%20ALJR%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 35
ALJR 106</a> at 107 it was said:
<P>

"In an action of law a plaintiff does not prove his/her case by showing that it
was possible that his injury was caused by the defendant's
<u>default</u>
("breach of duty") ... nor does proof of default followed by injury show that
the defendant caused the injury as Viscount Simonds
said in  Quin  v  Cameron
&amp; Roberton Ltd   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%20AC%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] AC 9</a> (at 23), post hoc ergo propter hoc is a fallacy
in respect of breach of a statutory regulation as it is in respect of any other
event
in life."
<P>

854   	Further, if the harm would have occurred notwithstanding
the failure to perform the alleged duty then the alleged omission
or failure is
not the cause of the damage; cf  <b><u>Quigley</u></b> supra;
<b><u>Duyvelshaff  v  Cathcart &amp; Ritchie Limited</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2047%20ALJR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 47 ALJR
410.</a>  In that situation the necessary causative link between omission or
failure to act and harm is not established.
<P>

855   	In the instant case the plaintiff alleges that the
necessary chain of causation can be traced back to the conduct of the
AWB,
arising not from any single particular situation, but rather extending over the
period commencing in 1942 and ceasing in 1960.
 It is said to be founded upon a
general course of conduct by omission, with the damage developing as a result
of the cumulative
effect of essentially negligent omissions.  The Borderline
Personality Disorder is particular asserted to be due to failure in parenting
for which the defendant AWB is liable.  These submissions are rejected.
<P>

856   	In order to succeed the plaintiff's case must show
negligence, or default or breach of duty (assuming a duty of care) causing
harm.  Absent proof of default or breach of duty causing harm, her action
fails.
<P>

857   	The defendants' position in respect of the matter of
Borderline Personality Disorder appears to be essentially that it conceded
(at
T 615) that Dr Waters made a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder in
1991; that Dr Ellard stated he "did not dispute
that diagnosis made by Dr
Waters" and that "in 1996 she ceased to have or ceased to satisfy the
diagnostic criteria."  They also
submitted "nobody knows precisely what is
wrong with her now".
<P>

858   	The plaintiff asserts that there were childhood
manifestations of attachment disorder and that had these been recognised
by an
"expert", the condition would have been "reversible" and that she would not
also have developed substance abuse "disorder".
 For reasons already given I
reject that argument.
<P>

859   	I have made findings of fact in relation to the absence
of such manifestations.  I have further referred to the report of
Dr Cooley in
1960.  If contrary to my findings, any manifestations were present during the
plaintiff's childhood then failure to
recognise them at any time would at most
be error and not negligent error.
<P>

860   	Further, it is claimed the alleged disorder of attachment
and/or Borderline Personality Disorder is the product of maternal
deprivation,
because of the mother giving up the plaintiff as a baby to the Board, for
reasons no doubt valid to her.  There is merit
in the defendants' argument that
this was a "given" with which other people including those who retained their
own children had to
face.
<P>

861   	Next, if the condition was caused or contributed to by
disruption of a bond with Sister Saville (at Bomaderry) or further
or
alternatively, as a result of disruption with Miss Atkinson (at Lutanda), both
disruptions were inevitable.  Any relationship
by their nature and in the
circumstances could not be permanent let alone semi-permanent.
<P>

862   	Next causation raises itself as an issue in another way.
The plaintiff asserts that AWB officers should have attended at
Lutanda "at
least once a year" (and more frequently in earlier years and particularly so
when she was approaching the age of a teenager
or in teenage years) and that
with such attendants, different things would have happened including
involvement of the Child Guidance
Clinics.  In the light of my findings and
reasons given, this submission is rejected.  Additionally; it involves unproved
speculation.
<P>

863   	Further, the plaintiff's case that if she had been seen
by a Child Guidance Clinic a diagnosis of mental disorder would have
been made
and effective form of treatment would allegedly have been instituted and/or
successful is based inter alia on assumptions
of fact and history, which I have
rejected as well for reasons already given and the findings made.
<P>

864   	In view of the plaintiff's strong criticism, Lutanda and
its staff are entitled to have me state that no criticism of it
or its staff
including any failure to take "proper" care is warranted or justified on the
evidence before me.  A similar observation
is made in respect of the UAM Home
at Bomaderry.  Although neither are sued, each is entitled to have its good
name and reputation,
in a difficult situation involving the upbringing of a
child in an institution, preserved.  The Board if it had a duty to take
reasonable
care, discharged its duty.  No default on its part caused "harm".
No negligent omission or acts on its part caused the plaintiff's
alleged
psychiatric disorder or any injury, harm or damage.  Even if there be a duty of
care, and/or breach, causation is thus not
proved or established.
<P>

865   	For all these reasons, even assuming a duty, and a breach
of duty, the plaintiff's case on causation also fails.
<P>

<b>The Result</b>
<P>

866   	The plaintiff's case on liability fails.  There should be
a verdict and judgment for the defendants.
<P>

<b><u>Damages:</u></b>
<P>

867   	At the trial I indicated that even were I to conclude
that the plaintiff should not succeed, I would endeavour to assess
damages.
Such assessment involves not merely very real speculation, but also
consideration of many imponderables.
<P>

868   	I have, despite my views on all aspects of liability,
despite my findings of fact made in respect of liability and on liability
evidence, and despite my view that any assessment is highly speculative,
nevertheless sought to perform a contingent assessment,
in case I am in error
in any of these views.  I do so only upon a hypothesis (and not otherwise) that
I am in error in finding no
duty, no breach, no causation and that the claim is
not too speculative.
<P>

869   	Thus, what I have written on the subject of damages, must
not be understood or read, as suggesting any inconsistency with
any of my
findings of fact on the issue of the liability, or suggesting error in respect
of my findings of fact on the issue of liability.
 Next, my assessment of
damages involves hypothesising and making assumptions, inconsistent with what I
have found on the liability
issue.  The assessment too, and on the further
assumption that any assessment is not highly speculative.  What I have said is
said
so as to avoid any misinterpretation of my reasons for performing any
assessment exercise.
<P>

870   	I have not been confronted with an assessment task of
this nature before.  It involves a somewhat novel claim for damages,
extending
back in some respects on the plaintiff's claim to the commencement of her life
in 1942 and continuing thereafter, and still
continuing into the future.  The
task of performing any "contingent" assessment at all, because of the issues,
is a formidable, indeed
extremely difficult one.
<P>

871   	Next, any assessment in this case as I have indicated, is
really largely speculative and provides some practical confirmation
for what
the majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal said in  <b><u>Prince</u></b>
at 277:
<P>

"Causation, including weighing the respective influences of nurture and nature
in shaping the child and affecting his or her life's
prospects and
<u>quantification of any loss are likely to be highly speculative if indeed
justiciable</u>."  [my emphasis]
<P>

872   	The nature of the claim, its size and its magnitude are
reflected in the following passages with Ms Adamson for the plaintiff
(at T
757):
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>		The plaintiff's case is I got a borderline personality
disorder and everything that has occurred to me ranging from substance abuse,
to Methedrine, getting caught up with Roslyn Norton's cult in Kings Cross, all
the bad people I met, prostitution, illegitimacy,
everything that has occurred
in her life is related to that and if she had never developed that borderline
personality disorder life
would have been different, she would have been a
totally different person.  She would have been a normal person who would have
achieved
the potential she achieved later on in life.  To quote Ms Adamson's
words the other day, she would have found her prince and life
would have been
different.  That is the proposition, I think I have fairly put it.
<P>

<b>ADAMSON:</b>	You have your Honour."
<P>

873   	Even had liability been established the plaintiff's case
in these terms is rejected.  It involves a speculative proposition.
 Indeed,
one may go further and suggest that it is not merely a proposition that is
essentially speculative in terms of the evidence,
but one which is likely in
terms of human experience to be also considered as speculative.  Be that as it
may, it is also a proposition
that does not reflect the uncertainties of life
itself or matters of chance and possibilities of the type discussed in
<b><u>Malec  v  J. C. Hutton Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638.</a>  Next,
the proposition as formulated in no way reflects even questions of loss or
opportunity.  The "ifs" of the plaintiff's life
also involve many
imponderables.
<P>

874   	Next, on the issue of damages as well, the opinions and
views of experts are to be considered in the same way as their views
on
liability.  Their views may or may not be helpful, or may be undermined by
inadequacy of facts to support them.  Their views may
also be based upon
speculation, the individual expert's own inference of fact, and personal views
of the credibility of the plaintiff.
 Their opinions may even go beyond what
may legitimately be said to be their expert opinion: see  <b><u>HG</u></b>;
<b><u>Ahmedi</u></b>;  <b><u>Public Trustee  v  The Commonwealth</u></b>.
<P>

875   	Causation in damages involves issues of fact for the
court to determine.  They are not merely issues for the "experts" and
involve
matters for close consideration, analysis and decision by the court.
<P>

876   	I have already indicated my inability to accept the
experts' views on liability, and some of those reasons for so concluding
apply
as well, to the matter of "contingent" damages.
<P>

877   	The plaintiff's proposition as referred to, namely that
without negligence she would have been a "totally different person",
is not one
I accept.  There is no warrant for concluding she would have been a different
person or gone through life differently,
or that life's experiences would, even
in terms of chance or opportunity, have been significantly different.
<P>

878   	In any event the proposition ignores perhaps the very
issue namely, assuming that a Borderline Personality Disorder and/or
some other
psychiatric disorder was caused by default of the AWB, of what was its
consequences for the plaintiff in terms of harm,
loss and damage.
<P>

879   	The matter of speculation as to damages is further
emphasised because of a difficulty in determining for compensation purposes,
a
commencement date for assessment and the extent to which, if at all, harm arose
before 1951, and thus may have occurred even at
different times.
<P>

880   	That said, I turn to the hypothetical or contingent
assessment issues.
<P>

881   	At common law a plaintiff who has been injured by the
negligence of the defendant should be awarded such sum of money as
will, as
nearly as possible, put them in the same position as if they had not sustained
the injuries:  <b><u>Todorovic  v  Waller</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20150%20CLR%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 150 CLR 402</a> at 412.
In a case based on negligence it is necessary to consider what damage the
injured party has sustained due to negligence.
<P>

882   	In  <b><u>Target Holdings Ltd</u></b>  supra, Lord Browne
Wilkinson said (at 432):
<P>

"At common law there are two principles fundamental to the awards of damages.
First, that the defendant's wrongful act must cause
the damage complained of.
Second, that the plaintiff is to be put in the same position as he would have
been in if he had not sustained
the wrong for which he is now getting his
compensation or reparation.  ... Under both systems (equity as in common law)
liability
is fault-based: the defendant is only liable for the consequences of
the legal wrong done.  He is not responsible for damage not
caused by his wrong
...".
<P>

883   	In the instant case the matter of any assessment is
further complicated by the fact that the Borderline Personality condition
is
not said to be the product of a particular episode or identifiable event
occurring at a particular time in the period 1942 to
1960 whilst the plaintiff
was under the Board's control.  The situation is quite unlike that of a single
identifiable event, followed
by injury, whether physical and psychological, or
by even psychological or psychiatric injury alone.  Here the plaintiff in one
sense
is asserting negligent conduct by neglect (omission) during her
upbringing over a long period of time (1942 to 1960) with perhaps,
further or
alternatively a cumulative effect said to have been capable of being remedied
or reversible at different ages by remedial
actions.  The complication may be
particularly illustrated by the evidence of Dr Lal.  On the matter of cause, Dr
Lal rather suggested
that a "contributory factor" to the ultimately diagnosed
Borderline Personality Disorder (or its equivalent in nomenclature) back
in
1962, was the "contribution" made by each separation.  In this case there was
the transfer by the mother of the child to the Board's
control.  Next there was
a further transfer after a period of four and a half years at Bomaderry which
broke the relationship or
attachment and bonding or interaction with Sister
Saville.  There was a further interruption again to the plaintiff's
relationship
with Miss Atkinson at Lutanda when Miss Atkinson retired.  As I
understand Dr Lal's evidence these transfers and interruptions were
also
capable of contributing to a Borderline Personality Disorder.  On the
plaintiff's own case it is said that these interruptions
or any of them are
said to be attributable to any negligence or lack of good faith on the part of
the defendant AWB.
<P>

884   	An issue perhaps also arises as to whether an assessment
may rather involve, in part, damages for an increased effect on
a condition
arising from an alleged default: cf  <b><u>State Rail Authority of New South
Wales  v  Howell</u></b>  (NSWCA 19 December 1996, unreported).  Another
complication arises from the fact that the plaintiff according to Dr Waters, as
at
1997. no longer suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder.  He
considered she had shed the criteria according to DSM-IVTM but
that as at
March/April 1999 a "new" condition of psychosis had arrived, not hitherto seen
in the "already complex psychiatric history".
 There can be little doubt of the
complexity of the plaintiff's psychiatric history, a matter giving rise to
further problems in
any "contingent" assessment.
<P>

885   	In this difficult case, if damages are to be awarded,
they should at most be confined to a period 1962 to 1997 and not otherwise.
Any assessment is complicated further because the plaintiff has formulated the
claim without real discrimination in terms of the
various causes of the
plaintiff's ill health.  All are the subject of claim.
<P>

886   	The contingent assessment involves difficult causation
issues, even putting to one side an issue of foreseeability:  see
<b><u>Kavanagh  v  Akhtar</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/779.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 779</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 588.</a>  The test of reasonable
foresight is not in itself a test of causation.  It marks the limits beyond
which a wrong doer will not be
held responsible for damages responsible from
his/her wrongful act.  In  <b><u>State Rail Authority of New South Wales  v
Wiegold</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 500</a> Samuels JA (at 517) discussed the test of
reasonable foreseeability as a test for remoteness of damage: see also
<b><u>Mount Isa Mines Ltd  v  Pusey</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20125%20CLR%20383" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 125 CLR 383.</a>
<P>

887   	Further, the plaintiff's case as put, is that she has no
"real responsibility" for any of the matters the subject of the
claim for
damages including alcoholism, drug addiction, criminal offences, (and other
matters) and that someone else is to blame
for these, in this case, the
defendants.  Ms Adamson, submitted that what the defendants' breach of duty had
caused was, in effect
to convert the plaintiff "from something she would not
have been into a person totally different who would not have been confronted
with life's problems".  She said at 620:
<P>

"[Exactly], for example she may have married and had three children but the
first would not have been conceived in the course of
prostitution.  The second
would not have been conceived from sexual encounters at the Fraser Hospital,
North Ryde".
<P>

888   	This submission, which should be rejected.  It also
further highlights the difficulties in the path of the plaintiff's case
on
damages.  This last submission raises not only issues of causation (and
remoteness), but perhaps as well aspects of policy of
the type for example,
envisaged in  <b><u>CES &amp; Anor  v  Superclinics</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR 47</a>
(a case concerning loss of chance and whether public policy precluded the
recovery of damages).  In that case there were significant
hypothetical
situations to be considered as well.
<P>

889   	It is also convenient to refer to Mr Hutley's submissions
(at T 601-605) where he argued the plaintiff had received none
of life's
benefits.  This he said included her free University education and welfare
support in the 1980'-1990's, her marriage, and
her three children.  He
submitted that the plaintiff was in effect to be compensated for all "life's
detriments" without identifying
them, or discriminating between them.  It was
in effect, enough to merely prove a Borderline Personality Disorder and on its
proof
the defendants become liable in the way submitted.  The following
exchange took place (at 602-603):
<P>

"<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	...  I want to find out the ambit of your claim.  You say
the ambit of this claim is that the defendant is responsible for every
detriment that has occurred to this [plaintiff] in the course of her life.
<P>

<b>HUTLEY:</b>	Subject to that, life's detriments, that she would have had
other than detriments of any child and there can be risks of that and
this".
<P>

890   	These excluded detriments I should note were not
identified.  The "that and this" was also not identified.
<P>

891   	Mr Hutley submitted at the same page, that the plaintiff
should be compensated, for example, because at one stage she became
a
prostitute, because she became a drug addict, and an alcoholic, as well as
because of her attempts to commit suicide, her admissions
to hospital in
1962-1965, and her sexual interests.  The AWB, he alleged, created "her tragic
life" and the Board should pay for
all of the "incidents" of tragedy.  I reject
these submissions in terms so argued.  Putting to one side the matter of
admissions
to Hospital, I do not accept in terms of causation (assuming
negligence to have been found) that on the evidence, such matters have
been
proved to have been caused by the defendants' alleged default (and there was no
default).  I would here observe that even if
her life had been "different" she
would still have been exposed to life's problems and misfortunes.  Indeed, it
has not been proved
to my satisfaction that her life would have been different.
It is highly speculative to suggest otherwise.  It is essentially speculative
to even really suggest that even some of life's experiences or happenings would
not have occurred if she had been a "different person".
 Next, in respect of
her one marriage to Mr "K", whilst it is not suggested that the act of marriage
was to be "attributed" to the
defendants, because during the marriage the
plaintiff had a Borderline Personality Disorder, the "tragic situation" it was
submitted
was "likely to contribute to a mistaken relationship".  Mr Hutley
accepted (perhaps not surprisingly) that no one "could tell" whether
falling
pregnant was a consequence of the Borderline Personality Disorder (T 605).  I
find it was not.  I find it was not caused
by it.  The plaintiff on this
matter, as on very many matters has not proved the defendants should be held in
some way responsible
in damages, even had liability been established.
<P>

892   	The plaintiff in effect submits that as a consequence of
her Borderline Personality Disorder, many of the her "problems",
indeed if not
all, are causatively related to her disorder and therefore compensable. This
proposition if advanced in such terms,
is one that I do not accept in terms of
causation.
<P>

893   	The plaintiff claims that the diagnosis of Borderline
Personality Disorder is not in dispute back in 1962-1965.  That is
not accepted
by the defendants.  The defendants stated that the only matter it conceded is
that Dr Waters made a retrospective diagnosis
of Borderline Personality
Disorder in 1991, and that Dr Ellard said that he "did not dispute the
diagnosis made by Dr Waters", who
also had said that by 1998, the plaintiff had
ceased to satisfy the diagnostic criteria (T 615).
<P>

894   	In further submission the plaintiff's counsel stated that
it was not being suggested that she behaved as a "100 per cent
automaton".  Nor
could she be in my view merely because of the possessing of an alleged
Borderline Personality Disorder.  It would
also ignore common sense to suggest
otherwise.  The plaintiff also relies upon the various historical happenings to
prove that under
the diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder
(DSM-III or DSM-IVTM) that the plaintiff had Borderline Personality Disorder.
This in some respects, reflects some post hoc reasoning.  She submitted  there
is a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder
therefore those historical
happenings are characteristics of the disorder and without more are to be
compensated.  This proposition
I reject.  For example, the plaintiff submitted
(at T 617) that because substance abuse disorder (a description and explanation
for
drug abuse and/or alcohol abuse) is one of the "characteristics" of the
Borderline Personality Disorder, that such was occasioned
by the defendants,
and therefore it is to be compensated without further inquiry, in accordance
with principles of causation and
foreseeability of damage.  Mr Hutley (at T
810) put the case that drug addiction is an acknowledged symptom or sequelae of
this condition.
 I reject the proposition.
<P>

895   	Whilst on one view it might be thought that junior
counsel for the plaintiff was putting the case for damages on an "all
or
nothing basis", Mr Hutley ultimately accepted that a possible approach to the
assessment of damages was to evaluate the loss of
opportunity "to evaluate the
chance that life would have taken a different turn" (at T808).  This I consider
is the more correct
approach, even had the plaintiff been entitled to recover
any damages and is reflected in my hypothetical assessment.  If I be wrong
that
any assessment is also highly speculative, I would conclude in all the
circumstances that there was but a relatively small chance
of the plaintiff's
life taking "a different turn".  Mr Hutley argued (at T 809) that "our case as
pleaded is that all these things
were caused by the [Borderline Personality
Disorder]".  I reject that submission.
<P>

896   	Mr Hutley (at 810) correctly accepted and acknowledged
that children coming from the most loving devoted homes with the best
of
parents and who do not develop psychological or psychiatric conditions commit
crimes and become drug addicts "without having a
Borderline Personality
Disorder".  That said, his proposition was that one would discount damages by
reference to the chance that
drug addiction "was not associated".  In my view
drug abuse or substance abuse disorder has not been proved to have been caused
by
any default of the defendants.  He also accepted that if I was against him
in inferring that every misfortune arose from the default
of the defendants or
that where there were doubts, then one would apply  <b><u>Malec</u></b>  supra,
and that it would be open to me to assess and conclude that the "plaintiff had
a good chance of a good life".  I reject this
submission in the terms asserted.
His ultimate proposition (perhaps a change from that initially advanced by Ms
Adamson) thus appears
to accept that I can look at each "misfortune" not only
in terms of "causation", but also in the context of issues of chance raised
in
<b><u>Malec</u></b>,  and that a finding of a Borderline Personality Disorder
per se does not mean everything is to be compensated.
<P>

897   	The nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim is set
forth in the plaintiff's Actuaries Report (exhibit "L") of 17 April
1999.  The
claim is for the sum of 1.9 million to $2.5 million plus general damages.  In
addition there are claims for interest on
general damages and claims for
exemplary and aggravatory damages.  The report assumes birth on 13 September
1942 and future life
expectation of 26.4 years.  It assumes that the AWB's
negligence caused a Borderline Personality Disorder, and also a substance abuse
disorder compromising her working life earning capacity from 1960 to date.  The
report advanced by the plaintiff's Actuary, contains
the calculations of loss
made on the basis of two "scenarios":
<P>

"						<b>Scenario A</b>		<b>Scenario B</b>
<P>

Past Loss of Income			$563,081		$364,300
<P>

Interest on Past Loss of Income		$638,214		$462,256
<P>

Future Loss of Income			$366,310		$195,170
<P>

Loss of Employer Financed Super.	$66,441		$30,529
<P>

Past Care					$340,090		$340,090
<P>

Past Medication				$12,287		$12,287
<P>

Future Care					$342,061		$342,061
<P>

Future Medical Services			$20,449		$20,449
<P>

Future Medication				$7,038		$7,038
<P>

Cost of Fund Management		<u>$150,138</u>		<u>$114,559</u>
<P>

					        $2,506,109	        $1,888,739".
<P>

898   	To these heads are to be added general damages and
interest.  As I have said there is claimed exemplary and aggravatory damages.
On any view the claim as formulated is for very significant and large damages
to be awarded.
<P>

899   	It is important to remember that a further question was
later raised for consideration of the Actuary in a Fax from the plaintiff's
solicitors.  In a further report of 19 April 1999 the Actuaries reported that
assuming Ms Williams' life expectancy was reduced by
five to ten years the
figures for Scenario A and B would need to be adjusted as follows:
<P>

"						<b>Scenario A		Scenario B</b>
<P>

Future Care					$295,978		$242,556
<P>

Future Medical Services			$19,264		$17,890
<P>

Future Medication				$6,090		$4,991
<P>

Cost of Fund Management		$130,628		$82,514".
<P>

900   	The plaintiff's two scenarios referred to, reflect
different potential levels of income.  Scenario A assumes a promotional
path
from August 1960 to 31 July 1974 as a Nurse's Aide;  from August 1964 to 3
November 1985 as a Registered Nurse;  Generals from
4 November 1985 to 12
September 1992 as a Nurse Educator (with Diploma) under Public Hospital Nurses'
State Award and since 13 September
1982 as a Co-ordinator, Aboriginal Health
Service and caring to age of 65.  Scenario B assumes earnings of average weekly
earnings
for a female in accordance with Bureau of Statistics figures.
<P>

901   	Next, in respect of earnings, an assumption is made that
the plaintiff would have taken two years leave from the workforce
commencing
three months prior to birth of each of three children who were born on 4
September 1963;  13 June 1967 and 7 August 1973
respectively.
<P>

902   	In an actuarial report 30 April 1999 (exhibit 11)
tendered on behalf of the defendant, Mr McLeay, Chartered Accountant challenged
the plaintiff's actuarial report.  He said that the potential earnings were
overstated, there were incorrect calculations of the
applicable marginal
taxation.  No consideration had been given for absences of work.  The
calculation of superannuation was wrong.
 No allowance had been made for
repayment of social security.  He commented that the plaintiff rarely stayed at
a place of employment
for any long period.  He noted the plaintiff's first
child was born in 1963, that the plaintiff never completed nursing training
and
worked as a nurse's aide intermittently.  Later two other children were born.
He also rejected the two scenarios advanced in
the plaintiff's actuarial
report.  He also noted that the plaintiff had received extensive social service
payments throughout most
of her life including Abstudy benefits (which appears
to be factually correct).  No allowance had been made for academic courses
undertaken or whether she would have undertaken courses to be a nurse.
Calculations under scenario B assumed full time employment
but overlooked
demands of motherhood in the 1960s and 1970s availability for the workforce.
Indeed, his conclusion was that it would
be extremely difficult for any expert
to state with reasonable certainty the potential earnings for the plaintiff
from 1960 to date.
 As to this matter I would here observe that I agree,
despite Dr Waters, the plaintiff's expert psychiatrist, attempting to do so
in
a report prepared just prior to trial and tendered in the plaintiff's case.
Apart from Dr Waters lack of qualifications to express
views on economic
matters, "retrospectively" to 1960 (although he did not see the plaintiff until
1991) or otherwise, the evidence
does not support Dr Waters' attempt to do so.
I regard Dr Waters' views as being unqualified and unhelpful on this point as
well:
see  <b><u>HG</u></b>.
<P>

903   	I would add that in my view merely to have the Borderline
Personality Disorder without proof of more, does not prove incapacity
or its
measure in the past or at all.
<P>

904   	There are claims, inter alia, for loss of earnings.
Interest on loss of income is also claimed prior to 1 July 1972 at a
rate of 5%
and since 1 July 1972 at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

905   	In respect of past value of care, the claim is made on a
commercial rate basis, for a partial period.  The current commercial
rate is
$17 per hour.  Past care is claimed on the basis of three hours per day, five
days a week apart from periods of hospitalisation
from 25 March 1962 to 31
December 1984, six hours per week from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1997; and from
1 July 1997 at four hours
per day five days a week apart from periods of
hospitalisation.  The claim for past care is again "retrospectively" supported
in
terms by Dr Waters, (in a recent report prepared in 1999).  Apart from the
fact that there is a paucity of evidence of actual care
being provided during
past periods, claims for care were still made on the basis of Dr Waters'
report.  On the matter of care generally,
I also find Dr Waters' views
unhelpful.  The matter of care, or its reasonableness, cannot be merely
resolved by expert medical witnesses
(none of whom in fact treated the
plaintiff) but are matters too, calling for close scrutiny and decision by the
Court.
<P>

906   	Future care is calculated on the basis of four hours per
day five days per week from 19 April 1999 at $17 per hour for 26.4
years.
<P>

907   	As regards the cost of medication this is calculated upon
the basis of a monthly visit to a general practitioner for the
remainder of her
life at $40 per visit, forty counselling sessions over the next two years at
$150 per session.  For past medication
from 1963 to date including Mogadon,
Fortral,  and Rohypnol, a claim is made together with a claim for interest.
Proof of need (due
to default causing injury), causation, of reasonableness, of
actual expenditure or liability to pay in the past, has by no means
been
established.  Relevant proof is somewhat vague.
<P>

908   	Fund management costs are claimed on the basis of either
scenario A or scenario B supra.
<P>

909   	If the plaintiff's case is accepted on negligence and
breach, (and it has been rejected) then the damage on the plaintiff's
case
first occurred between 1942 and 1960.  The plaintiff's case is that childhood
manifestations of an attachment disorder manifest
themselves before the age of
five or six (in this case I find they did not).  That said, the Borderline
Personality Disorder it is
claimed cannot be diagnosed before the age of
eighteen (T 749).  I have found that it was not present in 1960 as suggested by
Dr
Waters (ie it would have been present by "adolescence").  I have already
found neither it or any other psychiatric disorder was present
(nor had
manifested itself in or prior to 1960).
<P>

910   	The matter is further complicated by not merely "a
complex psychiatric history", with suggested "recovery" from the alleged
borderline personality disorder in 1996-1997 (albeit since then her health has
deteriorated) but also the fact that since March of
this year the plaintiff has
been suffering from a new psychiatric condition described essentially as one of
"psychotic reaction",
a "new condition" not previously seen in the plaintiff
over her already "complex psychiatric history" (Dr Waters 8 April 1999). 
Dr
Waters (at T 125) accepted the possibility of genetic predisposition to
psychosis.  It is not suggested that such a psychosis
in terms is an incident
of the Borderline Personality Disorder, which had ceased to meet the DSM-IVTM
criteria according to Dr Waters
in 1997, or thereabouts.  In his report of that
date Dr Waters said:
<P>

"She manifests a psychotic reaction, principally to the stress of the upcoming
court case, but contributory factors include substantial
recent weight loss and
possibly also cannabis use".
<P>

911   	The cause of the very substantial weight loss and its
consequences have not been the subject of acceptable medical evidence
in terms
of explanation or cause.  The cannabis use I do not accept as being caused by
any alleged negligence of the defendants or
further that the plaintiff has
discharged the onus in showing it was.  Further, the subject of alcoholism (and
its cause and consequences)
raises another matter.  The plaintiff is a
recovered alcoholic.  Her mother was an alcoholic and a very heavy user of
alcohol during
most of her life.  Dr Waters when asked whether alcoholism could
be part hereditary said (at T 124) that this was a controversial
subject, and
that there "is evidence" that there is an inherited component to alcoholism but
in a fairly complex way.  In 1989 there
was a diagnosis of the plaintiff's
mother by a psychiatrist, the diagnosis being of schizophrenia and probable
alcoholic hallucinosis
(a psychosis-biological condition).  I conclude, indeed,
I find on the evidence, that the plaintiff's own alcoholism particularly
during
a ten year child rearing period was not caused by any default (even if found)
of the defendants.  It is not responsible to
pay damages for it.  Nor has the
plaintiff discharged the onus in establishing that it was.
<P>

912   	In report dealing with whether proceedings should be
heard (as they were, and there was no application for an adjournment),
Dr
Waters considered that the plaintiff "remained extremely vulnerable to further
breakdowns whenever the case is heard such are
the pressures which it induces
in her".  In his report of 20 April 1999, Dr Waters referred to the plaintiff's
condition as "being
in a state of active psychosis associated with paranoid
ideation".  As I understand the evidence a psychosis is different to a
personality
disorder.
<P>

913   	The case has been heard, presumably the stress of "the
upcoming court case" no longer exists as a factor.  That said, the
unresolved
question of the substantial weight loss remains.  There are also the
significant physical factors present complicating
the case as well.
<P>

914   	The report from the Illawarra Aboriginal Medical Service
("the IAMS") reveals that the plaintiff had attended the IAMS since
October
1986.  She had a history of hysterectomy, migraine, drug abuse, psychiatric
illness, asthma and anxiety attacks.  No cause
for weight loss had been
identified in that report.  There were complaints of back pain to that
Service.
<P>

915   	Thus, there are considerable problems and difficulties in
computing "damages" in a case such as the present where events
commenced in
1942 and the case is heard in 1999.  Indeed, the matter is further complicated
by the fact that the damages claim is
not for physical injury arising from an
identifiable specific happening in terms of time.  The claim for damages (and
equitable compensation)
is for psychiatric and psychological damage, the
alleged consequence of a general course of conduct or an accumulation of
conduct
occurring between 1942 and 1960 and allegedly continuing thereafter.
It is not divided into different periods (see my reasons on
liability)  This is
not a case where psychiatric illness has supervened on physical injuries:  cf:
<b><u>Kavanagh  v  Ahktar</u></b>  supra.  The case particularly involves a
claim for psychiatric injury per se and for ill health, in all its physical and
psychological
respects.  That said,  <b><u>Kavanagh's</u></b>  case (applying
<b><u>Nader  v  Urban Transit Authority</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 501)</a> is of
relevance as I have earlier indicated.
<P>

916   	In my view, the mere statement that a person has a
Borderline Personality Disorder of itself tells the Court very little.
 It does
not inform the court whether on particular occasions acts, conduct or behaviour
are to be necessarily attributed to it,
nor does it prove such behaviour is not
the consequence of voluntary or rational decisions.  The expression "disorder"
(at least
in terms of explanation of particular conduct or behaviour) of a case
may not always be the subject of close scientifically rigorous
analysis even by
the experts.  Care should be taken that the focus of the trial not shift so as
to become preoccupied within the
mere existence of a condition rather than
analysing and considering its effects and consequences.  Causation is a
question of fact
for the Court as a matter of common sense.  A diagnosis, for
example, or classification of Borderline Personality Disorder is an
early step
in an assessment of damages, care still should be taken that a mere disorder
diagnosis, or diagnostic label be not misused
or misunderstood or used as an
explanation without more, for all happening events misfortunes or other
occurrences in life of the
person with such a an alleged disorder.
<P>

917   	As I have said, the presence of Borderline Personality
Disorder (like any other disorder) is not a reason, a basis or excuse
for
blaming everything that occurs upon it, for example, criminal conduct or
criminal activity the result of rational and voluntary
decisions of a person to
participate in it: see  <b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  at 516-517 or for denying
individual responsibility for one's behaviour and conduct.  Nor does it deny a
need to examine a happening
or event to determine whether it was voluntary, an
act of individual responsibility, or was the product of an alleged Borderline
Personality Disorder then existing, or is to be considered to be due to some
other explanation or cause.  Individual responsibility
has not been "wholly"
abolished by the law of torts: see  <b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  at 516-517.  The
mere presence of a disorder does not of itself provide excuses, or non excuses,
for actions or inaction.  Individual
responsibilities for actions and
behaviour, and personal acceptance of such is not excused or denied, nor is the
responsibility or
voluntariness of ones actions, including actions or omissions
in the criminal law to be denied.  As to the causal relationship between
the
mere presence of a mental disorder and the commission of a criminal offence
(here the plaintiff committed offences in the earlier
first half of the 1960's)
cf  <b><u>R  v  Engert</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2084%20A%20Crim%20R%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 84 A Crim R 67</a> where there was no causal
relationship between the presence of a disorder and the commission of the
offence).  In the criminal law
as to voluntariness see  <b><u>R  v
Falconer</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 30</a> and  <b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  supra.  As to
causation in the criminal law and its "purpose":  <b><u>Royall  v  The
Queen</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172 CLR 378.</a>  As to causation in the civil law of
negligence:  <b><u>March  v  E. M. Stramare Pty Ltd</u></b>  supra.  Further,
causation is not simply a factual question but a normative one, with questions
of policy and value judgment entering
into consideration:
<b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  at 511.
<P>

918   	I have very carefully read (and re-read) the evidence,
including the considerable volume of material touching upon the plaintiff's
admissions to hospital between 1962 and 1965.  I have carefully considered
other material not considered by the other experts.  I
have had regard to my
lack of satisfaction as to the reliability and credibility of the plaintiff on
significant matters and my findings
of fact including those on liability which
I do not qualify or resile from.  In the relevant contemporaneous medical notes
are recorded
diagnoses and in my view accurate diagnoses reflecting in my view
the then current psychiatric nomenclature in place in the field
of psychiatry
and the then existing criteria for diagnostic purposes.  Those notes also
reveal matters not the subject a sufficient
detail consideration and attention
in the medical reports, or which in my view have indeed, in some ways been
given inadequate consideration
in all the circumstances.
<P>

919   	Next, as I have sought to indicate, mere classification
of itself, of a disorder is not, determinant of its impact, or effect,
on the
level of functioning of the person suffering from it at any time or any place,
or indeed, a necessary guide to an individual's
responsibility or degree of
control over his or her conduct, behaviour or actions on particular occasions.
On the issue of causation
I may have regard to the lay evidence - what is said
by way of admissions by the plaintiff to others and to all the evidence as
well,
in determining what are the damage consequences flowing from a particular
psychiatric classification, which unless critically and
carefully considered
and analysed, may of itself create a some what erroneous or even distorted view
of a case, and provide false
unreliable inaccurate or unhelpful accounts  or
explanations of past or present events, as well as an unreliable guide to the
future.
<P>

920   	It is for me as a matter of commonsense in terms of
causation, (and if necessary foreseeability) to determine when, where
and under
what circumstances any impairment, disability incapacity or loss or damage, has
been caused by breach of duty (had such
been found).  As I have said, mere
proof of the "disorder" is the beginning, but not the end of the matter.
<P>

921   	Th experts called on behalf of the plaintiff have in some
ways approached the matter of scientific causation by proffering
an
authoritative sounding explanation, that is a Borderline Personality Disorder,
as substantially the explanation for the events
of the plaintiff's life with in
effect nothing counting against this proposition.  Nor has there been an
attempt, or adequate attempt
by the experts to fully explore the plaintiff's
behaviour history and conduct in its several respects.  It has been rather
assumed
that the explanation in all its respects is to be found in the claimed
Borderline Personality Disorder and that is enough.
<P>

922   	With great respect to the experts who seek to provide by
reference to a psychiatric disorder, explanations for events, past
and present
and for future happenings, the role of the Court on the matter of causation is
a different one.  I have touched upon
its role earlier.  That said, there is no
harm in repeating my remarks.  Questions of causation are answered in the legal
framework
in which they occur.  Here the framework is in the law of negligence
in the civil law.  There is also the need to start any legal
inquiry as to
causation from an understanding of the scope of the duty found to be breached.
Where negligence is in issue causation
is essentially a question of fact to be
answered by reference to commonsense and experience (of the tribunal of fact)
and one which
considerations of policy and value judgment necessarily occur:
see  <b><u>March  v  E. M. Stramare Pty Ltd</u></b>  supra;  <b><u>Chappel  v
Hart</u></b>  supra;  <b><u>Kavanagh  v  Akhtar</u></b>  supra.  In the civil
area as the cases make clear, the purpose of finding causation in civil
negligence is to attribute responsibility
in a civil action.  As I have already
mentioned, reasonable foresight is not itself a test of causation.  It marks
the limits beyond
which a wrong doer will not be held responsible for damage
resulting from his or her wrongful act.
<P>

923   	Next, it is to be remembered that causation is not
necessarily negated by the intervention of some act or decision of the
plaintiff or a third party which constitutes a more immediate cause of the loss
or damage than the defendant's negligence or default:
 <b><u>Medlin  v  State
Government Insurance Commission</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 1</a> at 13;
<b><u>Akhtar</u></b>  supra.  That said the voluntary and deliberate conduct by
the plaintiff is not to be ignored either in terms of her actions or behaviour.
Mitigation of damage principles may also have a role to play.  So do matters
not only of chance: but also of personal predisposition
and vulnerability: cf
<b><u>Wilson  v  Peisley</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2050%20ALJR%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 50 ALJR 207.</a>
<P>

924   	In  <b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  supra, a case involving an
issue of a defendant's liability to pay damages for personal injury, where it
was claimed that some of
the damages were affected by criminal conduct on the
part of the plaintiff, Samuels JA (with whom Handley JA agreed) discussed the
conceptual distinction between reasonable foreseeability as a test for both
remoteness of damage and causation, citing  <b><u>Chapman  v  Hearse</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20106%20CLR%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 106 CLR 112.</a>  Samuels JA said at 511:
<P>

"Causation is not simply a factual question; it is also a normative one.  This
proposition clearly emerges from the decision of
the High Court in  <i>March  v
E. &amp; M. H. Stramare Pty Limited</i>.  Hence it follows that the issue
whether the appellant's negligence was a cause of the respondents criminal
conduct is to be determined
not simply by reference to factual considerations
but to considerations of policy."
<P>

925   	His Honour (at 515) concluded in that case that it was an
error to hold that the appellant's negligence caused the respondent
to turn to
crime, and that it was strictly not necessary to express a firm view upon the
issue of remoteness of damage.  Further,
in discussing the matter of reasonable
foreseeability, he was nevertheless of the view that the consequences of the
criminal conviction
were not in the event reasonably foreseeable.  That said
(at 517) his Honour concluded that the defendant should not be held responsible
for the losses the plaintiff sustained as a result of "a rational and voluntary
decision to engage in criminal activity ... that
the losses ... fall outside
the limits for which the wrong doer should be held liable".
<P>

926   	These remarks and observations are in point in the
instant case particularly in respect of the criminal offences (including
imprisonment for one) in the 1960's and their effect on damages.  Earlier in
<b><u>Barnes  v  Hay</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 337</a> (a case preceding
<b><u>March's</u></b>  case) the Court of Appeal was also called upon to
consider the issues of foreseeability and remoteness and further the issue of
causation in the context of an assessment of damages.  An issue also arose
whether part of the loss was caused by the defendant's
negligence.  At 352,
Mahoney JA noted that a real difficulty in the law of causation was in the
formulation of the verbal principle,
the "formula".  That said Hope and
Priestley JJA (at 339) considered that where some principle of causation
applied, its resolution
still required the exercise of "judgment with different
judges arriving at different results".  This latter approach is consistent
with
the view that causation is a question of fact and very much for the trial
judge.
<P>

927   	So far I have been speaking of common law causation and
not causation in equity:  see  <b><u>O'Halloran</u></b>  supra (a case
particularly involving the trustee fiduciary duty type of case or one analogous
in the circumstances to such).  With
respect to Equity, Principles of
causation, remoteness and foreseeability as well as "novus actus" may well be
different:  <b><u>O'Halloran</u></b>;  <b><u>Makaronis</u></b>  supra.  As I
earlier said, I am relieved from dealing with the matter of equitable
compensation by the plaintiff's concession that
"Equity would follow the law in
quantifying equitable compensation by the same measures as are used in the
assessment of common law
damages""  For this reason in my assessment of damages
I forbear from looking at and considering the matter of equitable compensation
separately.
<P>

928   	Mr Barry (for the defendants) also submitted that when it
came to determining causation in relation to the plaintiff's alcoholism
and
drug dependence, even more difficult questions arise.  First, he submitted that
drug taking is a criminal offence and the policy
of the law is that there
should also be no compensation for the commission of criminal offences: see
<b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  supra.  The same proposition he submitted applied to the
plaintiff's claim based in part upon her conviction and imprisonment for
offences including for the serious offence of bestiality.  Mr Barry argued that
on the issue of alcoholism there was evidence that
the plaintiff's mother too
was an alcoholic, (throughout her life or a large part thereof and that the
report of Dr Heiner in 1989).
 He argued that the plaintiff's own alcoholism
was somehow caused by "her" personality disorder was not established.  He
further
submitted:
<P>

"[The plaintiff] may have been that way in any event.  She may have been that
way if she had gone to the Cootamundra Girl's Home
at the age of 12.  She may
have been worse off if she had gone to Cootamundra Girl's Home because other
girls may have identified
her as being "white" and singled her out for
prejudicial treatment as well".
<P>

929   	Dr Waters also gave some evidence on this matter well (at
T 135).  That said the plaintiff did not reunite with her mother
until 1973,
and the mother had no role in her upbringing.
<P>

930   	Mr Barry also submitted that matters such as drug
addiction were not compensable even if caused by the defendants' conduct.
 I
consider that on the facts of this case such drug addiction has not been proved
on the facts or established as having been caused
in any event by default or of
the defendant.  He also further submitted that in any event some damage to the
plaintiff's psychological
health was, in any event, likely because of
abandonment of the plaintiff by her mother and disrupted nurturing of her
earlier years
for reasons beyond the control of the Board.  There would have
been, it is submitted, some interruption in nurturing irrespective
of default.
There is substance in these submissions which I accept.
<P>

931   	In reply, the plaintiff has submitted that no factor was
identified by the defendant which was "causally unrelated to the
plaintiff's
Borderline Personality Disorder" (including also that the plaintiff was
depressed because her son was in gaol).  I reject
this submission in the terms
stated.
<P>

932   	As to the matter of the criminal offences, legal
questions aside, as a purely factual matter I am entitled to look to what
appears to be the circumstances surrounding the commission of an offence: see
<b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  at p 512.  Indeed, looking at the actual factual context
in which the plaintiff's offence(s) in the 1960's (including that of attempted
bestiality followed by imprisonment) took place such, I conclude that they were
not causatively the responsibility in law, or in
fact of the AWB.  I reiterate
that causation is as much a normative question as it is a factual one.  I find
the reasons of Samuels
JA in  <b><u>Chapman  v  Hearse</u></b>  supra, of
assistance, informative and applicable when it comes to dealing with the
offences to which pleas of guilty were entered.
 In the present case it has
been shown that there were pleas of guilty and sentencing by courts of law.
The plaintiff was found by
a court to have voluntarily committed the acts.  In
the circumstances it would, on the facts as well, be unrealistic or contrary
to
common sense to find that the defendant caused the plaintiff to engage in
criminal conduct.  In any event such has not been proved
by the plaintiff.
<P>

933   	Next, I am not prepared to find that the (illegal or
otherwise) abuse of drugs and the claimed substance abuse disorder (however,
it
be described) was caused by any alleged negligence of the defendants.  Further
or alternatively, it has not been established that
it has been.  The alcohol
abuse claim as I have said is subject to the same findings.  The defendant is
not responsible for it (even
if negligent).  The plaintiff has also not
discharged the relevant onus.
<P>

934   	In this case it will be necessary to look at a number of
other matters in their factual context setting to determine whether
the
defendant is to be made liable for all or any problems and misfortunes asserted
by the plaintiff.
<P>

935   	Mr Hutley further advanced the plaintiff's case as
follows.  The question to be determined was whether the plaintiff's mental
illness and its "consequences" was foreseeable as to make the defendant liable
for it.  He submitted that even in respect of drug
or alcohol abuse there was
no reason in law, policy or otherwise excluding drug or alcohol abuse from the
ambit of such consequences
even where abuse included illegal activities. I have
rejected this submission, for reasons given.
<P>

936   	The plaintiff's case also is that she suffered attachment
disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder as a result of the
AWB's
negligence, that the plaintiff had abused substances since her late adolescence
as a result of Borderline Personality Disorder.
 I reject this submission.  Mr
Hutley submitted that although the plaintiff no longer meets the diagnostic
criteria for Borderline
Personality Disorder, she continues to abuse
substances.  Mr Hutley submitted that Borderline Personality Disorder and the
associated
substance abuse had compromised the plaintiff's life in all
respects, including an inability to form relationships, to earn a living
and to
look after herself.  I reject these submissions in the terms stated.
<P>

937   	Further to the extent that it is asserted that substance
abuse is caused by a Borderline Personality Disorder, I do not have
to accept
his experts' views in this case.  Further the factual foundation for such
opinions have not been established.
<P>

938   	I also have regard to the plaintiff's behaviour and
company kept and criminal activities in 1960-1962, a period of some turbulent
behaviour in her life, not in my view due to any alleged default of the
defendant.  Reference in the plaintiff's affidavit evidence
as to early
involvement with drugs and alcohol is significantly limited.  As regards her
conduct in the period 1960-1962 she was
not forthcoming as to details when
questioned by Dr Waters.  Notwithstanding this, when the period 1960-1962 is
looked at, on all
the evidence available including the plaintiff's own limited
affidavit evidence, the matter of substance abuse and the commencement
of
alcohol abuse may be better understood in context.
<P>

939   	Another matter that I should mention in this most
difficult task of assessment relates to further heads of damage.  It is
impossible to assess damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of
life by any process of arithmetical calculation.
<P>

940   	I now turn to consider the specific heads of damages.
<P>

<b>General Damages:</b>
<P>

941   	The plaintiff's case is that when she left Lutanda she
was psychiatrically damaged to the extent that she could not partake
of
community life.  I reject this submission in the terms asserted.  Apart from my
view that this proposition is not one that I accept
in the terms stated, it is
not one that I accept having regard as I have said to the terms of Dr Cooley's
report which reveals and
discloses no psychiatric disorder.  I am not prepared
to accept that in 1960 the plaintiff had a psychiatric disorder, or further
or
alternatively, clinical or other manifestations of it.  As to the situation
before 1960, I have reached a similar conclusion for
reasons given by reference
to the evidence that I have accepted and the findings and inferences based
thereon.
<P>

942   	The plaintiff asserts that she was destined at eighteen
to spend much of her time in institutions (and clearly she spent
time in
1962-1965 in one such institution).  She claims that she was unable to mother
her three children, she could not participate
in social activities and unable
to lead a normal life.  She became a prostitute, developed a drug addiction,
became an alcoholic,
committed criminal offences, was in and out of employment.
She was unable to relate to others because of her emotional deprivations.
 She
suffered ongoing pain and unhappiness.  She claims she has had a lifetime of
problems and misfortunes.
<P>

943   	As regards general intelligence, I find the plaintiff in
1960 was rated as of average general intelligence (see Dr Cooley).
 I also find
that she probably completed the Intermediate Certificate and that when she left
Lutanda she had the same educational
advantages and opportunities as did others
in the community having the same or similar educational qualifications.  She
appeared
to have been qualified to embark on a career of nursing had she wished
to do so, yet had "declined" or refused to do so although
assisted by the
Parole Officer, Ms Barnett in 1962.  In fact she left employment after a few
hours at a hospital where the employer
had shown a willingness to employ her as
a nurse's aide and to assist her to do a nurse's course.  I do not accept the
plaintiff
broke parole or left the job because of any psychiatric disorder or
its consequences.  It was her decision, and in my view one involving
individual
responsibility.
<P>

944   	The plaintiff left Lutanda on 30 July 1960.  A job as a
domestic was arranged by Lutanda.  There is some evidence to suggest
she was
placed in that job.  She left it after six days.  The court records reveal that
on 30 August 1960 she was arrested and that
 "she had been living with a
criminal and pervert".  He had been keeping her.  In August 1960 she was
charged with  stealing from
Woolworths and she admitted the offence "saying she
had no money".  This is the explanation for her stealing that I accept.  She
was referred to Dr Cooley who, on 1 September 1960 gave a report including the
absence of reference to a psychiatric condition. 
I do not find this offence in
fact to have been caused by any breach of duty on the part of the defendant or
caused by the presence
of any Borderline Personality Disorder or any other
psychiatric disorder.  As to the diagnosis consistent between 1962-1965 of the
psychiatrists I accept that the diagnosis as stated in terms then stated,
whatever may have been later "retrospect" or changes in
psychiatric
nomenclature or in DSM criteria changes or otherwise.  The finding that I
further make is that they were the correct
psychiatric diagnosis in 1962-1965,
and I accept the "consistent" accuracy of each of the stated diagnosis ie of
each admission in
1962-1965.  Those diagnosis accorded with psychiatric
nomenclature at the time.
<P>

945   	However, for the purposes of assessing damages, I am
prepared with reservations, to accept as I said with respect to Dr Waters'
evidence, that the plaintiff according to modern psychiatric nomenclature was
suffering from a disorder consistent with Borderline
Personality Disorder from
1962 to 1997.  I do not accept it was caused by the defendants' default or
negligence.  That still leaves
open to determine what consequences flow from it
and the impact of it upon her life, conduct, behaviour and development in life.
There are many speculative matters here to be considered, as well as
identification of consequences.
<P>

946   	As I have stated, I accept the views of Dr Cooley and
drawing the inference that the plaintiff in 1960 then had no diagnosed
or
diagnosable psychiatric condition, otherwise she would have said so.
<P>

947   	In December 1960 and January 196l the plaintiff was
convicted of offensive behaviour.  On 28 April 1961 the plaintiff was
convicted
of the offence of attempted bestiality (28 March 1991) and sentenced to a gaol
term.  She pleaded guilty to the charge.
 The offence should in my view be seen
in the context of the plaintiff's association with Roslyn Norton, and the
plaintiff's involvement
in her black mass, pagan and witchcraft activities and
the "bad company" the sexual freedom generated by such associations.
<P>

948   	As to the plaintiff's behaviour between 1960-1962 I
accept the views of Ms Barnett, her Parole Officer.  The following paragraph
appears:
<P>

"Eileen Williams' work record has been satisfactory but she rarely stayed at
her place of employment for any length of time.  From
the time she left the
orphanage it is alleged that she periodically drifted into the company of
Bohemian  elements of the Kings Cross
area and has intimately associated with
men who were no more than bad companions.  She also admits that she has
attended celebrations
of black mass."
<P>

949   	I do not accept the defendant is causatively responsible
for these matters save for perhaps movement from employment ie unsettled
employment.  That said, it is really a matter of speculation or judgment.
<P>

950   	The plaintiff's life style appears to have been the
product of her voluntary behaviour.  Further prostitution for money,
for
pleasure or to get revenge on her father was not caused by any breach of duty
of the defendant.  Hatred towards men as an excuse
for prostitution, was not in
my view caused by any alleged default of the defendant.  If prostitution was
caused by the wish to do
it for money or to get back on her father this too
would not be the responsibility of the defendant: see also  <b><u>Havenaar  v
Havenaar</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%20626" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 626.</a>  In that case Hutley JA (when discussing
the consumption of alcohol as a voluntary act for most people) said (at
628):
<P>

"The concept of voluntariness in a world of universal causation has been
challenged but the legal system is built upon the retention
of some measure of
individual responsibility <u>and it has not been wholly abolished in the law of
torts</u>."  [my emphasis]
<P>

951   	This passage was cited with approval by Samuels JA in
<b><u>Wiegold</u></b>  at 517.
<P>

952   	Upon her release from prison on 2 November 1961 on parole
(terminating 27 March 1962) the plaintiff found employment initially
at a
nursing home.  The matter of a nursing course was apparently considered.  The
plaintiff it appears was keen to work as a nurse.
 It appears that the
plaintiff left her job at the nursing home (breaking parole) and her
whereabouts between 7 November 1961 and
12 February 1961 were unknown.  On 12
February 1962 she was arrested for soliciting.  It was believed she had been
living as a prostitute
since the previous November.  The plaintiff said she
couldn't stop herself from being a prostitute.  In March 1962 (when seen by
Ms
Barnett) the plaintiff was three months pregnant to some unknown person,  I do
not find in the circumstances that this pregnancy
was caused by any suggested
breach of duty by the defendant whether as an incident of prostitution (also
not caused by any alleged
default of the defendants) or otherwise.
<P>

953   	In February 1962 she met a Mr Thomas (aged 29) with whom
she was living as his wife.  He wanted to marry her.  He was not
the father of
the child.  The plaintiff said to Ms Barnett she had a strong sex drive and
they were sexually incompatible.  She had
returned to prostitution.  In my view
these matters have nothing to do with the defendants!  On the Monday evening
before 1 March
1962 the plaintiff came to see Ms Barnett about medical help.
<P>

954   	Ms Barnett observed that the plaintiff was of average
intelligence but her social history showed some marked absence of "socially
accepted moral standards".  In the circumstances this was not caused by any
breach of duty by the defendants or in my view, due to
any lack of teaching and
care at Lutanda.  I find that between 1962-1965 the change in jobs, the
commission of offences, her life
as a prostitute, her conduct, her sexual life,
her pregnancy, her relationship with Mr Thomas, were not caused by any default
of
the defendants (assuming such had been found by me), and the defendants are
not responsible in damages for such conduct.
<P>

955   	The plaintiff had eight admissions to the North Ryde
Psychiatric Centre between 25 March and 26 May 1965.  The records on
proper
examination provide information of considerable value to the Court in terms of
assisting it in arriving at a decision on all
the evidence.  The following
contents are taken from the Hospital's report to her solicitors (15 June
1989):
<P>

"<b><u>Re:  Joy Eileen WILLIAMS  -  13.9.1942</u></b>
<P>

The abovenamed has had 8 admissions to this hospital dating from 25.3.1962 to
26.5.1985.
<P>

Details of her admission are as follows:
<P>

1.	25.03.1962  -  08.12.1962
<P>

2.	01.02.1963  -  21.02.1963
<P>

3.	18.05.1963  -  14.08.1963
<P>

4.	28.08.1963  -  30.08.1963
<P>

5.	11.12.1963  -  13.12.1963
<P>

6.	04.03.1964  -  06.03.1964
<P>

7.	11.03.1964  -  11.06.1964
<P>

8.	19.05.1965  -  26.05.1965
<P>

Diagnosis at the conclusion of each one of these admissions was Sociopathic
personality, Prostitution and Sexual Deviation.
<P>

She was initially referred by a Parole Officer due to her multiple emotional
conflicts and her strong resentment towards any form
of authority.  Ms Williams
had asked for medical help herself and had expressed a keen desire to do
something about her condition.
<P>

Copy of Report concerning Ms Williams from her Parole Officer dated 1st March,
1962 is enclosed.
<P>

On admission she was found to be three months pregnant and subsequently had a
baby while in hospital.  She was treated with Largactil
200 mgs. q.i.d., due to
her <u>disruptive behaviour</u>.  There were no details or reports of any
psychotherapeutic treatment she had while in hospital.  She was discharged
12.12.1962 while
she was <u>absent without leave</u>.  [my emphasis]
<P>

Her second admission was precipitated by para-suicidal attempt with Largactil
tablets.  On admission she was unco-operative and
showed marked ambivalence and
dependency traits.  She was again discharged while <u>absent without leave</u>.
[my emphasis]
<P>

Her third admission she presented for voluntary admission as she felt she could
not cope and had nowhere to live and had expressed
suicidal feelings.  She was
accompanied by her 9 months old child who was subsequently placed in a home for
adoption.  As on previous
admissions she went absent <u>without leave and was
subsequently discharged</u>.  [my emphasis]
<P>

Her fourth admission was a referral from an official of Rainbow Lodge.  He felt
she was unable to stay there any longer due to anti-social
behaviour.  She had
been stirring up other inmates and had threatened suicide when not given her
own way.  On admission she was extremely
resentful for being hospitalised.  She
had multiple scars over both her forearms and she stated it was from trying to
commit suicide.
 She claimed to have been addicted to Methedrine about 30 tabs.
a day since 1960 but states that she had not been taking any for
the past few
months.  She was treated with Largactil for her disruptive behaviour and was
subsequently discharged to Gladesville
Hospital.
<P>

Her fifth admission she presented voluntarily as she felt she could not cope
and had self-inflicted cuts to her left forearm and
right wrist.  She had asked
for re-admission as she felt she could not cope on her own.
<P>

Her sixth admission she was transferred from Ryde Hospital following an
overdose of tablets.  According to the patient she took
the overdose to attract
attention.  She expressed guilt feelings about having abandoned her baby.
<P>

She had presented for re-admission for the seventh time for further treatment
and further attempts for rehabilitate herself.  According
to the discharge
summary there was some improvement in her behaviour during her two months stay.
She left the hospital to take up
a post as a Mother's Help.
<P>

Her last admission was again at her own request after taking an overdose.  She
went absent <u>without leave two days later and was subsequently
discharged</u>.  [my emphasis]
<P>

There are no records of any further admissions since 16.05.1965.  As she has
not been seen by any of our staff members since then
I am unable to comment on
her prognosis.
<P>

Yours sincerely,
<P>

R. Kaneyson
<P>

<u>Director of Clinical Services"</u>
<P>

956   	Working through the cause of each and every one of the
matters involves considerable difficulty.  If damages are to be awarded,
in my
view, as a matter of value judgment, I would award an amount of damages during
the period of hospitalisation for some of the
matters, the subject of
treatment, and accept that some of the matters, without detailing them, are
compensable.
<P>

957   	The hospital records (1962-1965) include references to
lack of co-operation, resentment, overdosing to attract attention,
addiction to
Methedrine, being discharged for being absent without leave, overdosing on
drugs, being irresponsible, practicing bestiality,
marriage to Kevin Thomas to
"legitimise the baby", hatred of men, prostituting herself for money,
prostituting herself to get revenge
on her father (4 May 1962), prostitution
for pleasure, manipulations to obtain benefits-power, or in order to get her
"own way".
 As I have said it is difficult to see why I should hold that these
matters should be regarded as being caused by any breach of duty,
if any.
Further, points to note from the records of an association with Roslyn Norton
(whom she met at 17) who "described vividly
sex with animals" to her (1 June
1963); being on Methedrine since 18; and having sexual intercourse since age of
17 (Hospital history
1.2.1963).  I do not regard these matters as being the
responsibility of the defendant, even if liable.  There are references to
living with men, and to the plaintiff being unsettled in jobs.  In May 1963 she
was admitted and described as a hostile sociopathic
girl who had "social
aberrations".  The hospital records reveal anti-social behaviour, and
threatened suicide if she did not get
her own way (30 August 1963).  She worked
in factories and resigned.  Why she did so is by no means clear, nor are
explanations simply
to be found.  She claimed to have done a nursing course for
ten months.  As noted, in August 1963 there is a history of three years
of drug
addiction to Methedrine about "30 tabs a day".  It is known what the
plaintiff's lifestyle was.  In December 1963 there was
an admission.  The
plaintiff was eight months pregnant.  She had a fight with a boyfriend, there
were superficial cuts inflicted
and described as "manipulative to get into
hospital".  In March 1964 there is a case history note referring to the
plaintiff saying
she had "overdosed to attract attention - thinks it is a
guilty feeling I have about my baby I should have kept her".  In May 1965
the
plaintiff described her job as a nurse, but also was editing a magazine.  The
notes in 1965 refer to a "constellation of symptoms"
<P>

958   	I have studied these reports and the hospital notes with
some care.  They are but briefly touched upon and referred to in
the reports of
Dr Waters.  They have not been seen by Dr Lal.  They were not even seen or
studied by Dr Katz or Mrs Bull called as
"experts" in the plaintiff's case.
Nor did either or both of these persons see the plaintiff anytime.  In making
detailed reference
to the details of the plaintiff's position in the 1960's I
do so because it is part of her case that substantially these problems,
matters
and behaviour were attributed to the defendants' default.
<P>

959   	The Unit Summary Sheet (A1 - p 209) summarised previous
admissions as follows:
<P>

"1.	25.3.62-8.12.62	Sociopathic Personality Prostitution

<P>

							Dr Hennessy Disch.
<P>

8.	19.5.65-26.5.65	Sociopathic Personality Prostitution."
<P>

960   	With respect to damage, the matter of the admissions and
their cause is by no means clear.  I am prepared to accept that
some of them
may have been caused in the legal and factual sense by a breach of duty had
such a breach been found but it is by no
means an easy task to do some 34 to 37
years after the event, and further in the context of changing psychiatric
terminology or nomenclature.
<P>

961   	Turning to other matters, the evidence shows that on 4
September 1962 the plaintiff's daughter Julia Ann was born and in
1963 she was
placed for adoption.  The birth and adoption were not caused by the defendant's
breach, if any.
<P>

962   	In 1964 the plaintiff took a job as a mother's help.  In
1964 she was convicted of stealing.  Between 1966 and 1968 the plaintiff
went
to New Guinea to live with Mr "K".  On 13 June 1968 the plaintiff's second
daughter was born.  The pregnancy and birth on any
view was not caused by
breach of any duty.  Mr "K" whom she had apparently met in Macquarie Hospital
(he was an employee) was the
alleged father of the second child.  In June 1969
he was ordered to pay maintenance.  Her daughter subsequently became subject to
a Children's Court order.  This is a matter particularly commented upon in
Child Welfare Records on or about 1 May 1980, twelve years
later (see the later
entry in the records).  There is no evidence that any alleged psychiatric
disorder caused the trip to be taken
to New Guinea, the pregnancy and birth of
the second child or prevented her travelling or from staying in New Guinea for
two years
or that there was any disorders at this time for which the defendant
should be held liable.
<P>

963   	In July 1970 the plaintiff applied for a Housing
Commission flat.  Her application form said she was not working and was
having
out-patient treatment at Caritas House for a psychiatric condition.  On 27
September 1971 it appears that Rachel, the plaintiff's
daughter was discharged
from Lutanda.  In March 1972 it is alleged that Mr "K" had applied to Lutanda
to again accept Rachel.
<P>

964   	In 1972 the social worker at Prince of Wales Hospital
reported that the plaintiff had come to see her about Rachel.  She
expressed
fears of being physically violent with the child.
<P>

965   	Again in 1972 there was the matter of admission of Rachel
to Dr Barnardo's Homes that was explored.  A social worker (Miss
Mackay) also
saw the plaintiff in 1972 and obtained a history of the plaintiff being "a
quarter caste aborigine and is rather dark
olive skinned".  She was described
as being obviously "disturbed" and quite "irresponsible".  The reason for being
disturbed has
not been really addressed.  It is not clear why the defendant,
even if liable, should be responsible causatively for this personal
irresponsibility.  The plaintiff was described as "a married-mother", and that
she had a divorce pending.  She had also had a de
facto relationship for six
years which broke up shortly after Rachel was born.  The de facto relationship,
the entry into it, or
its break up is not in my view attributed in terms of
responsibility  to the defendant.
<P>

966   	In another report on "Home of Ward" (29 November 1973)
reference is made to the son Benjamin (DOB 7.8.1973) then described
as being
the plaintiff's second illegitimate male child, to a different father.  The
child had been committed to State care because
the plaintiff had difficulty in
coping with him.  The plaintiff was said to have been unable to manage Ben as a
baby.  The child
Ben had been committed to the care of the Minister on 16
November 1973 by the Children's Court following complaint of neglect and
incompetent guardianship.  The child had previously been surrendered for
adoption on three occasions by the mother but she had revoked
the consent.  In
November 1973 concern was expressed about possible physical harm to Ben from
his mother.  I do not see why the defendant
should even assuming default, be
taken to have caused these difficulties or problems, or be responsible for such
in damages.
<P>

967   	In 1973 the plaintiff met her mother for the first time
through an organisation called Link-up.  Between 1973 and 1975 the
plaintiff's
mother came to live with the plaintiff and Rachel for two years.  They moved to
Nowra so that the plaintiff's mother
could live with them.  In 1974 the
plaintiff's income was a <u>supporting mother's benefit</u>  [my emphasis].
However, in May 1974 the plaintiff appears to have obtained some part time work
as a cleaner.  In 1974  in form(s)
relating to her son Ben, the plaintiff
declared her only income to be her DSS benefit.
<P>

968   	In 1974 correspondence took place with politicians,
concerning the plaintiff applying for return of her child, Ben.  On 15
August
1974 there is recorded a meeting between Ms Williams and one Ms Isabel Andrews.
It commenced "every one gathered for aforementioned
confrontation".  It was
noted that Ms Williams was <u>erratic, vacillating, self-centred</u> and that
Benjamin was well placed with foster parents!
<P>

969   	On 9 April 1974 it appears that Ms Williams was allegedly
interviewed by a TV Channel in respect of the application for restoration
of
the child Benjamin (Defendants' Bundle of Documents 189).  This took place
after a meeting between the plaintiff and the supervising
District Officer.  In
October 1974 another memo (14 October 1974) relating to Benjamin appeared (p
197).  I quote:
<P>

"The mother's behaviour does not appear to indicate any mental disorder but
rather a passive demonstration against  the department".
<P>

970   	Subsequently in March 1975 it was recommended by the
Department of Youth and Community Services ("DYCS") that a trial restoration
of
the child, Ben to the mother under close supervision take place.  In 1975 the
plaintiff moved to a Housing Commission home and
placed Ben with foster
parents.  There is a Housing Commission report that the plaintiff was often
drunk according to neighbour's
complaints.  In December 1976 Ben was discharged
from State control.  I do not see why the defendants in terms of causation
should
be held to be responsible for these problems, even were default to be
found.
<P>

971   	In 1975 the mother was having counselling sessions.  In a
report on the "Restored Ward" - Family Case Work one Morri Young
(21 November
1975) referred to seeing "Mrs Thomas" (Ms Williams' married name) in the
office.  The following entry appears:
<P>

"Mrs Thomas in the office.  There seemed nothing obviously wrong but I think
that Mrs Thomas came in to size up her new officer
(<u>victim</u>).  She talked
for about half an hour about the negative side of the Department (Child
Welfare) especially the male officers.  She
did confide in me that she had
successfully <u>manipulated</u> most of the previous officers and because of my
apparent youth I would be <u>no problem</u>."  [my emphasis]
<P>

972   	This conclusion which I accept would suggest it was an
occasion of deliberate intended manipulation for gain or purpose,
not for
attention (from carers or otherwise).  It appears to have been voluntary,
rational and deliberate conduct.
<P>

973   	In 1977 there is evidence of the plaintiff having a
drinking problem.  Again in November 1977 the son Ben appeared in Yasmar
Children's Court and the plaintiff was given eighteen months' probation for
"incompetent guardianship".  In January 1979 the daughter
Rachel overdosed.  In
1979-1980 the plaintiff had drinking problems and problems coping with her son
and left her children unsupervised
whilst she worked as a casual taxi
driver.
<P>

974   	In July 1978 (Vol A2 - 379) the plaintiff overdosed with
Serapax.  She was examined.  Contact was made with Miss Stricker
(social
worker) at the Prince of Wales Hospital who had been working with the
plaintiff.  There is a record that Miss Stricker was
no longer working with the
plaintiff due to her failure to keep regular appointments.  The cause of the
overdosing, is not to be
attributed to default of the defendant, or to be the
subject of responsibility by the defendant.  It has not been proved to my
satisfaction.
<P>

975   	In 1977 the Family Casework Report" revealed that Joy and
Ben were seen on a date unspecified.  The plaintiff was questioned
as to her
ability as a mother including her emotional turmoil with her son Ben, her
drinking habits, and her leaving the children
at night.  Counselling as
directed was to be continued.
<P>

976   	On 25 March 1978 (a Saturday night) a caseworker, Miss
Kemp was actually called out to see Ms Williams.  The plaintiff was
convinced
she should give up her five year old son.  The following passages appear in the
caseworker's report:
<P>

"Mrs Thomas is a very knowing manipulative lady, who wanted to play games with
me, the system etc.  She was very evasive when she
was asked why she had
reached her decision at this particular time and would tell me only what she
wanted me to hear".
<P>

977   	In my view her manipulations were not due to any alleged
disorder.
<P>

978   	In February 1981 Ben appeared in the Children's Court and
was placed on probation.  Again in May 1981 the plaintiff and her
family moved
to a Housing Commission property in Nowra.  Whilst the plaintiff had an
operation she placed her son with the UAM at
Bomaderry (indicating ongoing
dealings with the UAM by whom she had been looked after in their Children's
Home at Bomaderry between
1942 and 1947).  The plaintiff was a heavy drinker in
1981.  Drinking and instability was described in 1983.  In 1984 the plaintiff
signed a temporary fostering care order for her son, Ben.  Her then alcoholism
I do not accept as being caused by any default of
the defendant.
<P>

979   	The Report Form (Child Welfare, 2 August 1983) reveals
that Ben had court appearances for neglect and incompetent guardianship
in
November 1973, December 1977 and February 1981.  Rachel has an appearance at
Yasmar in July 1980 on a charge under the  <b><u>Child Welfare Act</u></b>.
The Department of Community Affairs did a psychological assessment on Ben in
respect of his absence from home in August 1982.  The
most significant person
in Ben's life was said to be his mother's "de facto", then aged 21.
<P>

980   	A report form in May 1982 referred to Ms Williams
receiving counselling from the Health Commission.  It was said "her
relationship
with Chris a sailor aged only about 20 was in itself potentially a
source of many problems as well as being symptomatic of other
problems being
experienced by Ms Williams".  Rachel was said to be a source of concern both at
home and at school.  These difficulties
I do not attribute to being caused by
the defendants' breach of duty even if one was established.
<P>

981   	The Department of Social Security ("DSS") Records
(Exhibit "A") reveal Disability support pension payments since 30 November
1995
to date.  At one stage sickness benefits were paid in 1991.  An Abstudy
tertiary supplement (post graduate) was paid from January
1993 to 30 December
1993 with Abstudy throughout 1995 and 1996.  In 1996 the plaintiff embarked
upon the degree course at Wollongong
University for a degree of Master of
Indigenous Health.
<P>

982   	In a letter from the Department of Social Security,
pension payment from 1981 to 1989 are revealed in different annual sums.
 In
1989-1990 there is no record in any pension or benefit microfiche.
<P>

983   	Records show the plaintiff worked with the Department of
Education from 31 January 1989 to 14 August 1991 resigning with
stress.  The
cause of the "stress" is not identified.  It does not appear to have prevented
University studies, nor did any suggested
psychiatric disorder if present
apparently do so.  Yet, in 1991 she graduated with an Associate Diploma in
Adult Education in May;
1992 with a Bachelor of Arts; in May 1993 with a Master
of Creative Arts.  She completed an Associate Diploma in Social Sciences
in
1995.
<P>

984   	It was in 1985, that significant changes began to take
place in her life.  Dr Waters gave evidence that because she became
involved in
Aboriginal affairs, activities and University life, her sense of aboriginal
identity proceeded dissolution of her personality
disorder by half a decade.
She commenced a Bachelor of Arts Degree at Wollongong which continued into
1986.  In April 1986 the plaintiff
sought a housing transfer to Wollongong
because she was studying at the Wollongong University with her income being a
pension and
Abstudy.  The plaintiff was offered short term employment as a
Projects Officer in the Aboriginal Education Unit.  In 1987 she did
her final
year of her BA degree.  According to Dr Waters he obtained a history of the
plaintiff being involved in aboriginal activities
and pursuing her Aboriginal
interests.  Whatever psychiatric disorder or condition, if then present and
operating, apparently did
not preclude such involvement in those matters.
<P>

985   	In 1987-1988 the plaintiff corresponded with Lutanda
receiving "documents" in 1987.  An earlier report form (again Child
Welfare
records in the son Benjamin's matter) of 1 May 1980 may be noted.
<P>

986   	There is evidence that in November 1993 the plaintiff was
granted an Abstudy supplement.  She was accepted into a TAFE course
in 1993
having graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in May 1992.  Another Abstudy grant was
sought in 1996 to permit her to do a Masters
Degree.  Any disorder did not
prevent her studying, nor were the academic results the product or incident of
any suggested Borderline
Personality Disorder or any disorder allegedly
present.  It is not suggested such inhibited her capacity to study.
<P>

987   	In 1991 the plaintiff started to resume regular contact
with her daughter Julie-Anne.  She was also awarded an Associate
Diploma in
Adult Education by UTS (Sydney).  In September 1991 she was advised that she
would be paid a sickness benefit from September.
<P>

988   	In December 1991 the plaintiff attended the Illawarra
Aboriginal Medical Service.  She complained of headaches and depression.
 The
cause of the headaches and depression is not established.  She was given drugs
(16 December 1991).  On 31 December 1991 the
plaintiff complained of headaches.
A past history of alcohol dependency was recorded.  There was discussion about
the use of Pethidine.
<P>

989   	In March 1993 the plaintiff ceased studies due to
illness.  On 11 May 1993 the plaintiff was awarded a Master of Creative
Arts
from the University of Wollongong.  In 1995 the plaintiff commenced studies for
an Associate Diploma in Social Sciences (Community
Welfare) from Wollongong
TAFE.  Any illness did not appear to prevent her from studying.  In 1995 Dr De
Silva reported the plaintiff
complained of backache, migraine and stress and
was given scripts.  These conditions were not in my view caused by any
suggested
default of the defendant.
<P>

990   	In December 1995, a Dr Mackay completed a report for DSS
in respect of a disability pension certifying her as being unfit
for work and
the plaintiff signed a "DDS form" applying for a pension.  A report in January
1996 by Dr Carner dealt with the plaintiff's
health, she also had problems of
emphysema and debilitating arthritis which in my view were not caused by any
suggested default of
the defendant.
<P>

991   	In 1997 Dr Waters stated that his overall impression was
that Ms Williams no longer suffered Borderline Personality Disorder.
 He
considered she had shed every one of the "criteria".  Indeed, he said (at 106)
that she fell short of the threshold for Borderline
Personality Disorder
sometime prior to 1997.
<P>

992   	During 1997 reports of the plaintiff's health were
received from the Illawarra Centre dealing with complaints of <u>migraine</u>.
The cause is unproved.  The plaintiff in 1997 decided she did not wish to move
to a house but wished to move to a retirement village.
 It was about this time
that Dr Waters (applying DSM-IVTM criteria) considered that the plaintiff did
not satisfy the majority of
the criteria for Borderline Personality
Disorder.
<P>

993   	A report of Dr Glenn (19 September 1995) was tendered in
the plaintiff's case.  It does not appear to have been considered
by any of the
plaintiff's medico legal experts.  The report was in the following terms:
<P>

"<b>EDUCATION:</b>	Was to age tertiary level with Master of Creative Arts.
<P>

<b>WORK HISTORY:</b>	Last worked for the Department of Education on 14/8/91
ceasing due to <b><u>stress</u>  </b>[my emphasis]
<P>

(As already pointed out the cause of which has not been proved).
<P>

<b>COMPLAINTS:</b>	Arthritis in a variety of joints which causes pain on
holding a pen to write but does not impede use of a keyboard.
<P>

Personality disorder from maternal separation in infancy which has apparently
ameliorated over years.
<P>

Depression which has in the past been worse but is still active and causes her
to be deeply sad she says beyond tears.  She is attending
a Paul Aaron for
counselling weekly at TAFE.  She sleeps a lot and has nocturnal disturbed
sleep.
<P>

<b>DISABILITY RATING:</b>	20%.
<P>

<b>WORK CAPACITY:</b>	She is unfit for work in the open market but may manage a
few hours possibly as a student.
<P>

<b>GENERAL ASSESSMENT:</b>	This woman is 53 and has an undetermined personality
disorder and depression said to be due to maternal separation in infancy.  She
has a long history of alcoholism which has been avoided since 1988.  She has
depressive symptoms.  It is noted that more recent data
was requested and it
would be helpful however it was felt unlikely to be forthcoming unless she were
to be reviewed by an independent
observer, which if required could be arranged.
On the basis of data provided she is 20% disabled and unfit to work in the open
market."
<P>

994   	It appears to me the 20% disability rating appears to
have been for her "composite" problems of a physical and psychological
then
found to be in existence.
<P>

995   	In April 1999 Dr Twomey reported seeing the plaintiff.
He received a history that the plaintiff "drank because her mother
drank", that
one of the daughters "was the third of a stolen generation" (a history that I
find is not correct).  Such a statement
should also be seen in the light of Dr
Waters' view that part of the alcohol problem may have been hereditary.  He
noted a history
of drug abuse since 1960 and that the plaintiff was using
amphetamines and methedrine.  The plaintiff had back pain, mild hypertension,
weight loss, chronic disc disease, hypoglycaemia which (in my view) were not
caused by the defendant's alleged default.  The plaintiff
was then suffering
from a multitude of problems.  The history from the Illawarra Aboriginal
Medical Service from 1991 may be summarised
in terms of hysterectomy, migraine,
drug abuse, low back pain, psychiatric illness, asthma and anxiety attacks. In
the evidence there
is reference to stress.  As I have said there is the
considerable unidentified weight loss referred to for which no cause in
given.
<P>

996   	Evidence reveals that Dr Lal, the treating psychiatric
specialist has been treating her since her recent admission on 23
March 1999.
He thought the plaintiff had a likely diagnostic "label" of "manic disorder",
she possibly suffering from a substance
(marijuana) disorder or a brief
psychotic disorder (which he "discounted").  He obtained a history of the
plaintiff having been smoking
marijuana on a daily basis till her admission.
It was important to see what would happen in the future.  He described
Methedrine
as a barbiturate prescribed to cause sedation.  She had a history of
having abused alcohol.  For fifteen years at one stage of her
life there was a
history of drinking herself into unconsciousness.  He did not diagnose any
depression (contrary to Dr Waters). 
The plaintiff may or may not have had an
anxiety disorder - he could not determine that whilst she was acutely
psychotic.  Psychosis
he said, was predominantly a biological condition.  In
the 1960's Largactil was used for a number of conditions one of which was
psychosis.  (The plaintiff was given Largactil at North Ryde in 1962-1965).  He
did not see reports in 1962-1965.  Her florid mental
illness may have had an
organic base (T 182).  In forming his views he relied particularly upon the
history to Dr Waters.  One of
the underlying problems was substance abuse.  He
said that her present condition was distinct from Borderline Personality
Disorder
(p 185).
<P>

997   	On 8 April 1999 Dr Waters reported that the plaintiff had
been admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of psychotic
reaction.
This was as I have said, a new condition "hitherto not seen in the plaintiff
over her already complex psychiatric history".
 She manifested a psychotic
reaction principally to the stress of the upcoming court case but contributing
factors include substantial
recent weight loss and possibly also cannabis use.
His view "was" that complete recovery would take place in a few weeks.
<P>

998   	At the time of the trial the plaintiff was in hospital
suffering from a new condition or psychotic re-action against a background
of
what Dr Waters said had already been "a complex psychiatric history"!  I agree
with this last statement.
<P>

999   	When dealing with the matter of general damages, I
propose to make some observations on the matter of care and treatment.
 As
heads of damage they will be also dealt with separately.
<P>

1000   	An affidavit of Rachel Williams (DOB 13 June 1968) has
been filed (14 April 1999).  Ms Williams also gave evidence.  She
had
recollections of her mother (and grandmother) drinking a lot of alcohol in
about the period of 1975, and of her mother working
in two jobs between 1974
and 1979.  Her mother in addition to drinking used to or consumed a lot of
pills.
<P>

1001   	As a child, Rachel recalled cashing pension cheques for
her mother.  She would help her mother and take care of her brother.
 She and
her brother spent time in children's homes.  In 1979 they moved to another
flat, and her mother kept drinking and taking
pills.  They moved to Nowra in
1980.  The mother formed a relationship with a man by the name of Chris.  The
mother would drink and
Chris would be violent to her.  When drunk her mother
was vindictive and cruel.  At Nowra they lived on social security benefits.
These matter, I do not regard as being matters for which the defendants are
responsible even if default was established.
<P>

1002   	The daughter had no contact with her mother for four
years when her mother moved to Wollongong to go to University.  The
mother
obtained a job as Regional Aboriginal Community Liaison Officer with the
Department of Education in the 1980's.  The daughter
said her mother said
started to go downhill when she left the job.  She attended "AA".  In the last
eight to ten years she lost "an
enormous amount of weight".  In April 1992
Rachel stayed with her mother in a "filthy flat" for two weeks.  She cleaned
the place.
 Her mother was "now" on marijuana (see also the history of Dr
Lal).
<P>

1003   	A Ms Leonie Burley, an enrolled nurse employed by the
Illawarra Aboriginal Medical Service described attending the plaintiff's
flat
since August 1997.  She described the plaintiff's flat as untidy, the
plaintiff's personal care as poor and complaining of inability
to cope.  There
has been "rapid" deterioration in her <u>mental</u> and physical condition
since about August 1998.  This is subsequent to the time when Dr Waters
considered that the plaintiff no longer
answered the majority criteria for
Borderline Personality Disorder.  The cause of this deterioration is complex
and I am unable to
find that the cause was due to any alleged default of the
defendant.
<P>

1004   	Ms Lovegrove, her "aged carer", was employed since March
1999 (before her admission to hospital) to assist the plaintiff
two hours per
week.  She assisted on a "voluntary basis" for about 5-7 hours per week from 3
March 1999.  Another carer assisted
the plaintiff on a voluntary basis for two
hours per week.  She said the plaintiff was on a pension.  She described the
plaintiff
as very thin.  She helped with shopping and tidying up.  Ms Lovegrove
expressed the opinion (prior to the plaintiff's admission to
hospital, that the
plaintiff needed 20 hours domestic assistance per week.  Her qualifications to
express such an opinion were not
revealed.  I do not accept her evaluation of
need in those terms, or that such can be attributed to any suggested default of
the
defendant.
<P>

1005   	Dr Twomey (13 April 1999) described the plaintiff as
being a voluntary patient in a psychiatric ward at Shellharbour Hospital.
 She
had been excessively anxious and was concerned about her son in gaol.  Her
weight had dropped in the last two to three years
from "98 kg to 47 kg".  She
has been diagnosed as having "hypoglycaemia" (the cause of which had not been
established).  He did not
undertake extensive investigations of weight loss or
hypoglycaemia.  The plaintiff appears thus to have lost almost half her weight
since 1997, and the issue was not addressed in terms of causation.  I do not
accept that the weight loss was due to any default of
the defendants.
<P>

1006   	In a report from Dial-an-Angel of 12 April 1999,
reference is made (at 2) to the plaintiff since 15 July 1995 having required
assistance and care from the Illawarra Aged Care Services.
<P>

1007   	A Mr Paul Aarons from the Illawarra Applied
Psychological Services provided an estimate of the cost of therapy from 19
December
1995 to November 1996.  The costs of one and a half hour consultations
(on average once a week) had been met by "TAFE".  There had
been some out of
time consultations between December 1995 and June 1996.  He estimated ongoing
therapy at forty private consultations
per year at $120, ie $4,800 per year.
His report deals with costs but is really silent on other matters.  What
services he has provided
all these years, their purpose and why and who was
referred for treatment is not clear.  Likewise, what is said as required to be
provided, and reasons for such is also left vague and uncertain.
<P>

1008   	The visits to Mr Aarons and the reasons for such raise
debatable issues.  In Dr Walker's report of 22 October 1997 (the
first time
sexual assaults at Lutanda were "ever" mentioned) there is a history given by
the plaintiff of starting to see Mr Paul
Aarons at a time she was attending a
"child protection course" as part of her studies in about 1994.  She recalls
being very distressed
by some of the course work which involved watching videos
about abusive institutions and also by class discussions in which people
talked
about "some of their own experiences".  The many years of frequent attendance
upon Paul Aarons are not satisfactorily established
in terms of proof of having
been caused by default of the defendant.  Further or alternatively, it has not
been established in terms
of "reasonable" need due to alleged injury caused by
any default of the defendants:  <b><u>Sharman  v  Evans</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20138%20CLR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 138 CLR
563.</a>
<P>

1009   	The plaintiff seeks to recover the costs of these
consultations.  It is not clear why she should recover any significant
sum on
the material before me.  The claims are not in the way formulated, made
good.
<P>

1010   	As to loss of earnings or earning capacity and ability
to work and working habits, this is a matter too addressed by Dr
Waters (at p 4
of his report of 22 October 1997).  I do not accept his qualifications to
express views or opinions on economic loss.
 It is these views substantially
relied upon by the plaintiff in her claim for loss of earning capacity founded
as they are upon
speculation, evidence unproved, assumptions and hypothesis.
The foundation for the views is not established.  His views are not supported
by my findings or by my views as to the reliability of the plaintiff.  I do not
accept his view "that the plaintiff (who he first
saw in 1991) would have
pursued a successful career without interruption apart from periods of
childbearing".  As I have said, the
factual foundations for such are not
proved, apart from Dr Waters lack of qualifications to express such a view.
The plaintiff's
case for loss of earning capacity is faced with considerable
evidentiary problems as well as for reasons, inter alia, advanced by
the
defendant's actuary.  If any modest sum should be awarded on this evidence it
should reflect value judgment and not, impossible,
mathematical calculation.
<P>

1011   	Generally, on the matter of the plaintiff's claim for
the cost of care, there are the views recently expressed by Dr Waters
that I
regard as unhelpful.
<P>

1012   	In a report of 20 April 1999 Dr Waters referred to the
materials that he relied upon as including an affidavit of Rachel
Williams,
affidavits of a Ms Burley, Ms Lovegrove, and a Ms Heine.  He also relied upon
reports extending back to 1991.  On this
basis he considered he was able to
deal with the need for care for five periods including extending back to 1965,
a period of 26
years before he first saw the plaintiff in 1991.  He did not
consider himself handicapped, disqualified or inhibited from expressing
retrospective views on the eve of the hearing (ie 20 April 1999) in terms of
preparing a report on the "need for care".  I do not
consider his approach to
be one that I should accept having regard to all the evidence.  Indeed, I do
not accept his approach including,
the "retrospect" approach to this assessment
of need.  What is reasonable need is for me to decide in all the circumstances.
Further
there is relatively little evidence of any actual care provided in the
period claimed, at least before 1997.  The evidentiary foundation
for any claim
for care apart from isolated periods has not been properly established.  Dr
Jones in the undated report does not refer
to it.  It is perhaps surprising
that Dr Waters did not address the issue before 1999, when he did so at the
plaintiff's solicitor's
request.
<P>

1013   	In terms of my assessment, the matter of composite
medical problems and difficulties and the respective role of each also
creates
difficulties for the plaintiff's case.  She has lost a great amount of weight,
is in a poor physical condition with the cause
still being explored.  The
prescription for care by Ms Burley or Ms Lovegrove is not supported.  They
first became involved in 1997.
 There is no adequate report from Dr Jones
dealing with the subject of care.  He (or his practice) was sin a position to
provide
such if appropriate from time to time since 1965.  Who recommended
care, when and why, including the need for future care is not
clear.  Further,
the declining capacity in the plaintiff since 1997 also seems to be at a time
when the Borderline Personality Disorder
was said not to have been present,
albeit there was a substance abuse problem in existence.  There is little
evidence as to past
need for care.  Dr Waters' future assessment, is but
speculative and not founded on evidence that I accept.  Further, the plaintiff
has not discharged the requisite onus of establishing that the defendant if
liable, should on the evidence be responsible for any
future care.  There has
been no real attempt in the plaintiff's case to discriminate between that
alleged to be due to that default
of the defendants and that which is not.  The
plaintiff's case in some ways can be stated in the terms that all "her" medical
problems
are the responsibility of the defendant.  The plaintiff carries the
relevant onus on matters of damage even if liability is established.
 The
matter of past care and future care calls not for finite calculations but some
value judgment.  Dr Ellard (19.4.1999) appears
to have accepted that the
plaintiff has a psychosis.  He suggested it had a number of explanations
perhaps more than one.  He referred
to problems with prescriptions of
medication since 1991 and diagnosis of drug abuse on several occasions.  He
thought that drug abuse
was the cause.  On the evidence I do not find the
psychosis (or drug abuse) was due to injury caused by the alleged fault of the
defendants, assuming I had found such.
<P>

1014   	I find Dr Waters' views on the need for care since 1965
of little assistance.  Whilst accepting his view in respect of 1986
to 1992 (as
being lacking in evidence), I do not accept his view that the plaintiff between
1965 and 1999 had any significant needs
for  <b><u>Griffiths  v
Kerkemeyer</u></b>  care.
<P>

1015   	Dr Waters has had not had regard to the views of Dr
Glenn (or Dr Lal) in terms of his assessment and current receipt of
monies for
disabilities for all her many conditions.  He did not suggest a care need.  He
understandably, did not have regard to
the whole of the evidence to which I
must and should have regard.  Dr Glenn in 1995 did not suggest any need for
care.  He assessed
a total disability for work in the open market of 20% due to
all conditions physical and psychiatric.  I do not see any reason to
disagree
with his then assessment for all conditions.  His independent view at the time
I accept.  That said, there are multiple
causes for that assessment.  Nor upon
reading Dr Jones' undated report do I find that on any occasion from 1986
onwards he had recommended
care.  I do not accept Dr Waters' evidence as
furnishing a proper evidentiary basis for care assessment.
<P>

1016   	Apart from the situation since 1997 (at a time when the
criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder was said to have been
no longer
present) when some care in fact has been provided to the plaintiff for complex
and composite reasons, but for which there
was then little contemporaneous
expert evidence diagnosing "a need", there is really limited evidence of any
actual care having been
provided in fact, save in terms of some assistance by
the daughter during part of her childhood.  Even then the care provided was
during a particular period of the alcohol abuse.
<P>

1017   	In making a contingent assessment of damages, I would
not assess damages as commencing prior to the plaintiff's first hospital
admission in 1962, nor extending past 1997, despite the ongoing presence of a
suggestion of drug abuse, which I do not accept on
the evidence should be found
to be due to any default of the defendants, had liability been found.  I would
have assessed general
damages in the sum of $50,000.  This assessment is
contingent, as I have already said.  It assumes, contrary to my view, that the
plaintiff suffered some damage at the default of the defendant,  It further
assumes that I am wrong in my general view that damages
may be so speculative
that they cannot be assessed at all.  The assessment also reflects the view
that the diagnostic criteria for
Borderline Personality Disorder were not
present with respect to the plaintiff in 1997.
<P>

<b>Past Interest</b>
<P>

1018   	Interest on the award of damages should be computed on
the basis that any hypothetical award for general damages is in respect
of a
period that commenced in 1962.
<P>

1019   	Because of the long period involved extending back to
1962, I grant liberty to the parties to apply in respect of an interest
claim.
The parties should endeavour to reach an agreement on "contingent" interest to
give effect to my reasons.  Since the period
is so long, consideration may have
to be given to the particular application of the principles in  <b><u>MBP (SA)
Pty Limited  v  Gogic</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 657</a> applied in
<b><u>Metropolitan Meat Industry Board  v  Williams</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR
54.</a>
<P>

<b>Care</b>
<P>

1020   	I have already discussed some of the relevant matters
when addressing the subject of general damages.  It was a convenient
course to
follow.  The principles relating to the assessment for care (past present and
future) do not need to be restated.  They
are to be found in the decision of
the High Court in  <b><u>Griffiths  v  Kerkemeyer</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 161.</a>
In this case I am prepared to accept that there was prior to 1997 perhaps some
"need" for care (incapable of mathematical calculation)
from time to time
actually met by the plaintiff's daughter, Rachel, in a somewhat vague and
general way when she was a girl.  The
identity of the person who provides the
care and services does not affect existence of the need or the plaintiff's
entitlement to
compensation for the proved loss giving rise to the need: see
<b><u>Kars  v  Kars</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20187%20CLR%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 187 CLR 354.</a>  A review of the whole of the
evidence, and the findings made as I have indicated, casts very considerable
doubt on whether a case
of needed care (even apart from the general absence of
actual provision of such) has been proved at all in consequence of any injury,
even were default to be established.  As I have said there is a paucity of
evidence as to actual care in fact provided at any time
before 1997 let alone
proof of any reasonable need for such.  What is recoverable is the reasonable
cost of services to address the
loss evidenced by need and involves considering
whether it was reasonably necessary to provide services to meet an injury
caused
need.  By way of value judgment I would have awarded a modest sum of
$10,000 to meet the matter of past need.  The issue of need
since 1997 is
rejected for reasons already discussed.  There is no medical evidence I accept
supporting need. it in terms of what
may have been caused by any hypothetical
default of the defendant(s) since 1997, or on the evidence into the future.
<P>

<b>Economic Loss</b>
<P>

1021   	It is not possible to attempt to achieve accuracy.  To
assess any loss other than in general terms would involve seeking
to provide an
accurate mathematical precision not reflecting the difficult hypothetical
assessment of damages.  Arithmetical calculation
of past losses in this case
cannot be achieved.  Any attempt to be precise, is on the evidence made
extremely difficult.  I have
decided value judgment in respect of any past
assessment called for.
<P>

1022   	The plaintiff claims that maternal deprivation and
Borderline Personality Disorder made it unlikely that she would be able
to
engage in regular continuous employment or to have sufficient psychological
health to do further study (except that she did in
the 1980's and 1990's).  I
reject this assertion and claim.  It is not one established or supported by the
actual evidence.  It is
not one that is to be attributed to any claimed default
of the defendants.  The plaintiff was able to study both when working and
when
she was not.  The plaintiff asserts that she endeavoured to work as a nurse's
aide but was not psychologically fit for such
work, that but for the Board's
negligence she would have trained as a nurse and worked as a nurse subject to
periods of child birth
and rearing.  It is argued that economic loss should not
be assessed by reference to her family or sibling situation, although why
such,
is or may be irrelevant as a matter of principle is not made clear.  Her
alleged Borderline Personality Disorder did not appear
to compromise her
intelligence (see the Binet test by Dr Cooley in 1960) nor her capacity for
higher training as indicated by her
later education and qualifications.  The
educational results which I accept, included the Intermediate Certificate.
They revealed
a capacity from the time the plaintiff left Lutanda to work as a
nurse's aide and to be trained as a nurse I do not accept that the
plaintiff
was denied a chance, or even a chance to any significant extent of progressing
in life, or really lost the opportunity
of being employed in a market
reasonably open to her with her qualifications in consequence of any alleged
default of the defendant.
<P>

1023   	The plaintiff may have perhaps lost some periods of
employment from time to time in the past but it is difficult to determine
such
on this evidence extending so far into the past.  The plaintiff's psychiatric
history too has been complex.  The economic loss
is that to be found due to
default of the defendants on the hypothesis it is liable.  Even were the
situation to be considered in
terms of  <b><u>Malec</u></b>  chances, the loss
of opportunity to claim past loss would in my view looking at all the evidence,
not be of real significance. 
The claim for economic loss save for perhaps
specific periods of hospitalisation is difficult to accept and I do not accept
it. 
Next, the cause of the "stress" as a reason for ceasing work is not
identified.  I also take into account as well, the fact that
in the 1980's and
1990's the plaintiff was involving herself in study and other activities, and
was not precluded from doing so by
any claimed psychiatric disorder.
<P>

1024   	I do not ignore  <b><u>Malec</u></b>.  I do not overlook
Dr Glenn's assessment of 20% "total disability pension entitlement for a
complex composite condition with many
physical and mental components".
<P>

1025   	However, when I look at the plaintiff's history in terms
of causation, I do not conclude that save for interrupted periods
of
unemployment particularly during periods of medical or hospital care until 1997
that the plaintiff has really made good her claim
for loss of earnings in the
past.  Alternatively, she has not established any loss as being due to the
defendants' default,  She
was not by any alleged default of the defendant
injury denied employment prospects, prospects of pursuing nursing avenues or
prospects
within her qualifications.  She did not lose an opportunity to earn
in a labour market reasonably open to her.  I find that no default
caused or
prevented the plaintiff in 1960 (or indeed 1962) from pursuing a career
involving training as a nurse or from pursuing
a career which her education and
intelligence had permitted her to do so.  If she wanted to she could have done
so.
<P>

1026   	I would have assessed a sum of $35,000 (reflecting very
much a value judgment) as being the amount for past economic loss,
had the
plaintiff been entitled to a verdict.  The parties are to bring in interest
calculations, if they wish to reflect these views
of past loss of earning
capacity.
<P>

<b>Loss of Superannuation</b>
<P>

1027   	The claim for loss of employer funded superannuation is
rejected essentially for reasons already given.
<P>

<b>Past Present and Future Expenses  (Medicine, Counselling etc)</b>
<P>

1028   	This is a matter I have addressed in general terms when
discussing the hypothetical assessment of general damages.
<P>

1029   	The need for counselling has not really been
established.  What services have in fact been provided, or on whose
recommendation,
is not made clear.  Why counselling over the years has been
needed is by no means clear.  Default aside, reasonable need has not
really
been established on the evidence:  <b><u>Sharman  v  Evans</u></b>  supra.
<P>

1030   	There is a claim for past medication (since 1963),
ongoing medication, counselling sessions and a monthly visit to the doctor.
 I
generally reject these claims in terms of causation and need.  The plaintiff
requires medical assistance for complex medical problems.
 The purpose of
ongoing counselling and reason for such is not clear.
<P>

1031   	The medical evidence touching on these matters is
somewhat scant.  There is no acceptable evidence and none from Mr Aarons
(the
counsellor) as to what he has been doing for the past years.  There is no
evidence as to the purposes or benefits of counselling
or why it is required in
the future.  In so concluding I have had regard to all the evidence since 1960
(almost 40 years).  I have
had regard to my findings and to the limited
evidence from the Illawarra Health Centre.  I have regard to the views of Dr
Waters,
who is not a treating expert.  Doing the best I can I propose to allow
the sum of $5,000 for past expenses.  Again this is a reflection
of a value
judgment.
<P>

<b>Cost of Fund Management</b>
<P>

1032   	The principles relating to the allowance of such a cost
are discussed by the High Court in its decision in the  <b><u>Nominal Defendant
v  Gardikiotis</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 49</a> per Gummow J.  Causation and need are
required to be met.  They are not in the instant case.  The claim should be
rejected even were
default established.
<P>

<b>Exemplary and Aggravatory Damages</b>
<P>

1033   	It is difficult to see any basis on which this claim was
even advanced at all.  It has somewhat emotive arguments advanced
in support of
it.  The claim and arguments are rejected.
<P>

1034   	The case is put that the plaintiff's life has been
impoverished not by a casual act of negligence on the part of the ephemeral
tortfeasors but by alleged deplorable conduct of a statutory body who had held
itself out as the statutory guardian to have regard
to the plaintiff's welfare
for a decade.  This argument, (including the factual foundation for it) should
be rejected as should the
claim based upon it.  There was no such conduct on
the part of the Board in any respect.  It is my finding that there was no
negligence
and that reasonable care has been exercised by the Board.  In any
event even if I be wrong, mere negligence does not establish any
entitlement.
<P>

1035   	The law in respect of an award of exemplary and
aggravatory damages is to be found in  <b><u>Lamb  v  Cotogno</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987)
164 CLR 1</a> (at 8).  The difference between aggravated damages and exemplary
damages was discussed in  <b><u>Trend Management Ltd  v  Borg</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996)
40 NSWLR 500</a> per Mahoney P at 503 and by the High Court in the recent decision
on the vexed question of exemplary damages in  <b><u>Gray  v  Motor Accident
Commission</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2073%20ALJR%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 73 ALJR 45:</a> see discussion in 73 ALJ at 402.
<P>

1036   	The suggestion for example that there is any conduct of
a sufficiently reprehensible kind, as to award damages to punish
and deter
needs merely to be stated to be rejected.  Here the Board in 1942 took over
control of the plaintiff because her mother
was unwilling or unable to be
involved in her upbringing.  Doing what was reasonably appropriate in the
circumstances it placed the
plaintiff with experienced carers (the UAM at
Bomaderry).  There she received care, comfort, devotion, attention, welfare
support,
maintenance and protection.  There was an advancement of her
interests.  The plaintiff was also transferred to Lutanda for her benefit,
welfare, protection and advancement.  There too, she received dedicated
support, attention, maintenance and care.  The Board properly
discharged its
statutory functions.  It performed its statutory duties with reasonable care.
Even if I am wrong and there was negligence,
there is no conceivable basis for
damages to punish or deter the defendants or to award aggravatory damages as
compensation.  Further,
even if the upbringing or care was not "good enough"
(and it was), or was even reflective of negligent error (which it was not).
The plaintiff's claim is without merit, and is rejected.
<P>

1037   	Had the plaintiff been entitled to any damages at all,
they would have been assessed by me in the total amount of $100,000
plus
interest.  In respect of interest, if they consider it appropriate then
interest calculations should be performed by them and
I grant liberty to
apply.
<P>

1038   	I conclude this assessment by again stating that it has
been performed contingently and only upon the basis stated at the
commencement.
My contingent assessment reasons apply only in the event that I am in error in
respect of my liability findings of
fact in one or more respects on the issue
of liability, and if I am also in error as to the highly speculative nature of
an assessment.
 Nothing I have written on the matter of assessment, should be
construed as suggesting any inconsistency with what I have said on
the issue of
liability.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

1.	Verdict and judgment for the defendants.

2.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

3.	Liberty to apply to all parties to put any further submissions
