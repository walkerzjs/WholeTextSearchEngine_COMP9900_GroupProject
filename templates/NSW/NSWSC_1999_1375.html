<u>Antanasios VALMAS  v  Trevor NYMAN</u><p>
010453/90<p>
Tuesday 12 November 1996<p>
SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION<p>
JAMES J<p>
<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<p>
<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   This is an action for damages for professional negligence
brought by Antanasios (Arthur) Valmas against Trevor Nyman, a solicitor.
 It
was alleged in the statement of claim that the plaintiff had retained the
defendant as his solicitor to advise him and to bring
court proceedings at
common law on his behalf for the recovery of damages for personal injuries
suffered by him in an accident which
occurred on 18 May 1983.  It was alleged
that on 18 May 1983 the plaintiff had been working at a building site at
Abbotsford in the
course of his employment by a man named Manuel Christianos
and that on that day a backhoe being operated by a man named Ignazio Pendino
struck him, causing him to fall from a wall thereby suffering personal
injuries.  It was further alleged that the accident on 18
May 1983 had occurred
as a result of negligence and breach of statutory duty by Christianos and
Pendino.  The plaintiff claimed that
the defendant had failed to commence
common law proceedings for the recovery of damages for the personal injuries
suffered by the
plaintiff in the accident, before the limitation period for
bringing such an action had expired on 18 May 1989 and had thereby been
negligent and had also committed a breach of an implied term of his retainer
that he would exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence
in acting for the
plaintiff.<p>
	The defendant did in fact cause common law proceedings for the recovery of
damages to be commenced against Christianos and Pendino
on 31 July 1989, that
is after the limitation period had expired.  At the same time as the statement
of claim in those proceedings
was filed, an application for an extension of the
limitation period was filed.  A defence was filed on behalf of Christianos and
Pendino, in which amongst other defences a defence based on the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></i> was pleaded.  The application for an extension of the limitation period
was not proceeded with and the proceedings generally were
not pursued.<p>
	The plaintiff subsequently brought a claim for workers compensation under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</i> <i>1987</a></i> against Christianos and also the
Work Cover Authority on the basis that Christianos was not insured against
liability under the Act.
 On 15 October 1990 Burke CCJ delivered a judgment in
which he found that on 18 May 1983 the plaintiff was employed by Christianos,
that on 18 May 1983 the arm of a backhoe being operated by Pendino had struck
the plaintiff causing him to fall from a wall, that
the plaintiff had suffered
injuries including a fracture of the sternum and a fracture of the fifth
thoracic vertebra, that up to
31 August 1986 the plaintiff had not demonstrated
any difference between his actual earnings and what he probably would have
earned
if uninjured, but that subsequently there had been such a difference.
Burke CCJ made an award of workers' compensation on the basis
of partial
incapacity from 1 September 1986 onwards.  I will refer to Burke CCJ's judgment
in more detail later in this judgment.<p>
	In the present proceedings the defendant, Mr Nyman, admitted in his defence
that he had been retained by the plaintiff as alleged
by the plaintiff and that
by failing to commence proceedings at common law against Christianos and
Pendino within the limitation
period he had breached an implied term of his
retainer and had also been negligent.  Hence, the hearing before me was
confined to
an assessment of the damages which should be awarded to the
plaintiff as a result of the admitted breaches of duty by the defendant.
 There
was no suggestion that any distinction should be drawn, so far as the
assessment of damages was concerned, between the cause
of action in contract
and the cause of action in tort.  The plaintiff claimed two kinds of damages,
namely:-<p>
1.	Damages to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of the chance of recovering
damages in the common law proceedings which should
have been brought on his
behalf against Christianos and Pendino before the limitation period expired.
It will be convenient to refer
to the action which should have been brought as
"the lost action" and to this first kind of damages as "the lost action
damages".
 <p>
2.	Damages to compensate the plaintiff for not having had his claims arising
out of the accident determined in the lost action and
for having had to bring
the present proceedings.  It will be convenient to refer to this second kind of
damages as "the further damages".
 <p>
	As regards the lost action damages, in <b>Scott  v  Echegaray</b> (1991) Aust
Torts Repts 69, 129, a case of an action against a solicitor for damages for
professional negligence for failing to commence
common law proceedings on
behalf of an injured worker, it was held by Mahoney JA, with whose judgment
Gleeson CJ and Kirby P agreed,
that the trial judge had not erred in adopting
an approach that he should assess (a) the value of the injured worker's right
to sue
at common law at the relevant time and (b) the value of his rights under
the  Workers' Compensation Legislation and should then deduct
(b) from (a).
Mahoney JA observed that in the ordinary course it would have been necessary
for the parties to establish matters (a)
and (b) by the evidence of experts but
that the parties had made an agreement which was to be taken as entitling the
judge to make
the relevant assessment of the value of the common law and
workers' compensation rights, by the application of his own knowledge
and
experience.  Similarly, in the present case, it was agreed by the parties that
there would be no need to call expert evidence
to enable an assessment of the
lost action damages and that I should assess the value of the plaintiff's right
to sue at common law
at the relevant time and the value of the plaintiff's
rights under the Workers' Compensation Legislation, without it being necessary
for evidence to be called from qualified persons expressing opinions about the
value of those rights.<p>
	It was common ground that the assessment of damages in an action for
professional negligence against a solicitor, where by reason
of the solicitor's
negligence the client has lost the benefit of a court action which he might
successfully have brought, is governed
by the decisions of the High Court in
<b>Johnson  v  Perez</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%2d89%29%20166%20CLR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988-89) 166 CLR 351</a> and <b>Nikolaou  v  Papasavas
(</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%2d89%29%20166%20CLR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988-89) 166 CLR 395.</a>  <b>Johnson  v  Perez</b> contains a fuller
discussion of the principles to be applied.  However, <b>Nikolaou</b>  v
<b>Papasavas</b> is more directly applicable because in that case, as in the
present, the benefit of the action had been lost through the client's
cause of
action becoming statute barred before any proceedings were commenced.  In
<b>Johnson  v  Perez</b> proceedings which had been commenced were, by reason
of the solicitor's negligence, dismissed for want of prosecution.   In
<b>Nikolaou  v  Papasavas</b> Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in their
joint judgment said that the loss flowing from the negligence of the solicitors
crystallised
at the date when the cause of action against the solicitors arose,
that is when the claim for damages against the original tortfeasor
became
statute barred.  Their Honours said at p404:-<p>
<p>
"For reasons which are set out in some detail in <b>Johnson  v  Perez</b>, his
Honour should first have focused on Mr Nikolaou's situation when his claim for
damages for personal injuries became statute
barred.  He should have assessed
damages by reference to the loss at that date of the right to claim damages.
That loss would ordinarily
be quantified by the trial judge taking a broad
brush approach to the several matters that in a particular case may require to
be
resolved - the likely date when in the absence of the negligence of the
solicitor the action would have come to trial, the evidence
that would or
should have been available to the plaintiff at that time, the relevant
principles of law then governing the assessment
of damages, the question of
contributory negligence, and (an issue which would not be a problem in the
present case) the prospects
of any judgment given in favour of the plaintiff
being satisfied - in order to arrive at a figure representing the loss suffered
by the plaintiff..."<p>
<p>
	In the present case, it was agreed by the parties that the date at which a
notional trial in the lost action would have been heard
could be taken to be 30
June 1992.  Accordingly, in determining what loss the plaintiff suffered at the
time his causes of action
against Christianos and Pendino became statute
barred, I have to take into account what evidence would or should have been
available
at the time of a notional trial held on 30 June 1992 and what
principles of law would have governed the assessment of damages as
at 30 June
1992.  In <b>Nikolaou  v  Papasavas</b> there was an agreement between the
parties which the High Court said had been treated as amounting to an agreement
that Mr Nikolaou
would have recovered in the lost action 75 percent of the
damages to which he was otherwise entitled.  However, it is clear that,
in the
absence of such an agreement, a court has to assess the chances that the
plaintiff would have succeeded in the lost action,
the chances in the lost
action of a finding that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory
negligence and the chances of the
plaintiff actually succeeding in recovering
the amount of any judgment in his favour.  The lost action was never brought
and there
was never any trial of the lost action.  Hence, whether the plaintiff
would have succeeded in obtaining a verdict in the lost action,
whether there
would have been a finding of contributory negligence in the lost action and
whether the plaintiff would have succeeded
in recovering the amount of any
verdict given in the lost action are all hypothetical and it is necessary to
assess the degree of
probability that such hypothetical events would have
occurred.  <b>Malec  v  JC Hutton Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a> especially
at 643.  <p>
	In the present case, as regards the first kind of damages claimed (that is the
lost action damages), counsel for the defendant disputed
that the plaintiff
would have succeeded in obtaining a verdict in the lost action, contended that
in the lost action there would
have been a finding of contributory negligence
against the plaintiff, disputed in many respects the claims for damages made on
behalf
of the plaintiff and contended that any damages which might have been
awarded to the plaintiff in the lost action would not have
been recoverable.
It is accordingly necessary to assess:-<p>
1.	What chance or degree of probability the plaintiff would have had of
recovering a verdict in the lost action (the issue of liability
in the lost
action).<p>
2.	What chance or degree of probability there would have been of a finding of
contributory negligence in the lost action (the issue
of contributory
negligence in the lost action).<p>
3.	The damages which would have been recoverable in the lost action (the issue
of damages in the lost action).<p>
4.	What chance or degree of probability the plaintiff would have had of
actually recovering any damages he was awarded in the lost
action (the issue of
the prospects of recovery of damages awarded in the lost action).<p>
	I will deal with each of these issues in turn.<p>
1.	<b>The Issue of Liability in the Lost Action</b>.<p>
	In the statement of claim in the present proceedings it was alleged that the
accident of 18 May 1983 had been caused by the negligence
of each of
Christianos and Pendino and by breaches of statutory duty by each of them.
Similar causes of action had been pleaded in
the statement of claim in the
abortive common law proceedings in 1989.  <p>
	Accordingly, in the present proceedings it was submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff that in the lost action the plaintiff would
have succeeded in
recovering a verdict on one or more of the following causes of action:-<p>
	(i)	Against Pendino for negligence in permitting part of the backhoe being
operated by him to strike the plaintiff.<p>
	(ii)	Against Christianos for breach of an obligation at common law to exercise
reasonable care to provide a safe system of work
and a safe place of work.<p>
	(iii)	Against Christianos for breaches of regs73(1), 73(3), 74 and 77A of the
<i>Construction Safety Regulations</i> under the <i>Construction Safety
Act</i>, 1912.<p>
	(iv)	Against Christianos as being vicariously liable for the negligence of
Pendino.<p>
	Before dealing with each of these causes of action, it is necessary to refer
to some of the evidence which should have been available
at the date of the
notional trial on the issue of liability in the lost action.<p>
	The plaintiff gave evidence in the present proceedings that at the time of the
accident he carried on a business of providing the
services of tradesmen to
builders, he doing many of the jobs himself.  At the end of 1982 he had been
employed by Christianos as
a supervisor for a wage of $450 per week to work on
a project of Christianos's at Abbotsford for the building of sixteen town
houses.
 The plaintiff's evidence about the happening of the accident on 18 May
1983 was brief, disjointed and assisted by some leading by
his counsel.
However, he gave evidence that he had been standing on a wall at the Abbotsford
building site, when he was struck on
the head by part of a backhoe (sometimes
described as a bobcat) being operated by Pendino.  The plaintiff had not seen
the part of
the backhoe before it struck him.  After being struck the plaintiff
fell from the wall a distance of about fifteen feet, landing
near the base of
the wall.  When the plaintiff was struck by the backhoe, Pendino was performing
an operation he had performed many
times before without accident, of excavating
rubbish or dirt from a hole, swinging the arm and bucket of the backhoe so as
to dump
the rubbish and then swinging the arm and the bucket of the backhoe
back to where the rubbish was.  Pendino had been at the building
site "on and
off", working for a week or two, then leaving and then coming back.
Christianos had arranged for Pendino to work at
the site and had introduced
Pendino to the plaintiff, saying that Pendino was going to operate the backhoe
at the site.<p>
	In cross-examination the plaintiff said that he had been the supervisor and
had been the only one on the job to give instructions.
 He had thought it was
safe for him to stand on the wall because he had done it many time before
without falling.   There was a drop
on one side of the wall only.  He denied
that anyone had previously told him when he stood on the wall that he should
get down. 
<p>
	In cross-examination the plaintiff said that he did not actually see that it
was the backhoe (or bobcat) which hit him.  He denied
that he had just fallen
off the wall, without being struck by anything.  He was asked, "and I'm
suggesting you don't know whether
you were hit by the bobcat or not, do you?"
and he answered "I know because something hit me, something but I don't know if
it was
a bobcat or anything else".  He was asked, "can you tell his Honour how
you say the bobcat could have hit you without you seeing
it?" and he answered
"because you can't see all the time, the bucket came up".<p>
	The plaintiff called two witnesses to the accident, Mr Sleiman and Mr Daoud.<p>
	Mr Sleiman said that on the day of the accident he had been working as a
concrete formworker at the Abbotsford site about seven
to ten metres away from
the plaintiff and in a position about four or five metres higher.  Mr Sleiman
saw the backhoe take dirt out
of a hole, dump it and then "I heard something.
I watch and I see Mr Valmas fall down and the machine hit him a little bit".
It was
the arm of the backhoe which hit Mr Valmas on the head.  The plaintiff
fell down from a wall a distance of up to three metres.<p>
	In cross-examination Mr Sleiman agreed that it was a noise that first caught
his attention.  At the request of counsel for the defendant
Mr Sleiman drew a
sketch of the accident site and agreed that the backhoe was on the other side
of the wall from where he was.  He
agreed that at the time he was engaged in
setting up form work for concreting.  He agreed that in a statement he had
given to the
plaintiff's solicitors he had said that he had heard a noise and
then looked around.  However, he maintained that he had seen the
backhoe hit
the plaintiff.  He was asked, "why then did you say to Mr Valmas's solicitors
that you heard a noise and looked around,
if you, in fact, saw him being hit by
the backhoe?" and he answered "how to explain to you.  I was there and when I
look by accident
I see the backhoe working and him fall down.  Straight away I
see him, you know, like hit him.  And I am not sure.  It is thirteen
years.  I
can't remember.  I don't lie.  I say the truth."  Mr Sleiman agreed in
cross-examination that he had been very unhappy
that Mr Christianos has
reported him once to the police. <p>
	Mr Daoud gave evidence that on the day of the accident he also had been a
formworker at the building site at Abbotsford.  The plaintiff
had been standing
on a wall 2.7 metres high.  Mr Daoud said that the backhoe "come back and hit
him (that is the plaintiff) behind
the head and collapse the garage, ground
level".<p>
	A statement made by Mr Daoud to the plaintiff's solicitors in January 1988 was
admitted into evidence pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">s64(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  I had
grave doubts whether I should admit the statement because of the long lapse in
time between May 1983 and January 1988 and
I have decided that I should not
give any weight to the statement.<p>
	In cross-examination Mr Daoud claimed to have a very good recollection of the
scene of the accident.  He said, "I said I remember
'till I die.  Is a
photograph of my eye, I never forget that".  Mr Daoud agreed that at the time
of the accident he was setting up
formwork but he said, "You don't close eyes
when waiting to hand timber to me" and "I was standing facing, I am on high
view, facing
him where the digger is digging".<p>
	The following passage occurred in the cross-examination of Mr Daoud:-<p>
<p>
	"Q.	And what I suggest to you is you have just assumed that the backhoe hit
him?<p>
	A.	Yes.<p>
<p>
	Q.	What I am putting to you is that when you saw him fall, you thought he must
have been hit by the backhoe?<p>
	A.	My eye was on him because he on lower position and I on high position, the
backhoe wanted to turn and it hit in the head".<p>
<p>
	In re-examination Mr Daoud said that he did not know the meaning of the word
"assume". <p>
	All of the plaintiff, Mr Sleiman and Mr Daoud were asked by counsel for the
defendant to draw sketches of the scene of the accident
and the positions of
the various persons involved.  There are a number of discrepancies between the
sketches.<p>
	In the defence case Mr Christianos said that on 18 May 1983 he had seen the
plaintiff standing on top of a wall.  He said that he
had "many times" told the
plaintiff to come down from the wall but the plaintiff had always refused,
saying that he had been a builder
for thirty-five years.  Mr Christianos did
not actually see the plaintiff fall off the wall.  He said that he had had a
dispute with
Mr Sleiman and Mr Daoud, that Mr Sleiman had got a gun and that Mr
Christianos had been obliged to call the police.<p>
	In cross-examination Mr Christianos agreed that there was no handrail,
scaffolding, safety belt or safety harness, safety net or
barriers provided for
anyone standing on the wall.  In cross-examination Mr Christianos was asked
questions about the signature purporting
to be his appearing in the affidavit
verifying the defence in the abortive proceedings in 1989.  There was a
progression in Mr Christianos's
evidence from "this looks like my signature" to
"I don't think it is exactly" to "I don't think the signature is mine" to "I
would
say 100 percent it is not mine".  It had been put to Mr Christianos that
he did not wish to admit that the signature was his, because
in the particulars
of the defence of contributory negligence pleaded in the defence there is no
allegation that he had warned the
plaintiff to get down from the wall.<p>
	Mr Pendino gave evidence through an Italian interpreter.  He said that on 18
May 1983 he had been operating a backhoe at the Abbotsford
site.  He saw the
plaintiff on top of a wall three metres high.  When he was asked what he saw
happen to the plaintiff he said, "he
just bend on that side... he went down on
the ground".  Mr Pendino said that the arm of the backhoe was not fully
extended and the
bucket was about nine metres away from the plaintiff.<p>
	When asked in cross-examination when after 18 May 1983 he had first been asked
to recall the events of 18 May 1983 he said about
two weeks before giving
evidence, when an investigator came to his home.  <p>
	In cross-examination Mr Pendino denied that the backhoe being operated by him
had hit the plaintiff.  He said that the arm of the
backhoe was four to five
metres long and that the bucket itself was about half a metre long.  He said
that the backhoe was a registered
vehicle and could be driven on roads. The
following questions and answers occurred in the cross-examination:-<p>
<p>
	Q.	Did Mr Valmas tell you to do the digging job?<p>
	A.	No.<p>
<p>
	Q.	He was the supervisor on the site wasn't he?<p>
	A.	Yes but was the proprietor that wanted that hole dug.  He asked me to do
it.  <p>
<p>
	Q.	Mr Valmas was supervising your doing it, wasn't' he?<p>
	A.	He was on top of the wall.  Maybe he wanted to come and have a look.<p>
<p>
	Q.	He was supervising you, wasn't he?<p>
	A.	This is a question that has to be asked to the proprietor, not to me.  I
don't know these things.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Didn't he give you some directions while you were operating the backhoe?<p>
	A.	Not to me."<p>
<p>
	Elsewhere in the cross-examination Mr Pendino said that Mr Christianos had
asked the plaintiff to come down from the wall.  He agreed
in cross-examination
that there was a flat area level with the top of the wall on which the
plaintiff was standing but it was left
entirely unclear how close this flat
area was to where the plaintiff was standing.<p>
	After this review of some of the evidence on the issue of liability I turn to
a consideration of the various causes of action.<p>
	<b>(i)	The cause of action against Mr Pendino.</b><p>
	The principal issue of fact in a trial of the cause of action in negligence
against Mr Pendino would have been whether the plaintiff
was struck by some
part of the backhoe being operated by Mr Pendino, causing the plaintiff to fall
from the top of the wall to the
ground, or whether the plaintiff simply fell
from the top of the wall, without having been struck by the backhoe.  If the
plaintiff
was caused to fall by being struck by some part of the backhoe, a
conclusion that Mr Pendino was negligent in operating the backhoe,
for example
by not keeping any proper lookout, would readily follow.<p>
	In the present proceedings the plaintiff, Mr Sleiman and Mr Daoud gave
evidence which, if it had been given in the trial of the
lost action and had
been accepted by the tribunal of fact, would have supported a finding that the
plaintiff was struck by the backhoe.
 Mr Christianos did not claim to have seen
the plaintiff fall.  Mr Pendino denied that the plaintiff was struck by the
backhoe. 
<p>
	Certain criticisms are common to the evidence of all of these witnesses.  None
of them was a native English speaker and all of them
had difficulties of
varying degrees in understanding and answering the questions they were asked.
Mr Pendino, as I have already mentioned,
gave his evidence through an
interpreter.  All the witnesses were in giving evidence of what had happened on
18 May 1983 attempting
to give evidence about what had happened on a day
thirteen years previously.  None of them had made a contemporaneous record of
what
had happened.  None of the sketches any of them drew while giving evidence
is such as to inspire any real confidence in its accuracy.
 Their evidence
about distances and dimensions and positions tended to be incoherent.  There
were no other witnesses and no photographs
of the scene of the accident.<p>
	The evidence of the witnesses for the plaintiff is open to criticism.  Without
attempting to be exhaustive, the plaintiff, while
maintaining that something
hit him admitted that he did not know whether it was the backhoe.  Mr Sleiman
accepted in cross-examination
that he was engaged in the task of setting up
formwork at the time of the accident, that it was a noise he heard which first
caught
his attention (suggesting that he had not really seen the backhoe hit
the plaintiff), that he was working on the other side of the
wall from the
backhoe and his view was partly obscured.  Mr Sleiman became very unsure in
parts of his cross-examination and he agreed
that he had been "very unhappy"
with Mr Christianos.  Mr Daoud was inappropriately emphatic about the vividness
of his recall of
an incident which happened thirteen years previously and he
also had been engaged in fixing formwork at the time of the accident.<p>
	Mr Christianos, as I have already stated, did not claim to have actually seen
the plaintiff fall off the wall.<p>
	It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that I should not accept Mr
Pendino's denial that the backhoe hit the plaintiff. 
 Counsel criticised Mr
Pendino on the basis that he had given grudging, conflicting evidence about
whether during an adjournment
while he was under cross-examination he had had a
conference with Mr Christianos who had already given evidence, that he had
given
conflicting evidence on whether the backhoe had hydraulic controls, that
his denial that he had been served with the statement of
claim in the abortive
1989 proceedings should not be accepted, that if his own evidence was to be
accepted he had first attempted
to recall what had happened on 18 May 1983 only
very recently, that Mr Pendino had been named as a defendant in the abortive
1989
proceedings and had an interest in denying that there had been any
negligence on his part.  I consider that there is some force in
these
criticisms.  Counsel for the plaintiff criticised other parts of Mr Pendino's
evidence but I consider that most of these parts
of Mr Pendino's evidence can
be explained on the basis of breakdowns in communication between the questioner
and the witness, questions
and answers having to be transmitted through an
interpreter.  <p>
	I have concluded that the combined weight of the evidence of the plaintiff, Mr
Sleiman and Mr Daoud would probably have been sufficient
to satisfy a tribunal
of fact in a trial of the lost action held on 30 June 1992, that the plaintiff
was caused to fall by being
struck by some part of the backhoe being operated
by Mr Pendino.  There is no evidence to the contrary from Mr Christianos.  Mr
Pendino's
evidence generally is to a high degree unsatisfactory.<p>
	I conclude that there is a very high degree of probability that the plaintiff
would have succeeded in obtaining a verdict against
Mr Pendino in the lost
action.  <p>
	<b>(ii) The cause of action against Mr Christianos for breach of an obligation
at common law to exercise reasonable care to provide a
safe system of work and
a safe place of work.</b><p>
	It was expressly conceded by counsel for the defendant in written submissions
that a duty was owed by Mr Christianos to the plaintiff
to provide a safe
system of work and a safe place of work.  However, it was submitted that the
plaintiff was wholly responsible for
the system of work obtaining at the
Abbotsford site, in that Mr Christianos had no building experience and had
engaged the plaintiff
to organise the job, the plaintiff had assumed the role
of supervisor and the plaintiff was the only person at the site who gave
instructions.  Counsel cited <b>Nicol  v  All Yacht Spas Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/68.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 68</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20163%20CLR%20611" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987)
163 CLR 611</a> at 618.  <p>
	I note, however, that <b>Nichol  v  All Yacht Spas Pty Limited</b> itself was
a case in which the High Court held unanimously that an employee was not
disabled from complaining that a system of work
was unsafe on the ground that
it had been devised by him.  There is no doubt that the plaintiff was acting as
a supervisor for Mr
Christianos and he said in cross-examination that he was
the only person to give instructions.  However, his evidence that he was
the
only person to give instructions is at variance with the evidence of Mr
Pendino, at least some of which on this particular point
I am disposed to
accept.  Mr Pendino insisted that it was the proprietor who asked Mr Pendino to
excavate the hole and that the plaintiff
had not given Mr Pendino any
directions while he was operating the backhoe.<p>
	I have concluded that I should find that the plaintiff was not wholly
responsible for the system of work in force at the site and
that in a notional
trial of the lost action there is a very high degree of probability that a
tribunal of fact would have held that
Mr Christianos owed a duty to the
plaintiff to provide a safe system of work and a safe place of work.  I have
further concluded
that there is a high degree of probability that a tribunal of
fact would have held that Mr Christianos breached that duty by not
taking some
of the precautions of the kind put to him in cross-examination by counsel for
the plaintiff and that this breach caused
the accident.  No argument on this
aspect of the case other than the argument based on <b>Nichol  v  All Yacht
Spas Pty Limited</b> was advanced by counsel for the defendant in his extensive
written submissions.<p>
	<b>(iii)	Causes of action against Mr Christianos for breach of statutory
duty.</b><p>
<b></b>	I accept submissions by counsel for the defendant that regs73(1), 74
and 77A of the <i>Construction Safety Regulations</i> would not have applied in
the present case, on the basis that the work to be done by the plaintiff was
not work which could not be
done by a person standing on a permanent or solid
construction (reg73(1)), on the basis that there was not a risk that the
plaintiff
might fall for want of an adequate foot hold (reg74(1)) and on the
basis that there was not a need for scaffolding so that brick
laying work could
be carried out by persons standing on the scaffolding.  <p>
	Subject to one submission to the contrary, counsel for the defendant accepted
that reg73(3) bound Mr Christianos and would have
applied in the present case,
in that the plaintiff was working at a place from which he would be liable to
fall a distance of more
than 1.8 metres.  It was implicitly accepted by counsel
that if the Regulation applied there had been a breach of the Regulation.
 The
only submission put by counsel for the defendant was based on what Herron J
said in <b>Peterson  v  General Constructions Pty Limited</b> (1961) 61 SR 242
at 246:-<p>
<p>
	"I think there may be cases in which persons who are working in such a fashion
as that might stand outside the protection of the
Regulations if by their
conduct they have shown to have gone beyond the course of their employment or
in some way acted so irresponsibly
as not to be covered by the Regulations".<p>
<p>
	I would not accept that this exception applies to the present case.  In
standing on the top of the wall the plaintiff was acting
in the course of his
employment as a supervisor so as to discharge his functions as a supervisor.
There is no suggestion that he
was acting for some purpose of his own beyond
the course of his employment.  Nor was he acting so irresponsibly as not to be
covered
by the Regulations.  <p>
	In my opinion, there is a high degree of probability that at the notional
trial the plaintiff would have succeeded in a cause of
action based on a breach
of reg73(3).<p>
	<b>(iv)	The cause of action against Mr Christianos as being vicariously liable
for the negligence of Mr Pendino.</b><p>
	I have already found that there is a high degree of probability that in a
trial of the lost action the court would have found that
Mr Pendino had been
negligent.  Whether Mr Christianos would have been found vicariously liable for
Mr Pendino's negligence would
have depended on whether there was a relationship
of employer/employee between Mr Christianos and Mr Pendino.  If there was, Mr
Pendino's
negligence clearly would have occurred in the course of such
employment.<p>
	The evidence on whether there was a relationship of employer/employee between
Mr Christianos and Mr Pendino is meagre.  I do not
consider that I can do more
than say that there would have been some likelihood that an employer/employee
relationship could have
been established in a trial of the lost action.  The
evidence given in the present proceedings includes that Mr Christianos engaged
Mr Pendino.  Mr Christianos was usually on the site.  Mr Christianos directed
Mr Pendino to dig the hole.  To the extent that the
plaintiff supervised Mr
Pendino the plaintiff was acting as Mr Christianos's employee.<p>
2.	<b>The Issue of Contributory Negligence in the Lost Action</b>.<p>
	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that at a notional trial there
would have been a finding of contributory negligence
against the plaintiff, on
the basis that the plaintiff had continued to stand on the top of a wall from
which he was liable to fall
a substantial distance, despite having been told
many times by Mr Christianos to come down from the wall, and on the basis that,
if he did not see such a large object as the arm of the backhoe before it
struck him, he must have been failing to keep a proper
lookout.<p>
	It was conceded by counsel for the defendant that contributory negligence was
not legally available as a defence in the cause of
action against Mr
Christianos for breach of the statutory duty imposed by reg73(3) of the
<i>Construction Safety Regulations</i>.  <p>
	As regards the contributory negligence alleged, I do not consider that it was
negligent of the plaintiff as a building supervisor
to stand on the top of a
retaining wall of a building under construction.  I do not accept Mr
Christianos's evidence that Mr Christianos
told the plaintiff many times or at
all to come down from the top of the wall.  I formed an unfavourable view of Mr
Christianos's
credibility generally and I consider it is of significance that
there is no such allegation in the particulars of contributory negligence
by
the plaintiff alleged in the defence to the 1989 proceedings, which I am
satisfied was verified by Mr Christianos.  I consider
that the plaintiff could
reasonably expect that Mr Pendino, an experienced backhoe operator, who was
performing an operation with
the backhoe which he had performed many times
before without accident, would so control the backhoe as not to strike a
clearly visible
person standing on the top of a wall.<p>
	I conclude that there is little chance that at a notional trial the amount of
the plaintiff's verdict would have been reduced by
a finding of contributory
negligence.<p>
<b>3.	The Issue of Damages in the Lost Action</b><p>
	Earlier in this judgment I referred to the decisions of the High Court in
<b>Johnson  v  Perez</b>, <b>Nikolaou  v Papasavas</b> and <b>Malec  v  JC
Hutton Pty Limited</b> and to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <b>Scott
v  Echegaray</b>;  to the agreement between the parties that the date of the
notional trial in the lost action could be taken to be 30 June 1992;
 and to
the agreement between the parties that I should assess the value of the
plaintiff's right to sue at common law at the relevant
time and the value of
the plaintiff's rights under the <i>Workers Compensation Legislation</i>,
without the need for expert evidence to be called.  Before endeavouring to
apply the principles stated in the cases I have just
referred to, I will refer
to some of the evidence in the case relevant to the damages which would have
been recoverable in the lost
action. <p>
	The plaintiff gave evidence that he was born on 8 August 1934 in Greece.  He
was accordingly forty-eight years old at the time of
the accident, would have
been fifty-seven years old at the time of the notional trial and is now
sixty-two years old.<p>
	The plaintiff worked in the building trades in Greece, apart from a period in
the Greek army.  He migrated to Australia in January
1962.  From about mid 1963
he worked in Australia in the building industry.  Between 1969 and 1974 the
plaintiff travelled overseas,
combining travel with periods of work.  In 1975
(in one part of the transcript the date is inaccurately transcribed as 1965)
the
plaintiff obtained a licence from the Builders' Licensing Board.  In 1976
he started up his own business, providing building tradesmen
to builders, doing
much of the work himself.<p>
	I have already referred to the plaintiff's evidence about the accident on 18
May 1983.<p>
	After the accident the plaintiff recovered consciousness in Balmain Hospital.
He had been taken to Balmain Hospital by ambulance.
 He was discharged from
Balmain Hospital after having been in hospital for a period between one and two
weeks.  He felt pain in his
chest, back and neck.  He had trouble with his
breathing.  He denied that he had had any problems with his breathing before
the accident.<p>
	About two to three weeks after the accident the plaintiff returned to working
for Mr Christianos and he continued working for Mr
Christianos until June 1984.
He continued to be paid $450 per week by Mr Christianos.  In one part of his
evidence the plaintiff
said that after the accident he was unable to continue
carrying on his own business but elsewhere in his evidence he said that he
did
some work in his own business after the accident.<p>
	The plaintiff said in evidence that in about 1981 or 1982 he had lost between
$43,000 and $47,000, when a building owner with whom
he had a contract did not
pay him and the plaintiff was unsuccessful in a subsequent arbitration.  <p>
	Between 1986 and 1990 the plaintiff received sickness benefits and since the
award made by Burke CCJ in 1990 he has been receiving
periodical workers
compensation payments.  <p>
	The plaintiff asserted that he still feels pain in his chest, spine and neck,
that if he tries to lift anything he feels pain, that
he has difficulty in
turning his head and that he suffers from headaches.  He has not worked since
1986.<p>
	In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed that after he returned to work for
Mr Christianos after the accident, he had worked for
him for more than a year
for the same pay, supervising the construction of the town houses at Abbotsford
and performing such functions
as employing tradesmen, checking on the rate at
which the tradesmen were working, checking on the standard of their work and
dealing
with complaints by the owner.  He had been able to manage such physical
work as was required, which was not like the constant heavy
work involved in
working full-time as a brick layer or a concreter. Mr Christianos had never
complained about the plaintiff's performance.
 The plaintiff was asked "and of
course that was the sort of thing that you could have kept doing after 1986,
isn't is, that sort
of supervision?" to which he replied "exactly".  Later in
his evidence the plaintiff said that the sort of work he was doing for
Mr
Christianos he could do, even with the problems he has with his chest and back
since the accident.<p>
	After the plaintiff stopped working for Mr Christianos he undertook the
building of a couple of houses on his own account.  However,
on these jobs he
had problems with his chest and back.  He was unable to do any of the physical
work himself and had to engage tradesmen
to do all the work and at the end of
each job the plaintiff found that there was no profit for him.<p>
	In 1986 the plaintiff decided not to continue working.  He did not ask Mr
Christianos for another job as a supervisor because Mr
Christianos had moved
interstate.    When asked whether he could have applied for a job as a building
supervisor the plaintiff said,
"No, I didn't ask because my English is still
not 100 percent and I am too old".  He added, "the job I doing for Mr
Christianos -
nobody can give it to me".  The plaintiff accepted, as is
obvious, that he has very long experience and considerable skills in the
building industry.<p>
	The plaintiff was asked a number of questions in cross-examination about
whether his job with Mr Christianos was unusual, in that
he was an employee and
not a contractor.  He was asked, "that normally you did it the way you said
earlier that is that you were
the contractor rather than being paid a fixed
weekly amount, is that so?" to which he replied "Yes".  The plaintiff said, "I
wouldn't
mind if I worked for wages or if I work on my own job".  But his
preference was for working for himself.  He agreed that he made
more money if
he organised a building job himself.<p>
	The plaintiff was cross-examined about his income tax returns.  The income tax
returns state that the plaintiff's net income as
a building contractor in the
year ended 30 June 1980 was $8,447, in the year ended 30 June 1981 was $4,033,
in the year ended 30
June 1982 was in fact a loss of $15,961, that his net
income as a building contractor and an employee in the year ended 30 June 1983
was in fact a loss of $6,240, that his net income as a building contractor in
the year ended 30 June 1984 was a loss of $12,540,
that his net income as a
building contractor and an employee in the year ended 30 June 1985 was $43,
that his net income as a building
contractor in the year ended 30 June 1986 was
in fact a loss of $1,835 and that his net income in the year ended 30 June 1987
was
$4,403 consisting of sickness benefits.  <p>
	All the plaintiff's income tax returns were prepared by the same firm of
accountants.  In his cross-examination the plaintiff said
that he had kept
records, provided information to the accountant including information about any
cash received and had then left
it to the accountant to prepare the income tax
returns.  For several years no income tax return had been prepared and then in
one
year, which appears to have been 1987, a number of returns were prepared.
The plaintiff claimed not to have been aware that many
of his income tax
returns showed losses.  In re-examination he said that before the accident he
had had enough money to provide for
himself and his family.<p>
	In the discharge summary from Balmain Hospital it is recorded that there was
an anterior displacement of the lower half of the plaintiff's
sternum and that
there was anterior compression of the mid thoracic vertebral body, probably
T-6, consistent with a recent fracture.<p>
	The first medical practitioner the plaintiff saw after being discharged from
Balmain Hospital was a general practitioner with a
surgical qualification, Dr
Selvaraj, who made an after hours visit to the plaintiff on 30 May 1983. Dr
Selvaraj's contemporaneous
note of this visit records no more than the fact of
the visit.  <p>
	The plaintiff had been a general patient of Dr Selvaraj's since January 1982
and after the accident the plaintiff continued to see
Dr Selvaraj for medical
problems arising from the accident and also generally.<p>
	In a report of 19 July 1984 Dr Selvaraj said:-<p>
<p>
	"I was involved in the care of this man when I was asked to a after hours
visit on 30/5/83 and I was informed that he had presented
to the casualty after
a fall between ten and twenty feet at a building construction site and alleged
to have landed on his right
side.  When I examined him on 30/5/83, I did notice
that he was in a considerable amount of distress and he had chest pain,
particularly
in the region of the sternum. He also had considerable amount pain
in the dorsal region about the middle of the dorsal spine."<p>
<p>
	Later in his report Dr Selvaraj said:-<p>
<p>
	"Since then Mr Valmas was not examined in my rooms until 8/5/84. Of course he
had seen me many times during this period, but they
were all for conditions
unrelated to his fall.  On 8/5/84 when he was seen, he started complaining of
pain in the sternum and the
dorsal spine and an x-ray examination revealed a
fracture of the dorsal fifth vertebra and a fracture of the sternum.  Both the
fractures
were healing and were in good position".<p>
<p>
	In a report of 17 May 1994 Dr Selvaraj said of the plaintiff, whom he had
examined on 4 May and 7 May 1994:-<p>
<p>
	"His posture was one of a moderate degree of Kyphosis.<p>
	His chest expansion was extremely limited and air entry was diminished over
both lung bases.<p>
	He was tender over the fifth dorsal vertebra and over the middle of the body
of the sternum.<p>
	His chest expansion with inspiration was grossly limited and was less than one
inch.<p>
	He appeared to be very anxious, depressed and tired."<p>
<p>
	Dr Selvaraj expressed the opinion that the plaintiff's symptoms were
"predominantly related" to the accident, that the plaintiff
had a 50 percent
permanent loss of chest function and was unemployable as a builder.<p>
	In cross-examination of Dr Selvaraj it emerged that in January 1982 the
plaintiff had been diagnosed by Dr Selvaraj as having a
right-sided inguinal
hernia, which had been operated on by Dr Selvaraj in June 1982 and which had
not recurred.  In April 1992 Dr
Selvaraj diagnosed the plaintiff as having a
left-sided hernia, which was operated on in February 1993.  If in 1992 the
plaintiff
had been working in a job involving heavy lifting, Dr Selvaraj would
have advised him not to lift heavy weights for six to twelve
months.  Dr
Selvaraj gave evidence that predisposing factors for hernia in the plaintiff's
case are a chronic obstruction airways
disease aggravated by the plaintiff's
smoking, which causes the plaintiff to cough, and a bladder obstruction which
causes him to
strain when passing water.<p>
	On many occasions both before and after the accident the plaintiff has
presented to Dr Selvaraj suffering from acute bronchitis.
 For example in March
1993 Dr Selvaraj noted "severe coughing and wheezing and expectoration".  Dr
Selvaraj recommended that the
plaintiff stop smoking but the plaintiff has not
heeded his advice.  The plaintiff has been treated with medication including
injections
for his bronchitis.  <p>
	Before the accident the plaintiff often complained of general weakness and not
feeling well and of sexual impotence, which may have
been associated with his
divorce.  He was often concerned, anxious and depressed.  On 14 February 1983
Dr Selvaraj noted that "he
was quite upset and...visibly perturbed and quite
sad". In April 1993 he made complaints of generalised aches and pains. <p>
	In the twelve months after the accident the plaintiff complained primarily
about his bronchitis, not his injuries from the accident.<p>
	The only other medical practitioner who gave oral evidence at the hearing was
Dr Searle, consultant orthopaedic surgeon, two of
whose reports were also
admitted into evidence.<p>
	In his opinion of 14 May 1990 Dr Searle expressed the following opinions:-<p>
<p>
	"The fracture of his thoracic vertebra was associated with neighbouring soft
tissue injuries, including ligament strains of the
nearby joints, and damage to
the T-4-5 disc.  The symptoms and disability from these injuries are persisting
and are permanent and
causes a severe degree of disability especially in
relation to his normal work activities. He is certainly unfit for his
pre-injury
work and indeed is unfit for any form of work which requires
physical effort.  He is also unfit for work which requires prolonged
standing
or prolonged sitting, lifting or repeated bending, repeated or strenuous
movements of the upper limbs, or regularly travelling
moderate distances.  From
a practical point of view this makes him unemployable.<p>
<p>
	The fracture of his sternum is also consistent with the fall he described and
appears to have gone on to non-union.  It is still
tender and would be painful
if he were required to perform repeated or strenuous movements of his upper
limbs.  With regard to prognosis
there will be no change in this condition with
the passage of time.<p>
<p>
	However the prognosis for his thoracic spine is not so good.  Degenerative
changes will intervene at the injured levels, probably
from about T3 to T6 and
will cause gradually increasing symptoms and disability with the passage of
time."<p>
<p>
	In his report of 31 May 1994 Dr Searle expressed similar opinions. He said:-<p>
<p>
	"In the thoracic region he has not only fractures of T-5 and possibly T-4 but
damage to the soft tissues in this area, and almost
certainly ligament strains
in the low thoracic spine as well.  The symptoms and disability from these
injuries are persistent and
permanent and cause referred pain into the back of
the neck and the occiput, and the thoracic symptoms are also aggravated by
movements
of his neck.  Degenerative changes have already developed and the
symptoms and disability in this area will gradually increase with
the passage
of time.<p>
<p>
	The pain and tenderness in the sternum are consistent with an old fracture
which has remained ununited.  This causes a moderate
degree of disability, but
prevents him performing any activity which requires repetitive or strong
movements of his upper limbs.<p>
<p>
	As previously explained he is probably unemployable.  This work incapacity is
permanent.  Because of this physical disability he
is also unfit for performing
normal domestic chores and requires assistance for such activities, two or
three hours a week.<p>
<p>
	He has a 30 percent permanent impairment of his back, and a 50 percent
permanent impairment of his sternum which I estimate is equivalent
to a 10
percent permanent loss of efficient use of his chest."<p>
<p>
	In cross-examination Dr Searle said that in expressing an opinion that the
plaintiff required two to three hours a week of assistance,
he had simply
proceeded on the assumption that the plaintiff carried out the average normal
domestic chores.  Two to three hours
a week had been the time suggested to Dr
Searle in a letter of instructions to Dr Searle from the plaintiff's solicitors
and such
a figure seemed reasonable to Dr Searle.  The number of hours required
would be affected by whether a person lived in a home unit
or a large house.
<p>
	Dr Searle said that he felt that work as a supervisor on a building site would
be beyond the plaintiff unless it was very part-time
work.  Dr Searle was
asked:-<p>
<p>
	"If he were able to carry out the supervisory activities which didn't involve
him in prolonged standing or prolonged sitting or
heavy lifting or repeated
bending or undertaking repeated or strenuous movements of the upper limbs, then
it would follow, from your
expression of opinion wouldn't it, that he would be
able to undertake that form of work?"<p>
<p>
	  Dr Searle replied:-<p>
<p>
	"If what you say is correct then he probably would be able to undertake that
sort of work but, as I said, from a practical point
of view on a building site
I imagine that even supervising requires you to be on your feet".<p>
<p>
	I generally accept the evidence of Dr Searle.<p>
	The plaintiff's case also included a report prepared for medico-legal purposes
by Dr Dent, a psychiatrist, dated 31 May 1994.  Dr
Dent considered that major
aspects of mental suffering for the plaintiff included concern about whether he
would be able to work
again, depressive helplessness and anger.  Dr Dent
considered that the plaintiff might "even be beyond retrieval in the
psychological
sense" and that the plaintiff "feels murderously angry".  Dr Dent
added: "I think he is right when he says a part of  him has died".
 In a later
part of his report Dr Dent says:-<p>
<p>
	"...it is not humane to suggest that there be no ongoing assistance; I believe
he would be benefited, again to what may regrettably
now be a limited optimum,
if he were referred to a psychiatrist to assist him.  I think he would be
benefited from the use of psychoactive
medication and probably antidepressant
medication.  <p>
<p>
	It would be prudent to recommend he see a Greek speaking psychiatrist or a
specialist with such facilities....Nevertheless we should
not be seeing this as
a situation where he will now recover, but one where simple humanity says he
needs assistance now to relieve
what degree of suffering can be relieved..."<p>
<p>
	The plaintiff gave the following evidence in relation to Dr Dent in his
evidence in chief:-<p>
<p>
	"Q.	Have you seen a psychiatrist at times?<p>
	A.	No.<p>
<p>
	Q.	What about Dr Dent?<p>
	A.	Yes, I saw him once.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Has he suggested you might try and find a Greek speaking psychiatrist to
assist you?<p>
	A.	I can't remember....<p>
<p>
	Q.	If a psychiatrist suggested that you should have ongoing psychiatric
help.<p>
	A.	Yes.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Would you have the help?<p>
	A.	Yes.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Do you think a Greek speaking psychiatrist might be able to help you.<p>
	A.	I don't think so.<p>
<p>
	Q.	But would you try?<p>
	A.	I never had problems for doctors for language".<p>
<p>
	The plaintiff gave the following evidence about whether he felt anger:-<p>
	Q.	Do you ever feel angry?<p>
	A.	Yes.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Do you feel angry with some people?<p>
	A.	No.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Why do you feel angry?<p>
	A.	I don't feel angry with people.<p>
<p>
	Q.	Do you ever feel angry?<p>
	A.	No,<p>
<p>
	Q.	What about Mr Nyman, how do you feel about him&gt;|?<p>
	A.	I don't feel anything."<p>
	A number of medical reports were admitted into evidence in the defendant's
case and I have taken all of these reports into account.
 Dr Rapaport, vascular
and general surgeon, in a report of 19 September 1994 concluded inter alia.<p>
<p>
	"The patient has chronic bronchitis and emphysema as a result of heavy
cigarette smoking which is continuing and this has produced
radiological signs
on chest x-ray.  It is possible that the presence of his lung disease may have
contributed to his decision to
quit working.<p>
<p>
	I believe this patient would be fit for some supervisory work in the building
industry.  On the basis of his age and chronic airways
disease, I believe he is
not fit for heavy labouring and brick laying."<p>
<p>
	Dr James Maguire, a consultant psychiatrist, in a report of 11 October 1994
said inter alia:-<p>
<p>
	"Mr Valmas said he was a hard worker who found it difficult to cope with
sitting at home with nothing to do.  This caused him to
become 'nervous' by
which he meant he was 'a little bit on edge - a bit cranky and couldn't sit
still in one spot for a long time.<p>
<center>   *  *  *<p>
</center>	..He has never been referred for psychological counselling or
treatment and did not feel he ever needed any.<p>
<center>*  *  *<p>
</center>	He gave a straight forward account of events and appeared  a relaxed
and friendly man.  I felt his mood was normal in that he did
not appear to be
clinically depressed or anxious.<p>
<center>*  *  *<p>
</center>	He does not require any ongoing psychological counselling for issues
to do with the accident."<p>
<p>
	Neither Dr Dent nor Dr Maguire was required to attend for cross-examination
and I have to decide which of their reports I prefer.
  I generally prefer the
report of Dr Maguire.  The statment of the plaintiff's symptoms in Dr Dent's
report is exaggerated.  The
report itself is expressed in florid language and
reads like a piece of advocacy.  The plaintiff has never in fact undergone any
psychiatric or psychological counselling or treatment.<p>
	I will now proceed to determine what damages would have been assessed at the
notional trial.  At a notional trial on 30 June 1992
damages for loss and
damage up to the date of the notional trial would have been past damages;
damages for loss and damage after
the date of the notional trial would have
been future damages.  I will deal in turn with the various heads of damages.<p>
<b>1.	Past Loss of Earning Capacity.</b><p>
	In his submissions both written and oral counsel for the plaintiff did not
make any claim for damages for past loss of earning capacity
for any part of
the period between 18 May 1983 and 31 August 1986, which was approximately when
the plaintiff ceased to carry on
his business as a building contractor.  <p>
	As regards damages for past loss of earning capacity for the period from 1
September 1986 onwards, counsel for the plaintiff submitted
that the
plaintiff's income tax returns for the years when he was working should be
disregarded, as not being true indices of his
earning capacity.  It was clear,
it was submitted, that while he was working the plaintiff was able to maintain
himself and his household
and the losses or the extremely small amounts of net
income shown in his income tax returns could not have been a true reflection
of
the income he was in fact receiving.<p>
	In his submissions counsel for the plaintiff expressly limited the plaintiff's
claim for damages for past loss of earning capacity
so as to accord with
findings made by Burke CCJ in his judgment of 15 October 1990, repeatedly
stating that Burke CCJ's findings
gave rise to issue estoppels which would have
enured up to the date of the notional trial, although elsewhere in his
submissions
counsel said that the plaintiff was prepared "to reduce this aspect
of his claim as a matter of convenience to the date of the notional
trial".  It
was accepted by counsel for the plaintiff that the amount of workers'
compensation payments received by the plaintiff
up to 30 June 1992 in pursuance
of Burke CCJ's judgment should be deducted from the damages which would
otherwise be awarded for
past loss of earning capacity.<p>
	On p44 of his written submissions counsel for the plaintiff set out a table of
figures derived from findings and orders made by
Burke CCJ in his judgment of
15 October 1990.  I will now reproduce that table, with an additional column
containing figures which
can be arithmetically derived from the figures in
counsel for the plaintiff's table.<p>

<BR></TD></TR></TABLE><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The column headed "Probable Weekly Earnings" contains the amounts which
Burke CCJ considered that the plaintiff would probably have
earned if he had
been uninjured.  The column headed "Difference", which I have inserted,
contains the differences between the figures
for probable weekly earnings and
the figures for residual earning capacity.<p>
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff should be awarded the
total amount in the Total Loss Column, that is $33,888,
which is the total of
the differences between what the plaintiff would probably have earned if
uninjured and the plaintiff's residual
earning capacity, less the amounts of
the workers' compensation payments.<p>
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that I should accept the plaintiff's
income tax returns as accurate and as true indices of his
earning capacity and
that I should find that the plaintiff retained a residual earning capacity to
work as a supervisor in the building
industry.  Counsel submitted that I should
find that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate any past loss of earning
capacity or,
alternatively, that any damages awarded for past loss of earning
capacity should not exceed the amounts of the awards of compensation
made by
Burke CCJ and that an amount should be deducted because of the plaintiff's
left-sided hernia in 1992.  If this alternative
approach of counsel for the
defendant was adopted, including making a deduction for the hernia in the
amount contended for by counsel,
an amount of $33,482 would be arrived at.
This amount is very similar to the amount claimed by counsel for the plaintiff,
although
the methods of arriving at the results are different.<p>
	I will now proceed to assess damages for past loss of earning capacity.  As
counsel for the plaintiff did not claim any damages
for the period from 18 May
1983 to 31 August 1986, I will not award any damages, for any part of that
period.  I do not consider
that the plaintiff's income tax returns provide any
useful guide to his earning capacity;  the returns clearly did not make a full
and accurate disclosure of his income.  I find that the plaintiff has
demonstrated a partial loss of earning capacity from 1 September
1986 onwards.
As both counsel referred me to Burke CCJ's findings and orders, counsel for the
plaintiff contending that I was bound
by them, I propose to adopt them, even if
they do not give rise to any estoppel.  I see no reason why I should equate the
damages
to be awarded for past loss of earning capacity with the amounts of
workers compensation awarded by Burke CCJ.  On the other hand,
counsel for the
plaintiff's submission makes sense, that damages for past loss of earning
capacity should be awarded on the difference
between what the plaintiff
probably would have earned if uninjured and his residual earning capacity, but
that the amounts of workers
compensation should then be deducted.  I do not
consider that any amount should be deducted for the plaintiff's left-sided
hernia,
which was not operated on until 1993.<p>
	I accordingly find that damages for past loss of earning capacity would be the
amount claimed by the plaintiff of $33,888.<p>
<b>Interest on Damages for Past Loss of Earning Capacity</b><p>
	Interest on damages awarded for past loss of earning capacity would clearly
have been recoverable at the notional trial.  No objection
was made by counsel
for the defendant to the rate of 15 percent adopted by counsel for the
plaintiff.  However, the calculation of
interest in the plaintiff's written
submissions seems to assume that the period over which interest is to be
calculated is 4.8 years,
whereas the period from 1 September 1986 to 30 June
1992 is approximately 5.8 years.<p>
	I find that interest on the damages for past loss of earning capacity would be
$14,741.<p>
<b>Damages for Future Loss of Earning Capacity</b><p>
<b></b>	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff would have been
awarded damages for the period between 30 June 1992, the date
of the notional
trial, and 8 August 1999, the plaintiff's sixty-fifth birthday, a period which
in calculations of damages was asserted
to be 7.2 years, but is much closer to
7.1 years, on the basis that the plaintiff throughout the whole of the period
had a total
loss of earning capacity, damages being assessed at the rate of
$750 per week (based on what the plaintiff said was his total income
when,
before the accident, he was working for Mr Christianos and also conducting his
own business) or, alternatively, at the rate
of $465 per week, being the rate
of remuneration of a brick layer.  It was submitted by counsel for the
plaintiff that only a conventional
discount of 15 percent for contingencies
should be allowed.  <p>
	Counsel for the defendant submitted, as he had in relation to the claim for
damages for past loss of earning capacity, that the
plaintiff should be bound
by his income tax returns and that, for many reasons, a discount of more than
15 percent should be allowed
for contingencies.<p>
	In regard to this head of damages, I adhere to the view I expressed in
relation to the claim for damages for past loss of earning
capacity that the
plaintiff's income tax returns do not provide any useful guide to the
plaintiff's earning capacity.<p>
	Apart from the income tax returns, the evidence is meagre.  I do not consider
that I can confidently rely on the plaintiff's evidence
that when he had two
jobs, that is working for Mr Christianos and also working for himself, "he got
in his own pocket" $700 to $800
per week.  There are no supporting records and
the figures stated are utterly at variance with his income tax return for the
year
ended 30 June 1983, which was prepared years afterwards, in which he shows
a loss for that year.  Furthermore, the period when the
plaintiff had two jobs,
working as an employee for Mr Christianos and also carrying on his own
business, could have been an abnormally
lucrative period for the plaintiff.<p>
	Nor do I consider that the rate of remuneration of a bricklayer should be
adopted.  It seems to me highly improbable that if the
plaintiff had not been
injured he would, with his preference for working for himself, his experience
and skills as a supervisor,
his advanced age and his bronchitis, have worked as
a bricklayer between the ages of fifty-eight and sixty-five.<p>
	In October 1990 Burke CCJ found that the probable weekly earnings of the
plaintiff if uninjured would have been $590 per week and
I have decided to
adopt, as the amount which the plaintiff would probably have been earning at
the date of the notional trial if
he had not been injured, the amount of $600
per week.  I find that from 30 June 1992 onwards the plaintiff would have had
no residual
earning capacity.<p>
	I agree with the submission made by counsel for the defendant that a greater
discount than the conventional discount should be allowed
for contingencies,
because of the heavy nature of almost all work in the building industry, the
risk of injury in a non-compensible
accident, fluctuations in the availability
of work in the building industry, the plaintiff's chronic airways disease, his
pre-accident
susceptibility to periods of depression and the conditions
predisposing him to a formation of hernia.  I also take into account that
the
plaintiff's left-sided hernia had been diagnosed before the date of the
notional trial.<p>
	I consider that damages should be awarded at the rate of $600 per week for 7.1
years, using a multiplier taken from the 3 percent
tables of 335, with a
discount for contingencies of 30 percent, producing a figure of $140,700.<p>
	Later in this judgment I will deal with the subject of the deduction of the
value of the plaintiff's future workers' compensation
rights.<p>
<b>General Damages</b><p>
<b></b>	Without attempting to be exhaustive, some of the more salient aspects
of the plaintiff's claim for general damages can be summarised
as follows.  The
plaintiff, a forty-eight year old man, fell a distance of about fifteen feet at
a building site.  He lost consciousness
in the fall and was taken by ambulance
to hospital, where he remained until 26 May 1983.  His principal injuries were
a fracture
of a thoracic vertebra with associated soft tissue injuries and a
fracture of his sternum which remained for a long time ununited.
 He has
experienced and will permanently continue to experience pain and restriction of
movement in his back, chest, neck and head.
 Dr Searle is of the opinion, and I
accept, that the plaintiff has suffered a 30 percent permanent impairment of
his back and a 50
percent permanent impairment of his sternum, equivalent to a
10 percent permanent loss of the efficient use of his chest.  The plaintiff
did
not sustain any psychiatric condition as a result of the accident but has
suffered some depression.<p>
	On the other hand, I have to take into account that before the accident the
plaintiff had had frequent serious attacks of bronchitis
and that some of his
difficulty with his chest and breathing since the accident is attributable to
his bronchitis.  He also had frequent
episodes of depression before the
accident.<p>
	Counsel for the plaintiff contended for an award of general damages of
$175,000.  Counsel for the defendant contended for an award
of general damages
of $55,000 to $60,000.  I am of course determining what amount of general
damages would have awarded at a notional
trial on 30 June 1992.  <p>
	I consider that $90,000 would have been awarded for general damages.<p>
<b>Interest on Past General Damages</b><p>
<b></b>	It was common ground that interest on past general damages should be
calculated at 4 percent.  I apportion general damages, half
to the past and
half to the future.  Interest on $45,000 from 18 May 1983 to 30 June 1992
(close enough to nine years) is $8,100.<p>
<b>Past Out of Pocket Expenses</b><p>
<b></b>	In the plaintiff's written submissions it was stated that the plaintiff
was still considering whether to make a claim for damages
for past out of
pocket expenses.  In oral argument it was conceded that there was no claim for
damages for past out of pocket expenses.
 Presumably any out of pocket expenses
would have been covered by the award made under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation
Act</a></i>.<p>
<b>Future Out of Pocket Expenses</b><p>
<b></b>	The plaintiff claimed damages for future out of pocket expenses,
relying on the report by the psychiatrist Dr Dent in which Dr Dent
said that
the plaintiff would be benefited by physiotherapy, psychiatric counselling,
pain management and psychoactive and antidepressant
medication.  A global sum
of $50,000 was claimed.<p>
	I do not consider that any damages should be awarded for future out of pocket
expenses.  As I have indicated earlier in this judgment,
I prefer the evidence
of Dr Maguire to the evidence of Dr Dent.  I have already referred to the
plaintiff's evidence that he did
not think a Greek speaking psychiatrist would
help him and that he did not feel any anger for Mr Nyman.  There is no evidence
that
the plaintiff has ever undergone any physiotherapy, psychiatric
counselling or pain management and in my opinion there is no prospect
that he
would ever undergo any of these forms of therapy.<p>
	In any event, the plaintiff continues to have the benefit of the order under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></i>, which should cover the costs of any
of the kinds of treatment mentioned by Dr Dent.<p>
<b>Past and Future Domestic Care</b><p>
<b></b>	The plaintiff lives in a home unit with his two adult sons.  The
plaintiff said that his two sons assist him by providing domestic
services but
he was unable to provide any estimate of the amount of time spent by them in
providing those services.  <p>
	Counsel for the plaintiff based a claim for damages for the cost of past
domestic services on evidence by the plaintiff's son, Mr
C Valmas, that he and
his brother did between sixteen to twenty-four hours housework per week in the
unit.  It was submitted that
if time spent otherwise than for the care of the
plaintiff was deducted, there would still be ten hours per week spent in the
care
of the plaintiff.  It was suggested by counsel for the plaintiff that an
hourly rate of $10 could be adopted for the computation
of damages for past
domestic care and that an hourly rate of $13.12 could be adopted for the
calculation of damages for future domestic
care.  <p>
	Counsel for the defendant did not dispute that some damages should be awarded
under this head, but submitted that they should be
minuscule.  <p>
	Mr Valmas gave evidence that he and his brother, both of whom are adults and
working, live in a home unit with the plaintiff.  Mr
Valmas said that since the
accident his brother and he do 90 to 95 percent of the housework in the unit.
The following questions
and answers occurred in Mr Valmas's examination in
chief:-<p>
<p>
	"Q.	All up how many hours would you and your brother spend on housework per
week?<p>
	A.	Never added it. I can estimate on it. <p>
	<p>
	Q.	Estimate the best you can?<p>
	A.	Combined.<p>
	<p>
	Q.	Yes.<p>
	A.	Between sixteen and twenty, twenty-four hours I would say".<p>
<p>
	In later evidence in chief, when counsel for the plaintiff sought to elicit
what he and his brother actually did, he said "there
are only three plates to
be washed anyway and my father washes his own;  vacuuming of the unit varied,
maybe once a week, maybe twice
a week, sometimes three times a week".  When
asked how often he would do clothes washing for his father he answered, "varies
again,
twice a week, depending.  We have different occupations, my brother and
myself so".  Later again he said, "we would wash I don't
say I wash my own, my
brother washes his own, father washes his own its all combined".  In
cross-examination Mr Valmas said that
the things he and his brother had done
since the accident were practically the same things as they had done before the
accident.<p>
	I do not consider that I can place any reliance on Mr C Valmas's estimates of
the time spent by his brother and himself in performing
household chores in the
home unit they share with their father.  His estimates were vague, unsupported
by detail and in fact at variance
with such detail as was given and in my
opinion it is inherently likely that his estimates were greatly exaggerated.  I
consider
that I should place more weight on Dr Searle's evidence that the
plaintiff requires assistance for normal domestic chores at the
rate of two to
three hours per week.  That sort of figure had actually been nominated to Dr
Searle by the plaintiff's solicitors.<p>
	I find that damages for the cost of past domestic care at the rate of three
hours per week would be $14,040 and that damages for
the cost of future
domestic care for the rest of the plaintiff's life, taking a life expectancy of
eighteen and a half years, would
be $29,264.<p>
<b>Loss of Superannuation</b><p>
	In his written submissions counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the
plaintiff should be awarded damages for loss of superannuation,
based on $750
per week or on $565 per week gross as a bricklayer.  In oral submissions it was
merely contended that a modest figure
should be awarded.  <p>
	In my opinion, I should accept counsel for the defendant's submission that if
the plaintiff had not been injured he would have continued
working in his
preferred mode as a contractor carrying on his own business and would not have
become entitled to any superannuation
as an employee.  I reject this claim for
damages.<p>
<b>Cost of Management</b><p>
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff would have been
entitled to some professional assistance to manage the amount
of his verdict,
even though he is not a disabled person.  It was submitted that the amount of
the management fee should be calculated
in accordance with the regulations
under the <i>Protected <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea103/" class="autolink_findacts">Estates Act</a></i> and in accordance with the decision of
the Court of Appeal in <b>GIO  v  Rosniak</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20665" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 665</a> or
alternatively a reasonable lump sum should be awarded to enable the plaintiff
to retain the services of an accountant or investment
adviser.<p>
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that no evidence had been given to
establish a need for fund management or that any verdict
would be the subject
of management.  Counsel for the defendant also submitted that <b>GIO  v
Rosniak</b> was a case involving a plaintiff suffering from severe brain damage
and was a decision given on 17 July 1992, after the date of the
notional trial.
<p>
	In my opinion, an amount for fund management would not have been awarded at
the notional trial.   <b>GIO  v  Rosniak</b> had not then been decided.  As
counsel for the defendant submitted, there is no evidence of a need for fund
management created by
the tortfeasor or that the amount of the verdict would
have been subject to fund management.  The plaintiff was a man of some business
acumen who had carried on for some years his own business as a building
contractor and was used to collecting, handling and disbursing
substantial sums
of money.  I find that the plaintiff was not intellectually disabled in any way
by the accident.  After the accident
the plaintiff continued working for Mr
Christianos for a number of months, built two houses on his own account as a
building contractor
and then ceased to carry on business only because of his
physical disabilities.  It is apparent from the amounts I have stated and
will
state for other heads of damages that the amount of the total verdict would
have been nowhere near as large as the amount contended
for by counsel for the
plaintiff.  <p>
	The heads of damages which I consider would have been awarded at the notional
trial can be tabulated as follows:-<p>
Damages for Past Loss of Earning Capacity	$33,888.00<p>
Interest on Damages for Past Loss of Earning Capacity	$14,741.00<p>
Future Loss of Earning Capacity	$140,700.00<p>
General Damages 	$90,000.00<p>
Interest on Past General Damages	$8,100.00<p>
Past Domestic Care	$14,040.00<p>
Future Domestic Care	<u>$29,264.00</u><p>
<u></u>	$330,733.00</a><p>
	Earlier in my judgment I concluded that there was a high degree of probability
that in the lost action the plaintiff would have
succeeded in obtaining a
verdict against Mr Pendino, the plaintiff would have succeeded in obtaining a
verdict against Mr Christianos
for breach of his obligation at common law to
provide a safe system of work and a safe place of work and the plaintiff would
have
succeeded in obtaining a verdict against Mr Christianos in a cause of
action based on a breach of reg73(3) of the <i>Construction Safety
Regulations</i> and some likelihood that the plaintiff would have succeeded in
obtaining a verdict against Mr Christianos on the basis that he was
vicariously
liable for the negligence of Mr Pendino.  I have also concluded that there was
little likelihood of any finding of contributory
negligence against the
plaintiff and that in any event contributory negligence would not have been
legally available as a defence
to the cause of action against Mr Christianos
based on breach of statutory duty.  In my opinion, I should find that at a
notional
trial the plaintiff would have had a 95 percent chance of the amounts
of damages I have set out being assessed and that accordingly
the value of the
benefit he lost through his solicitor's breach should, subject to any
deductions which would have had to have been
made from the verdict in any event
and subject to any risk that he might not have been able to actually recover
any damages awarded
in the lost trial, be found to be $314,196.<p>
	From this total deductions should be made of amounts which would necessarily
have been deducted in full.  Social Security payments
amounting to $23,544.74
would have been deducted.  <p>
	In calculating the amount of damages for past loss of earning capacity I have
already taken into account past workers' compensation.<p>
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the value of the plaintiff's rights
to future workers' compensation should not be deducted
from the amount of the
damages, or, alternatively, that the value of the plaintiff's rights to future
workers' compensation should
be substantially discounted.<p>
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that it was necessary to deduct the value
of the plaintiff's rights to future workers' compensation.
 It was submitted
that what had to be deducted was the value of the plaintiff's rights to future
workers' compensation and not the
amount of compensation which the plaintiff
happened to be receiving at the time of the notional trial, that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></i> the plaintiff could have applied at any
time after 1 April 1992 to have the amount of his weekly compensation
increased, on the basis
of the total incapacity he alleges he then had, to
$242.20 per week ($210 net) and that the amount of $210 should be used in
calculating
the amount of the deduction for future workers' compensation
rights. <p>
	It was also submitted by counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff's rights
to workers' compensation would continue until his
death, because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</i> <i>1987</a></i>, which provides for the termination
of weekly benefits on the worker reaching retiring age, applies only if the
worker's injury occurred
on or after 30 June 1985 and hence does not apply in
the plaintiff's case.<p>
	It was conceded by counsel for the defendant that the value of the future
workers' compensation rights would have to be discounted
for contingencies, for
example the contingency of the plaintiff not succeeding on an application for
an award of compensation on
the basis of total incapacity, of a redemption or
of a successful application by the employer or Work Cover to terminate the
award.
 However, it was submitted that the adverse contingencies affecting the
plaintiff's rights to workers' compensation were much less
important than the
adverse contingencies which would have affected the plaintiff's earning
capacity if he had not been injured.<p>
	It is clearly established that it is necessary, at least at some stage in the
process of the assessment of damages in a case such
as the present, to deduct
the value of the plaintiff's rights to future workers' compensation, which, if
the solicitor had not been
negligent, would have terminated at the date of the
notional trial.  See <b>Tipper  v  Williams</b> (Court of Appeal 12 May 1993).
I also accept that what should be deducted is the value of the plaintiff's
rights to future workers'
compensation, not merely the extent to which he has
happened to exercise them up to the date of the notional trial.  Consistently
with my finding that on and from the date of the notional trial the plaintiff
was totally incapacitated from working, the value of
the plaintiff's future
workers' compensation rights should be calculated at the rate of $210 per week.
<p>
	I also accept that because the plaintiff's injury occurred before 30 June 1985
his workers' compensation rights will not cease on
his attaining retiring age
but will continue until his death.  I accept, as was submitted by counsel for
the plaintiff, that the
plaintiff's life expectancy at the date of a notional
trial was approximately eighteen and a half years and that a multiplier of
743.5 can be used.<p>
	In some cases courts have applied an equal percentage discount to the damages
for future loss of earning capacity and to the value
of the future workers'
compensation rights, while recognising that the actual contingencies are not
the same in the two cases.  In
the present case, I consider that there is force
in the submission made by counsel for the defendant and I have decided to
select
a lesser percentage, 20 percent, for the discount on the value of future
workers' compensation rights.  The amount of the deduction
for future workers
compensation rights is accordingly $124,908.<p>
	If the amounts for Social Security payments and for the value of future
workers' compensation rights are deducted from the amount
of $314,196, a figure
of $165,743 is arrived at.<p>
<b>4.	The Issue of Prospects of Recovery of Damages awarded in the Lost
Action.</b><p>
	Notwithstanding a submission to the contrary made on behalf of the plaintiff,
it is clearly necessary for me to consider this issue.
 See <b>Nikolaou  v
Papasavas </b>at 404.<p>
	No evidence was given by either Mr Christianos or Mr Pendino, in either
examination in chief or cross-examination, about his financial
means, either
currently or at about the time the notional trial would have been held.<p>
	It seems highly unlikely that Mr Pendino would have had the means to satisfy a
substantial judgment obtained against him or that
he would have been insured
against liability.  At the time the plaintiff was injured Mr Christianos was
the proprietor of a building
project involving the building of a number of town
houses at Abbotsford and it may be that it could be inferred that at that time
he was a person of some financial substance.  However, even if this inference
could be drawn, evidence about his financial position
in 1983-4 is a weak basis
for drawing any inference about his ability to satisfy a substantial judgment
obtained in mid 1992.  Mr
Christianos was not insured against his liability to
pay workers' compensation to the plaintiff and it is improbable that he was
insured against any other form of liability to the plaintiff.  There is no
evidence that he had any such insurance.<p>
	Thus far, in my consideration of this issue, it would seem that the
plaintiff's chances of actually recovering damages awarded in
the lost action
would have been very slight.  However, counsel for the plaintiff pointed to
evidence given by Mr Pendino in cross-examination
that the backhoe was a
registered vehicle which could be driven on roads and if being driven on a road
could be steered off the road
into a driveway.  It was accordingly submitted on
behalf of the plaintiff that at the time of the accident the backhoe was a
motor
vehicle within the meaning of the <i>Motor Vehicles (Third Party
Insurance) Act</i>, that it was a registered and therefore an insured motor
vehicle, that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was bodily injury caused
by
or arising out of the use of a motor vehicle and accordingly there was
necessarily insurance against the liability to the plaintiff
(or at least
access to a statutory fund).  Counsel for the plaintiff cited <b>Fawcett  v
BAP By Products Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1960/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1960] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20104%20CLR%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 104 CLR 80</a> and <b>GIO  v  Green</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20114%20CLR%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966)
114 CLR 437.</a>  Counsel for the defendant did not make any submission to the
contrary of these submissions by counsel for the plaintiff, except
to contend
that insurance would be available only to satisfy a judgment recovered against
Mr Pendino and that in the cause of action
against Mr Pendino contributory
negligence could be relied on.<p>
	I consider that I should find that if in the notional trial the plaintiff
would have obtained a verdict against Mr Pendino (and
I have already concluded
that there would have been a high degree of probability of that happening) then
the plaintiff would certainly
been able to recover the amount of the verdict
via the <i>Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act</i>.<p>
	It is true that it did not occur to the draftsman of the statement of claim in
the 1989 proceedings to allege that the backhoe was
a motor vehicle.  However,
in my opinion, it would certainly have occurred to some legal adviser of the
plaintiff at some time before
the notional trial that recovery of any judgment
from Mr Pendino or Mr Christianos would be uncertain and that consequently some
amendment would have been made to the statement of claim to add such an
allegation.  <p>
	Because of the availability of compulsory third party insurance I find that
the plaintiff would have been certain to recover the
damages awarded to him in
the lost action in his cause of action against Mr Pendino.  However, because of
the slight chance of the
plaintiff not succeeding on that cause of action or of
a finding of contributory negligence, the figure of $165,743 should be reduced
by 5 percent, producing a figure of $157,456.<p>
<b>Interest</b><p>
	The plaintiff would have been entitled to interest on the amount of a judgment
obtained in the notional trial between the date of
the notional trial and the
present.  The interest should be calculated on the sum of $157,456, to take
into account the chances that
the plaintiff would not have obtained a verdict
or would not have been able actually to recover interest.  In written
submissions
the plaintiff claimed interest at the rate of 15 percent per annum.
However, this rate is more appropriate for the years preceding
30 June 1992,
when interest rates were higher, and I have adopted an interest rate of 12
percent as a fairly accurate average interest
rate for the period since 30 June
1992.  I have treated the period for which interest is to allowed as four and
one third years.
 Interest on the notional judgment so calculated is $81,877.
<p>
<b>Costs of the Notional Trial</b><p>
	It was submitted by counsel for the defendant and disputed by counsel for the
plaintiff that the amount of the solicitor/client
costs which the plaintiff
would have incurred in the lost action, that is the costs the plaintiff would
have incurred which would
not have been recoverable under a costs order against
the defendants should be deducted.  I accept that, consistently with the
general
guiding principle in the assessment of damages that the object is to
award the plaintiff an amount of money that will, as nearly
as money can, put
the plaintiff in the same position he would have been in if he had not been
injured by the defendant, the amount
of any costs the plaintiff would have
incurred in the lost action which would not have been recoverable from the
defendants in the
lost action should be deducted.  The plaintiff should not be
placed in a better position than he would have been in if the defendant
had not
committed any breach of duty.  <p>
	The defendant called evidence from Mr Pearlman, a solicitor, who started
working for the defendant as an employed solicitor in February
1994.  On the
basis of an inspection of half a dozen files in which the defendant had acted
as solicitor for the plaintiff in personal
injury matters between about 1989
and 1992, the files having been selected by other employees of the defendant,
Mr Pearlman expressed
the opinion that if proceedings by Mr Valmas against Mr
Christianos and Mr Pendino had gone to a hearing and the trial had lasted
three
days, the total costs would have been about $25,000 and the percentage of those
costs recoverable from the defendants between
60 to 65 percent, leaving the
balance of the costs to be borne by Mr Valmas.  In cross-examination Mr
Pearlman said that of the six
matters two had gone to an arbitration hearing
and all the others had been settled.  <p>
	Various criticisms were made by counsel for the plaintiff of Mr Pearlman's
evidence and some of these criticisms have weight.  However,
I accept that the
plaintiff would have had to meet some costs out of his own pocket and in the
absence of any other evidence I propose
to broadly accept Mr Pearlman's
evidence and deduct $8,000 for these costs.  The costs would have been less if
there had not been
a full trial of the lost action.  On the other hand, if the
plaintiff's claims had been settled out of court before a hearing, the
amount
of the settlement would probably have involved some element of compromise on
his part.  <p>
	If there had been a full trial of the lost action, at least this amount of
costs would have been incurred, regardless of the result
of the trial.  If the
plaintiff had not succeeded in obtaining a verdict, the costs payable by him
would have been much greater.
 Accordingly, I do not propose to discount the
amount of the costs.  <p>
	The amount of the costs should not be deducted from the amount of the notional
judgment, for the purposes of calculating interest
on the amount of the
notional judgment.<p>
	After the deduction of these costs the amount of damages referable to the lost
action is $157,456, plus $81,877, less $8,000, producing
a figure of
$231,333.<p>
<b>The Further Damages</b><p>
	Damages of this kind can properly be awarded in an action of this kind against
a solicitor.  See <b>Nikolaou  v  Papasavas</b> at 404-5.  <p>
	I have already referred to the plaintiff's evidence in chief where he said
that he did not feel angry with people and that he did
not feel anything about
Mr Nyman.  Counsel for the defendant did not object to the questions in
response to which this evidence was
given.  Towards the end of the hearing,
after the plaintiff had completed giving evidence and after certain other
witnesses including
Dr Selvaraj had given evidence and after an overnight
adjournment, the plaintiff was recalled at the request of his counsel and asked
whether he had ever had any conversation with Mr Nyman "on the topic of him not
having lodged your claim for common law proceedings".
 This question was
objected to by counsel for the defendant and I indicated that I would probably
disallow the question, on the grounds
inter alia that it had not been asked in
evidence in chief and was now sought to be asked at a very late stage in the
hearing, after
a number of witnesses including the plaintiff's general medical
practitioner had concluded giving their evidence.  Counsel for the
plaintiff
then said that he would withdraw the question.  Counsel for the plaintiff was
permitted to ask the plaintiff how he felt
when he was asked in
cross-examination by counsel for the defendant whether he had been foolish to
stand on the wall, to which the
plaintiff replied that he had felt very angry,
and when he was asked in cross-examination by counsel for the defendant whether
he
had been told to get down from the wall, to which the plaintiff replied that
he had felt a bit worried and angry.  <p>
	I do not consider that I should place much weight on these answers.  As I have
already indicated, the questions were asked and the
answers were given after an
overnight adjournment.  The answers appeared to have been rehearsed and were
given without expression
and without conviction.  I did not observe the
plaintiff evince any anger in the relevant parts of the cross-examination.  <p>
	In support of the claim for this head of damages counsel for the plaintiff
also relied on Dr Dent's report, and in particular a
passage containing a
history allegedly given by the plaintiff to Dr Dent that when he found out that
the plaintiff had not "put the
claim in" he was so angry that he could have
shot the defendant and an opinion by Dr Dent that the news from his solicitor
had exacerbated
"the plaintiff's helplessness and despair" and made the
plaintiff's depression worse.  <p>
	It was recognised by counsel for the plaintiff that it was difficult to
reconcile the evidence the plaintiff had given in court
in these proceedings
with the history recorded by Dr Dent.  However, it was submitted that it was
more likely that the plaintiff
would express his anger in a session with a
psychiatrist than in giving evidence in a courtroom.  <p>
	I do not see why the plaintiff in giving evidence in court proceedings, which
he must have known were for the recovery of damages
from his former solicitor,
would have been reluctant to express any anger he genuinely felt against his
solicitor.  I consider that
I should prefer the evidence given by the plaintiff
in the courtroom, particularly having regard to the reservations I have
previously
outlined about Dr Dent's report.  I do not accept that the plaintiff
feels or has felt any homicidal anger against the defendant
or any emotion over
and above what would ordinarily be expected in a person in his position or that
the defendant's failure to commence
court proceedings had the dire consequences
asserted by Dr Dent.  <p>
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that I should not entertain any claim for
further damages because it had not been pleaded. 
However, damages of this kind
are a recognised head of damages in this sort of proceeding, the defendant had
been served with Dr
Dent's report and counsel for the defendant did not object
to the questions asked of the plaintiff in examination in chief as to
what he
felt about the defendant.  I consider that I should entertain such a claim for
further damages.  <p>
	I accept that the plaintiff suffered some anxiety and stress in attempting to
check with the defendant about the progress of the
proceedings which should
have been brought, discovering that no proceedings had been brought with the
limitation period, having to
instruct other lawyers, having to wait until the
present proceedings reached court and having to undergo a trial against his
former
solicitor in which some allegations were made against him which might
not have been made in a trial of his original claims.  <p>
	I assess the sum of $20,000 for the further damages.<p>
<b>Costs of these Proceedings</b><p>
	In written submissions counsel for the plaintiff made a claim for indemnity
costs.  He did not refer me to any authority or any
court rule in support of
this claim.  Counsel for the defendant submitted that an order for indemnity
costs would be contrary to
principle and contrary to such authority as exists.
Counsel for the defendant cited <b>Vulic  v  Bilinsky</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20NSWLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 2 NSWLR 472</a> at
488;  <b>NSW Medical Defence Union  v  Crawford</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 469</a> at 494.
<p>
	I do not consider that there should be any departure from the normal order for
costs and I consider that I should make an order
that the defendant pay the
plaintiff's costs.<p>
	I intend to publish these reasons without immediately making any formal orders
so that the parties will have the opportunity of
drawing my attention to any
formal or arithmetical errors I may have made or any matters I may have
overlooked.<p>
