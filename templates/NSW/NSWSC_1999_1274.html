Port Macquarie Base Hospital &amp; Anor</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	In these proceedings the plaintiff seeks
to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered by him when he fell
from a tree
in the backyard of the premises where he lived at 21 Bennett St,
Port Macquarie on 18 November 1994.  
<P>

2   	The tree was in the middle of the backyard of the premises
where the plaintiff lived with his mother, Sylvia Van Beers, who
was the tenant
of the Department of Housing and who was concerned about the tree because she
considered it dangerous.  The reasons
she considered it dangerous were that it
was split down the middle, it was too high, ants nested in the middle of the
branches and
she believed it was a poisonous wattle tree, although it has
otherwise been described as a melaleuca tree.  She was also afraid that
children might climb it, fall and hurt themselves.  The tree is depicted in the
composite photo Ex. A.  
<P>

3   	The three children that she then had and a number of
neighbourhood children regularly played touch football, cricket and other
games
in the backyard and there was evidence from Mrs Bailey and also from Mrs
Rafferty that the children regularly climbed the tree,
but that whenever she
saw them the plaintiff's mother told them not to.  She said that she was so
concerned about the tree for the
reasons I have indicated that she went to the
Department of Housing on a number of occasions, complained about the tree and
asked
that it be removed.  The evidence from the Department's officers,
particularly Mr Sullivan, leads me to the conclusion that no permanent
record
was kept of complaints or requests made by tenants unless such complaints or
requests were acted upon, and having regard to
the evidence of the plaintiff's
mother supported as it is by that of Mrs Bailey and Mrs Sims, I am satisfied
that the former made
a number of requests to the Department prior to the
plaintiff's accident for the removal of the tree, but to no avail.  After the
accident, in May 1995, the Department caused the tree to be removed at a cost
of $60.
<P>

4   	On 18 November 1994 the plaintiff and a group of other
children were playing cricket in the backyard of the premises when someone
hit
the ball into the tree, where it lodged.  The plaintiff, who claimed he had not
been given any instruction by his mother not
to climb the tree, or
alternatively did not recall such instruction, climbed up the tree, but as he
was climbing his foot lost its
grip and he slipped and fell out of the tree
landing on the ground on his buttocks.  Over the next couple of days his left
thigh
became tender so his mother took him to the doctor who referred him to
the Port Macquarie Base Hospital and he was sent home with
antibiotics.  The
antibiotics did not work so a couple of days later he returned to the hospital
and was examined under anaesthesia
when a foreign body being a small piece of
twig measuring approximately 20mm by 5mm (Ex. J) was removed.  Two days later
he was returned
to the operating theatre due to pungent discharge and extreme
pain in the wound.  Nothing further was found and a diagnosis of necrotic
fasciitis was made.
<P>

5   	The proceedings were originally commenced against the Port
Macquarie Base Hospital (the first defendant) alleging negligence
in the
diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injury, and later, by amendment, the
State of New South Wales (the second defendant)
was joined alleging negligence
on the part of the Department of Housing, as landlord of the premises, in its
management of the premises
and in failing to remove the tree after being
requested to do so by the plaintiff's mother.  During the hearing on 2
September last,
after considering the evidence then placed before me concerning
the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff by the servants and
agents of the
first defendant, I approved the settlement reached between the plaintiff by his
next friend, and the first defendant.
 The Terms of Settlement are not to be
disclosed but are known to all parties and recorded on the court file.  The
matter has therefore
proceeded only against the second defendant.
<P>

6   	The terms of the tenancy agreement between the plaintiff's
mother and the Department of Housing were not put in evidence and
no point was
taken that it was the mother as tenant in possession and not the Department
that was responsible for the tree.  As the
tree was there when the tenancy
commenced, I am satisfied that the Department was responsible for it:
<b><i>Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 313</a>,
<b><i>Parker v South Australian Housing Trust </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2041%20SASR%20494" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 41 SASR 494</a>,

<P>

7   	I am satisfied that the tree was a dangerous tree to have
in the backyard of residential premises where children were likely
to be living
and/or playing, as they in fact were.  What rendered it dangerous in those
circumstances was that because of the so-called
"split" down the centre the
branches commenced to separate close to the ground thereby making it easy, and
therefore attractive,
for young children to climb, whereas a tree whose
branches did not separate until much higher off the ground would not so readily
attract climbers.  The plaintiff's mother was also concerned that because of
the split in the trunk and the ants' nest at its base
there was a danger that
the tree might fall or collapse; but in my view the main problem was that
because of its shape and configuration
it was an attraction or allurement to
young persons to climb it, and it was foreseeable that if they did, and the
tree collapsed,
the branches broke or the climbers lost their footing, they
would fall and suffer physical injury, not necessarily of the precise
type
suffered by the plaintiff, but some form of physical injury including broken
bones, bruising and/or abrasions.
<P>

8   	I accept Ms Van Beers' evidence that on a number of
occasions over a number of years she complained about the tree and asked
that
it be removed.  In particular I am satisfied that she complained both in person
and over the telephone to Mr Sullivan and other
employees of the Department who
it would seem made notes of such complaint on loose pieces of paper but no
permanent record; and
although representatives apparently came and inspected
the tree on occasions, nothing was done to remove it until after the
plaintiff's
accident.  Because Ms Vicki White was not appointed to Port
Macquarie until October 1994, it appears that the complaints made to
her by Ms
Van Beers were probably made after the plaintiff's accident.
<P>

9   	In my opinion, the dangerous nature of the tree having been
drawn to the attention of the Department's servants, the Department
was
negligent in not removing it prior to the plaintiff's accident, and such
negligence was an effective cause of the plaintiff's
falling and suffering his
injuries.
<P>

10   	There is a partial defence raised of contributory
negligence, and I am satisfied that the plaintiff had been told by his mother
not to climb the tree; but although a child can be guilty of contributory
negligence; <b><i>McHale v Watson </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 199</a>, <b><i>Mye v
Peters </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2068%20SR%28NSW%29%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 68 SR(NSW) 298</a>, he was at the time only 10 years of age,
the cricket ball had become lodged in the upper branches and the game was
presumably held
up for want of a ball.  In these circumstances I would regard
the plaintiff's action in climbing the tree merely as disobedience
of a
parental direction and I would not regard it as a failure to take reasonable
care for his own safety.  The defence of contributory
negligence is not made
out.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff was born on 17 April 1984 and accordingly
was 10 years old at the time of the accident and is 15 years old now.
 On 21
November he was transferred by Air Ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital
for Children in Sydney where his wound was debrided
on a number of occasions,
he spent some days in the Intensive Care Unit, he had blood transfusions and
underwent a number of operations
including skin grafts.  He suffered a lot of
pain whilst undergoing the various grafts and other treatment at the Children's
Hospital
and was discharged from there to the Port Macquarie Base Hospital on
22 December 1994 from which hospital he was discharged on 29
December 1994.
The Discharge Summary Notes from the Children's Hospital record that he was
suffering suicidal ideation whilst in
that hospital.  
<P>

12   	At the time of the accident he was in Year 5 at school and
claims to have been doing quite well.  He was also a keen Rugby
League player.
The plaintiff was examined by Dr John F. Davis on 12 January 1999 who observed
a large ugly skin grafted area extending
basically from the posterior pelvic
brim over the hips and lateral aspect of the left thigh with a large number of
areas of blistering
and skin breakdown which were a little weepy although they
appeared to be drying up to some extent.  He also noted sensory changes
with
the upper half of the scar being extremely hypersensitive whilst the lower half
was quite hypoaesthetic.  There was also a large
area of muscle and soft tissue
deficit and quite marked prominence of the left femoral head.  He found hip
movements full with some
discomfort at the end of the range of forced flexion
and the plaintiff walked with a normal gait.  The wound is shown in the
photographs
Exs. C (shortly after the grafting procedure), D (about December
1994) and E (July 1999).  The breakdown of the grafted area shown
in Ex. E is a
transient but recurring problem.  
<P>

13   	I examined the scarring myself on the outer and frontal
aspects of the plaintiff's left thigh.  It runs down the thigh for
about 12
inches from a position about 1 to 2 inches above the belt line and is
approximately 6 inches wide.  It is discoloured, botchy,
irregular and
disfiguring.  There is a further area of less disfigurement further down the
leg from where the grafts have been taken.
 The area is hypersensitive and
contact causes severe tenderness and pain.  He is unable to run, play football
or take part in contact
sports due to pain and the pain is also aggravated with
the use of stairs or heavy lifting.  He suffers numbness and paracsthesia
in
his left hip if he sits for too long.
<P>

14   	He missed most of the 1995 school year because of his
condition when he was theoretically in Year 6 and, notwithstanding the
time
missed, was considered suitable to commence Year 7 at West Port Technology High
School in Port Macquarie, but was initially
enrolled for only two days per
week.  With the amount of time he had missed the previous year and his
part-time attendance he had
a lot of problems in high school both in keeping up
with the work and in disciplinary matters.  He was teased by other students
which
he found difficult to cope with and was unable to play sport because of
the consequences of his injuries.  He had some counselling
from school
counsellors, but this was not effective, and following a series of incidents he
was expelled in the middle of Year 9
in 1998.  He then commenced the
Alternative Learning Programme in the Hastings Area (ALPHA) which involved
Literacy and Numeracy
and continued that until the end of last year.  This year
(1999) he commenced Year 9 studies in such subjects at the TAFE College
in Port
Macquarie and he claims to be getting high marks in both courses.  
<P>

15   	He says he feels quite good about himself.  He goes to the
beach but wears long shorts which are the current fashion.  He
has no
girlfriend but he is really not interested in girls at this stage.  He says he
has no problem about people seeing the scar,
that he does not have trouble
talking to people and has a number of mates, a couple of whom are his age and
others are older.  He
listens to live music and when it was put to him by
counsel for the defence he agreed that he was a happy fellow, he gets a laugh
out of life and is happy with his mates.  His mother on the other hand presents
a very different picture and presented a very different
picture to the
psychologist.  She describes him as withdrawn, depressed, wants to stay home
and keep to himself, says that he walks
with a limp, that his life has been
ruined and so has hers, that he is not confident with other people, that he
only has a couple
of friends with whom he goes to the pictures once every two
weeks, and she then goes to pick them up and brings them back to her
place
where the friends stay overnight because they live out of town.  She says that
although he appears to be comfortable when talking
to his friends he is not
comfortable when talking to strangers, and that he has a number of off days
when he becomes quite withdrawn
and retires to his room where he plays his
music.  She says he has a very "short fuse" and does not like being told what
to do. 

<P>

16   	Cheryl Bailey also described him as very withdrawn since
the accident and not socialising with children of his own age and
not wanting
to mix although she had not had a lot of close contact with him and his family
over the last twelve months.  
<P>

17   	His brother Anthony Donovan who is two years older than
the plaintiff described him as being "pretty cool" before the accident,
into
sport, good academically and "normal compared to what he is now".  His evidence
and that of the plaintiff's step father, Craig
Jones, who both impressed as
truthful, reliable witnesses suggest that the plaintiff is hiding his real
feelings and emotions about
the injury and scaring.  He clearly does not feel
good about the scarring, no one could; and I accept that he has become
withdrawn
to a degree, although it is difficult to assess the extent to which
that is due to the injury and scarring and to what extent it
is due to natural
adolescent development or the difficult family situation, but in my view,
because of the nature of the scarring
and disfigurement it is likely that his
withdrawal is at least largely due to the injury.  
<P>

18   	I am satisfied that he does have friends, goes to the
movies, live bands, beach and such like; that he is not presently interested
in
the opposite sex, but he is only 15 years old, although having regard to the
nature and extent of the scarring he will be at a
disadvantage in this regard
as he grows older.
<P>

19   	The psychologist, Diana Reid, concluded that he was
severely depressed which was manifested by symptoms of withdrawal,
irritability,
outbursts of aggression, low self esteem and difficulty
maintaining attention, and suggested the possibility of a Post Traumatic
Stress
Disorder but did not make a final diagnosis in that regard.  I am satisfied
that the plaintiff tends to hide his real feelings
about his disfigurement and
disabilities; and also he seemed to have a tendency to agree with propositions
put to him, especially
in cross-examination.  Although he has on occasions
talked in terms of having little or nothing to live for, I am not satisfied
that
there is any real likelihood of him taking his own life.  
<P>

20   	The plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer
considerable pain and discomfort, he has extensive and ugly scarring,
there are
the restrictions on his activities to which I have referred and he is
significantly depressed, although not to the extent
described by his mother.
The scarring and hypersensitivity of the left hip is unlikely to be improved by
any further surgery.
<P>

21   	I assess the plaintiff's general damages at $180,000 of
which I apportion $60,000 to the past, and I allow interest on the
latter
amount at 2% per annum for five years, namely $6,000.
<P>

22   	Loss of earning capacity was left very much at large on
the evidence.  The only material adduced as to what he could have
earned if not
injured was the table of Average Weekly Earnings (Ex. O), which is of very
little assistance as it includes the wages
of highly paid executives, managers
and employees with professional qualifications, as well as the more menial and
lowly paid jobs.
 There can moreover only be guesswork and speculation as to
what he might have done if not injured.  He started a motor mechanics
course
recently but decided to put it off until next year.  He can stand for about
forty-five minutes and sit for about one and a
half hours but then has to get
up and move around to avoid pain in his hip area.  
<P>

23   	He has worked with his current step father doing furniture
removalist work but this made his hip sore and he needed to rest.
 He has also
recently expressed an interest in training as a boilermaker, but whether he
would have obtained an apprenticeship as
a motor mechanic or boilermaker is
uncertain, and he would have difficulty doing such work now, particularly
bending, stretching,
going under motor vehicles and such like due to the
hypersensitivity of his scarring; and his step father says that although he
tried
hard, because of the injury, he would not be employable on the open
market as a furniture removalist.  
<P>

24   	His brother Anthony has just completed his Higher School
Certificate (and moved out of home to do so) but gave no evidence
of what
career he hoped to pursue apart from the possibility of a career in top class
Rugby League, where he may have some prospects.
 Although the plaintiff also
enjoyed playing the game and according to his brother could "run straight and
hard," I am not satisfied
his prospects in that regard were as good as his
brother's.  His other older brother's whereabouts and occupation, if any, were
not
the subject of any evidence and their natural father, according to Ms
Reid's report on the family background, is it would seem not
generally engaged
in gainful employment.  His current step father is employed in the furniture
removalist business whilst his mother
currently works part-time as an assistant
teacher, teaching literacy, reading and writing to aboriginal children in the
kindergarten
class at Port Macquarie Primary School.
<P>

25   	Moreover, although reference was made to the good results
he is currently obtaining in the courses he is presently doing at
the TAFE
College there was no evidence as to the level, standard or content of such
courses.
<P>

26   	In all the circumstances I consider that if he had not
been injured the plaintiff would probably have been engaged in unskilled,
labouring or process work, probably with some periods of unemployment.  A lot,
if not most of those occupations are now closed to
him because of the pain in
his thigh, particularly if it is bumped, and his inability to run, lift heavy
weights, or to stand or
sit in one place for any length of time, and to this
extent I agree with the opinions expressed by Peter Barron in his report that
he would be fit for process work, but the opportunities for such work in his
local area are greatly limited.  
<P>

27   	The plaintiff is currently only aged 15 years and if not
injured may have remained in school for another 3 years, and in any
event would
not have earned full adult wages for some time.  For this reason I will allow
loss of earning capacity for 47 years (from
18 years to 65 years) less 15% for
vicissitudes but the whole amount postponed for 3 years.
<P>

28   	Doing the best I can with the meagre materials available,
I assess the plaintiff's loss of  earning capacity at $200 net per
week and I
allow this amount capitalised for 47 years at 3% per annum less 15% for
vicissitudes namely $225,300 postponed for 3 years
at 3%, namely $206,150.
<P>

29   	In regard of loss of superannuation benefits, no figures
have been placed before me but doing some rough calculations similar
to those
used in some other cases and based on a wage loss of $230 per week gross I
allow under this head $19,690.
<P>

30   	Out-of-Pocket expenses to date are agreed at $5,457.
There is no formal claim for future out-of-pocket expenses and no evidence
in
respect thereof except that attached to the report of Ms Reid in respect of
psychological counselling.  The plaintiff has not
had any counselling since he
left school and expressed no intention to have it, but some psychological
counselling would in my opinion
be beneficial.  Unfortunately Ms Reid gives
three sets of figures, all dated 10 July 1999, but no explanation for the
different rates.
 Also I do not consider the number of consultations she
advises to be reasonable.  For future psychological counselling I allow
$3,000.
<P>

31   	
<P>

The various heads of damages may therefore be summarised as follows:
<P>

General damages		$180,000
<P>

Interest on past general damages		6,000
<P>

Out-of-pocket expenses to date		5,457
<P>

Future psychological counselling		3,000
<P>

Loss of future earning capacity		206,150
<P>

Loss of future superannuation benefits		<u>19,690</u>
<P>

		<u>$420,297</u>
<P>

32   	I direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff against
the second defendant for this amount and order the second defendant
to pay the
plaintiff's costs of the proceedings against it.
<P>

33   	I direct that the amount of the judgment be paid into
Court and then to the Public Trustee for investment on behalf of the
plaintiff
