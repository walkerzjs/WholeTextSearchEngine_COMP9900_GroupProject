<b>1806/99 - HEATH GROUP AUSTRALASIA PTY LIMITED v LEONARD HENRY HANNING</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered ex tempore on 26 July 1999;  revised 27 July
1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  In this proceeding I handed down reasons for
judgment on 19 July 1999 concluding that I should make orders to remove
two
proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to this
Court, together with a proceeding before the Chief
Industrial Magistrate.  The
plaintiffs intend to make an application to the Federal Court for transfer of
two proceedings from that
Court to this Court.
<P>

2  	The parties returned to the Court today for the making of orders
and to deal with two issues which remain in contention.  The
first relates to
the conciliation procedure which is required under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> of the<b>
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act 1996</a> (NSW).  As counsel for the defendants pointed
out, that procedure is not a discretionary matter.  If the Commission
proceedings are
removed to this Court before conciliation has occurred, the
statutory duty which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> impresses on the Commission will have to be
discharged by this Court in some way.  It seems to me that since the Commission
has in
place established procedures for conciliation and this Court's
procedures, though they allow for mediation and similar matters, do
not
specifically make provision for conciliation, it would be preferable for
conciliation to occur while the two proceedings are
still in the Commission and
before their removal to this Court.  
<P>

3  	However, that consideration could be outweighed if it emerged
that conciliation in the Commission would produce such undue delay
that the
present plaintiffs would be thereby prejudiced. There is no evidence before me
as to the amount of delay (if any) to which
conciliation in the Commission
would lead.  I propose to grant liberty to apply and if the present plaintiffs
wish to use that liberty
to make an application in which they would provide
evidence of delay and prejudice, then they may do so.  
<P>

4  	For the time being, it seems to me, the appropriate course is, as
I foreshadowed in my reasons for judgment of 19 July 1999,
to make an order
staying the orders for removal of the Commission proceedings to this Court
until the conciliation procedure contemplated
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> is attended to.  I note
that this was the approach taken by Young J in<b> </b><i>Minproc Ltd v
Killinger </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/564.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 564.</a>  I do not regard the decision as
distinguishable by virtue of the fact that the Commission had there made an
order for conciliation,
since it seems to me the substance of the issue is
whether the Commission or the Court is, as a matter of this Court's discretion,
the better equipped to deal with conciliation.
<P>

5  	The second issue in contention relates to costs.  The substantive
relief sought in the summons was dealt with in my reasons
for judgment, and the
orders which follow today will give effect to those reasons, subject to the
stay of the removal orders to which
I have referred.  It is true that the
plaintiffs have yet to complete their application to the Federal Court for
transfer of the
proceedings in that court, and so the process of transferring
all relevant proceedings to this Court has not yet been completed.
 It is also
true that the plaintiffs would have had to make an application to this Court
even if there were no opposition, in order
to secure removal of the Commission
proceedings.  Nevertheless, the plaintiffs have succeeded in a contested
application and their
success was on all substantive points argued, except on
the question of stay of the removal orders.  Therefore, costs up to but not
including today's hearing should follow the event.
<P>

6  	In terms of the short minutes of order which I initial and date
for the purposes of identification, I make orders 1 - 3.  In
order 4 I make the
order with the additional words `within the present proceedings'.  I make
orders 5, 7 and 8 with the exception
that in order 8 the plaintiffs are
entitled to costs only up to 23 July 1999 since the defendants had some success
with respect to
the stay of proceedings today.  I do not make order 6 which I
regard as premature at this stage.  I order that orders 1 and 2 be
stayed until
the conciliation required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act 1996</a> has
occurred, or until further order.  I intend that the existing liberty to apply
may be used to make an application in relation
to that matter.
