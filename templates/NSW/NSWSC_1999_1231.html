<b>3837/99 FRANCIS EDWARD MURPHY &amp; ANOR v TEAKBRIDGE PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER:  The present proceedings before me are an application to
wind up the defendant.  There is also a notice of motion brought
by the
defendant seeking leave under s 459S of the <i>Corporations Law</i> to raise
certain matters by way of defence.  The summons which commenced the proceedings
sought the winding up based upon a failure
to comply with a statutory demand.
At the commencement of the hearing it was also made clear that the plaintiff
seeks to wind up
the company on the basis of actual insolvency in the event
that the failure to comply with the demand was not available.  The statutory
demand was made by Francis Edward Murphy and Laraine Lee Murphy and sought
repayment of $43,220 being monies due under a contract
for the sale of business
dated 17 September 1998.  The demand was dated 23 July 1999.  At the hearing
and following amendment of
the notice under s 465C of the <i>Corporations
Law</i> the following defences were raised.
<P>

1.	Abuse of process.
<P>

2.	Non-delivery of the statutory demand.
<P>

3.	The Court's general discretion as to whether the company should be wound
up.
<P>

4.	Non compliance with part 80A rule 16.
<P>

5.	Lack of relevant parties, namely, Shelltex Pty Limited.
<P>

2  	In respect of this last matter the defect has been cured by
Shelltex becoming a party to the proceedings.  In respect of the
second last
matter appropriate evidence was available and thus the point does not arise.
<P>

3  	In respect of the notice of motion under s 459S the matters
sought to be raised if leave is granted are:
<P>

1.	A dispute as to the indebtedness of the defendant.
<P>

2.	Offsetting claims in respect of retention of four trucks owned by the
defendant.
<P>

3.	Failure to have the statutory demand issued by all necessary joint
debtors.
<P>

4.	Abuse of process.
<P>

4  	Given this variety of defences and matters which arise under the
notice of motion seeking leave under s 459S, it necessary to
give some
consideration as to how the matter ought to be approached.  I seems to me that
I should first deal with the defence that
there was non-delivery of the
statutory demand.  If there was no delivery then there was no non-compliance
and therefore no presumption
of insolvency that would arise under the law.  
<P>

5  	It would then be necessary to move to the abuse of process point
to see whether -
<P>

6  	(a)	The plaintiff establishes the necessary standing as a
creditor.  In the event that there is a dispute as to the existence
of the
debt, ie the whole of the debt, it may be appropriate to conclude that the
plaintiff has no standing and thus the proceedings
are an abuse.  In this event
one does not get to consider the question of actual insolvency.  See <i>Wilson
Market Research &amp; Corporations Law </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 311.</a>
<P>

(b)	There are parallel proceedings in which case the court may conclude that
the present proceedings are an abuse of process.
<P>

7  	If the answer to the question as to whether there was
non-delivery of the statement of demand is that there was delivery, it
would be
necessary to move to the application under s 459S rather than the abuse of
process point.  This because the abuse point
could have been relied upon under
s 459J1(b) on the application to set aside the demand.  The principal matter on
the application
under s 459S is whether the court is satisfied that the ground
of opposition is material to proving that the company is insolvent.
 If the
court is not satisfied then no leave will be granted and the abuse point would
not be available to be dealt with in the proceedings.
 If the answer is, yes,
then the court can move on to deal with such grounds as are material to proving
that the company is solvent.
 These would only seem to be the dispute as to
indebtedness and the offsetting claims.  
<P>

8  	It seems therefore that the first matter to be dealt with is
whether or not there was delivery of the statutory demand and I
will now turn
to that matter.
<P>

9  	According to the plaintiffs' evidence the statutory demand was
served by post by sending it by ordinary pre-paid post addressed
to the
defendant at its registered office which was Unit 2, 140 Nicholson Parade,
Cronulla.  Evidence was given by the Susanne Mary
Clarke, a secretary in charge
of mail who swore to the posting of the letter.  Cross examination demonstrated
she put letters in
envelopes and then took the mail to be posted to the post
office.  A postage book was kept which recorded items being posted but
did not
record the addressees.  Accordingly, it was apparent that the only reason that
the plaintiff could depose to postage of a
particular item was the fact that
she had subsequently seen a copy of the letter enclosing the demand dated 26
July 1999 and that
the regular practice was that mail was posted on the day of
the letter.  Given the usual course I would accept that the letter was
posted
by ordinary pre-paid post to the defendant at its registered office on 26 July
1997.  
<P>

10  	There was also evidence from an officer from Australia Post that
in the ordinary course the letter would have been delivered
on the second
working day after posting.  There is also evidence that the letter has not been
returned in the post to the plaintiffs'
solicitor's office.
<P>

11  	Provision is made in s 160 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> relating
to service and certain presumptions concerning service in the ordinary course
of post.  However, in <b>Howship Holdings Pty Limited v Leslie &amp; Anor
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=14%20ACLC%201549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">14 ACLC 1549</a> and in <b>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Barroleg
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/428.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 428</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 ACSR 167</a> His Honour Mr Justice Young held that s 109Y (b) of the
<b>Corporations Law </b>and not s 160 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </b>applied to
postal service of a statutory demand.  Under the provisions of the former s
220(1) and the present provisions of s 109X(1)
of the <b>Corporations</b>
<b>Law </b>a document may be served on a company, inter alia, by posting it to
the company's registered office.  Section 109Y deals with the
meaning of
service by post and is in the following terms.
<P>

""109Y Where a provision of this Law authorises or requires any document to be
served by post, whether the expression "serve" or
the expression "give" or
"send" or any other expression is used, then:
<P>

(a)	the service is taken to be effected by properly addressing and posting
(under pre-paid post) the document as a letter to the
last known address of the
person to be served; and
<P>

(b)	unless the contrary is proved, the service is taken to have been effected
at the time at which the letter would have been delivered
in the ordinary
course of post."
<P>

12  	It can be seen by this section that the only requirement is that
the postage be by prepaid post.
<P>

13  	In Fancourt v Mercantile Credits Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20154%20CLR%2087" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 154 C.L.R. 87</a> the
High Court had to deal with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a> of the <b>Acts <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</a> </b>1956 in
Queensland.  In terms that was very similar to s 109Y.  At page 96 the Court
had the following to say:-
<P>

"There is a line of cases, commencing with Reg. v. County of London Quarter
Sessions Appeals Committee; Ex parte Rossi 19  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%201%20QB%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] 1 Q.B. 682</a>, which deal
with the effect of proof of non-delivery where service by post is permitted and
used, having regard to s. 26 of the Interpretation
Act 1889 (U.K.) . That
section is the equivalent of s. 39(1) of the Queensland Acts Interpretation
Acts.  The effect of the cases
appears to be that proof of non-delivery means
that service cannot be deemed to have taken place under the second limb of the
section
at the time of delivery in the ordinary course of the post and cannot
be established as having taken place at any other time.  The
consequence is
that where it is necessary to establish service at a particular time, proof of
non-delivery is as effective as proof
of non service, notwithstanding that
service by post is in the circumstances permitted and the requirements of the
Interpretation
Act are observed: see Beer v. Davies 20  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%202%20QB%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] 2 Q.B. 187</a>;
Hewitt v. Leicester Corporation 21  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20WLR%20855" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 W.L.R. 855</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20All%20ER%20802" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 All E.R. 802</a>;
Saga Ltd. v. Avalon Promotions 22  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20QB%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 Q.B. 325n</a>; A./S. Cathrineholm v.
Norequipment 23  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20QB%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 Q.B. 314</a>; cf.  Lombard Australia Ltd.  V. Mohrwinkel

in such a result because it means that, notwithstanding the adoption of
a
permitted means of service, the service is nevertheless ineffective if there is
proof of non-delivery.  It is, however, unnecessary
to pursue these decisions
here save to remark that they are all cases in which delivery was disproved.
Despite remarks in the judgments
about non-receipt, it was non-delivery which
was significant because the second limb of s. 26 of the Interpretation Act
refers to
proof of the contrary of delivery.  As the present case shows,
delivery may be different from receipt by the intended recipient and,
provided
that delivery is not disproved, the fact of non-receipt does not displace the
result that delivery is deemed to have been
effected at the time at which it
would have taken place in the ordinary course of the post.  There is here no
evidence of non-delivery.
it follows that the application of s. 39(1) of the
Acts Interpretation Acts in no way affects the proof of service of the notices
in this case in accordance with s. 42(1) (c) of the Hire-Purchase Act and that
such service is deemed to have taken place in the
due course of the post.  It
also follows that the appellants fail to establish any defence under s. 13(4)
of the Hire-Purchase Act.
971"
<P>

14  	This is clear authority which is binding on the construction of
s 109Y which is in material respects identical to the section
under
consideration by the High Court.
<P>

15  	The question is whether in fact there is evidence of
non-delivery.  Clearly, in many cases there is evidence of non receipt.
Frequently this occurs in cases where a registered office has been vacated and
the document is served and not returned through the
post.  In such cases the
mere fact of non receipt does not prove non delivery.  
<P>

16  	The present circumstances in this case are somewhat different
and it is necessary to see whether there might be evidence which
would suggest
non delivery.  The first thing to note about the present matter is that the
registered office was at the address of
a home unit in Sydney which was Mr
Adams' residence when in Sydney.  He normally resided in Sydney from Friday
over the weekend and
sometimes on Monday.  The rest of the time he would
normally spend in Newcastle attending to his other business.  He gave evidence
that he was the person who received the mail except for an occasion when the
letter box became too full when his next door neighbour
would take it out and
later give it to him.  
<P>

17  	He swears that the letter was not received.  He also swears that
he was in Sydney on 26, 30 and 31 July.  Given these dates
if the letter had
been delivered in the ordinary course one could conclude that it would come to
his attention.  
<P>

18  	Another matter to note is that being an accountant and having
practised in insolvency areas he is aware of the importance of
the statutory
demand and would not have ignored it if it had been received.  The fact that it
was not delivered to him seems to be
supported by Mr Adams' reaction when he
first heard of the fact that a statutory demand had been served.  This occurred
at the meeting
between him and Mr Murphy when Mr Murphy wanted to talk about
their disputes.  The meeting was on 25 August 1999.  Mr Murphy is alleged
to
have said:-
<P>

 "Thanks for coming Robert. I want to talk about the business between us.  My
solicitor tells me that you have committed an act
of bankruptcy."
<P>

19  	Mr Adams replied:-
<P>

"What the hell are you talking about?"
<P>

Mr Murphy said:
<P>

My solicitor sent you a Statutory Demand and gave you 21 days to pay and he
didn't get a reply to that demand.  He wants me to take
action on that but I'm
willing to offer you one last chance."
<P>

20  	Mr Adams said:
<P>

"What are you talking about? I have never received anything from your solicitor
and especially not a Statutory Demand."
<P>

21  	Although Mr Murphy filed an affidavit sworn after this one he
did not deny the conversation nor was Mr Adams cross examined
to suggest that
the conversation was false.  
<P>

22  	It seems to me that it is important in this case that we are not
dealing with a letter which was sent to a business address
where other people
may open mail or where there is a likelihood of it being mislaid.  There is no
doubt that the letter was posted
but it seems to me that the evidence given by
Mr Adams is sufficient evidence "to the contrary" to disprove delivery of the
letter.
<P>

23  	In these circumstances there is no proof of the time of delivery
and, accordingly, there has been no compliance with the demand.
 In these
circumstances I move on to the question as to whether there has been an abuse
of process in respect of the present proceedings.
<P>

24  	The first area for consideration on the abuse of process
argument depends upon whether or not the plaintiff can prove that
it is a
creditor.  The statutory demand in this matter claims an amount of debt being
$43,220.  The detail of that is referred to
in the affidavit in support of the
statutory demand which sets out special condition 2(b) of the contract between
the parties.  The
contract was for the sale of a business and the relevant
clause was in the following terms:-
<P>

"The parties acknowledge that as at the date of this agreement the sum of
$200,000.00 has been paid.  Of the balance of $50,000.00
the amount of
$32,000.00 will be considered to have been repaid when the current leases over
the two vehicles marked with * in clause
two (2) of annexure "A" hereto have
been repaid in full by the purchasers and the purchasers acknowledge that they
will from the
date of this agreement be responsible for the payment of the said
leases.  The balance of $18,000.00 is an interest free loan from
the vendors to
the purchasers repayable within six (6) months of the date of this
agreement."
<P>

25  	The undisputed evidence before me is that the leases of the two
trucks which were referred to in the clause, which were entered
into by the
vendors, have in fact been replaced by leases entered into by the purchaser,
the defendant in this matter.  This would
seem to fulfil the requirements of
clause 2(b) and, accordingly, there is no doubt that $32,000 is not payable.
The balance which
appears to be either $18,000 or $18,020 is said to be an
interest free loan.  Mr Adams, on behalf of the defendant, has not sworn
any
evidence about repayment of that loan.  The only evidence that goes to the
matter is a letter from the plaintiffs' former solicitors
Messrs Burgess Foat
in which they make demands for various amounts.  The demand included the loan
of $18,000 but referred to a payment
of $8,000 on 3 March 1999.  The letter
which was not clear that this amount was paid in relation to the $18,000 loan.
In the absence
of evidence either from Mr Adams or Mr Murphy that the $18,000
has been paid in reduction of the loan, I would not conclude that
the $18,000
has been repaid in part.  
<P>

26  	The other area which should be mentioned is the offsetting
claims which are raised in the evidence.  These offsetting claims
relate to the
retention by the plaintiff of vehicles belonging to the defendant.  The
vehicles were in a leased area occupied by
the defendant when the plaintiff
took possession of it apparently after issuing a notice to quit.  The plaintiff
secured the vehicles
and then subsequently removed them from the site.  No
basis for the retainer of any satisfactory nature has been advanced.  There
is
evidence before me that the damages for retention of the vehicle PAR107 of
$37,500 and the vehicle PAY422 of $22,5000.  This is
a total of $59,500.  
<P>

27  	However for the purposes of considering whether the creditor has
standing it is only appropriate to consider the claim in debt
and the potential
set off evidenced by the offsetting claim cannot be taken into account.  See
<i>L &amp; D Audio Acoustic Pty Limited v Pioneer Electronic Australia Pty
Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%207%20ACLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 7 ACLR 180</a> at 183 or  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20ACLC%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 ACLC 538</a> at 539.  Accordingly
in the present case since the set off does not affect the standing of the
plaintiffs as creditor one could not
conclude there is an abuse of process by
virtue of the fact that the creditor has no standing.  There is at least an
admitted debt
due of $18,000.  
<P>

28  	The next matter to consider is the parallel proceedings point.
Shelltex Pty Limited who is now a plaintiff in these proceedings
commenced
proceedings in the Local Court at Newcastle to recover $10,000 from the
defendant.  The claim was issued on 8 April 1999.
 The statutory demand in
these proceedings was dated 23 July 1999 and it will be recalled that in a
letter of 18 June 1999 a demand
had been made for a payment in relation to a
loan of $18,000.  These proceedings were discontinued on 30 September 1999
which is
after the issue of the summons in these proceedings on 6 September
1999.  
<P>

29  	In <i>Portfolio Projects Pty Ltd v Oakes Building Co Pty Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%205%20ACLC%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 5 ACLC 911</a> at 913, His Honour Mr Justice Needham was concerned with
a case of a parallel set of proceedings.  He concluded at 913 that:-
<P>

"It seems to me to be an abuse of the process of this Court to make the claim
for that sum of money as included in its Common Law
claim, and then to seek to
wind the company up by parallel proceedings in the Equity Division because of
the failure to pay to the
plaintiff the same sum of $78,930."
<P>

30  	His Honour's comments were adopted by Santow J in <i>Roy Morgan
Research v Wilson Market Research </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%20925" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 925.</a>  There was also
reference with approval to what was said by the late Master Adams in Mala Pty
Ltd v Johnston  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 100</a> at 102.  There the Master said:-
<P>

"As to abuse of process, it is prima facie an abuse of process for any party to
institute two proceedings for the one claim. That
much, I think, appears from a
case cited to me this morning, Portfolio Projects Pty Ltd v Oakes Building Co
Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%205%20ACLC%20911" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 5 ACLC 911.</a> I use the words &#180;prima facie' because there can
be an explanation why two proceedings are issued and it is a matter for the
court to determine whether the explanation is sufficient. That, I think,
appears from Re Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%208%20ACLC%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 8 ACLC 153</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20WAR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 WAR
465</a> where there was at the time of the filing of a petition civil proceedings
in the court which involved a dispute as to the same amount."
<P>

31  	In the present case there has been cross examination of Mr
Murphy one of the principals of the other plaintiff Shelltex Pty
Limited.  That
cross examination demonstrated that the proceedings commenced by Shelltex were
for part of the same sum as was sought
to be recovered in the present statutory
demand.  As I have earlier indicated the chronology indicates that the
proceedings for recovery
of the debt by Shelltex were commenced well before the
issue of the statutory demand and the commencement of these proceedings.
Clearly
they were part of a recovery process which also included the letter of
18 June 1999 to which I have referred.  Mr Murphy seems to
have changed
solicitors some time after that letter was written and a procedure was adopted
by the new solicitors of issuing a statutory
demand and then commencing these
proceedings.  In my view the change of solicitors does not excuse what has
happened.  It seems to
me that the issue of the statutory demand is another
step in the debt collection process adopted by Mr Murphy.  There is of course
nothing intrinsically wrong with a debt collecting process.  However, to issue
proceedings for the winding up of a company when there
are already proceedings
on foot for the recovery of the debt is, as has been pointed out in the cases,
prima facie an abuse.  There
is nothing in the evidence that provides an
explanation in respect of the matter.
<P>

32  	In these circumstances I am satisfied that the commencement of
these proceedings is an abuse of process and that, accordingly,
the summons
should be dismissed.
<P>

33  	The orders that I make are:-
<P>

1.	That the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.	That the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs.
