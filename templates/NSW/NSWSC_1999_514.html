<P>

<b>1953/99	EDMOND AL-HADI &amp; ANOR   -v-   GAZI ZREIKA &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:    </b>These proceedings were instituted by
summons filed on 9 April 1999 by the plaintiffs, Edmond Al-Hadi and Ramona
Al-Hadi.  The defendants
named to that summons are Gazi Zreika and Wafaa
Zreika.  The summons seeks declarations and injunctive relief concerning the
drainage
of sewerage from the land of the defendants through the land of the
plaintiffs and also seeks damages and costs.
<P>

2   	An appearance was filed on behalf of the defendants by
Bruce Brian Cameron of Cameron Gillingham &amp; Boyd on 19 April 1999.
 The
matter came before Bergin J as Duty Judge in the Equity Division on 27 April
1999.  On that date orders were made by consent,
those orders being
declarations in the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 in the summons and an order in
the terms of paragraph 3 in the
summons.  On that occasion the first defendant
appeared in person.  I gather that the defendants had by then dispensed with
the services
of their solicitors, although no notice of ceasing to act has yet
been filed.  
<P>

3   	The orders by consent also included orders in the form of a
timetable set forth in short minutes dated 27 April 1999.  That
timetable
included provision for the filing of affidavits by the defendants by 17 May
1999.  No affidavits of the defendants were
filed by that date or indeed at any
time.
<P>

4   	The orders of Bergin J included an order that the matter be
listed before the Registrar this day, 31 May 1999.  The matter
has been
referred by the Registrar to me upon the application of the plaintiffs.  The
purpose of that referral was the application
of the plaintiffs for damages and
for costs.  The amount of damages sought by the plaintiffs is in a total amount
of $2,870.  In
support of that amount the plaintiffs relied upon the affidavit
of Buddy John Chaloub sworn on 21 May 1999.
<P>

5   	The first defendant appeared in person; his daughter acted
as his interpreter.  At the outset the defendants were desirous
that the matter
be further adjourned, an application which was opposed by the plaintiffs on
account of the small amount being claimed
by them in respect to damages.  I
stood the matter down in the list, and ultimately the parties reached agreement
concerning the
claim of the plaintiffs for damages.
<P>

6   	A document entitled Terms of Settlement has been signed by
Counsel for the plaintiffs and by the first defendant on behalf
of the
defendants.  It also bears a notation that the daughter of the first defendant,
Mrs Boushra Kabbout, has acted as interpreter
for her father.  That document is
in the following terms:
<P>

By consent the court orders:
<P>

(1)	That the plaintiffs have judgment against the defendants in the sum of
$2,870.
<P>

7   	I have enquired of Mr Zreika through his daughter whether
he understands the effect of that document and I am satisfied that
he does.

<P>

8   	The plaintiffs now seek an order that the defendants pay
the costs of the plaintiffs of the proceedings.  That application
for costs is
opposed by the defendants.
<P>

9   	The defendants point to the fact which they assert,
although I would emphasise that there is no evidence in this regard since
the
defendants have not filed any affidavits, that the defendants have resided in
their premises for the past twenty years and that
the problem concerning
drainage arose before that time.  
<P>

10   	The various communications which have given rise to the
institution of the present proceedings by summons filed on 9 April
1999 are set
forth in the affidavit of Neil Graham Kerz, the solicitor for the plaintiffs,
sworn 9 April 1999 and in the various
annexures to that affidavit.
<P>

11   	It is unfortunate that the defendants have not been
represented by solicitor or counsel at today's hearing or that they did
not,
before the proceedings were instituted, have the benefit of legal advice.
However, I must decide the matter upon the evidence
which is properly placed
before me.  The Court is, in general, enjoined to follow the principle that the
costs follow the outcome
of the proceedings.  The plaintiffs have been totally
successful in the proceedings brought by them.  At each stage, firstly at the
hearing before Bergin J, and secondly at the hearing before me the defendants
have ultimately consented to the relief sought by the
plaintiffs.
<P>

12   	In those circumstances I am not persuaded that there is
any reason why I should depart from the principle that the defendants
should
pay the costs of the successful plaintiffs.  Accordingly, I propose so to
order.
<P>

13   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I make an order as in the document entitled Terms of Settlement signed by
Counsel for the plaintiffs and the first defendant,
initialled by me and filed
in Court this day.
<P>

(2)	I order that the defendants pay the costs of the plaintiffs.
