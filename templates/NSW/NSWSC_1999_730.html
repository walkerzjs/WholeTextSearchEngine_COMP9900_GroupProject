<b>4826/97	JOANNA MARY BRIDGET KENT-BIGGS   -v-   ANZ EXECUTORS AND TRUSTEE CO
LIMITED   -   ESTATE OF DONNA KENT-BIGGS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</i> 1982</a>.  By summons filed on 20 November 1997 the plaintiff,
Joanna Mary Bridget Kent-Biggs, claims an order for provision for her
maintenance
and advancement in life out of the estate of the late Donna
Kent-Biggs (to whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

2   	At the commencement of the hearing of this matter I stated,
and had it recorded, that the residuary beneficiary named in the
will of the
deceased, to the details of which will I shall shortly advert, is the
University of Sydney; that I am a graduate of the
University of Sydney and a
member of a number of organisations and entities associated with the
University.  Also, that my late mother
was a graduate in medicine of the
University of Sydney where she was taught by Professor Sir Thomas Anderson
Stuart, the first Dean
of the Faculty of Medicine, who was the grandfather of
the deceased. Those facts did not cause any difficulty for either party to
my
hearing this matter.
<P>

3   	The deceased died on 19 or 20 April 1997. She left a will
dated 20 March 1997, probate whereof was, on 16 July 1997, granted
to ANZ
Executors and Trustee Co Limited, the executor named in such will (who is the
defendant to the present proceedings).
<P>

4   	The assets of the estate of the deceased consisted of a
shareholding in Macleay Regis Pty Limited which entitled the deceased
to
occupancy of an apartment in the building known as Macleay Regis, being unit
608/12 Macleay Street, Potts Point. That shareholding
was valued at $480,000 at
the date of the death of the deceased.
<P>

5   	In addition, the deceased left furniture and personal
effects valued at a little over $22,000, and various other investments
and
moneys held in various accounts, bringing the total value of the assets in her
estate at the time of her death to $1,285,508.
 The deceased had liabilities of
$2842, leaving a net value of the estate as at the date of death in an amount
of $1,282,665.
<P>

6   	The assets of the estate have been realised.  The estate
presently consists of assets totalling $1,270,226.  There is a liability
for
commission to the defendant in an amount of about $30,000. Further, it will be
appreciated that the costs of the defendant will,
in any event, be payable out
of the estate of the deceased, and, in the event that she be successful in the
present proceedings,
it is likely that the costs of the plaintiff also will be
payable out of that estate.
<P>

7   	The solicitors for the respective parties have, in
accordance with the prescribed practice, filed affidavits setting forth
estimates of the costs of their respective clients.   For the plaintiff the
estimate of the costs of the proceedings is about $18,500,
whilst the estimate
of the costs of the defendant is about $20,800.
<P>

8   	The will of the deceased made a number of gifts of specific
chattels to various friends and to the University of Sydney. The
residue of the
estate was, by clause 4.2 of the will, given as follows:
<P>

(a)	To the University of Sydney to be initially applied for the charitable
purposes of the restoration and repair in progress at
my death of the building
known as the Anderson Stuart building, and to apply any surplus funds and the
income thereon for future
maintenance of such building.
<P>

(b)	If this gift cannot take effect I direct my trustee to pay it to the
charitable organisation in Australia which my trustee considers
most nearly
fulfils the objects I intend to benefit.
<P>

9   	The evidence filed on behalf of the defendant and, in
particular, that of Professor Jonathan Stone, the Challis Professor of
Anatomy
in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney, reveals that there is
no suggestion that the gift to the University
of Sydney for the purpose
specified in subclause (a) of clause 4.2, which I have just set forth, cannot
take effect.
<P>

10   	The chattels which are the subject of specific gifts have
been transferred to the various beneficiaries named by the deceased
in clause 2
of her will.  There has not been any distribution of the residue of the
estate.
<P>

11   	At the time of her death the deceased was a widow. She
appears to have had no children, and certainly no children were born
of her
marriage.  She was the grand-daughter of the late Professor Sir Thomas Anderson
Stuart, who was the first Dean of the Faculty
of Medicine in the University of
Sydney and after whom the Anderson Stuart Building, the object of the
testamentary beneficence of
the deceased, was named. The age of the deceased
has not been disclosed in the evidence.  
<P>

12   	The plaintiff was born on 9 December 1955.  She is
presently forty-three years of age.  When she was a few days old she was
taken
home by the late David Kent-Biggs and his wife, Joy Cosmo Kent-Biggs, who
formalised their adoption of the plaintiff in about
March 1956.  They had no
other children.  The plaintiff was treated by them, as she was in law, as their
child.
<P>

13   	In 1957, when the plaintiff was still an infant, her
father purchased a coffee plantation in New Guinea, outside a small town
called
Kainantu in the Eastern Highlands, about 120 miles north west of Lae.  That was
the family home of the plaintiff and her parents.
<P>

14   	In 1966, when the plaintiff was aged about ten, she came
to Australia to attend a boarding school in Toowoomba in Queensland.
From then
until she finished her schooling it was the practice of the plaintiff to spend
all of each school holidays --- being holidays
of about three weeks and four
weeks respectively during the year in about May and late August and of about
two months at the end
of the year --- in New Guinea on the plantation with her
parents.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff's mother died on 9 September 1968 when the
plaintiff was aged only twelve. In July of the following year, 1969,
the
plaintiff's father married the deceased.  Apparently the plaintiff had met the
deceased only once before the marriage of her
father and the deceased, that
being an occasion when the plaintiff was a very small child. The deceased was
an old friend of at least
the plaintiff's mother.  Both the plaintiff's mother
and the deceased had been members of the nursing profession and the plaintiff's
father had been acquainted with the deceased before he had met the plaintiff's
mother.
<P>

16   	After the marriage of her father to the deceased the
plaintiff still continued at school in Toowoomba, returning from school
to the
coffee plantation in New Guinea. The plaintiff finished school at the end of
1972.  At that time her father and the deceased
had sold the coffee plantation
and returned to Sydney.  They moved into residence in the residential apartment
of the deceased in
Macleay Street, Potts Point; that appears to have been a one
bedroom apartment.
<P>

17   	From the time when her father and the deceased left New
Guinea and the plaintiff finished school she did not reside with her
father and
the deceased.  The plaintiff commenced training in the nursing profession in
January 1973. She qualified as a nurse and
has practised in that profession
ever since so qualifying.  She has, between 1980 and 1983, worked in the United
Arab Emirates as
a nurse.  She is presently employed by the Western Sydney Area
Health Service in a position as senior nursing administrator.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff's father died in April 1978.  The plaintiff
did not receive any benefit from the estate of her father on his
death.  It
would appear that the entirety of his estate passed to the deceased.
Unfortunately, despite the efforts which have been
made by the legal
representatives of each party in the present proceedings, there has not been
located any precise information concerning
the existence or the provisions of
any will of the plaintiff's father or concerning the details of any assets left
by the plaintiff's
father at the time of his death.
<P>

19   	There is, however, some slight information of assistance
in this regard, being the statement contained in paragraph (e) of
a statutory
declaration made by the deceased on 25 February 1988.  In that paragraph the
deceased said:
<P>

Ninety per cent of my gross estate comes from my own family, namely Anderson
Stuart, my maiden name, from direct inheritance.
<P>

20   	There is no evidence before the Court as to the assets of
the deceased in February 1988, at the time when she made that statement.
It
will be appreciated that that was some nine years before her death.
<P>

21   	In order to have the standing to bring the present
proceedings the plaintiff must establish that she is an eligible person
within
the meaning of one or more of the four paragraphs of the definition of that
phrase contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  Unless
she can establish that she is such an eligible person the plaintiff does not
have the standing to bring the present proceedings.
<P>

22   	The plaintiff submits that she is an eligible person
within paragraph (d) of the definition of that phrase.  That definition
is,
relevantly, as follows:
<P>

A person 
<P>

(i)	who was, at any particular time, wholly or partly dependent upon the
deceased person; and 
<P>

(ii)	who is a grandchild of the deceased person or was, at that particular time
or at any other time, a member of a household of
which the deceased person was
a member.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff submits that for the period from the
marriage of her father to the deceased in July 1969 until at least the
end of
1972, when her father and the deceased departed New Guinea permanently to
reside in Sydney, the plaintiff was a member of
the same household of which the
deceased was a member; and, further, that throughout that period the plaintiff
was partly dependent
upon the deceased.
<P>

24   	The defendant disputes the status of the plaintiff as an
eligible person.  The defendant disputes that the plaintiff was a
member of the
same household as that of which the deceased was a member and disputes that the
plaintiff was ever in any way dependent
upon the deceased.
<P>

25   	I have been taken to a number of authorities concerning
the concept of membership of a household.  Those authorities include
the
decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Ball v. Newey </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%2013%20NSWLR%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 13 NSWLR 489</a> at
492, in particular the judgment of Samuels JA.  I have also been taken to the
unreported decision of McLelland CJ in Eq in <i>Monroe v. Lake </i>(8 February
1991) in which his Honour referred to the decision of Gobbo J of the Supreme
Court of Victoria in <i>Kingsland v. McIndoe </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1989/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] VicRp 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20VR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] VR 273</a> and of Young J
in <i>Benney v. Jones </i>(unreported, 13 February 1990), which went on appeal
to the Court of Appeal,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2023%20NSWLR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 23 NSWLR 559.</a>
<P>

26   	McLelland CJ in Eq referred to the concept of the
membership of a household in the context of a degree of continuity and
permanency
of mutual living arrangements.   In the case before his Honour that
concept of continuity and permanency of mutual living arrangements
was absent,
since the plaintiff in that case, together with her mother, apparently was in
the habit of spending each weekend with
the testator, but of spending the rest
of the week in another residence, with the plaintiff's maternal grandfather.
<P>

27   	I have also been taken to the unreported decision of Young
J in <i>Nagatomi v. Hudson </i>(18 September 1997) and to two unreported
decisions of myself, being <i>Murdoch v. Johnson </i>(27 May 1996) and <i>Joy
v. Perpetual Trustee Co Limited </i>(9 December 1998).
<P>

28   	It is suggested on behalf of the defendant that the fact
that for a period from mid-1969 until the end of 1972 the plaintiff
spent a
total of about thirteen weeks each year residing on the coffee plantation with
her father and the deceased, did not result
in the plaintiff, throughout that
period, being a member of the same household as the deceased.
<P>

29   	I do not consider that the fact that the plaintiff was
attending school in Australia whilst her father and his new wife were
residing
in New Guinea deprived the plaintiff of membership of the only household of
which she had ever been, or indeed could be,
a member, being the household of
which her father was a member.  I do not consider that upon his marriage to the
deceased the plaintiff's
membership of the household of which her father was a
member came to an end. Neither do I consider that upon that marriage the father
became a member of two households.
<P>

30   	From a purely practical point of view, at least during the
period whilst the plaintiff was physically present upon the coffee
plantation
in New Guinea she was, in my conclusion, a member of the same household as that
of which the deceased was a member.  The
fact that the coffee plantation
included in its physical domestic arrangements a main homestead and what has
been described by the
plaintiff as a guest house, and that her father and the
deceased occupied the principal homestead (which apparently had only one
bedroom, being constructed in the architectural fashion common to such
establishments in New Guinea at the time), and that the plaintiff
slept in a
physically and geographically separate structure about twenty metres away, did
not, in my conclusion, somehow deprive
the plaintiff of membership of the
household.
<P>

31   	I am satisfied that the living arrangements of the
plaintiff, her father and the deceased upon the coffee plantation were
such
that not only was she a member of the same household as the deceased, during
the periods whilst she was physically present in
New Guinea, but that she still
remained a member of that household during the period whilst she was attending
boarding school at
Toowoomba.
<P>

32   	I have already recorded that the defendant submits that
there was no degree of dependency of the plaintiff upon the deceased.
 In that
regard the defendant submits that essentially the plaintiff's father was
responsible for supporting the plaintiff, and that
the plaintiff, during her
teenage years, was dependent upon her father and that she was not in any way
dependent upon the deceased.
<P>

33   	I have, concerning the question of dependency, been taken
to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Benney v. Jones</i> (to which I
have already referred) and in particular to the judgment of Priestley JA at 565
- 566 where his Honour quoted from the
decision of Samuels JA in <i>Ball v.
Newey</i>, a decision to which I have also earlier referred.
<P>

34   	The concept of dependency is not limited to financial or
economic dependency, although it would certainly appear that such
financial or
economic dependency is an essential part of that concept.  The plaintiff in her
oral evidence, supplemented the material
set forth in her affidavit evidence
concerning the extent of the financial and economic dependency which she
asserted existed between
herself and the deceased.
<P>

35   	She gave evidence concerning shopping trips at the
commencement and at the end of each of her school holidays, when, accompanied
by the deceased, she would go to the town of Lae and items of clothing would
there be purchased for her, which were paid for in cash
by the deceased.  She
also referred to other shopping trips made somewhat more frequently, to a
smaller town closer to the coffee
plantation, where again purchases for her
would be made by cash taken from the deceased's handbag.
<P>

36   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that, whilst
those payments might have been immediately made by the deceased,
the ultimate
source of those payments was the plaintiff's father and not the deceased
herself.  The defendant pointed to the evidence
that whilst in New Guinea the
deceased was not in paid employment, although she did some unpaid voluntary
work of a nursing nature,
and further that whilst she was in New Guinea she did
not have any income.
<P>

37   	That may well be so, but the evidence of the deceased
herself in her statutory declaration is that the bulk of her assets
were
acquired by direct inheritance from her own family, the Anderson Stuarts.  That
assertion is borne out by the size of the estate
of the deceased upon her
death.
<P>

38   	Not only do I conclude that there was a degree of
financial dependency of the plaintiff upon the deceased concerning the purchase
of the plaintiff's clothing during the New Guinea years, but I am satisfied
that during that period also there was a considerable
degree of emotional
dependence of the plaintiff upon the deceased.
<P>

39   	During the New Guinea years the relationship between the
plaintiff and the deceased appears to have been a close and affectionate
one.
It has been described as being a daughter/mother relationship.  Whether it went
so far, I would hesitate to conclude. But it
is certainly clear that there was
no one else to fulfil the role of mother for the plaintiff during those New
Guinea years.
<P>

40   	Unfortunately, however, the relationship appears to have
deteriorated after the plaintiff's father and the deceased returned
to
Australia, and especially after the death of the plaintiff's father in April
1978. At that time the plaintiff was aged twenty-three
and she had qualified as
a nurse. Nevertheless there still continued a relationship between the
plaintiff and the deceased after
that period, to the details of which I shall
shortly refer.
<P>

41   	I am satisfied, however, that there was a sufficient
degree of dependency between the plaintiff and the deceased as would
satisfy
the requirement of paragraph (d) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1).</a>  Since I have already
expressed my conclusion that the plaintiff and the deceased were, at least
throughout the years from the marriage
of the deceased to the plaintiff's
father in 1969 until the end of 1972, members of the same household, I am
satisfied that the plaintiff
is an eligible person in relation to the
deceased.
<P>

42   	However, since she is an eligible person in relation to
the deceased only by reason of paragraph (d) of the definition of
that phrase,
the Court is required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(1)</a> of the Act to determine whether, in its
opinion, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, whether past or
present, there
are factors which warrant the making of the application, and the
Court is obliged to refuse to proceed with the determination of
the application
and to make the order unless it is satisfied that there are those factors.
<P>

43   	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the facts
which warrant the making of the application include the following:
The
plaintiff was the step-daughter of the deceased.  There existed between herself
and the deceased a mother/daughter relationship.
That relationship continued,
even after the death of the plaintiff's father, as is disclosed by such matters
as the fact that the
deceased allowed the plaintiff to use her address for a
number of years whilst the plaintiff was working in the Middle East, and
it was
necessary for the plaintiff to have a local address for her Australian nursing
registration.
<P>

44   	Further, the deceased operated the plaintiff's bank
account during the years whilst the plaintiff was working overseas, and
even,
on at least one occasion, met from her own funds a slight overdrawing of the
plaintiff's account.  In addition the plaintiff's
passport, which was issued on
24 December 1978, disclosed the deceased as the person to be notified in case
of death or accident.
<P>

45   	The plaintiff maintained a continuing contact with the
deceased, although the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff
and the
deceased deteriorated in 1987.  There was an estrangement for about four years
and the plaintiff then contacted the deceased
in 1991 concerning arrangements
for a reunion of the family of the plaintiff's father, which was to take place
in Queensland in that
year.  Both the plaintiff and the deceased attended that
reunion and spoke, although, according to the plaintiff, the attitude of
the
deceased on that occasion was "very cool" towards her.  The plaintiff did not,
thereafter, have any face to face contact with
the deceased and did not speak
with her by telephone, although she said that she always continued to send to
the deceased Christmas
cards and that those cards contained her current
address.
<P>

46   	Other factors which the plaintiff submits warrant the
making of the present application are that the deceased was the only
family
which the plaintiff had in Australia, apart from some cousins in Queensland.
Apparently she had no kin on her mother's side,
and her father's only brother
lived overseas in Portugal.  It was submitted that the plaintiff was bound
emotionally to the deceased
to a significant extent during the deceased's life
time.
<P>

47   	Another factor which the plaintiff relies upon as
warranting the making of the present application is the fact that no provision
was made for the plaintiff from the estate of her father and that her father's
entire estate went to the deceased.  I have already
referred to the lack of
evidence concerning the precise nature of that estate.  It has been suggested
that the statement in paragraph
(e) of the statutory declaration of the
deceased would indicate that about ten per cent of the gross estate of the
deceased at the
time of her death had come to her from the estate of the
plaintiff's father.
<P>

48   	I question whether that is a correct assumption.  I have
already referred to the fact that the statutory declaration was made
some nine
years before the death of the deceased.  There is no evidence as to the size of
the assets of the deceased at the time
she made the statutory declaration or as
to whether her assets increased by way of wise investment or as a result of an
increase
in, for example, the value of the Macleay Regis shares during the
period between the making of the statutory declaration and her
death.
Nevertheless, it seems to me to be an appropriate inference that some part of
the assets of this not inconsiderable estate
had their source in the estate of
the plaintiff's father.  From that estate the plaintiff received no benefit.
<P>

49   	I am satisfied that at least that last fact (that the
plaintiff received no benefit from the estate of her father, which estate
passed in its entirety to the deceased, who appears at that stage to have been
a woman in very comfortable financial circumstances
from inheritance from her
own family), constitutes a factor warranting the making of the present
application by the plaintiff.
<P>

50   	Another such factor is the fact that the deceased, her
step-mother, was, for practical purposes, the only family which the
plaintiff
had in Australia at the time. The fact that the relationship, apparently a
close and affectionate one in New Guinea, deteriorated
very significantly down
the years, does not, of itself, preclude the relationship from being a factor
which warrants the making of
the present application.
<P>

51   	It becomes necessary, therefore, for me to consider the
substantive basis for the claim of the plaintiff.   In that regard
I should
refer to the details of the plaintiff's present financial and material
circumstances.  Details of those circumstances were
given originally by the
plaintiff in her affidavit of 11 March 1998.  Under cross-examination it
appeared that those details were
far from accurate.  However, the following
matters appear to constitute accurate information concerning those
circumstances.
<P>

52   	The plaintiff's present fortnightly income, after
deduction of tax, is in a net amount of $1570, that is about $40,820 net
a
year. The plaintiff has no other income. She has assets consisting of household
furniture, to which she ascribes a value of about
$20,000; a computer worth
about $2000; personal effects worth about $10,000; a Daewoo motor vehicle, a
1997 model, which she purchased
with the benefit of a loan from the Endeavour
Credit Union, and which now has a value of about $15,000; a superannuation
entitlement
with a present value of about $20,000; jewellery worth about $2000
and money held in an account with Westpac Banking Corporation,
of about
$1280.
<P>

53   	The plaintiff sets forth the following recurring expenses
on a fortnightly basis, which total about $1050.  Those expenses
include an
amount for an item described as "board expenses", $75.  That relates to the
plaintiff's occupancy of a house which she
is sharing at 32 Brooklyns Road,
Glenbrook.  She shares that house with a friend. She does not pay any amount
which can be described
as either rent or occupation fee, and indeed she does
not pay what, with accuracy, can be described as board.  She does, however,
contribute to certain items of outgoings in respect to the household expenses.
She makes a contribution towards the upkeep of the
establishment, including the
upkeep of the gardens, and she purchases most of the food for the household.
<P>

54   	The plaintiff has no security of residence in the
Glenbrook establishment, which is owned by the father of the friend with
whom
she is presently residing.  The plaintiff asserts that her need is for security
of accommodation.  I will come back to that
consideration shortly.
<P>

55   	The plaintiff is a single woman; she has never been
married; she stated that she has no present intention or plans for matrimony.
She has been pursuing a post-graduate course for the degree of Master of
Business Administration. She deferred that course at the
beginning of this year
until August 1999.  She expects to complete that course in 2000.  The plaintiff
said that she was pursuing
that course in order to support her current position
as a senior nurse manager and that she does not propose to change her present
employment and she plans to remain working in the nursing profession.
<P>

56   	The plaintiff gave evidence concerning her desires for
accommodation. Since she has a cat and a dog she said that she cannot
live in a
home unit.  She wishes to live either in the inner western suburbs of Sydney
(identifying those suburbs as including Annandale,
Newtown, Marrickville,
Petersham, Enmore).  She has lived in that area until she moved to the
Glenbrook establishment two years ago.
 Most of her friends live in the inner
west of Sydney.  She gave evidence concerning the range of prices for an
appropriate residence
that she would wish to acquire in that area, being
between $350,000 and $400,000.
<P>

57   	Since the plaintiff works at the Westmead campus at
Parramatta she travels by motor car from her residence at Glenbrook to
Parramatta. That journey can take up to sixty minutes. She, therefore, does not
desire to reside any further west of Parramatta than
Glenbrook.  She gave
evidence of the cost of appropriate residences in the Glenbrook area, the
average house in that area costing
about $250,000.
<P>

58   	The plaintiff has made inquiries concerning her
eligibility to obtain a loan from Westpac.  Having regard to her age and
financial
position she has been informed that she could obtain a loan for
housing purposes of a little over $100,000.
<P>

59   	The plaintiff seeks from the estate of the deceased an
order for provision in an amount which, taking into account her potential
to
obtain a bank loan, would enable her to acquire a residence of her own, either
in the inner west of Sydney or in the Glenbrook
area.  She seeks for the former
an amount of at least $300,000, perhaps up to $350,000; for the latter, at
least $150,000, perhaps
up to $200,000.
<P>

60   	Not even a natural child of a testator would have a claim
upon the estate of a natural parent for an amount necessary to acquire
a
residence.  The plaintiff in the instant case has professional qualifications
and secure employment; her income exceeds her expenditure
by at least $12,000.
She certainly has not established any entitlement to receive from the estate of
the deceased anything like the
amount which has been submitted by her
Counsel.
<P>

61   	It seems to me, however, especially since the plaintiff
received nothing out of the estate of her own father and that the
totality of
that estate passed to the deceased, that the plaintiff has established an
entitlement to receive from the estate of the
deceased an amount which would go
at least some way towards assisting her in acquiring a residence, but certainly
would not cover
the total difference between any amount of a bank loan and the
cost of the residence itself.
<P>

62   	The Court is required to take into consideration any
competing claims upon the testamentary bounty of the deceased.  The only
competing claim is that of the University of Sydney for the purposes of the
restoration of the Anderson Stuart building. It has not
been suggested on
behalf of the defendant that, if there is any erosion of the residue of the
estate of the deceased, the plans for
the restoration of the Anderson Stuart
Building will be significantly affected.  Accordingly, I do not consider the
competing claim
of the residuary beneficiary has the effect of reducing, let
alone extinguishing, any order for provision an entitlement to which
the
plaintiff might otherwise have established.
<P>

63   	In my conclusion, in all the circumstances of this case,
it is appropriate that the plaintiff should receive out of the estate
of the
deceased a legacy in the sum of $100,000, and I propose so to order.
<P>

64   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that the plaintiff receive out of the estate of the late Donna
Kent-Biggs ("the deceased") a legacy in the sum of $100,000,
such legacy not to
bear interest if paid on or before 12 August 1999, and if not so paid, to bear
interest at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

(2)	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of
the deceased.
<P>

The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
