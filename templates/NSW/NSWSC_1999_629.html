EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Monday, 28 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2276/97	JENNIFER MARY DRAPER  -v-  CHRISTINE DIANNE NIXON AND SUSAN
LONG</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT </b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>    These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</i> 1982</a>. 
<P>

2   	The proceedings were instituted by summons filed by the
plaintiff Jennifer Mary Draper on 1 May 1997. That summons did not
name a
defendant. The relief claimed in that summons was as follows:
<P>

1.	An order making provision out of the estate of the late Allan Francis Draper
for her maintenance and advancement in life pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act </i>1982</a>.
<P>

2. 	Further orders.
<P>

3.	Costs.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff is the eldest of the five children of the
late Allan Francis Draper (to whom I shall refer as "the deceased").

<P>

4   	The deceased died (by throwing himself under a locomotive)
on 2 November 1995. At the time of his death the deceased was a
widower, aged
74. The deceased left a will dated 6 December 1993, probate whereof was on 4
July 1997 granted to Susan Long and Christine
Dianne Nixon, the executors named
in such will, who are the defendants to the present proceedings.
<P>

5   	I have already observed that the summons did not name any
defendants. Presumably the reason was that at the date of the filing
of the
summons, 1 May 1997, probate had not yet been granted to the executors named in
the will of the deceased. However, the Court
on 13 October 1997 made an order
(by consent of the plaintiff and the present defendants) that Susan Long and
Christine Dianne Nixon
be joined as defendants to these proceedings. 
<P>

6   	By that time the plaintiff had dispensed with the services
of the solicitor who had acted for her at the institution of the
proceedings;
that solicitor filed a notice of ceasing to act on 5 September 1997. The
plaintiff on 25 September 1997 filed a notice
of intention to act without a
solicitor, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/index.html#p66" class="autolink_findacts">Part 66</a> Rule 6(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Rules. The
plaintiff thereafter conducted the proceedings in person until shortly before
the hearing
commenced on 28 October 1998, when she retained Counsel to appear
for her. Counsel so retained was directly instructed by the plaintiff,
without
the intervention of a solicitor.
<P>

7   	However, on 10 November 1997, whilst she was conducting the
proceedings in person, the plaintiff filed in the Registry an amended
summons.
Prayers 2 and 3 in that document are identical to the equivalent prayers in the
summons. However, by prayer 1 the plaintiff
claims:
<P>

An order making proper provision from the estate and notional estate of the
late Allan Francis Draper for her maintenance and advancement
in life pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i> 1982</a>.
<P>

8   	It will be appreciated that there is in that foregoing
prayer a significant alteration from prayer 1 in the summons filed on
1 May
1997, in that the amended summons seeks provision from not only the estate but
also the notional estate of the deceased. I
will return, in due course, to the
significance of that alteration, and also to the effect of the fact that the
amended summons was
filed more than eighteen months after the death of the
deceased (that limitation period having expired on 2 May 1997 --- the summons
itself having been filed on the penultimate day of the limitation period). 
<P>

9   	The amended summons bears the endorsement "Filed pursuant
to leave granted on 13/10/97". It will be recalled that on 13 October
1997 the
Court by consent made orders joining Susan Long and Christine Dianne Nixon as
defendants to the proceedings. On that date
also the Court by consent made
orders for the further progress of the proceedings (providing a timetable in
relation to the filing
of affidavits, the service of the prescribed notice
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Part 77</a> Rule 63 (1), the service of the prescribed notice in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Part 77</a> Rule 63(2)). No order, by consent or otherwise, was
made by the Court, either on 13 October 1997 or on any other date, granting to
the plaintiff leave to file an amended summons. I shall, in due course, return
to the significance of the filing of the amended summons,
and also to the
assertion made by the misleading, and false, endorsement upon it that leave to
do so had been granted on 13 October
1997.
<P>

10   	Subsequently, on 20 October 1998, when the matter was
listed before me in order to ascertain its state of readiness (the hearing
having been fixed to commence on Wednesday, 28 October 1998), the plaintiff
filed in Court a further amended summons, dated 20 October
1998, seeking not
only an order for provision of the nature claimed in prayer 1 in the amended
summons, but also declarations pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a></i>, that the deceased during his lifetime entered into a number
of prescribed transactions (referred to, at least by general description,
in
prayers 1, 2 and 3 in the further amended summons), and also an order, pursuant
to "<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 24"</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>,</i> designating
as notional estate various pieces of real property which had been registered in
the names of the deceased and/or the
defendants and (in the case of one piece
of real estate, in the names of "Susan Geraldine Long and Graeme John Long". (I
would here
interpolate that Mrs Long does not use the given name
"Geraldine".))
<P>

11   	By his will, which was made in circumstances to which I
shall shortly refer, the deceased left the entirety of his estate
to the
defendants. He made no provision for his other three children, being Jennifer
(the plaintiff), Phillip, and Penelope. Clause
8 of the will is in the
following terms:
<P>

<u>I SPECIFICALLY MAKE NO BEQUEST</u> in favour of my daughters <u>JENNIFER
MARY DRAPER</u>, <u>PENELOPE JOCELYN PHILLIPS</u> and my son <u>PHILLIP JOHN
DRAPER</u>.
<P>

12   	The inventory of property discloses that the deceased at
the time of his death held an account with the State Bank in which
there was an
amount of $12,215, and that he held, as joint tenant with Susan Long and
Christine Dianne Nixon, real property situate
at and known as 14/510 Pacific
Highway, Killara (to which an estimated value of $215,000 was ascribed). The
liabilities of the estate
consisted of funeral expenses ($2,518) and legal
costs in relation to the administration of the estate ($694). 
<P>

13   	It will be appreciated that the entirety of the estate
held by the deceased at the time of his death, consisting of the amount
to his
credit in the account with the State Bank, will be exhausted in the payment of
the liabilities and in the payment of the costs
of the defendants of the
present proceedings (to which costs they, as executors, will, irrespective of
the outcome of the proceedings,
be entitled).
<P>

14   	Unless she can establish an entitlement to resort to
notional estate of the deceased, there is no fund from which any order
for
provision which ultimately might be made in favour of the plaintiff can be
paid. It is obviously for that reason that the plaintiff
filed the amended
summons, claiming relief against not only the estate but also the notional
estate of the deceased. 
<P>

15   	However, before it becomes necessary for the Court to
proceed to a consideration of any question of whether the deceased might
have
entered into a prescribed transaction which would give rise to the possibility
of property being designated as notional estate
of the deceased, it is
necessary for the plaintiff to establish an entitlement to an order for
provision. 
<P>

16   	The plaintiff, as a daughter of the deceased, is an
eligible person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase
contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, she has the
standing to bring the present proceedings. Each of the defendants, and each of
the other children of the deceased,
is also an eligible person within the same
paragraph of the definition of that phrase.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff was born on 24 December 1946, and is
presently aged 52. For most of her life (subject only to interruptions
whilst
she was teaching away from Sydney and whilst she was travelling overseas) the
plaintiff resided with both her parents and
then (after the death of her
mother, Joyce Draper, on 15 May 1992) with her father, the deceased. Whilst
living at home the plaintiff
paid board to her mother. The family home
throughout the latter part of the lifetime of her parents was 8 Hermitage Road,
West Ryde,
a property which at least after the death  of her mother was owned
by the deceased. 
<P>

18   	The plaintiff obtained her Leaving Certificate in 1963.
According to her evidence she was employed in performing office work
from 1964
until 1975 in Sydney and overseas. She was living away from home between 1970
and 1975, but, according to her, returned
to the family home at West Ryde every
weekend. 
<P>

19   	The plaintiff said that at the end of 1975 she returned to
live permanently in the family home, whereupon she resumed paying
board to her
parents (which she asserted she had done from 1964 until she moved away from
the family home). 
<P>

20   	The plaintiff said that she enrolled for, and passed, the
Higher School Certificate in 1975, and that in 1980 she completed
a "Bachelor
of Arts (Honours) Degree with Diploma of Education". She said that she lived on
her savings during that period. 
<P>

21   	The plaintiff was in employment as a teacher at Bowral in
1983. It was her practice to return to the family home each weekend.
According
to the plaintiff, she returned permanently to the family home in 1983
(apparently at the end of that year), on account
of her mother's deteriorating
health, and at the end of 1986 (she having taught at Strathfield in the
intervening period) the plaintiff
gave up work permanently, in order to assume
the role of principal carer to her mother. She said that after her mother's
death on
15 May 1992 (and especially after his motor accident in 1993) the
plaintiff became the principal carer to her father.
<P>

22   	According to the plaintiff, in 1990 she "commenced
preliminary research towards a Doctorate". She said that that research
was
abandoned in 1991, suggesting that the reason for the abandonment was her
mother's deteriorating health. 
<P>

23   	According to the plaintiff, after the death of her mother
the deceased frequently said that it was important to him to honour
a promise
which he had made to her concerning the transfer to the plaintiff of certain
moneys belonging to her mother. Accordingly,
the plaintiff at the end of August
1992 accompanied her father to various financial institutions where money was
held, and the following
amounts were transferred into the name of the
plaintiff:
<P>

Hatmax Finance Limited - $20,000
<P>

Barclays Bank - $12,000
<P>

AGC - $7,000
<P>

St George Bank - $3,000
<P>

State Bank - $12,000
<P>

24   	It was the evidence of the plaintiff that in October 1993
--- that is, only two months after the transfer of the foregoing
amounts to her
--- the deceased requested from the plaintiff the sum of $20,000 towards the
replacement of his motor vehicle which
had been damaged beyond repair in the
preceding month. Accordingly, she said that she withdrew from Hatmax Finance
Limited two amounts
of money, which were then deposited by the deceased in his
account with the State Bank at West Ryde, being $10,140.50 on 29 October
1993
and $9,900 on 2 November 1993. The plaintiff said that after she gave this
money to her father he neither expended it on a new
motor vehicle nor returned
it to the plaintiff. 
<P>

25   	There has been placed in evidence (as annexure D to the
affidavit of the plaintiff sworn 22 October 1998) a document described
as
"Codicil to my Last Will and Testament" signed by the plaintiff's mother, the
late Joyce Draper, apparently before two witness
whose signatures appear
thereon, and dated 25 April 1984. The evidence is silent as to whether that
document (or, indeed, any testamentary
instrument of the plaintiff's mother)
has ever been admitted to probate. However, the document is in the following
terms,
<P>

I give to my daughter Jennifer Mary Draper all money invested in Australian
Guarantee Corporation. Details as follows:
<P>

$15,000 holder No. 910885000
<P>

Certificate No. 18346414
<P>

$4,000 holder No. 910885000
<P>

Certificate No. 18243252
<P>

and also in St George Building Society Ltd account No. 051 147 601 also account
No. 183 536 587.
<P>

26   	It would appear that the transfer to the plaintiff of the
various amounts of money in August 1992 was effected by the deceased
consonant
with the terms of the foregoing document (although it will be recognised that
the funds referred to in that document are
not identical with the various funds
which the plaintiff says were transferred to her by her father at the end of
August 1992).
<P>

27   	On 4 September 1993, the deceased suffered a motor vehicle
accident, in which he sustained fractured bones, lacerations and
other physical
injuries. According to the evidence of the plaintiff, after that accident the
conduct of the deceased (with whom the
plaintiff had previously enjoyed a good
and affectionate relationship) became increasingly eccentric, not to say
bizarre. 
<P>

28   	Eventually, on 16 November 1993, the plaintiff, her
brother Phillip Draper (who at that time was residing at 10 Hermitage
Road,
West Ryde, next door to the deceased) and one of their sisters, Penelope
Phillips, arranged for a psychiatrist, Dr Ruth Foster,
in the company of a
psychiatric nurse, to visit the deceased, for the purpose of psychiatric
assessment. 
<P>

29   	It was this arrangement, the subsequent visit to the home
at West Ryde by Dr Foster and the psychiatric nurse, the signing
of a Schedule
2 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Act</i> 1990</a> by Dr Foster, and the consequential
removal of the deceased from his home to the Macquarie Hospital (formerly the
Ryde Psychiatric
Hospital), which ultimately gave rise to the present
proceedings.
<P>

30   	The deceased spent only some hours at the psychiatric
hospital, before being allowed to return home. The purpose, as the plaintiff
understood, of the deceased being taken to the psychiatric hospital, was to
enable a psychiatric assessment there to be conducted.
Apparently, however, the
medical authorities at the psychiatric hospital decided several hours after the
arrival of the deceased
that there were no grounds upon which they could detain
him there against his will. He was discharged into the care of one of his
other
daughters, Susan Long (one of the present defendants), who had offered to take
him to her home. Despite the terms of that offer,
Mrs Long took the deceased
firstly to his own residence at West Ryde, where there was confrontation with
the plaintiff.
<P>

31   	During the course of that confrontation the deceased
ordered the plaintiff to leave his home, expressing an intention that
otherwise
he would kill her. The plaintiff did leave the family home, and had no further
contact with the deceased from that day,
16 November 1993 until his death on 2
November 1995. 
<P>

32   	The result of the forcible removal of the deceased from
his home to the psychiatric hospital was that on 6 December 1993 he
made a
fresh will, being the will to which I have already referred, which was admitted
to probate on 4 July 1997. 
<P>

33   	Whilst the deceased was living with Mrs Long he sold the
West Ryde house, in March 1994. From the proceeds of that sale he
purchased, as
joint tenant with his daughters Susan Long and Christine Nixon, a home unit at
Killara for $220,000. That is the home
unit referred to in the inventory of
property. In consequence, that home unit passed by survivorship to Mrs Long and
Mrs Nixon upon
the death of the deceased. The home unit was subsequently sold
in May 1996, and the net proceeds of sale, in an amount slightly in
excess of
$210,000, were divided equally between Mrs Long and Mrs Nixon.
<P>

34   	An enormous quantity of affidavit evidence was filed on
behalf of the plaintiff. That evidence comprised 28 affidavits (running
to a
total of 168 pages), and included 15 separate affidavits sworn by the plaintiff
herself (extending over 107 pages). Much of
that evidence was totally
irrelevant. (For completeness it should also be noted that twelve affidavits
were filed on behalf of the
defendants.) In relation to this superabundance of
evidence, it is appropriate that I should set forth the following salutary
views
expressed in the High Court of Australia in <i>Blore</i> <i>v Lang
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1960/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1960] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20104%20CLR%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 104 CLR 124</a> at 137 by Windeyer J, in considering the statutory
predecessor of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i> (the <i>Testator's Family
Maintenance and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act</a></i>, 1916), 
<P>

The jurisdiction under the <i>Testator's Family Maintenance Act</i> is to
provide for deserving persons according to their requirements, not to reward
past services. This is sometimes overlooked and
evidence concerning the present
and probable future requirements of the applicant is subordinated to or
submerged in evidence of
past services to the testator. Allegations and denials
concerning episodes in the past are then likely to become emphasised at the
expense of evidence directed to the central issues in the case.
<P>

35   	The foregoing comments are extremely apposite to the way
in which the instant case was prepared and presented by the plaintiff.
Further,
it cannot be emphasised too strongly that it is for an applicant who claims an
order for provision for her maintenance and
advancement in life, to place
before the Court as fully and as frankly as possible all available information
concerning her financial
and material circumstances. This the plaintiff in the
instant case has signally failed to do. From the vast plethora of evidentiary
material filed on her behalf, it is very difficult to extract relevant
information concerning her present financial and material
circumstances.
<P>

36   	The affidavit evidence in relation to the needs of the
plaintiff which (in consequence of comments made by me when the matter
was
listed before me on 20 October 1998, in the week preceding the commencement of
the trial of the proceedings) was eventually filed,
consisted essentially of
what was (in my view, accurately) described by Counsel for the defendants as
being a "wish list".
<P>

37   	It was asserted by the plaintiff that she had academic
qualifications as a teacher. She taught for some relatively short period,
from
1983 to 1986. There did not emerge with any clarity from the evidence the
reason why the plaintiff is not presently, and, apparently
for at least the
period since she departed the residence of the deceased on 16 November 1993
(and probably for the period since 1986),
has not been, in remunerative
employment. It would appear that the plaintiff is, and for some time has been,
in receipt of some form
of regular payments or benefits from the Department of
Social Security. However, the nature of those payments has not been disclosed
to the Court, nor the grounds and circumstances in which the plaintiff became
entitled to receive those payments or in which she
has continued to receive
those payments.
<P>

38   	On 8 September 1998 the plaintiff underwent investigative
surgery, at which is was confirmed that she had a malignant tumour
of the right
ovary. In his report dated 6 October 1998 (annexure A to the affidavit of the
plaintiff of 26 October 1998, such affidavit
being marked A for
identification), Dr John Murray, gynaecologist, stated that "the prognosis must
be guarded".
<P>

39   	It was asserted by the plaintiff that she had academic
qualifications, being the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of
Arts. But
precise details of those qualifications were not set forth in her affidavit
evidence, and there seemed to be some uncertainty
in the plaintiff's responses
when, during the course of her cross-examination, she was asked questions
concerning those degrees.
Further, the plaintiff's evidence in relation to her
intention of enrolling for, and ultimately achieving, a doctorate (presumably
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy) at Macquarie University was not entirely
clear. She did not see fit to obtain from Macquarie
University a copy of her
academic record, which would have placed beyond doubt her academic achievements
from that institution. 
<P>

40   	At the commencement of her evidence the plaintiff declined
to state orally her residential address, saying, "It is unsafe
to disclose my
residential address; therefore my sister's address appears on all of the
documentation". However, the plaintiff wrote
her address on a piece of paper,
which then became part of the Court file. 
<P>

41   	In her affidavit of 10 November 1997 the plaintiff said
(paragraph 36),
<P>

Being reduced to live as a social security recipient and having no car,...I do
not now have and never will have any security without
a home. At present I am
obliged to live in the dark and cold backyard garage of a migrant family who
speak very poor English and
where there is no privacy. My assets comprise
household effects and furniture of no commercial value, such as a 30 year old
black
and white television set which works only occasionally, a record player,
jug and iron of the same age, but no ironing board, bookcases
from timber I
purchased many years ago which Dad and I made together.
<P>

42   	In the same paragraph the plaintiff also listed her income
which included 7.3 percent quarterly interest on a deposit with
Hatmax Finance
Limited, being $109.50. Her social security payments were at that time $189.15
a week. The plaintiff listed her outgoings
(including rent of $140 a week),
which totalled about $216 a week.
<P>

43   	The plaintiff's affidavit of 22 October 1998 (containing
47 paragraphs, extending over 12 pages, to which were annexed an
additional 10
pages of annexures) purported to set forth the plaintiff's then current
material and financial circumstances. That
affidavit also purported to contain
what is described therein as "[a] detailed and reasoned list of needs and
wants" (which, as I
have already stated, was described as a "wish list").
<P>

44   	According to that affidavit (paragraph 5) the plaintiff
was still occupying a backyard garage owned by a migrant family, for
which she
was still paying rent of $140 a week. She said that that amount constituted
more than 70 percent of her "social security
payment which includes rent
assistance". That is the first reference made by the plaintiff to the fact that
she is in receipt of
rent assistance. The plaintiff further said in that
paragraph that she had no security of tenure in respect to her
accommodation.
<P>

45   	She expressed a need for new spectacles and dental
work.
<P>

46   	The plaintiff in that affidavit asserted that her "efforts
to secure paid employment to date have been retarded in part by
a need for
basic necessities such as:", then setting forth a list of fourteen categories.
Those categories included a computer and
a printer (about $4,000), a motor car
(about $14,000 plus $3,000 a year), a renewal of basic wardrobe items (about
$2,000). 
<P>

47   	In addition (in paragraph 20), the plaintiff claimed
renewal of household items, listing 23 separate items, the total of prices
ascribed to a number of those items exceeding $4,000, but some of the items not
having a price ascribed to them. The plaintiff then
set forth under the heading
"Gardening Needs" a list of some 52 items (including, for example,
"bonsaihouse/glasshouse", for the
purpose of enabling her "to resume my
lifelong gardening involvement").
<P>

48   	In her affidavit of 22 October 1998 the plaintiff brought
up to date details of her income. She said that there had in the
preceding
month (that is, September 1998) been an increase in her "Social Security
payment" to $199.30 a week; that quarterly interest
on the $6,000 investment
with Hatmax at 7.3 percent remained at $109.50; and that the monthly interest
on the $7,000 investment with
AGC at 7.5% remained at $43.75. Upon my
calculations, the plaintiff's weekly income from those sources would be about
$219.
<P>

49   	The hearing of this matter was originally estimated to
occupy two days. For that reason it was listed to be heard during the
Family
Provision Running List in October 1998, with the trial fixed to commence on
Wednesday, 28 October 1998. The hearing occupied
that day (the totality of
which was spent in entertaining objections to the various affidavits which had
been filed on behalf of
the respective parties), and the next two days, 29 and
30 October. Since a conclusion of the case was still distant when the hearing
on that lastmentioned date was completed, I considered it prudent (in the light
of the estimate given by Counsel as to the period
still remaining for the
hearing) to reserve three further days for that hearing. Accordingly, I
adjourned the matter, part-heard,
to Tuesday, 9 February 1999, reserving also
10 and 11 February. On account of that protracted adjournment, and the
statement made
by Mr Amor-Smith of Counsel, for the plaintiff, in that regard,
I had it noted that Mr Amor-Smith would be requiring to confer in
the interim
with his client, who was then currently under cross-examination.
<P>

50   	The evidence concluded and the addresses of Counsel
commenced at 2:40pm on Thursday, 11 February 1999, that being the fifth
day of
the hearing. When the addresses of Counsel commenced, Mr Amor-Smith said that
there were a number of matters upon which he
was desirous of consulting with
his client and identifying passages in the transcript before making submissions
to the Court. He
therefore requested that he be allowed to furnish written
submissions. In consequence, the last hour or so of the trial was occupied
by
the submissions of Mr Willmott of Counsel, for the defendants. 
<P>

51   	I acceded to the request of Mr Amor-Smith, and made the
following orders:
<P>

1.	Direct that the plaintiff lodge written submissions on or before 25 February
1999, and that the defendants lodge written submissions
within 14 days after
service upon them of the plaintiff's submissions.
<P>

2. 	Judgment reserved.
<P>

52   	I also noted that the parties requested that I should not
make any order for costs when delivering my reserved judgment, and
that, in the
light of my decision, I should then hear Counsel concerning costs.
<P>

53   	Before the foregoing date for the lodgment of written
submissions by the plaintiff a letter dated 18 February 1999 from Mr
Amor-Smith, addressed to my Associate, arrived at my chambers on 19 February
1999.
<P>

54   	That letter contained the following:
<P>

Please be advised that on 16 February 1999 I received a communication from Ms
Draper dated 14 February 1999, wherein Ms Draper said:
<P>

"On Thursday afternoon 11 February, I took full responsibility for writing the
document for which Mr [<i>sic</i>, Master] J. K. McLaughlin asked in the
Supreme Court on Thursday, 11 February 1999. I am handling the conclusion of
this matter by
myself. J.M. Draper."
<P>

In the circumstances would you please advise the Master that I am no longer
briefed in relation to the written submissions referable
to this matter.
<P>

55   	Subsequently, the plaintiff communicated to my Associate a
request that she be allowed to lodge her written submissions beyond
the limit
of 25 February 1999, which had been provided in the direction in that regard
made by me on 11 February 1999. A document
purporting to constitute those
written submissions headed "Summation" and bearing the date 4 March 1999 was
delivered to my chambers
on 5 March 1999 under cover of a letter from the
plaintiff bearing that latter date. Subsequently written submissions on behalf
of
the defendants were lodged at my chambers on 18 March 1999. 
<P>

56   	The plaintiff, through her Counsel, had been granted an
indulgence in regard to presenting submissions to the Court. In the
hearing of
a case such as the present, Counsel for the plaintiff would normally be
required, at the conclusion of the evidence, to
place before the Court his
submissions is oral form. Since Mr Amor-Smith had come into the matter only a
little over a week before
the commencement of the hearing, I granted to him the
indulgence which he sought, to allow him to consult with his client and to
check various references in the transcript before presenting his submissions to
the Court, and then to present those submissions
in written form. 
<P>

57   	The plaintiff has now used the opportunity afforded by the
indulgence given to her Counsel, firstly, to terminate the instructions
of that
Counsel, and secondly to use the purported written submissions as a vehicle by
which to attempt to insinuate into the evidence
a vast quantity of material
which could have been --- but was not --- tendered as evidence at the hearing.
Much of that material
is totally inadmissible. If it had been tendered at the
hearing it would have been rejected.
<P>

58   	The conduct of the plaintiff in this regard is highly
improper and amounts to a deliberate attempt to abuse the processes
of the
Court. (The plaintiff's conduct in this regard is consistent with her
misleading and false endorsement upon the amended summons
filed on 10 November
1997, which would not have been accepted by the Registry unless such leave had
been granted or the consent of
the defendants obtained.)
<P>

59   	Apart from what actually constitutes submissions
concerning either the evidence which was admitted at the trial or the legal
principles to be applied to that evidence, I propose totally to disregard the
entirety of the material lodged by the plaintiff in
purported compliance with
the opportunity given to her Counsel to lodge written submissions. However, all
documents and material
lodged by the plaintiff in purported compliance with the
opportunity given to her Counsel to lodge written submissions will be retained
in the Court file. 
<P>

60   	Not only did the plaintiff use this indulgence of written
submissions for the improper purpose of attempting in a devious
and underhand
fashion to place before the Court totally inadmissible material, but, further,
the plaintiff used this indulgence as
a vehicle by which to make insulting and
totally unjustified and baseless allegations against the conduct of the case by
Counsel
for the defendants, and by various solicitors. 
<P>

61   	The insulting allegations made by the plaintiff against
Counsel for the defendants are consistent with the attitude and manner
adopted
by the plaintiff towards Mr Willmott during her cross-examination (and are also
consistent with the form and style of her
affidavits responding to affidavits
filed on behalf of the defendants).
<P>

62   	In his written submissions on behalf of the defendants Mr
Willmott with admirable restraint said (at page 37, paragraph 5.3)
that
"comments and assertions made by the plaintiff in submissions which are no more
than gratuitous insults are ignored". However,
I consider that the Court has a
responsibility to protect from such insults and allegations made by a party
acting in person members
of the legal profession who are doing no more than
carrying out their duty to their clients and to the Court. Indeed, in the case
of the solicitors who are the subject of the written abuse by the plaintiff,
those practitioners have no opportunity of answering
the allegations made
against them --- indeed, they are probably totally unaware of such allegations
having been made. 
<P>

63   	Had a member of the legal profession acted in the way in
which the plaintiff has done in relation to the content and form
of her
purported written submissions, such conduct would have attracted the attention
of that practitioner's professional association.
<P>

64   	Even after making all possible allowances for the fact
that, for large parts of the proceedings, the plaintiff was acting
for herself,
nevertheless, I consider her conduct in making such allegations to be highly
improper.
<P>

65   	Not even Mr Amor-Smith emerged unscathed from these
criticisms made by the plaintiff. I have already recorded that at the
conclusion of the hearing on 11 February 1999 the parties through their
respective Counsel requested that I should not make any order
for costs when
delivering my reserved judgment, and that, in the light of my decision, I
should hear Counsel concerning costs. Nevertheless,
in her Summation (page 22)
the plaintiff said 
<P>

Although the barristers, J. Amor-Smith and M. Willmott, may have asked to be
heard on costs <b>after</b> the Court has made a final decision, J. Amor-Smith
did not have instructions from me at any time to make such a request or to
consent
to deferring this matter. In view of the failure of both barristers to
conclude these proceedings on 11th February, requiring this
further
documentation to be prepared following the Hearing, both barristers are
extremely selfish in seeking to prolong the proceedings
even further. 
<P>

66   	The request that costs should be argued in the light of my
final decision appeared to me a reasonable one, and one which could
possibly be
of benefit to the plaintiff. If, however, she does not wish to have that
opportunity, then such opportunity will not
be granted to her. The reason why
the present proceedings did not conclude on 11 February (indeed why they did
not conclude after
only two days of hearing, in accordance with the original
estimate) can be attributed entirely and exclusively to the conduct of
the
plaintiff herself, both in deluging the Court with a torrent of, almost totally
irrelevant and inadmissible, affidavit material,
and in failing to place before
the Court evidence addressing the essential issues in this case, being
primarily the need of the plaintiff,
and then the various questions in relation
to prescribed transactions and notional estate. I regard the criticisms
directed by the
plaintiff against Counsel for the defendants, who carried out a
difficult task with the utmost propriety, as being totally without
foundation.
<P>

67   	In exercising the power vested in it by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i> the Court is required to carry out a two-stage
process. In <i>Singer v Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> Mason CJ, Deane and
McHugh JJ said, at 208,
<P>

The first stage calls for a determination of whether the applicant has been
left without adequate provision for his or her proper
maintenance, education
and advancement in life. The second stage, which only arises if that
determination be made in favour of the
applicant, requires the court to decide
what provision ought to be made out of the deceased's estate for the applicant.
The first
stage has been described as the "jurisdictional question" (see, for
example, <i>White v Barron</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1924/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144 CLR 431</a> at 456; <i>Bondelmonte</i>
<i>v Blanckensee</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20WAR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] WAR 305</a> at 307; <i>Golosky v Golosky </i>Court of
Appeal, 5 October 1993, unreported). That description means no more than that
the court's power to make an order in favour
of an applicant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> is
conditioned upon the court being satisfied of the state of affairs predicated
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(2)(a).</a> 
<P>

68   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9(2)</a> of the Act provides, relevantly,
<P>

The Court shall not make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a> in favour of an eligible
person out of the estate or notional estate of a deceased person unless it is
satisfied that ---
<P>

(a)	the provision (if any) made in favour of the eligible person by the
deceased person either during his lifetime or out of his
estate;
<P>

is, at the time the Court is determining whether or not to make such an order,
inadequate for the proper maintenance, education
and advancement in life of the
eligible person.
<P>

69   	The plaintiff lived at her parent's home continually from
1986, when she gave up teaching, until about 1994. She had also
lived at home
with them for earlier periods during her adulthood, except when she was
overseas or was teaching at Bowral. During
the years from 1986 until 1994 it
would appear that she paid no board and made no other financial contribution
towards the expenses
of the household. Such accommodation for a period of eight
years was a considerable benefit to the plaintiff.
<P>

70   	Although the plaintiff said that the reason for her giving
up work was to enable her to look after her mother, the Court should
approach
with caution that evidence of the plaintiff. At that time, in 1986, Mrs Joyce
Draper had not been diagnosed as suffering
from any illness, no medical
practitioner had been consulted by her, and the plaintiff had not been
requested by her mother to give
up work. 
<P>

71   	It is obvious that the chief reason why the plaintiff
chose to leave her remunerative employment as a teacher was to undertake
further study, not to care for her mother (who at that time was aged only 66
and enjoyed reasonably good health).
<P>

72   	After the death of her mother the plaintiff continued to
reside free of charge with her father until the incident on 16 November
1993.
In August 1992 the plaintiff received from the deceased amounts of money
totalling $54,000 (although it is recognised that
shortly thereafter she
returned to him an amount of $20,000; the plaintiff also said that she paid
$1,200 for the purchase of a new
television for the household and paid $1,400
for renewal of guttering). The plaintiff also said that, when the deceased
appeared
to have changed his mind about fulfilling a promise alleged to have
been made by him to his late wife, the plaintiff herself gave
$5,000 to her
brother Phillip and her sister Penelope (but nothing to either of the
defendants). 
<P>

73   	Even accepting all the foregoing payments alleged to have
been made by her out of the amount of $54,000, the plaintiff undisputedly
received the benefit of $54,000 for a period of time, and ultimately the
unqualified benefits of about $22,000. 
<P>

74   	On 16 November 1993, after he had returned home from the
Macquarie Hospital, the deceased gave the plaintiff a cheque for
$5,000. 
<P>

75   	I have already observed that the plaintiff has been far
from frank or forthcoming in placing before the Court full details
concerning
her financial and material circumstances. Her oral evidence in this regard was
quite unsatisfactory, and her answers were
at times evasive.
<P>

76   	There is no evidence as to what employment the plaintiff
is capable of undertaking. If she is unable to work she has not placed
before
the Court any evidence as to the reason for that inability. 
<P>

77   	A very considerable quantity of oral evidence was directed
to the desire of the plaintiff "to resume work towards a Doctorate".
However, I
am far from satisfied that the plaintiff has ever taken any formal steps
towards enrolment for a doctorate, or, that she
is qualified so to enrol. I
regarded her responses concerning the preliminary research she claimed to have
undertaken as being evasive
and vague. It seemed to me to be of significance
that no evidence was given either by Professor Naguib Kanawati (under the
general
academic authority of whom the plaintiff asserted that she was
undertaking preliminary research) or by any other person of academic
standing
concerning the plaintiff's doctoral aspirations. Further, the evidence
concerning the advances (in an amount of $5,000)
made to the plaintiff by an
entity known as the Rundle Foundation  appeared to me to be far from
satisfactory. Indeed, there seemed
to me to be considerable substance in the
submission made on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff had dishonestly
retained
that amount of money and did not propose to return it. 
<P>

78   	I have already referred to the medical report from Dr
Murray concerning the malignant ovarian tumour from which the plaintiff
suffered. However, there was no evidence placed before the Court concerning the
extent, if any, to which the plaintiff's physical
condition will affect her
ability to undertake remunerative employment (or, indeed, academic research).

<P>

79   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established the
state of affairs predicated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(2)(a)</a> of the Act. In particular, I am
not satisfied that the plaintiff is unable to undertake remunerative
employment. The fact that she
does not do so appears to be a result of her own
deliberate choice. She certainly did not place before the Court evidence of any
attempt to obtain employment either after the death of her mother or after she
left the North Ryde residence on 16 November 1993.
Further, during the lifetime
of the deceased the plaintiff received from him very considerable direct
financial benefits (in August
1992 and in November 1993), and very significant
non-financial benefits (by way of accommodation from the latter part of 1986
until
16 November 1993). 
<P>

80   	My conclusion that the plaintiff has not established the
state of affairs predicated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(2)(a)</a> (and, in particular, has not
established any relevant need) of itself is sufficient to dispose of the
present proceedings. 
<P>

81   	However, even if, contrary to the view which I have just
expressed, the plaintiff were to have established need, the question
then
arises of whether the deceased was justified in disposing of his estate (and of
any property which might potentially be regarded
as notional estate) in such a
fashion that the plaintiff was deprived of any interest therein. One can
envisage few situations to
which the phrase "conduct disentitling" could with
more accuracy be applied than to that which culminated in the incident of 16
November
1993. 
<P>

82   	The facts which emerged in the instant case constitute the
very circumstances so greatly loved by Victorian novelists and
dramatists,
where a sane person was sent to a lunatic asylum on the evidence of a scheming
relative and his accomplices. 
<P>

83   	The deceased was entirely sane at the date of the incident
on 16 November 1993 when, at the instance of the plaintiff, her
sister Penelope
and their brother Phillip, an attempt was made to have the deceased committed
to a psychiatric hospital, under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Act</i> 1990</a>. Having been
forcibly removed from his home at the insistence of three of his children, the
deceased was, a few hours later, released
from the Macquarie Hospital, North
Ryde, to which he had been taken against his will.
<P>

84   	The plaintiff can hardly have been surprised at the
reaction of the deceased to that incident. He was in my view totally justified
in telling the plaintiff to leave his home. The threat that if he saw her again
he would kill her, although denied by the defendants,
seems to me to be an
entirely justifiable reaction on the part of the deceased. It says a great deal
for the forbearance of the deceased
that he, in fact, wrote a cheque for $5,000
in favour of the plaintiff at the time when he ordered her from his home. 
<P>

85   	It will be appreciated that no challenge has ever been
made by the plaintiff, or by any other person, to the testamentary
capacity of
the deceased, or to the validity of his last will. 
<P>

86   	Even if (contrary to the conclusion which I have already
expressed) the plaintiff were to have satisfied the Court as to the
first stage
of the two-stage process described in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i>, I am satisfied
that her foregoing conduct constitutes conduct of such a nature and to such a
degree as to disentitle her totally
from the benefit of any order for provision
to which she might otherwise, in consequence of any relevant need, have
established an
entitlement. My conclusion concerning the conduct of the
plaintiff is, of itself, sufficient to dispose of the present application.
<P>

87   	Even if (contrary to my foregoing conclusion) I were to be
satisfied that the plaintiff had established an entitlement to
an order for
provision, that entitlement must be viewed in the light of any competing claims
upon the testamentary bounty of the
deceased. 
<P>

88   	Apart from the plaintiff, the only other persons who might
have such claim are the other four children of the deceased. Neither
Penelope
nor Phillip makes any claim upon the estate of the deceased. Accordingly, the
only other persons the claims of whom must
be considered as competing with that
of the plaintiff are the two defendants. It must be recognised that they are
the chosen objects
of the testamentary beneficence of the deceased. Not only
did the deceased name them as the sole beneficiaries in his will, but during
his lifetime the deceased, in consequence of acquiring the Killara home unit in
joint tenancy with the two defendants, ensured that,
upon his death, they would
jointly be entitled to the totality of such property. 
<P>

89   	It is appropriate, therefore, that I should set forth
details of the financial and material circumstances of each of the
defendants.
<P>

90   	Susan Long was born on 21 September 1956, and is presently
aged 42. She is the youngest of the five children of the deceased.
She lived at
home with her parents until 1976, when she commenced training as a nurse at the
Hornsby District Hospital. She qualified
as a nurse in 1980, and in the
following year obtained an additional qualification in midwifery. She practised
full-time in the nursing
profession from 1976 until 1993. From 1993 to the
present time she has worked part-time as a midwife at the Sydney Adventist
Hospital
at Wahroonga. On average she works five or six shifts a fortnight. 
<P>

91   	On 29 September 1979 Susan married Graeme Long. They have
three children, whose ages range from 10 to 15. Mrs Long's husband,
who has
been retrenched on two occasions, is currently employed as a financial
controller. She and her husband have a combined net
weekly income of about
$1,000. Their assets consist of their residence at 49 Pretoria Parade, Hornsby
(which has a present value
of between $350,000 and $375,000, and upon which
there is outstanding an amount $2,500 secured by way of mortgage to the State
Bank).
Mr and Mrs Long own two motor vehicles, one being a 14 year old Ford
Laser and the other being a three year old Holden station wagon.

<P>

92   	When the home unit at Killara was sold in May 1996 Susan
received an amount of $105,017.99. That amount was used in order
to repay
$40,000 in respect to the mortgage on the house property in Pretoria Parade,
Hornsby, $35,000 on renovations and extensions
to that house property, a family
holiday ($8,000), an investment in respect to the school fees of her children
($20,000), and a deposit
in respect to those school fees ($1,500). 
<P>

93   	Christine Dianne Nixon was born on 11 October 1950 and is
presently aged 48. She is the second-eldest of the five children
of the
deceased. 
<P>

94   	Christine commenced training as a teacher at Sydney
Teachers College in 1969. She has worked in the teaching profession since
she
qualified at the end of 1971. She has taught at the Burwood Girl's High School,
Strathfield South High School, and Balmain High
School from 1972 until 1993.
From 1994 until 1997 she was employed as a special education teacher at Concord
High School. At the
end of 1997 Christine's employment in that position
terminated. She is presently assisting the school with its literacy program,
holding a temporary position from term to term. There is the possibility that
her appointment might be terminated and that she might
become redundant. 
<P>

95   	On 8 January 1972, Christine married Peter Nixon. Of that
marriage were born three children (one of whom died in infancy).
Christine and
her husband separated in 1993 and were divorced in the following year. They
resided at 9 Smalls Bay Road, Ryde, from
November 1972 until their separation.
Christine continues to reside in that house property, which is unencumbered and
has a present
value of about $200,000. Christine owns a 1990 Daihatsu motor
vehicle. 
<P>

96   	Christine's two children, now aged 22 and 17, still reside
with her. 
<P>

97   	Evidence was given by Christine concerning the need for
repair and renovations to her house property.
<P>

98   	Until the end of 1997 Christine's net income as a teacher
was about $34,000 a year. In addition she receives child maintenance
from her
former husband in an amount of $580 a month; interest of about $185 a month;
and $23.50 a fortnight child support. Her annual
outgoings amount to more than
$33,000 a year. 
<P>

99   	Christine from the sale of the Killara property also
received an amount of $105,018. That amount was disbursed by her upon
the
discharge of the amount owing by way of mortgage on her residence ($40,000),
the purchase of her present second-hand motor vehicle
($15,000), renovations,
extensions, and furnishings for her house ($20,000), investment for children's
education ($25,000), and a
holiday ($3,000).
<P>

100   	In about 1976 Christine was diagnosed as suffering from a
condition which was then described as manic depression, but which
is now known
as bi-polar mood disorder. She suffers severe mood swings from extreme bouts of
manic to severe depression. Christine
has been in the care of the Ryde Hospital
and Community Health Services and the Macquarie Psychiatric Hospital for the
past 20 years.
She has check-ups every three to four months or when she is
unwell. In consequence of the death of her infant son in 1980, Christine
suffered a bout of depression. During the period of her employment at Concord
High School, it has been necessary for Christine to
have two periods of
extended sick leave as a result of her mental condition. During early 1996 she
was off work for a period of seven
weeks. During April and May 1997 she was off
work for a period of eight weeks. After she returned to work following each of
those
periods, she did so under heavy medication. 
<P>

101   	Christine in her affidavit evidence referred to the
problems which she had experienced in her teaching and in her relationship
with
the Principal of Concord High School, who has suggested that she take early
retirement. She is of the view that it is unlikely
that if her present position
is declared redundant she will be able to obtain further employment as a
teacher, especially since her
qualification is that of a three year trained
teacher, whilst schools currently prefer to employ university trained teachers.

<P>

102   	The competing claims of the chosen objects of the
testamentary beneficence of the deceased, especially the claim of Christine
(divorced from her husband, still with one dependent child, in a precarious
employment situation and suffering from a significant
mental disorder), are
such that, even if the plaintiff had otherwise established an entitlement to an
order for provision, I would
not, in the exercise of my discretion, make any
such order for provision for the plaintiff out of the estate or notional estate
of
the deceased. It will be appreciated that, were any such order to be made,
the consequence would be to deprive each of Susan and
Christine of benefits
which they have already received --- and have largely expended --- from the
proceeds of sale of the Killara
home unit.
<P>

103   	I have already observed that the estate of the plaintiff
is not sufficient to meet any order for provision an entitlement
to which the
plaintiff might otherwise have established. Accordingly it becomes necessary
for her to resort to notional estate of
the deceased.
<P>

104   	It will be appreciated that the Court is entitled to make
an order designating property as notional estate of a deceased
person only in
circumstances where the Court has already reached the conclusion that an order
for provision should be made. Where,
as here, I have reached the conclusion
that such an order for provision should not be made, not merely is it
unnecessary for me to
proceed to a consideration of whether or not an order
should be made designating property as notional estate of the deceased, but
the
Court is precluded, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the Act (in particular, subsections (1)
and (2) of that section) from making such an order. 
<P>

105   	But even if (contrary to all the foregoing conclusions
which I have expressed) I were to be satisfied that the plaintiff
has
established an entitlement to an order for provision, then it would be
necessary, before the Court could make an order designating
part or all of the
proceeds of the sale of the Killara home unit as notional property of the
deceased, firstly to proceed to a consideration
of whether the deceased entered
into a prescribed transaction of the nature contemplated by paragraph (b) of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23</a> the Act. 
<P>

106   	The prescribed transactions which are, at least by
general reference, asserted in prayers 1, 2 and 3 in the further amended
summons, relate firstly to the sale by the deceased of the house property at 8
Hermitage Road, West Ryde, secondly to the acquisition
by the deceased as joint
tenant with each of the two defendants of the Killara home unit and the failure
by the deceased before his
death to sever that joint tenancy, and thirdly to
"the balance of each and every investment and bank account in the deceased's
name
including but not limited to State Bank Account No. 070-320957-81 in the
amount of $12,215.15".
<P>

107   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22</a> (1) provides the circumstances in which a
person shall be deemed to enter into a prescribed transaction. Paragraph (a) of
that subsection
requires that as a result of the act or omission which is
asserted to constitute the prescribed transaction, either (i) property
becomes
held by another person (whether or not as trustee); or (ii) property becomes
subject to a trust. 
<P>

108   	The conduct of the deceased in selling the Ryde property
did not result in property --- the proceeds of sale --- becoming
held by
another person or becoming subject to a trust. The deceased continued to hold
the proceeds of sale himself. 
<P>

109   	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the conduct of the
deceased in selling the Ryde property can constitute a prescribed
transaction.
<P>

110   	Although the deceased failed to sever the joint tenancy
within the period of one year before his death, I am not satisfied
that his
omission to do so "was entered into at a time when the deceased person had a
moral obligation to make adequate provision,
by will or otherwise, for the
proper maintenance, education and advancement in life" of the plaintiff or of
any other eligible person
which was substantially greater than any moral
obligation of the deceased to enter into the prescribed transaction (that is,
to maintain
the joint tenancy) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 23</a> (b) (ii)). I have already expressed
my conclusions which constitute the absence of any moral obligation of the
deceased to make provision
for the plaintiff by will or otherwise for her
maintenance, education or advancement in life. 
<P>

111   	I do not understand how any prescribed transaction can
arise in respect to the subject matter of the third of the prayers
for relief,
relating to investments and bank accounts.
<P>

112   	Accordingly, I summarise my foregoing views concerning
prescribed transactions and notional estate by saying that I am not
satisfied
that the deceased entered into any prescribed transaction. It follows,
therefore, that the Court does not have the power
to designate as notional
estate of the deceased any part of the proceeds of sale of the Killara home
unit.
<P>

113   	If, however, I am wrong in my foregoing conclusion, and
the conduct of the deceased in failing to sever the joint tenancy
does
constitute a prescribed transaction, then it becomes necessary for the Court,
before making an order designating part or all
of the proceeds of the sale of
the Killara property as notional estate of the deceased, to consider the
various matters set forth
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> of the Act.
<P>

114   	In the circumstances of the instant case, the matters to
which I have referred in relation to the competing claims of each
of the two
defendants, and the effect of those competing claims upon the claim of the
plaintiff, are equally relevant to the various
matters referred to in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27.</a> I consider that
each of the defendants had reasonable expectations in relation to the ultimate
proceeds of sale of the Killara home
unit. Further, I consider that the
substantial justice and merits involved in making or in refusing to make the
order designating
property as notional estate of the plaintiff require that I
should not make any order which would have the effect of reducing or
detrimentally affecting the present financial and material situation of each or
either of the defendants. 
<P>

115   	In the light of the views which I have just expressed,
and in the light of the substantive merits of the plaintiff's claim,
which are
significantly less than the entitlement of the defendants as the chosen objects
of the testamentary beneficence of the
deceased, I am not satisfied that the
plaintiff has established that she is entitled to an order designating as
notional estate of
the deceased any part of the proceeds of sale of the Killara
home unit.
<P>

116   	In consequence of the conclusion which I have just
expressed, there would be no assets available to meet any order for provision
to which the plaintiff (contrary to all my earlier conclusions) might otherwise
have established an entitlement.
<P>

117   	I should also, for completeness, refer to the
significance of the fact that when the proceedings were originally instituted
on 1 May 1997 (within the limitation period of eighteen months after the death
of the deceased) no relief was sought in relation
to the notional estate of the
deceased. That relief was sought for the first time in the document described
as amended summons which
was filed on 10 November 1997 --- that being more than
two years after the date of the death of the deceased. 
<P>

118   	In the light of the earlier conclusions which I have
expressed concerning the claim by the plaintiff to an order for provision
out
of the notional estate of the deceased, it is unnecessary for me to do more
than state my view that the purported amended summons,
which was filed without
leave, was a nullity and of no effect. If the plaintiff were otherwise entitled
to obtain leave to seek relief
in relation to the notional estate of the
deceased --- and I am not satisfied that she is entitled to such leave --- that
leave would
be granted only in relation to any parts of the proceeds of sale of
the Killara home unit which were not dealt with by the defendants
in the
intervening period between the institution of the proceedings on 1 May 1997 and
the filing of the further amended summons
on 20 October 1998 However, as I have
already observed, there is no practical significance to be attached to the
claim of the plaintiff
in respect to notional estate being made out of time,
since, even had it been made within time, I would not have acceded to any such
claim.
<P>

119   	The consequence of all my foregoing conclusions can be
summarised as follows.
<P>

120   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established the
state of affairs predicated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(2)(a)</a> of the Act, and in particular I
am not satisfied that she has established any relevant need. Even if (contrary
to that conclusion)
she has established such need, the claim of the plaintiff
must be approached in the light of the competing claims of the defendants.
In
the light of those competing claims, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has
established an entitlement to an order for provision.
Even if (contrary to my
foregoing conclusions), she has established such an entitlement, the estate of
the deceased is not sufficient
to meet any such order for provision. If it were
to become necessary for the Court to proceed to a consideration of possible
notional
estate of the deceased, I am not satisfied that the deceased entered
into a prescribed transaction of the nature contemplated by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the
Act. Even if (contrary to that conclusion) the deceased did enter into such a
prescribed transaction, I am not satisfied that
an order for provision ought to
be made on the application of the plaintiff; thus it follows that the
discretion which by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23</a> is vested in the Court is not activated.
Further, in any event, I am satisfied that the various matters set forth in
subsection (1)
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> are such as to preclude the Court (even if I were
otherwise minded to do so) from making an order designating property as
notional
estate of the deceased. The claim in respect to notional estate has
not formally or properly been made. The plaintiff is now out
of time to make a
claim. She has not established an entitlement to an order for leave to make
such a claim outside the prescribed
period.
<P>

121   	It follows therefore, from all the foregoing conclusions,
that the plaintiff's claim for provision must fail.
<P>

122   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the proceedings be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendants.
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
