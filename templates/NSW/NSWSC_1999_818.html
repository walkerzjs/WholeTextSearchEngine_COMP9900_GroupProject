<u>20150/95   -   Katherine Anne Langhorne McINNES v K. AHLUWALIA</u>
<P>

<u>JUDMENT</u>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  This is a claim for damages in respect of
medical conditions suffered by the plaintiff, Miss Katherine McInnes,
which are
said to have been aggravated by the failure of the respondent, Dr K Ahluwahlia,
to diagnose a condition of bilateral hip
dysplasia when Katherine was a young
child and also by his failure to advise the plaintiff's mother, Mrs Maxine
McInnes, to have
her daughter checked again at a later stage.  The negligence
is said to have occurred in April 1974 when the plaintiff, aged two
months,
attended with her mother on      Dr Ahluwahlia.  The existence of the
condition, bilateral hip dysplasia, was not identified
until 1990, when
Katherine was sixteen years of age.  Her left hip was operated on on 26 June
1990 and her right hip on 9 November
1990. On 3 October 1991, the pins were
removed from the pelvis on both sides.  In 1974, the name of the family was
Thomas and the
medical records of that period use that name.
<P>

2   	Katherine suffered a condition in which each hip socket,
the acetabulum, was steeper and shallower than it ought to have been.
 With
this condition, the femoral head tends in the long term to migrate slowly
upwards and there is increased pressure on the cartilage
lining, the joint
surface between the femoral head and the acetabulum.  With the increased
pressure over time, the cartilage tends
to wear away and the joint can become
painful and stiff and subject to osteoarthritis.  In a severe case, the femoral
head may become
displaced. 
<P>

3   	The condition can be, and probably was in Katherine's case,
genetically based. Female children tend to suffer the condition
more than male
children.  Katherine's elder sister, Josine, who was born on 14 June 1971,
suffered at birth from bilateral dislocation
of the hips.  She was treated by
Dr Gordon Colvin, a specialist in the field, and was placed in a Pavlic harness
for fourteen months.
 This harness encouraged the bone structure to develop
normally and Josine suffered no residual consequences.  It is a matter of
interest rather than of any particular significance that another daughter,
Olivia, born to Mrs McInnes in 1988, also suffered from
the genetic condition.
Her condition was identified shortly after birth and she also suffered no
further problems after wearing a
harness for seven months.
<P>

4   	I have said that Katherine was born with bilateral hip
dysplasia, not bilateral hip dislocation from which Josine suffered.
 It is
agreed by the medical witnesses that the distinction is important.  Dr John P H
Stephen, a specialist in paediatric orthopaedics,
who operated on Katherine in
1990 when she was sixteen years of age, gave evidence that Katherine suffered
from dysplasia of both
hips with early subluxation on the left side.  He
described the subluxation as early dislocation.  In his oral evidence, Dr
Stephen
said that Katherine may at birth have had a dislocation on the left
side which subsequently stabilised.  However, I think it improbable
that that
was the case.  I think it probable that, had there been a dislocation at the
time of birth, that would have been picked
up by either Dr Ahluwahlia or the
paediatrician, Dr Oldfield, who examined Katherine shortly after her birth and
who detected no
abnormality.  Dr Stephen said that, with dysplasia, the femoral
head tends to migrate slowly upwards.  He said that subluxation occurs
when the
femoral head starts to slide outward. 
<P>

5   	Dr Stephen said that when he first saw Katherine on 22
March 1990 she stood without any muscle wasting.  She had a very mild
left-sided limp and the lower left limb was 7 mm shorter than the right but the
Trendelenberg test was negative showing no muscle
weakness.  Katherine had a
good range of movement although there was some mild restriction.  The left hip
was showing probably the
beginnings of sclerosis, indicating early degenerative
change.  For reasons I shall later mention, I think that symptoms of pain
from
Katherine's left hip began to emerge in the year before the operation.
<P>

6   	I do not think it could be seriously contended that, in
1974, Dr Ahluwahlia was negligent in not diagnosing for himself Katherine's
hip
dysplasia.  Evidence has been given that, since 1974, radiography has much
improved.  Ultrasound is also now used as a diagnostic
tool.  Even so, the
evidence is that it can be difficult to diagnose the condition of dysplasia
before the bones have firmed up at
about six months.  A displaced hip can be
more readily detected.
<P>

7   	The issue on negligence thus turns upon the question
whether Dr Ahluwahlia should have given to Mrs McInnes a reference to
an
appropriate specialist which she requested, and whether, in any event, he ought
to have advised Mrs McInnes to bring Katherine
back after a few months to be
checked again.
<P>

8   	There was a great deal of agreement between the medical
experts; but I should observe that, in this case as in other cases,
the process
of examination and cross-examination has tended not to resolve important
questions about which the evidence differs.
 Other jurisdictions are adopting
the procedure, which was first commenced in the Trade Practices Tribunal, where
the experts appear
together in a consultation with the court or tribunal.  At
such a hearing, experts tend to resolve many of their differences and
make it
clear what are the differences which remain and why each expert holds his or
her view.  In the present case, we are left
with some important issues about
which further clarification would have been desirable. 
<P>

9   	I shall set out the substance of the matters in respect of
which the experts were in agreement and I shall do that by referring
to the
report of Dr J S Scougall, who was not cross-examined but who set out in his
report a number of principles in very clear and
what appear to be fair terms.
I incorporate and join together aspects of his report and aspects of his
addendum.  Dr Scougall said,
inter alia:
<P>

"<i>At the age of 2-3 months, if there had been concern that the hips may not
have been normal, then reasonable treatment at that time
would have been to
physically assess the hips then and at regular intervals, to check for the
maintenance of stability, and then
to carry out, at about the age of 6 months,
a radiological examination. ... The difficulty with interpretation of
radiological examinations
in a neonate is related to the fact that there is
relatively more growing cartilage which does not show up on radiological
examination
and relatively less bone, which of course does. ... the degree of
dysplasia is quite frequently difficult to assess in radiological
examination
at the age of 6 months.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>It should be pointed out that the vast majority of dysplastic hips usually
spontaneously resolve. These days, with the introduction
of ultrasound
examination in neonates and continuing observation of these hips that are found
to be dysplastic, it appears that very
few do not resolve ... Genetically
determined causes of failure of a child's hip to develop normally are usually
more difficult to
treat with end results that are less satisfactory.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Failure of the dysplasia to improve, over the years, enough to be thought to
be acceptable, would have warranted discussion on the
possible merits of
surgical correction. ... By acceptable is meant that the probable risk for the
later development of osteoarthritis
of the hips is held to be not great enough
to justify the risks of surgery for the child.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>I would add ... that hip dysplasia, in the presence of a concentrically
reduced hip prior to any subluxation causing osteoarthritic
changes, is
asymptomatic.</i>"
<P>

10   	I set out those matters from Dr Scougall's report because
I can see no element of bias in them.  It seemed to me that Dr Stephen,
who was
called on behalf of  the plaintiff and Dr Stalley, who was called on behalf of
the defendant, both tended on occasions to
overstate a point.  Dr Scougall
reported to the defendant's solicitors.
<P>

11   	An issue between the experts was whether Katherine's hip
dysplasia would have been identified had an x-ray been taken when
she was about
the age of six months.  Dr Stephen said, "<i>X-ray at about the age of twenty
weeks in an infant is pretty reasonable showing either a dysplasia or a
dislocation</i>".  However, Dr Stalley expressed, as did Dr Scougall, the point
that, in 1974 when ultrasound and more modern radiological developments
were
not available, the diagnosis of dysplasia and of its degree was difficult in
the early months and became easier as the child
grew older.  I accept Dr
Scougall's description of the position.
<P>

12   	That leads to the issue whether, had Katherine been
diagnosed at an early stage as suffering from dysplasia, she would have
been
treated with a Pavlic harness, as had Katherine's elder sister Josine.  Dr
Stephen said that the harness is the ideal method
of treatment and he said that
the number of orthopaedic surgeons who would fail to use a harness would be in
the minority for the
reason that the longer one waits to treat the problem the
less is the potential for regeneration.  Dr Stalley said, however, that
a
Pavlic harness is used with either dislocated or dislocatable hips, hips which
show a problem on physical examination.  Dr Stalley
said he had not seen a
Pavlic harness used in any instance for progressive dysplasia or for hips that
did not dislocate.  He said
that the use of the Pavlic harness is a hotly
debated topic in the circumstances of a child such as Katherine.  Dr Stalley
gave this
oral evidence:
<P>

"<i>There is no doubt in the literature that success rates of Pavlic harness
usage when started in children from four to six weeks of
age is around 90 per
cent in correcting dislocating and dislocatable hips. But if you have no
dislocation or dislocatable hips and
you can't ... x-ray until the child is
older ascertain that they have a dysplastic hip then you would start the use of
the Pavlic
harness when you can begin to make those radiological estimations
around </i><cite>six months</cite><i> that can say this child has significant
dysplasia, </i><cite>if you then start to use the Pavlic harness at that age
its efficacy is reduced because the ability of the hip to accommodate and
change has significantly reduced and the likelihood of something such as
avascular necrosis go up so there is a reticence to use
the Pavlic harness
purely for dysplasia in the older child</cite><i>.</i>"   (emphasis added)
<P>

13   	In his report, Dr Scougall did not mention the Pavlic
harness. I infer that his opinion was similar to Dr Stalley's on this
point.
When speaking of what might have occurred had x-rays been taken at the age of
six months and disclosed dysplasia, Dr Scougall
stated:
<P>

"<i>Assuming the hips at that stage were concentrically reduced, which the
subsequent history indicates, then continuing observation would
have been
recommended, with periodic radiological assessments every 6-12 months.</i>"
<P>

14   	In the result, I conclude that the use of a Pavlic harness
was just one of the options that would have been available to a
doctor had
dysplasia been identified when Katherine was about six months.  As Dr Scougall
suggested, it would have been appropriate
for there to be radiological
examination at intervals to ascertain if Katherine had a problem.  If those
examinations had occurred,
then, at six months or a few months thereafter,
x-rays would probably have shown that Katherine suffered from hip dysplasia.
Whether
a Pavlic harness would have been used at that point would have depended
upon the view of the doctor as to its possible benefits and
the problems to
which its use then could give rise.
<P>

15   	Another option for treating dysplasia was an operation.
The experts seem to be agreed that, had an operation been undertaken,
it would
have been undertaken before the child reached the age of five or six or after
the age of twelve, probably at about sixteen
when she was actually operated on.
Dr Scougall said that, in a pre-school child, the operation frequently
discussed is an innominate
osteotomy, with some doctors recommending a femoral
osteotomy, while, in the older child, twelve years or over, the operation is
usually a triple innominate osteotomy.  The latter was the operation actually
performed on each of Katherine's hips.  Dr Stephen
said that, had he operated
before the age of six, he would have performed a femoral osteotomy.
<P>

16   	Katherine's birth occurred on 25 February 1974 in the Mona
Vale District Hospital.  It was noticed that there was a slight
click in
Katherine's left hip.  Katherine was put into double nappies which acted as a
primitive harness.  Clicky hips may have many
causes and are not necessarily a
result of hip dysplasia or hip dislocation.  Double nappies appear to be of
doubtful therapeutic
value.
<P>

17   	The resident medical officer noted for the purposes of a
consultant, Dr Oldfield, a paediatrician, that Mrs McInnes' previous
child had
suffered from severe jaundice and congenital dislocated hips.  Dr Oldfield
examined the child.  He prescribed treatment
for Katherine's jaundice.  As to
the hip condition, he merely noted, "<i>I have discussed problem with
mother</i>".  Mrs McInnes said that she was informed by Dr Oldfield that he
could find no problem with Katherine's hips.  Dr Oldfield directed
that the
double nappies be discontinued. 
<P>

18   	On 3 March 1974, the night nurse noted in the records that
Katherine had a slight click in the left hip and that the mother
was aware and
would consult her own GP in two weeks.  Mrs McInnes did not raise the matter
with Dr Ahluwahlia when she saw him on
12 March 1974.  Her evidence is that she
obtained from her obstetrician, Dr Newlinds, a reference to Dr Colvin who had
treated Josine.
 At about that time, Dr Newlinds wrote to Dr Ahluwahlia on 17
April 1974 as follows:
<P>

"<i>I saw Mrs Thomas today some seven weeks after the birth of her baby girl.
I could find no abnormality when I examined the daughter.
 She has been told by
two different Sisters at the hospital that there is a click in one hip but I
have not been able to detect it.
However, she has a sister who had bilateral
marked congenital dislocation of the hip and therefore I feel the matter cannot
be ignored.
 I have taken the liberty of referring her directly to Dr Gordon
Colvin who managed the last baby's hips.  I suggested he contact
you
directly.</i>"
<P>

In the same letter, Dr Newlinds said that he had given Mrs McInnes a
contraceptive device and he asked Dr Ahluwahlia to check the
position of it in
about a week's time.
<P>

19   	What happened next is a matter of dispute.  Mrs McInnes
gave evidence that she tried to obtain an appointment with Dr Colvin
but could
not do so, probably because of Dr Colvin's ill health.  She said that she made
an appointment with    Dr Ahluwahlia with
a view to obtaining a reference to
another specialist.  She said that Dr Ahluwahlia declined to give the reference
but examined Katherine
himself.  He could find no problem with Katherine's
hips.  In his evidence, Dr Ahluwahlia said that he could not recall the
consultation
and had no note of it.
<P>

20   	However, Dr Ahluwahlia's note taking was deficient.  There
is at least one entry with respect to Mrs McInnes on the card which
he kept for
Josine and, although Dr Ahluwahlia kept no record of the consultation with
which we are now concerned, there is on the
card which he kept for Katherine
the date 26 April 1974.  Against that date there is no entry.  It is the only
such circumstance
in the record cards which are in evidence.  It is probable
that Mrs McInnes did see  Dr Ahluwahlia on that date to have the contraceptive
device checked and that, during that consultation, she discussed Katherine's
hips and asked for a referral to a specialist.  The
fact that both Katherine's
hips and the contraceptive device were referred to in Dr Newlinds' letter is a
strong indication that
both matters would have been discussed during the
consultation.  Moreover, there is no good reason to reject Mrs McInnes'
evidence
that she could not obtain an appointment with       Dr Colvin and that
she asked Dr Ahluwahlia for a referral to another specialist.
 It is probable
that she did so. 
<P>

21   	Dr Ahluwahlia did not disagree that, if Mrs McInnes had
asked for a referral, he would himself have examined the child.  It
follows
that, at that consultation, Dr Ahluwahlia examined Katherine and could find no
problem with the hips.  It is probable that
Dr Ahluwahlia was informed that the
paediatrician had also examined Katherine and could find nothing wrong and that
he concluded
that there was no need to refer Katherine to a specialist at that
time. 
<P>

22   	At the present day, attitudes in the profession have
changed and investigatory techniques have improved.  Although Dr Stephen
and Dr
Stalley agree that it would have been appropriate for Dr Ahluwahlia to refer
Katherine to a specialist, I accept Dr Stalley's
evidence that, prior to 1980,
it was a matter about which a general practitioner would have exercised his own
judgment.  It is to
be kept in mind that Dr Ahluwahlia and Dr Oldfield would
have been familiar with the tests to be applied in such an examination and
that
Katherine was, at that stage, too young for radiological examination.
<P>

23   	I cannot conclude that Dr Ahluwahlia was negligent in not
giving to Mrs McInnes the reference that she requested.  General
medical
practitioners are bound to exercise their own judgment as to whether or not
there should be a reference to a specialist.
 Dr Ahluwahlia made an
investigation and could not detect any abnormality or symptoms thereof.  I am
satisfied that Dr Ahluwahlia
would have been informed that the consultant, Dr
Oldfield, had looked at the child and could identify no problem.  I am not
satisfied
that, at that stage in April 1974, there were any such symptoms or
other circumstances as would have required Dr Ahluwahlia, in the
exercise of
his duty of care to Katherine, to refer her to a specialist.  In his oral
evidence, Dr Ahluwahlia said that, in 1974,
his view as to the value of seeing
an orthopaedic surgeon in circumstances where there was a suspicion of hip
dysplasia was that
you needed to confirm the diagnosis by x-rays and that
Katherine was only two or three months old, whereas x-rays were taken when
children were six months or so of age.  He said that he would never hesitate to
send a patient to an orthopaedic surgeon, for he
did not practise orthopaedics.

<P>

24   	The question remains, however, whether Dr Ahluwahlia
should have advised Mrs McInnes to come back for further investigation
when
Katherine was a little older.  I am satisfied on the probabilities that he did
not give that advice.  That is because, not only
has Mrs McInnes denied
receiving such advice, but it is probable that, had she received the advice,
she would have kept it in mind
and would have brought Katherine back to Dr
Ahluwahlia or to another doctor for further investigation.  Mrs McInnes was
well aware
of the problem and of its significance. 
<P>

25   	In a written statement, Dr Ahluwahlia said:
<P>

"<i>23. 	If presented with a history of clicking hips I would conduct my own
examination.  If I could find no evidence of clicking hips
I would ask for the
parent(s) to return the child to me for review when the child was weight
bearing at about 10-12 months.  If I
was still in doubt at that stage I would
arrange an x-ray which would show evidence of dislocation or dysplasia.</i>"
<P>

In his oral evidence, Dr Ahluwahlia reduced the period of 10-12 months, which
appears in his written statement, to six months. 
Drs Stephen and Scougall said
that, if a child is at risk of dysplasia, a doctor should keep the child under
review.  They are agreed
that, if there is a risk, which there was with
Katherine because of her sex, her sister's condition and her clicky hips, then
from
the age of six months onwards, further investigation should be undertaken.
Dr Ahluwahlia's written statement accorded with that.

<P>

26   	It follows in my opinion that, having regard to his
knowledge of Katherine and to his receipt of Dr Newlinds' letter, which
emphasised the importance of investigation, Dr Ahluwahlia should, on 26 April
1974, either then and there have given a reference
to a specialist or have
advised Mrs McInnes in clear terms to return to him when Katherine was six
months of age.  Dr Ahluwahlia
did neither. In that, he was negligent. 
<P>

27   	It may be that Dr Ahluwahlia gave advice which was
inadequate.  In his written statement, Dr Ahluwahlia said he would ask
that the
child be returned for examination when the child was weight bearing.  In his
oral evidence, Dr Ahluwahlia said:
<P>

"<i>Q. And you are going to leave that 10 to 12 months?</i>
<P>

<i>A. See it is, weight bearing starts at the 9 to 10 or 12 months,
</i><cite>some children have problems with the weight bearing</cite><i> or
could not stand so you get the x-rays and you check for dysplasia.</i>
<P>

<i>Q. And you wait 10 to 12 months to check for dysplasia?</i>
<P>

<i>A. </i><cite>Depends when the child complains</cite><i>.</i>"  (emphasis
added)
<P>

28   	These answers suggest that Dr Ahluwahlia would have waited
for some complaint from the child or for some problems of weight
bearing and it
may be that the advice which he gave was to keep an eye on Katherine and to
bring her back if that occurred.  If that
advice was given, and there is no
evidence that it was, the advice was inadequate because the evidence before the
Court shows that
hip dysplasia is usually asymptomatic until there is wear in
the joints.  Very often a problem of hip dysplasia will not show up
until a
child is sixteen or eighteen years of age and may not show up until much later
in life.  The evidence also shows that treatment
should commence as soon as is
practicable, while the bones are forming.
<P>

29   	In the circumstances, I am satisfied that Dr Ahluwahlia
did not exercise the degree of care towards Katherine which a doctor
in his
situation ought to have done.  The fact that he did not even make a note of the
consultation is perhaps one indication that,
on that day, he was not exercising
due care so far as Katherine was concerned.
<P>

30   	That brings me to the question of the lost chance. The
issue is to assess the prospects that Katherine would not later have
had
physical problems had Dr Ahluwahlia either sent her off to a specialist
orthopaedic surgeon for examination or had he advised
Mrs McInnes to bring her
back for an examination at about age six months.  I think the six months period
is the important time for
I think that it is improbable that both Dr Ahluwahlia
and Dr Oldfield missed any matter that should have been observed in the early
months of Katherine's life by a physical examination.  Therefore, the issue is
as to what might have occurred had either an orthopaedic
surgeon or Dr
Ahluwahlia examined her again when she was about six months of age.
<P>

31   	Here the evidence of Dr Stephen conflicts with that of Dr
Scougall and of Dr Stalley.  I accept the evidence of Drs Scougall
and Stalley
that, even at six months, the identification of dysplasia from x-rays was an
uncertain task.  It is probable that, at
six months or at least during the 6-12
months period, dysplasia would have been identified.  By then, the best
prospects of using
a Pavlic harness would have passed.  Perhaps a harness would
have been used, perhaps not.  Katherine would have been kept under observation
and it may be that an operation would have been performed at least on the left
hip when she was about the age of five.  This operation
would of course have
involved Katherine in significant trauma.  There is also a possibility that Mrs
McInnes would have been advised
or chosen to wait to see how the hips developed
and that no operation would have been carried out until about the time or
shortly
before the operations were actually performed. 
<P>

32   	Doing the best I can in this difficult field, I would
assess the prospects that Katherine would have achieved a full recovery
by
reason of an early operation, the use of a harness or other treatment, at 50
per cent.  This does not mean that I am satisfied
as a matter of probability
that Katherine's problems would have been overcome had Dr Ahluwahlia sent her
to an orthopaedic surgeon
or advised her mother to have her further examined at
the age of six months.  Rather, my view is that the chance of such recovery
was
about 50 per cent.
<P>

33   	The damages issue is complex for, after the operations of
which I have spoken, Katherine demonstrated a psychiatric condition
of severe
depression and social phobia.  Dr Lisa Lampe, a consultant psychiatrist, on 29
November 1995 described the condition as
follows:
<P>

"<i>Ms McInnes' psychiatric diagnoses, in accordance with the DSM-IV
classification are</i>
<P>

<i>Axis I:	Major depression (recurrent),</i>
<P>

<i>		social phobia</i>
<P>

<i>Axis II:	avoidant personality disorder,</i>
<P>

<i>		borderline personality traits</i>
<P>

<i>The observable features are anxiety and avoidance of social interaction,
recurrent depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts and
other self harming
behaviour, and an extremely poor self image and low self esteem.</i>"
<P>

34   	There was a history of depression in Katherine's family at
the level of her grandparents.  J Parmegiani described her as biologically
vulnerable to depression whilst Dr R McMurdo said she had a considerable
congenital predisposition to both her depression and her
anxiety or phobic
condition.  Dr McMurdo, who examined Katherine on behalf of the defendant,
stated that Katherine would have developed
some difficulty psychologically had
she not had the difficulty with her hips.  He noted that, had she not had any
sexual assault
nor suffered any problem with her hips and had had a very stable
biological family, she might still have developed later depression
and anxiety
to a significant and serious degree. 
<P>

35   	Dr Lampe also agreed that it was very probable that
Katherine would have developed a psychiatric illness whether or not she
had had
any hip problems.  Another factor which played a part was that, when Katherine
was aged six and again when she was aged twelve,
Katherine was sexually
assaulted.  I need not mention the distressing circumstances of these assaults
except to say that Katherine
was so distressed and embarrassed by the second
assault, which involved four youths, that she kept it to herself and did not
disclose
it until she was nineteen years of age.  This, of course, tended to
affect her underlying psychological condition.  Dr Lampe was
satisfied that the
assaults, particularly the assault when she was aged twelve and before she
attended secondary school, were major
factors in Katherine's psychiatric
problems.  Dr Lampe agreed that, in terms of the stressors that were
significant in the development
of Katherine's psychological problems, the
sexual assaults were, "<i>at the very front ... by a long way</i>". 
<P>

36   	However, I am satisfied that Katherine's hip condition
contributed to the development of the severe psychiatric illness from
which
Katherine suffered in recent years.  Dr Parmegiani spoke of bilateral hip pain
during childhood but, as I shall later mention,
I do not think there was any
such pain.  Dr Lampe and Dr McMurdo were, however, in agreement that the
operations and Katherine's
post-operative condition played a part in
contributing to Katherine's illness.  This view finds strong support in the
report of Dr
Phillip Ridge who had first seen Katherine on 9 March 1990 when
she complained of left hip pain for ten days.  Dr Ridge gives this
description
of his consultation on 20 February 1991, after the second operation:
<P>

"<i>The next occasion I saw Miss McInnes on the 20th February 1991 at which
time it appeared she was depressed.  She had the second operation
on the 9th
November 1990 by Dr John Stephen.  At the time I saw her she had poor
concentration and having difficulty talking to people.
 She had considered
suicide and she had been like this for one month.  She said she wanted to sleep
all the time and had strange
dreams about dying.  She has difficulty doing her
work especially Maths and she was said to have gone `hysterical' on the
previous
Monday.  She couldn't control herself and wouldn't accept any help
from friends especially her best friend.  She had no interest
in school.  She
said she was like this before her surgery but not as bad and she could control
things but now she felt she was unable
to hold her feelings.  She felt she was
two people looking at herself with loathing and disgust in that she could not
do anything.
I suggested she see Dr Mel Bennett, Psychiatrist as soon as
possible.</i>"
<P>

The sequence of events itself suggests that the hip operations, their trauma
and their interference with her normal life, played
a part in aggravating
Katherine's underlying psychiatric illness. 
<P>

37   	Katherine recovered from that episode but had a very
severe breakdown when she attended the Queensland Conservatorium of Music
in
1993.  Dr Lampe explained that development in these terms:
<P>

"<i>Going to university is a much more demanding proposition than being at
school.</i>"
<P>

Dr Lampe considered that the problems which Katherine had had with her hips and
the prolonged absences for hospitalisation would
have interfered with her
normal social development.  Dr Lampe thought, however, that Katherine's
problems with her hips were not
a major problem at the time she left school in
1992 and that perhaps her hip problems had played a greater part thereafter
for, at
the present time, it was her pain and disability that was stopping her
performing normal activities that her psychological state
permitted.
<P>

38   	Dr McMurdo expressed the view that it was very probable
that the interstate move was an aggravating factor with Katherine's
social
phobia and that moving away from familiar surroundings, support, and family, to
a different and competitive environment was
very likely to have aggravated the
anxiety of the social phobia. He also explained that individuals with
Katherine's condition are
generally very fragile emotionally and more easily
distressed by threats to their efficiency or body image.  He said that
Katherine's
hip problems would, in his opinion, be placed fairly high in the
order of the various factors which aggravated her emotional fragility.
<P>

39   	There was a specific factor related to the hips which
played a part in Katherine's breakdown which occurred at the Conservatorium.
As part of her studies, Katherine had to undergo a movement course.  This
course was a demanding one and Katherine found that she
was inadequate and that
she suffered pain and discomfort.  This increased her inability to cope with
life at the Conservatorium.
In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the
hip problems played an active role, perhaps a small one if Dr Lampe's evidence
is to be preferred, but nevertheless a contributing role in the development of
Katherine's psychiatric illness.
<P>

40   	Two further matters flow from this description of
Katherine's illness.  The first is that I cannot accept as accurate all
the
problems that Katherine now alleges she encountered as a result of her hips.
The second is that there is disagreement as to how
the damages issue should be
approached.  The case put by Mr A T McInnes QC, with him Mr A L Hill, for
Katherine was that, as the
hip condition contributed to the depressive
condition which developed, the fact that Katherine was likely to have developed
a psychiatric
illness in any event is irrelevant.  Mr P H Greenwood SC, counsel
for Dr Ahluwahlia, submitted that the damages issue must be approached
on the
footing that Katherine would in any event have had a severe psychiatric
condition which would have interfered with her life.
<P>

41   	Mr Greenwood relied upon <b><i>Malec v J C Hutton Pty
Ltd</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a> in which it was held that where questions as to
the future or hypothetical effect of physical injury or degeneration arise, the
degree
of probability of the occurrence of associated future or hypothetical
events must be evaluated by the Court.  What had to be evaluated
in that case
was the plaintiff's future earning capacity and the prospect that his
deteriorating back condition would have precluded
him from engaging in gainful
employment had he not contracted the disease of brucellosis from his
employment.  As was said in <b><i>Malec</i></b> at 639-640, 642-643, past facts
should be determined on the probabilities whilst, when the Court is considering
future facts, it
must conjecture about the hypothetical. 
<P>

42   	The significance of this discussion is that, in the
present case, Katherine's underlying psychiatric condition, her depression
and
social phobia, and the possibility or probability that because of that
condition she would not have gained employment as an opera
singer, the
profession to which she aspired, notwithstanding that her voice and her
appearance qualified her to do so, is a factor
which must be taken into account
in assessing the effect which the bilateral hip dysplasia has had on her
life.
<P>

43   	I turn now to deal with the question of damages as if
liability for the whole of the damages were established.
<P>

44   	During her early years, Katherine had some pains in her
legs.  I am satisfied by the expert evidence that these would have
been normal
"<i>growing pains</i>" not related to her hip condition.  I am satisfied that
Katherine suffered no relevant symptoms until she was a boarder at Kinross
Wolaroi School in Orange.  She commenced at that school when she was about
twelve after the second assault which I have mentioned.
 Katherine gave
evidence that both at primary school and at the Kinross Wolaroi School when she
undertook sport she had a lot of
pain afterwards unless the sport was swimming.
She gave evidence that she had a problem with walking after a lot of exercise,
that
her gait would change and she would start to get a rolling motion which
worsened as she got older.  Such a description did not find
support with the
experts called on behalf of either party.  I think that much of Katherine's
complaints have their source in her
psychological problems and in a
disinclination which she had to engage in active sports.  On the evidence,
particularly of her mother,
Katherine tended to sit rather than be active.  She
tended to be overweight.
<P>

45   	Katherine's mother gave evidence that Katherine was "<i>a
clumsy, perhaps overly clumsy, uncoordinated child</i>" and that her condition
did not improve as she grew older.  Mrs McInnes said Katherine has led "<i>a
very soft, quiet life as a child</i>" and that when she went to the Kinross
Wolaroi School she was a bit overweight, did not do a lot of exercises and
seemed to read
a lot.  Mrs McInnes said that when Katherine came home on
holidays she would occasionally, after exercise, have a bad night after
walking
up the hill or doing any more than she was used to doing.
<P>

46   	It is a feature of Katherine's life that she has tended to
be sedentary and to have complaints of pain after exercise.  However,
there is
no medical evidence which would support a finding that these problems resulted
from her hip dysplasia.  The evidence is
that hip dysplasia tends to be
asymptomatic until wear occurs in the joints.  All the doctors rejected the
view that the pain which
Katherine described in her early period resulted from
her hip condition.  The conclusion I draw is that Katherine had an inherent
dislike of activity and a tendency to be sedentary and, accordingly, that when
she did exercise she felt discomfort which arose from
the inadequate use of her
muscles.  I shall later mention the report of Dr R Laurent who considers that
much of the pain and the
problems which she is now encountering is arising from
reduced movement and weakness in her muscles.
<P>

47   	At the end of February 1990, Katherine complained of a
sharp pain in her left hip. She saw a sister at the school and at Mrs
McInnes'
request was referred to a physiotherapist.  On the physiotherapist's advice,
she was sent to see Dr Phillip Ridge, a general
practitioner.  He saw Katherine
on 9 March 1990 and took a history of left hip pain for ten days.  He also
noted, "<i>She had occasional hip pain with running</i>".  Dr Ridge considered
that x-rays should be performed and possibly orthopaedic review should be
undertaken.
<P>

48   	Katherine thereafter saw a Dr Meachin and then Dr John P H
Stephen, a specialist in paediatric orthopaedics.  He saw Katherine
on 22 March
1990.  He found that she had a very mild left-sided limp and that the left limb
was 7 mm shorter than the right.  She
had good range of movement in her left
hip.  After examining        x-rays, Dr Stephen concluded that Katherine's
right hip was dysplastic
whereas the left hip was dysplastic with early
subluxation.  Using a Trendelenberg test he found no weakness in the hip
muscles.
 He considered that the left hip was suitable for a triple osteotomy
procedure in which the acetabulum would be realigned.  He undertook
the
operation on the left hip on 26 June 1990.  After the operation, Katherine was
in traction for six weeks before mobilising and
on crutches for another four
weeks.  On 9 November 1990, Katherine's right hip was treated in a like manner
and again Katherine was
in traction for six weeks and in a wheelchair and on
crutches for another four weeks or so.  She described the pain while she was
in
traction as agonising.  A good correction of the acetabular angle was achieved
in both hips.  A year later, on 3 October 1991,
the pins were removed from the
pelvis on both sides.  Dr Stephen expected a good result.
<P>

49   	Notwithstanding her operations in 1990, Katherine passed
through her six years of secondary school without having to repeat.
 Her school
reports from 1992 are favourable although her marks seem to have been slightly
under the average.  A reference given
by the principal included the comments,
"<i>We have found Kate to be a capable, conscientious student who has excellent
communication skills ... Kate is a responsible young lady
with an excellent
sense of humour, who is very trustworthy and reliable</i>".
<P>

50   	In addition to her school activities, Katherine undertook
a good deal of classical singing.  In Year 12, she won a scholarship
for vocal
tuition which was the Godfrey Turner Memorial Prize in Star Quest, an
instrumental and vocal competition in New South Wales
and the Australian
Capital Territory.  She won a prize in an eisteddfod held at Orange and was
soloist at an opera workshop which
put on an opera in Sydney.  At school, she
was involved in productions of Iolanthe, The Mikado, Hawaii, and Pyjama Game
and was a
member of the Madrigal Singers, senior and junior choirs and the
junior ensemble.  It does not appear that Katherine's hips were,
during 1992,
holding back her general development.  Her great interest was singing, for she
had an outstanding voice and in that
field she did very well.  Mrs McInnes gave
evidence that Katherine was very much alive on the stage, perhaps more alive
there than
anywhere else.
<P>

51   	LM Paix, Director of Music at the Kinross Wolaroi School
has written in glowing terms of Katherine's potential.  He said that
her
potential astounded many people on the staff of the school and that that
potential, with her diligence and great determination,
had reached the highest
peak he had known in any school student in his twenty-six years as a music
educator.  He said that her vocal
clarity, power, maturity and rich timbre made
listening to her perform a great joy and privilege. He said that her
achievements to
date were outstanding but only illustrative of the potential of
greater things to come.
<P>

52   	In 1993, Katherine was accepted into the Queensland
Conservatorium on the strength of her ability.  She attended there for
only
four months before becoming severely depressed.  She sought psychiatric help
and has been under psychiatric treatment ever since.
<P>

53   	Katherine's breakdown was a severe one and she has not
been able to continue with her singing since that time.  She returned
to Sydney
and was admitted to the Northside Clinic at Greenwich under the care of a Dr
Diamond.  She was admitted to the Northside
Clinic on three occasions.
Subsequently, Katherine was referred to Dr Lampe at the Eversham Clinic where
she has been admitted on
about eleven occasions.  Over the years, Katherine has
been treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, hospitalisation and
electroconvulsive
treatment.  Her few attempts to work at remunerated
employment have been unsuccessful.  She suffered awful personal problems which
I need not detail.  For some years, she was an alcoholic and at one stage she
suffered a conviction for an alcohol induced offence.
 During 1993 to 1996, she
was greatly depressed and attempted suicide with drugs on three occasions.  Her
relationships have been
unhappy.  In brief, she has undergone some terrible
years.
<P>

54   	It is a striking feature of this case that, although the
medical experts are agreed that the condition of hip dysplasia is
asymptomatic
until there is a wearing out of the cartilage lining and ultimately the
development of osteoarthritis, Katherine's evidence
gives a picture of constant
problems with her legs from an early age and her evidence as to her condition
after the operations was
to similar effect.  The following are extracts from
Katherine's evidence as to her condition in earlier years:
<P>

"<i>Q.	You have had aches and pains in your body?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What is your first recollection of those?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	When I was five or six, whenever I did any exercise, I would always have
aches and pains in my hips and thighs, and down to my
calves afterwards.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Were they worse at some time of the day than at others?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	After exercise in the evening, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, and
mum and dad would give me Panadol and make me walk to
try and relieve the
pain.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	After you commenced sporting activities, how long did it take for the
pain to come on?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Ten minutes, fifteen minutes.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you find something about running?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would fall over, I couldn't - in 1989/1990 it got to a stage where I
just couldn't run, I couldn't pick up speed. Sometimes I
would fall over with
severe pain.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	By 1990, was your physical condition getting worse?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Much worse, yes.</i>
<P>

...
<P>

<i>Q.	When were you sore?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would - it only had to be a short walk, any sort of walking or
standing for any length of time. Staying in any position, even
sitting for any
length of time in the one position.</i>"
<P>

55   	This evidence does not fit the medical evidence as to the
effects of hip dysplasia.  I have already set out an extract from
Dr Scougall's
report.  Dr Stephen reported on 2 September 1996:
<P>

"<i>Almost certainly these severe leg pains, about the age of six, at night
before bedtime and after she had been in bed for a while,
were the pains of
so-called "painful legs of childhood" or "growing pains".  These would in no
way be related to any hip condition.
 It would appear that the left hip may
have been symptomatic on and off prior to Dr Meachin's referring her to me on
15/3/90 although
the aching which drove her to see him had only been present
for about two and a half weeks beforehand.</i>"
<P>

In his report of 8 May 1996, Dr Stalley said:
<P>

"<i>Over the next years, up until the age of 16, Katherine complained,
apparently, of bilateral leg pain, radiating down to and involving
the shins
such that her Mother during the evening was required to massage her shins to
relieve the pain.  I do point out that that
particular symptom is not
consistent with pain coming from the hip joint.  ... It was not until the age
of 16, when she complained
of increasing groin pain, that a further X-ray was
taken.  I do note that the patient is unable to distinguish between the pain
that
was getting worse at the age of 16, and the leg pains that she has had all
her life.  All she can say is that the severity got progressively
worse and
that was why she sought further help.</i>"
<P>

In his oral evidence, Dr Stalley said that the pain which Katherine said she
suffered over the years was grossly atypical of hip
pain.
<P>

56   	Dr Stephen undertook the operation expecting to give
Katherine two good hips which would last for many years.  However, Katherine's
complaints have been similar but worse.  She gave this evidence:
<P>

"<i>Q.	What about your hips and knees after walking, you told us earlier that
you were having problems.  What about the present time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Ten to fifteen minutes I start to feel pain in my hips and knees, and
then afterwards referred pain in my thighs and calves.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What about sitting, does that cause any problem?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yeah, I have to switch positions quite regularly, because I get
sore.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What kind of pain is it in the hip, can you describe it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is a burning pain.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is it on the surface?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In the socket.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Your back?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	My lower back, I get an aching pain in my lower back.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is there any particular time that you get it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	When I have been lifting, or I walk too far.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	At one time you had a limp, has that gone now?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It has - when I have walked for an extended period of time, it comes
back.  But normally I'm okay."</i>
<P>

57   	In his reports, Dr Stephen tended to ignore the problems
of which Katherine was complaining, presumably because he considered
that there
was no organic basis for them.  In his report of 19 February 1997, Dr Stephen
concluded:
<P>

"<i>Currently, Kate still gets some hip pain.  When I saw her in 1996 (in March
and subsequently on 2.12.96) she still had some hip pain
but the hips were well
covered and there was as yet no sign of any degenerative change in either
hip.</i>"
<P>

In his report of 10 May 1999, Dr Stephen said:
<P>

"<i>Currently Kate has low-grade pain in both hips, easily controlled by low
doses of analgesics, activity modification, and moderate
doses of
anti-inflammatories.  Her x-rays shows no deterioration since 1996.  There is
as yet no clear evidence of any degenerative
change.  That is, there is no
joint space narrowing.</i>"
<P>

58   	Dr Stalley pointed out that, in the pre and post operative
x-rays, the joint space and the articular cartilage of the hip
joint were
normal and symmetrical.  He said that there appeared to be some increased
sclerosis of the superolateral margin of both
acetabulae in the immediate
pre-operative x-rays in 1990 and that this was unchanged in subsequent films.
The lack of change in Katherine's
condition led him to query whether the
osteotomies may have been necessary.  He said that the osteotomies appeared to
have produced
no symptomatic improvement in her hips whatsoever and that
Katherine was still complaining of the sort of pain which she said she
had had
from the age of five.  In his oral evidence, Dr Stalley said:
<P>

"<i>Q.	What about when you saw her recently, at the end of 1998?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Her symptoms at that stage were bilateral groin pain, worse on the left
than the right with referred pain in both knees and ankles,
so once again we
have pain going all the way down the leg to the feet which is most unusual for
hip pain.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is there any organic basis for that pain resulting from the hip condition
as apparent to you after the operation was performed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would again be very perplexed that pain profile as coming from the hip.
If a patient complains of pain in a specific distribution
and you accept only
half that distribution i.e. the pain from the groin to the knees as being
significant and dismiss the rest of
the description of the pain, that is, to
me, invalid so I would find it very difficult to put an organic specific
diagnosis on the
description of the pain that I had seen when last seen in
1998.</i>"
<P>

59   	I conclude that there have been substantial functional or
psychosomatic elements in Katherine's condition both before and
after the
operations.  Her condition while at school centred on the growing pains and on
her physical discomfort which resulted from
her being overweight and sedentary
rather than upon any aspect of her hip dysplasia.  I accept as likely that
there would have been
some niggling symptomatology going back for up to twelve
months before Katherine saw Dr Stephen and there was, of course, the period
of
pain which she had for two or more weeks before seeing a doctor.
<P>

60   	After the operations, the organic symptomatology should
have been, at worst, as described by Dr Stephen, namely low-grade
pain in both
hips, controlled by low doses of analgesics, activity modification and moderate
doses of anti-inflammatories.  However,
her complaints, some of which are set
out in the evidence above, have been serious.  Dr M Baz, an occupational
physician, summarised
Katherine's complaints as follows:
<P>

"<i>She has continued problems including restricted mobility, pain in the hips,
and radiated pain in the knees and low back which she
feels is muscular.  There
has also been intermittent pain in both shoulders which is attributed to strain
while using crutches.</i>
<P>

<i>She described constant pain in both hips.  The pain in the knees is related
to activity.  There is always pain in low back.  Shoulder
region and back pain
is related to lifting and carrying.</i>
<P>

<i>She has limited walking and standing, estimating she is limited standing for
5 minutes.  After sitting she feels stiff and sore, so
she must keep changing
her position.  Walking is limited to about 500 meters at most, and even 200
meters causes pain.  She has more
problems on rough and uneven ground.</i>
<P>

<i>She avoids extended walking and also lifting or carrying which aggravates
back pain and also causes shoulder discomfort.  If she increases
her activity
level or walking she has increased pain over the next few days.</i>
<P>

<i>She estimates her pain level, at usually about 6.5 out of 10, where 10 is
the worst imaginable.  With exercise it is 8 to 9 out of
10, for example after
walking a long distance, or increased domestic activity.  At rest in bed it may
be less than 6.5.</i>"
<P>

61   	Although there is clearly a functional or psychosomatic
element in Katherine's condition, there are also two organic bases
for some of
her complaints.  One is that, for many years, starting perhaps even before the
first operation, Katherine has favoured
her left leg.  This has caused problems
with her gait and may have given rise to some pain in her back and in her
knees.  Another
is that Katherine has not exercised as she should have done.
Dr Laurent has recommended, as have other doctors, that Katherine undertake
an
appropriate exercise programme and that she improve the range of movement in
her hips and also improve her gait.  He has reported
that this should reduce
her pain and her requirement for analgesics.  He has reported that it is
important for Katherine to try to
keep her back and hip muscles as fit as
possible to support these joints.  At one time, she swam quite a lot and she
used an exercise
bike.  However, when Dr Laurent saw her in 1999, she had
reduced the amount of swimming and the use of the bike because of pain and
she
did not have a regular exercise programme.
<P>

62   	It is clear that Katherine's physical condition and her
psychological state each tend to worsen the other.  Her exercise tolerance
is
low, in part because of her psychological state.  As Dr Lampe has reported, her
experience of physical disability with its concurrent
limitations on her
physical capabilities causes her to feel different from others and this has had
an impact upon her personality
development and has contributed to a reduced
ability to cope with the stresses in life, which in turn has made her more
vulnerable
to becoming depressed.  Dr Lampe reported that exercise would be
likely to contribute to an improvement in mood and social function
and it would
provide a more appropriate means of weight control than dieting excessively and
erratically.
<P>

63   	Under the direction of Dr Lampe, Katherine has been
undergoing treatment for her social phobia and it is thought both by Katherine
and by Dr Lampe that there has been considerable improvement and that Katherine
is showing signs of recovery. Katherine is now working
voluntarily at WIRES for
half a day a week and is able to cope with that.  One of the factors which has
inhibited Katherine's recovery
has been the pain which she feels in her hips,
legs and back.  I have already given a sample of her evidence on this point.
It has
been retarding her recovery.  Katherine in her evidence said that she
felt she was improving in recent times, that the pain was less
and that she
could move more freely.  Dr Lampe thought that Katherine would be fit for
normal activities in about two years.
<P>

64   	Dr McMurdo said that when he examined Katherine on 7
October 1998, he saw a remarkable difference from the girl he saw in
1993.  He
said that, on the day of the examination, she did not appear to be clinically
depressed and there was no evidence of psychosis
nor cognitive impairment.  Dr
McMurdo reported:
<P>

"<i>On her presentation today, the plaintiff presented as quite optimistic
about her future and was not currently depressed but she is
continuing with
antidepressant therapy and psychiatric management.  She is continuing with
cognitive behaviour therapy to cope with
her anxiety and again was optimistic
that she will improve considerably and eventually hopes to develop a singing
career, but I cannot
see that being in the very near future.  She has certainly
been very depressed in the past on the notes I have read, and at this
point in
time she seems to be doing quite well.  The prognosis for depression and
anxiety when it has been so severe in a younger
person is generally not good.
This is regardless of other external factors, so that a long term prognosis is
not favourable but that
could have been the case had she not suffered the
aggravating factors of problems with her hips, or the sexual abuse."</i>
<P>

65   	Dr Lampe expressed a slightly more optimistic view.  She
said that it was unfortunately highly likely that Katherine will
suffer
episodes of depression in the future and that the odds are more than 50 per
cent that she will have another episode.  However,
Dr Lampe said that in
Katherine's case there was a good understanding of treatments that work
effectively for her.  Dr Lampe hoped
that she could limit the time during which
Katherine suffered depression during episodes in the future.
<P>

66   	Dr Parmegiani was the most optimistic, taking the view
that Katherine's psychiatric symptoms had improved considerably over
the past
ten months.  He said that he expected her mental state would continue to
improve and that she would need to be under the
care of a psychiatrist for
another 12-18 months. Thereafter, she would need to continue taking
antidepressant medication, probably
on an indefinite basis.
<P>

67   	I accept the descriptions given by Dr Lampe and Dr McMurdo
and there is probably little between them.  They consider that
Katherine is
doing well and that within another two years she will be functioning with
reasonable normality.  They consider that
there will always be severe
limitations upon what Katherine can do. They are of the view that Katherine
will suffer episodes of depression
in the future.  I accept Dr McMurdo's
comment that, having regard to the severity of the illness from which Katherine
has suffered,
she is likely to suffer severe episodes in the future.  However,
I also accept Dr Lampe's view that Katherine has arrived at a good
understanding of the treatments that work effectively for her and that she
should be able to limit the impact of future episodes.
<P>

68   	With respect to Katherine's future, Dr Baz has expressed
the view that, with further management of her pain and psychiatric
condition,
Katherine may be able to undertake further studies which could enable her to
undertake office and administrative tasks
or possibly some limited occupation
associated with music, such as private teaching.  I think that this prognosis
accords with the
view of Dr Lampe.  Katherine will not be able to undertake a
career as an opera singer, however, she may well make use of her voice
in a
lighter musical field as she has an interest in that area.  Or she may
undertake some entirely different employment. She is
a good looking young woman
and should be able to obtain employment.
<P>

69   	Katherine's hips are not yet showing signs of
osteoarthritis but Dr Stephen thought that it was likely that, in about twenty
years, at least the left hip would need to be replaced.  Dr Stalley also
referred to the possibility of the development of osteoarthritis
and the need
for further surgery.  It is probable that, at some stage, both hips will need
to be replaced.
<P>

70   	It is unlikely that Katherine will be able to achieve the
same success that she might have, had she not had the very severe
breakdown.
However, as I have already mentioned, Dr Lampe considers that, whether or not
she had had problems with her hip, Katherine
would have suffered a psychiatric
illness.  Dr McMurdo thought she would have developed some difficulty
psychologically.  I am satisfied
that this would have limited the opportunities
available to her and that she would not have withstood the discipline and
strain involved
in becoming an opera singer.
<P>

71   	I assess the general damages at $120,000, which takes into
account the pain and discomfort Katherine has suffered, the past
and future
disruption to her life and the depression, anxiety and social phobia which she
has suffered and will again suffer episodically
in the future.  As I have
already said, she has undergone a terrible time in the past decade.  I
attribute three quarters of that
sum to the past.
<P>

72   	Interest at the rate of 2 per cent per annum should be
added in accordance with the principles discussed in <b><i>M.B.P. (S.A.) Pty
Limited v Gogic</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 657.</a> The calculation is:  $90,000 x 2% x
9 = $16,200.
<P>

73   	Counsel for Katherine has calculated past economic loss as
at 10 June 1999 at $75,766, using the net wage for a chorister
level 1 and
assuming that Katherine would have studied for three years.  Brought up to date
the figure is $79,214.  I am content
to accept those figures.  The result is
appropriate whether one looks at the matter on the hypothetical basis that,
without her hip
problems, Katherine would have successfully completed her
singing studies and would have commenced an operatic career or on the basis
that Katherine would in any event have had a depressive illness of some
severity and that her earning capacity would have been affected
thereby.  The
figures adopted are appropriate for a female commencing work.  If one assumes
that Katherine would have had a significant
depressive episode, even had she
not had the hip injury, that episode would not have been as severe as the
episode she has undergone,
but she may well have missed some years'
employment.
<P>

74   	Adopting an average rate of interest over the period of
earning of 10 per cent, the calculation will be:  $79,214 x 5% x 2.5
years =
$9,902.
<P>

<u>75   	</u>Counsel for Katherine has calculated future
economic loss as follows:
<P>

<u>Future Loss</u>
<P>

Loss of earning capacity to age 65 - plaintiff's age as at 10 June 1999 - 25
years 15 weeks.
<P>

Assume the plaintiff would work as a singer/chorister level 8 to 65 years of
age, equalling a future working life of 39 years and
37 weeks.
<P>

To 65 years of age, 2065 weeks @ $550.00 per week = $1,135,750.00.
<P>

Present value of future loss at 3 per cent per annum discount and rounding down
to 39 years, $550.00 net per week x 1207.9:	$664,345.00
<P>

	Less 15% for contingencies	<u>  99,651.00</u>
<P>

	Total of future loss of income	$564,694.00
<P>

This calculation assumes, however, that, but for her hip problems, Katherine
would have been in constant employment in the field
of opera to age sixty-five
and also that she will not be able to engage in remunerative employment.  I
would not put that prospect
at more than 10 per cent.
<P>

76   	Another way of looking at the matter is that it will be
some years yet before Katherine is able to return to a normal life
and, even
then, she may have to take training in some field to qualify for whatever form
of earning she chooses to pursue.  Then
there were two additional factors.  One
is that she is likely in the future to have bouts of depression which will
interfere with
her income earning. These will not be as severe as her past
depression has been, but they are likely to be significant.  Some period
of
time must be allowed for that.  Moreover, her ability to earn income is likely
to be reduced because, in the future, she will
be unlikely to show the
confidence that she would have displayed had she not had the psychiatric
illness over the past decade and
had she entered the workforce a good deal
younger than she will now be able to do.  These factors suggest that we should
take into
account at least five years loss of employment in the future and also
an overall reduced ability to earn income.  The calculation
would be:
<P>

Five years loss of income at $480 per week 
<P>

discounted at 3%	$116,640
<P>

Reduction in income 34.6 years  x $100 per week	
<P>

discounted at 3%	$113,000
<P>

Less 15% for contingencies	$195,194
<P>

I consider that these figures adequately replace the reduction in Katherine's
future earning capacity.
<P>

77   	Past out-of-pockets have been agreed at $252,149.00.
Interest thereon may be calculated as follows:  $252,149 x 7% x 10 =
$176,504.
<P>

78   	No figure has been given to me for future out-of-pockets
but taking account of Katherine's present need for psychiatric and
other
assistance, particularly in the field of rehabilitation exercise and podiatry,
the likely need for hip replacements in the
future and the need for substantial
psychiatric treatment from time to time in the future, I think I should allow a
further sum of
$50,000 which I discount over seven years using the 3 per cent
tables.  The result is $40,655.
<P>

79   	No <b><i>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</i></b><i> </i>claim has
been made.
<P>

80   	The summary of damages is as follows:
<P>

General damages	$120,000
<P>

Interest on general damages	$  16,200
<P>

Past economic loss	$  79,214
<P>

Interest on past economic loss	$    9,902
<P>

Future economic loss	$195,194
<P>

Past out-of-pocket expenses	$252,149
<P>

Interest on past out-of-pocket expenses	$176,504
<P>

Future out-of-pocket expenses	<u>$  40,655</u>
<P>

Total	$889,818
<P>

81   	I am of the view that the total sum arrived at by the
addition of these elements would amount to fair compensation had it
been
established that Dr Ahluwahlia's negligence resulted in the problems I have
described.
<P>

82   	Having regard to my view that the chance that Katherine's
hips would have fully recovered had Dr Ahluwahlia sent her to a
specialist or
advised her mother to bring her back in six months time is only 50%, the total
damages must be reduced by one-half.
<P>

83   	There will be judgment against the defendant in the sum of
$444,909.
<P>

84   	Costs are reserved.
