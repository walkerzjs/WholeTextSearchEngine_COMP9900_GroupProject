<P>

<b>Judgment (Defendant's Notice of Motion for further discovery)</b>
<P>

1   	By Notice of Motion dated 18 October 1999 the defendant
moves the Court for an order that the plaintiff provide further and
better
discovery of documents in what is described as "<i>the categories set out in
the schedule to this Notice of Motion</i>".  Appended to these reasons is that
schedule of 35 classes of documents.
<P>

2   	The application arises, <i>inter alia</i>, from the
following:  what is said to be the inadequacy of the discovery given by the
plaintiff in each action in November 1986;
 the judgment I delivered in 23 June
1999 granting leave to the defendant to amend its case on justification (NSWSC
619:  DLJT:44)
and particularly the failure of the plaintiff to comply with
consent orders made on 13 August this year which required both parties
to give
further discovery of documents by 10 September.  
<P>

3   	The plaintiff has failed to comply with that consent
order.
<P>

4   	Discovery is governed by the <i>"old</i>" Part 23 of the
Rules.
<P>

5   	An affidavit by Ian Robert Angus, solicitor for the
defendant, was sworn on 18 October 1999.  Exhibited to it is a folder
containing
27 documents (Exhibit 2 on this application).  A second affidavit
sworn 25 October 1999 has exhibited to it two bundles of documents
(Exhibits 3
and 4) produced by the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority of New South Wales in
response to subpoenas issued by the defendant
on 1 February 1999 and 20 July
1999.
<P>

6   	Other "<i>source</i>" material for the purposes of
determining the application is constituted by the Amended Second Consolidated
Particulars of Truth
which have been delivered and the Further Amended Defences
filed on 26 October 1999.  Additionally, I have been provided with a folder
of
witness statements directed to be served by the defendant on the plaintiff.
<P>

7   	From this material there was generated a useful compendium
of the evidentiary basis for each of the categories.  It is argued
for the
defendant that an analysis of the material referred to in this document
discloses that there is evidence pointing to the
existence of the relevant
categories of documents. 
<P>

8   	Appendix 2 is made up of three pages of a "<i>Discovery
Schedule</i>" which is a more focused analysis of evidence said to point to the
existence of material in relation to motor vehicles, the plaintiff's
house and
photographs.
<P>

9   	Exhibit 1 in the defendant's application is a bundle of
correspondence passing between the defendant's solicitors and the plaintiff's
solicitors and the plaintiff himself.  In several letters, 26 August 1999 and 6
September 1999, the plaintiff candidly presents his
position in relation to the
various categories of documents now set out in the Schedule to the Notice of
Motion.  He refers to the
existence or non-existence of documents, claims
privilege and asserts that in respect to any document that he might have its
proposed
use will be for cross-examination.  
<P>

10   	The essence of this application is that the plaintiff be
ordered to give discovery:  that is, to deliver a list of documents
in
accordance with the "<i>old</i>" Part 23.  In this context I am not concerned
with the validity of any claim for privilege the plaintiff might make or the
availability
of any claim akin to that determined by me in the "<i>Corrs
subpoena</i>" judgment delivered in these proceedings on 7 May 1999 (NSWSC 428:
DLJT: 39).  The real issue is the "<i>ambit</i>" of the asserted
"<i>requirements"</i> of the defendant to be imposed upon the plaintiff as to
the 35 categories of documents.  This "<i>ambit</i>" has given rise to
complaints on the part of the plaintiff akin to oppression, fishing and the
like.  The "<i>relevance</i>" of some of the material is asserted to be
non-existent at worst, or doubtful at best.  The ultimate use of any material
of which
discovery is given and in respect of which no claim for privilege can
be maintained will be a matter that arises upon its deployment
and tender.  I
cannot hypothesise, as I was invited to do by the defendant, as to a series of
steps that may be taken in the course
of evidence given by a particular witness
that may give rise to the use of a document in some way (as corroborative
material, for
example). I am not concerned with any question of inspection at
this stage.
<P>

11   	What is available to me are the powers provided in SCR Pt
23 r 3 and the general power under Pt 26 r 1 (cf.  <b><i>Kimberley Mineral
Holdings Limited (In Liq) &amp; Anor v McKewan </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%201%20NSWLR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 1 NSWLR 210).</a>
<P>

12   	Nor am I concerned with any forensic advantage the
defendant might wish to take of the fact that the plaintiff verifies the
List.
Nor am I concerned with questions of bare utility in the sense advanced for the
defendant that it would be useful to have a
numerated and particularised list
of documents to obviate confusion.  It certainly would be of utility to have
such a document, but
that will not be determinative of the nature and extent of
the obligation in the plaintiff to give discovery particularly in the
light of
the proximity of the trial on the one hand but not ignoring, on the other, the
plaintiff's default in compliance with the
consent order referred to above.
<P>

13   	It thus seems to me to be appropriate to resolve the
matters in contention by reference to the 35 categories in the Schedule
to the
Notice of Motion.
<P>

14   	In dealing with the following categories I will indicate
pursuant to SCR Pt 23 r 3 the nature of any limitations I direct
to apply to
the List of Documents.
<P>

15   	<b>Category 1 (motor vehicles):</b>  the Discovery
Schedule appended hereto in relation to paragraph 1 represents a more focused
"<i>requirement"</i> of the defendant in relation to the five D persons
referred to.  It is not however perfect.  In relation to D16 there is no
paragraph
26 in the particulars and in relation to D17 there is no paragraph
13.  In relation to D15 in paragraph 7(16) of the particulars
there is a
reference to a Mercedes Benz motor vehicle.  In respect of D16 there is in
paragraph 8(13), (14a) and (19) a reference
to a "<i>car</i>".  With respect to
D17 paragraph 9(6) refers to a chauffeur driven car, paragraph 9(7) does not
refer to a motor vehicle at all.
 The end of paragraph 9(11) refers to the
complainant's being driven by a driver.  In relation to D19 paragraph 11(3)
there is reference
to the plaintiff being observed "<i>driving past the
wall</i>".  In relation to D24 the relevant paragraph of the particulars is 16
(not 18) and paragraph (3) refers to a car and a driver; similarly
paragraph
(4) and (10) refers to the plaintiff arranging for someone to <i>"drive"
</i>D24 back to Campbelltown.
<P>

16   	The relevant years appear to be 1973, 1974, 1985, 1986,
1987, 1989 and 1990.  Whilst Exhibits 3 and 4 on the application (material
from
the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority) discloses to the defendant at least a great
deal of material in relation to ownership and
registration of motor vehicles,
the plaintiff's obligation to discover will be limited to D15, D16, D17, D19
and D24 in respect of
the years allocated to each in the Discovery Schedule.
<P>

17   	A further limitation will relate to the ownership by the
plaintiff, by the plaintiff's company or to any vehicle used by him
in his
capacity as an officer of the Law Society during any relevant year.  The
"<i>use</i>" of any other motor vehicle during the period 1970 to 1990 as a
requirement for discovery is undue.
<P>

18   	These documents are to be listed as classes of documents
in relation to the respective D persons and the respective years.
 
<P>

19   	<b>Category 2 (the plaintiff's house):</b>  the second
Discovery Schedule in relation to paragraph 2 indicates the following relevant
years:  1970, 1976 to 1979, 1984, 1985,
1986 and 1990.
<P>

20   	The relevant consideration appears to be the
configuration, layout and furnishing of the plaintiff's house in relation to
the specified D persons in the specified periods.  
<P>

21   	The plaintiff is to give discovery by reference to classes
of documents allocated to each of the D persons for each of the
relevant years
in respect of items 2(b), (c), (d) and (e) in the Schedule to the Notice of
Motion. 
<P>

22   	<b>Category 3 (photographs of the plaintiff):</b>  this is
perhaps the most controversial of the defendant's "<i>requirements</i>".
Relevance is to some extent acknowledged in the plaintiff's letter of 26 August
1999 (part of Exhibit 1), paragraph 3.  The plaintiff's
concerns otherwise
expressed as to the onerous nature of the defendant's <i>"requirement</i>" and
the intrusion into privacy and similar considerations are, in my view, well
founded.  It does appear that it has to be acknowledged
however that
"<i>identification" </i>will be an issue.  This is clear from Mr Marsden's
letter just referred to.
<P>

23   	Accordingly, the plaintiff is to include in the List of
Documents, by reference to the periods allocated to each of the D
persons only,
photographs (but not photograph albums) of himself and as classes of
documents.
<P>

24   	As is the case in relation to all categories the plaintiff
in compiling the List of Documents is free to claim any privilege
that he
considers appropriate.
<P>

25   	<b>Category 4 (photographs of motor vehicles):</b>
discovery of classes of documents should be given by reference to the D persons
and periods referred to in category 1 and limited
to the motor vehicles therein
referred to but excluding any motor vehicle described as a motor vehicle
"<i>used</i>".  
<P>

26   	<b>Category 5 (D15 and D16 employment records):
</b>discovery by way of classes of documents in respect of each of these D
persons should be given regarding employment by the plaintiff
of each of them.
The limitation is in respect of the D persons and the periods of time relating
to each such D person as set out
in the Consolidated Particulars.
<P>

27   	<b>Category 6 (business cards):</b>  this is another
"<i>undue</i>" requirement by the defendant.  It appears from the Consolidated
Particulars of Truth (paragraph 7(10) in relation to D15) that there
is one
reference to a business card and that is in 1980.  Mr Marsden deals with the
defendant's "<i>requirement</i>" in his letter of 26 August 1999 (part of
Exhibit 1).
<P>

28   	The plaintiff is required to give discovery in relation to
any business card or cards for the year 1980 only.
<P>

29   	<b>Category 7 (plaintiff's mobile telephone numbers):</b>
I disagree with the defendant's contention that Mr Marsden's letter of 26
August dealing with mobile telephone numbers (paragraph
7, page 4) implies that
he has documents in that very broad category constituting the defendant's
"<i>requirement</i>".  The focus of relevance is D16 as set out in paragraph
8(18) and (19) of the Consolidated Particulars.
<P>

30   	The plaintiff is required to include in the List of
Documents by reference to a class of documents the records called for
in
paragraph 7 of the Schedule to the Notice of Motion.
<P>

31   	<b>Category 8 (Brett Whiteley pictures):</b>  it seems
clear on the correspondence that there is no issue that the plaintiff has two
Brett Whiteley pictures.  The relevance is
clear from the particulars.  I am
not persuaded that the plaintiff is required to give discovery of anything
other than the two Brett
Whiteley pictures and documents relating to their
purchase.  
<P>

32   	By "<i>give discovery</i>" it is to be stressed that the
requirement in the plaintiff is to do no more than comply with the <i>"old</i>"
Part 23.
<P>

33   	<b>Category 9 (Regent Hotel - records of stays):</b>  the
plaintiff should give discovery as classes of documents the material referred
to in paragraph 9 of the Schedule of the Notice
of Motion.
<P>

34   	<b>Category 10 (Regent Hotel - Law Society):</b>  as for
category 9.
<P>

35   	<b>Category 11 (remuneration/benefits received by
plaintiff):</b>  with respect to any vehicle provided by the Law Society this
should be covered by discovery in relation to category 1 above.  Otherwise
the
position of the defendant is really embarrassing particularly in the light of
the legitimate remarks made by Mr Marsden in his
letter of 26 August 1999
(paragraph 12).  Once the defendant had to embark upon a process of elimination
of material from this category
its vulnerability was clearly exposed.
<P>

36   	The plaintiff is not required to give discovery (save for
the exception in relation to Law Society motor vehicles under category
1) of
material referred to in paragraph 11 of the Schedule to the Notice of
Motion.
<P>

37   	<b>Category 12 (contact records with D persons):</b>  the
plaintiff is required to give discovery of the material in paragraph 12 of the
Schedule to the Notice of Motion by reference
to classes of documents.  
<P>

38   	<b>Category 13 (records of contact between the plaintiff
and named persons concerning D persons):</b>  the plaintiff is required to give
discovery in the same way as was directed in relation to category 12.
<P>

39   	<b>Category 14:</b>  the plaintiff is to give discovery as
per categories 12 and 13.
<P>

40   	<b>Category 15 (the statutory declaration):</b>  The
plaintiff is to give discovery thereof.
<P>

41   	<b>Category 16:</b>  the generality of the defendant's
<i>"requirement</i>" in this regard is such that I am unable to focus it in any
way in relation to the exposed issues.
<P>

42   	The plaintiff is not required to give discovery of the
material referred to in paragraph 16 of the Schedule to the defendant's
Notice
of Motion.
<P>

43   	<b>Category 17 (photographs of the plaintiff in the
company of the D persons):</b>  the plaintiff is required to give discovery
(that is, to list the documents) of the material referred to in paragraph 17 of
the
Schedule to the Notice of Motion. 
<P>

44   	<b>Categories 18, 19, 20 and 21</b>:  the fact that this
material might have been the subject of earlier applications, successful or
otherwise, does not preclude, in
my view, the obligation on the plaintiff to
give discovery of this material.
<P>

45   	The plaintiff therefore is required to give discovery, by
reference to classes of documents, of the material referred to in
paragraphs
18, 19, 20 and 21 of the defendant's Notice of Motion.
<P>

46   	<b>Category 22 (statement by the Law Society):</b>  in a
letter dated 26 August 1999 the plaintiff states that he has obtained
statements from the Law Society ("<i>which you can subpoena"</i>) which show
that the Law Society did not pay for any Regent Hotel expenses in respect of
the subject period.  
<P>

47   	The plaintiff is required to give discovery of these
documents.
<P>

48   	<b>Category 23 (statutory declarations):</b>  again,
irrespective of any claim for privilege hitherto successful in relation to any
one or more of these statutory declarations,
the plaintiff is nonetheless
required to give discovery of them:  paragraph 23 of the Schedule to the Notice
of Motion conveniently,
for the plaintiff, sets out the particular documents
which are to be listed and he should so list them.
<P>

49   	Again, if it has to be stressed, I am only concerned with
the defendant's Notice of Motion for the discovery of the documents
in the
Schedule and the plaintiff is concerned only with compliance with the old SCR
Pt 23 in accordance with these directions. 
It is open to the plaintiff in
accordance with that rule to state or re-state any claim for privilege or other
matter that may in
due course affect questions of inspection, Notices to
Produce and the tendering of material in evidence. 
<P>

50   	<b>Categories 24, 25, 26 and 27:</b>  These individual
documents should be listed by the plaintiff in the affidavit of discovery.
<P>

51   	<b>Category 28 (records relating to instructions received
by Marsdens):</b>  in relation to these documents there would appear to
available claims privilege.  But that will be a matter later to be
determined.
<P>

52   	The plaintiff is required to give discovery of the
material referred to in paragraph 28 of the Schedule to the Notice of Motion
by
reference to classes of documents.
<P>

53   	<b>Category 29 (diaries of plaintiff 1975-1984):</b>  the
defendant refers to an affidavit of Jarrod Bruce Lovely sworn 9 October 1998
which appears itself to be an annexure to a statutory
declaration of the
plaintiff sworn in November 1998 and a statement by Mr Barker Q.C. on 11
February 1999 to the effect that the
plaintiff has no diaries to produce.  Mr
Lovely's affidavit, which is behind tab 12 of Exhibit 2, relates to searches
conducted by
him and another person of telephone message books from 1986 to
1990 of the firm of Marsden's and the message books for the plaintiff
1986,
1989 and 1990, and 1987-1988.  The message books are described as taking the
form of "<i>Collins-type diaries</i>".  The relevant focus appears from
category 31 to be an asserted record of a message from D16 on 13 May 1986.
<P>

54   	It is impossible to reconcile the "<i>requirement"</i> of
the defendant in paragraph 29 of the Schedule to the Notice of Motion with the
basis (Mr Lovely's affidavit) relied upon.
<P>

55   	The plaintiff will be required to give discovery of the
telephone message books of the period 1986-1999 of the firm Marsden's
as is
referred to in paragraph 2 of the affidavit of Mr Lovely and of the telephone
message books referred to in paragraph 3 the
years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 and
1990 of the plaintiff. 
<P>

56   	<b>Category 30 (diaries of Marsden's the attorneys
1975-1984):</b>  the defendant has failed to persuade me of any principled
basis for this wide-ranging <i>"requirement</i>" in respect of the diaries of a
firm of solicitors for nine years.
<P>

57   	The plaintiff is not required to give discovery of the
material referred to in paragraph 30 of the Schedule to the defendant's
Notice
of Motion.
<P>

58   	The requirements referred to in relation to category 29
above and category 31 below appear to me to be sufficient.
<P>

59   	<b>Category 31 (telephone message book for the plaintiff
in respect of the period "<i>1970 to date")</i>:</b>  it is the defendant's
"<i>requirement</i>" that the plaintiff give discovery of his message books for
a period of 29 years.  The plaintiff is not required to give discovery
of the
documents referred to in paragraph 31 of the Schedule to the Notice of Motion
otherwise than in compliance with the direction
given in relation to category
29.  It is to be noted that discovery is to be given of the telephone message
books by reference to
year and not by reference to classes of documents.
<P>

60   	<b>Category 32 (documents re loan to D15):</b>  the
plaintiff is required to give discovery by reference to class of documents of
the material referred to in paragraph 32 of the
Schedule to the Notice of
Motion.
<P>

61   	<b>Categories 33, 34 and 35:</b>  the plaintiff is
required to give discovery of the documents referred to in paragraphs 33, 34
and 35 by reference to classes of
documents.
<P>

62   	In making these directions I have borne in mind
particularly the desirability of minimising activities that would otherwise
be
capable of interfering the preparation for and conduct of the trial of this
case, not ignoring however the plaintiff's default
which triggered the
correspondence and the filing of the Notice of Motion.  The trial is listed to
re-commence on 15 November 1999.
<P>

63   	It was submitted that I should change the views expressed
in my ruling on the Corrs subpoena (7 May 1999 - NSWSC 428:  DLJT:
39).  The
present application provides no basis for my so doing nor for my considering so
to do.  It is clear that the defendant
consequent upon the grant of leave to
amend its case on justification has gone through just about every document that
the plaintiff
has deployed in the course of a multiplicity of interlocutory
applications and indeed, a lot of material that the defendant has subpoenaed,
to embark upon this exercise of seeking wide-ranging discovery.  Save for that
which is reflected in the directions that I have given
in the Schedule to the
Notice of Motion, I have not otherwise been persuaded that either as a matter
of principle, let alone as a
matter of efficient trial management that the
defendant's "<i>requirements</i>" should be unreservedly met.
<P>

64   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The plaintiff is, by 5pm on Wednesday 17 November 1999, to deliver to the
defendant a Verified List of Documents pursuant to
SCR Pt 23 in accordance with
these reasons.
