<b><u>2040/95 UNA EVELYN ARCHER v  TREVOR ROBERT ARCHER</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Issue</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, Una Evelyn Archer, (Mrs. Archer) originally
sought an order that a transfer by her to her son Trevor of a one
half interest
in a property known as 'Sussex' near Cudal be set aside on the ground of undue
influence.  That property has been sold
and she now seeks an order that a sum
of money, being one third of the proceeds of sale of 'Sussex', being the same
as two thirds
of a one half interest, be paid to her on the grounds of the
transfer of the two thirds of her one half share was obtained by undue
influence or through unconscionable conduct of Trevor.  The question is whether
or not she is entitled to relief.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	This is a very sad case.  The original claim was brought by
Mrs. Archer and her husband, Ernest Robert Archer (Mr Archer) against
their son
Trevor, both claiming that the transfer by them of 'Sussex' to Trevor was
procured by undue influence.
<P>

3   	Those proceedings were heard over 11 days in 1995 before
Simos J when the claim of Mr. Archer was dismissed but the claim of
Mrs. Archer
was upheld in part and a declaration made that the transfer by her to Trevor of
her one half interest in the property
'Sussex' was as to two thirds of that one
half procured by the undue influence of Trevor.  Other orders were made which
are not relevant
at the present time.  Mr. Trevor Archer appealed to the Court
of Appeal against the finding of undue influence.  That appeal was
heard by the
Court of Appeal on 18 August 1998 and its judgment was delivered on 23 February
1999.  The Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal and set aside the orders made by
Simos J, upholding part of Mrs. Archer's claim and ordered that there be a new
trial of her
claims.
<P>

4   	The new trial was heard before me on 10, 11 and 12 May
1999.  As Mr. Archer had not filed any appeal against the decision of
Simos J
that he claimed that the transfer of his one half share of 'Sussex' had been
obtained by undue influence, the new trial before
me was only of the claim of
Mrs. Archer, and only in respect of the fund representing two thirds of her
notional one half interest
in the property, namely one third of the proceeds of
sale of that property, that amount being agreed and held in a trust account
in
the names of the solicitors for the parties.  However, as I will explain the
action was founded not only on undue influence, but
on unconscionable conduct
as well.
<P>

5   	The new trial before me proceeded quite quickly as a result
of certain procedural directions or orders made by Bryson J that
the evidence
in the original trial be evidence in the new trial and that cross-examination
of witnesses be limited in time and directed
towards the major matters of
contention.  In view of the very substantial amounts which would have been and
have been incurred for
costs in this action in comparison to the amount
involved it seems to me those orders were very effective, and counsel on both
sides
should be congratulated on their efficient handling of the new trial in
the bounds of those procedural directions.  It is proper
to say that while some
comments were made about the directions by Mr. Coles QC and the use I could
make of the material he made no
application for their variation and the hearing
proceeded on the basis they were in place.  It is of course obvious that a lot
of
the material is irrelevant to the trial before me, particularly insofar as
it related to a claim about a house and the partnership.
 I have had no regard
to that irrelevant material.  I have received a further communication from Mr.
Coles about this, which I have
disregarded.
<P>

<b><u>Uncontested facts</u></b>
<P>

6   	Mr. Archer was born in 1919 and his wife in 1920.  At about
the time the events under consideration in this action occurred
they were aged
about 70 and 69 respectively.  They were married in 1946.  They have three
children, Colin born in 1949, Trevor born
in 1952 and Neville born in 1956.
Mr. Archer purchased a property known as "'Glenroy'" near Cudal in 1948.  He
and his wife conducted
a farming enterprise on that property, Trevor became a
partner in 1978 and Neville a partner in 1980, Neville withdrawing from the
partnership in 1987.  Another property in the Cudal area known as "'Sussex'"
had been owned by Mrs. Archer's father.  That property
was purchased by Mr. and
Mrs. Archer in 1979 from the estate, they buying out Mrs. Archer's sisters.
The purchase moneys were provided
at least in part by loans from the Rural
Assistance Board of $30 000, from the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney
Limited for $27
000 and from the four sisters of Mrs. Archer for $40 000.  All
these loans were secured by mortgage over 'Sussex'.  It had been originally
intended that 'Sussex' would be purchased in the names of Mr. and Mrs. Archer
and Trevor, but that was not possible due to the conditions
under which Rural
Assistance Board loans were available, thus Trevor did not become a purchaser
although he was a guarantor of the
liability of his parents under the Rural
Assistance Board mortgage.
<P>

7   	Trevor married his wife Sue Archer in 1982 and they lived
in a cottage on 'Sussex' and for a time Neville lived there as well.
 After
Neville withdrew from the partnership a new partnership was formed in which Mr.
and Mrs. Archer had a one half share and Trevor
a one half share.  This
occurred in March 1989.
<P>

8   	Trevor continued to work on the two properties and from
time to time was engaged in additional employment with a security company
at
Orange.  Both he and his wife were concerned about their future security at
'Sussex'.  Trevor discussed this with his father at
various times, particularly
during 1989 and I will come back to these matters later for determination.  
<P>

9   	Mr. and Mrs. Archer had both made wills on 1 March 1989
which were in effect mirror wills under which they each gave their
estate to
the other, provided that other survived, but if that did not happen then
'Sussex' was given to Trevor and the residue of
the estate was given to the
three sons equally, except that the share of Colin was charged with payment of
certain legacies.  Trevor
said he was given a copy of those wills by his mother
and I will come back to that later because Mr. and Mrs. Archer denied that
they
had given copies to him.  In September 1989 the mortgage loan to the sisters of
Mrs. Archer was repaid and the Rural Assistance
Board mortgage was discharged,
moneys being advanced by the State Bank of New South Wales.  The Rural
Assistance Board mortgage was
over both 'Sussex' and 'Glenroy', but the State
Bank substituted loan was secured only on 'Glenroy'.  
<P>

10   	On 21 September 1989 Trevor consulted Mr. Cheney of
Messrs. Cheney and Wilson solicitors of Orange, doing this he says as
a result
of a conversation with his father who told him, so Trevor said, to find out how
much it would cost to transfer 'Sussex'
into his name.  
<P>

11   	After the visit to Messrs. Cheney and Wilson, Mr. Cheney
wrote to Trevor setting out the desirability of having a transfer
to himself
effected during the lifetime of his parents and as quickly as possible.  There
is then some dispute about what happened,
Trevor saying that there were
discussions when it was agreed that the transfer would go ahead but to him
alone and the parents denying
that.  
<P>

12   	On 16 October Trevor and his wife saw Mr. Cheney and told
him Mr. and Mrs. Archer had agreed to transfer 'Sussex' to Trevor,
but not to
Sue.  As a result of this Mr. Cheney prepared the necessary documents.  Mr.
Archer suffered a heart attack on 6 November
1989 and was in hospital in Orange
for a time, being discharged on 17 November 1989 with arrangements that he
would consult his general
practitioner, Dr. Winkworth within a week and then
see his specialist treating doctor shortly thereafter.
<P>

13   	On either 24 November 1989 or 1 December 1989 Mr. and Mrs.
Archer were driven by Trevor and his wife to the office of Messrs.
Cheney and
Wilson where they signed a contract for the sale of 'Sussex' to Trevor together
with a transfer of that property and an
authority directed to the State Bank to
send the title deeds to Cheney and Wilson.  Mr. Cheney and Trevor say that this
took place
on 24 November 1989.  Mrs Archer says it took place on 1 December.
Mr. Archer really does not know.  In evidence before me he said
he saw Dr.
Shannon on the critical day, but later he seemed to concede that it must have
happened on 24 November.  After the documents
were signed in the office of Mr.
Cheney, Mr. Archer was taken to a medical appointment, either with Dr. Ridge
who is Dr. Winkworth's
partner or Dr. Shannon.  
<P>

14   	The consideration shown in the agreement for sale was
$436,500.  I will come back to this.  Mr. Cheney said that was his method
of
dealing with what he described as "inter-generational transfers of rural
property" in 1989 although it was never intended that
any money should be paid.
It is not the case of Mrs. Archer that any moneys were to be paid.  On 5
December 1989 Mr. Cheney gave
instructions to Messrs. Toner Savage &amp; Co.,
to prepare a valuation; wrote to the National Australia Bank asking it to
discharge
what was the old Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited
mortgage; and to the State Bank at Canowindra for the deeds and a discharge
of
the mortgage which had previously existed to that bank to secure the Rural
Assistance Board debt.  There was an error about the
banks but that does not
matter.
<P>

15   	By some lucky co-incidence which is likely to have been
pre-arranged, the valuation came in at the purchase price stated in
the
contract and after the National Australia Bank received an authority signed by
Mr. and Mrs. Archer for the handing over of the
title deeds, Mr. Cheney
completed the contract and transfer by dating the contract 20 March and the
transfer 9 April, and arranged
for the discharges and the transfer to be
registered.
<P>

16   	In the meantime, according to Mrs. Archer, she wrote a
note on the date of signing these documents which is dated in two places
1
December 1989 in which she expressed her dismay at what she had done.  She said
that she had destroyed the original of this but
had made a fair copy of it
later on.  Unfortunately the original of that fair copy, which is exhibit 18 in
the proceedings, is somehow
missing from the court papers, but that does not
matter for this decision as it is reproduced in the appeal books which were
used
for the purposes of the re-hearing before me.
<P>

17   	During December 1989 there seem to have been the usual
family activities including a birthday party for Mr. Archer and a family
Christmas at 'Glenroy' when there was no complaint about anything that had been
done, but no mention of it either.
<P>

18   	On 2 March 1990, Mr. and Mrs. Archer signed an authority
to the National Bank of Australia at Orange authorising it to send
the title
deeds to 'Sussex' to Cheney and Wilson.  This was the day or day after Mr.
Archer returned home from a period in hospital
in Sydney.
<P>

19   	On 12 September 1990, Mr. and Mrs. Archer made new wills.
They each appointed the other and Trevor as executors and gave the
whole of
their estate to the other.  In the event that the spouse did not survive then
each will gave a one half share in the estate
to Colin, once again charged with
payment of certain legacies and a one half share to Neville.  There were some
other provisions
which do not matter.  Each will contained the following
clause:
<P>

8.	<u>I DECLARE</u> that I have made no provision for my son Trevor Robert
Archer as I have provided adequately for him during my lifetime.
<P>

20   	Things seemed to proceed along reasonably well during
1991, Trevor and his wife conducting some independent activities on
'Sussex',
but generally so far as one can tell still using the land for partnership
activities.  Some time, probably in April 1992,
Mrs Archer obtained a copy of
the contract of sale from Mr. Cheney  as a result of a discussion with one of
her sons, who had been
told by Trevor that 'Sussex' was his.
<P>

21   	On 10 December 1992 Messrs. Timmins &amp; Partners, who
have remained the solicitors for Mrs. Archer, wrote to Messrs. Cheney
and
Wilson, stating that they acted for Neville and Mr. and Mrs. Archer and seeking
further information to which Mr. Cheney responded
on 22 December 1992, but his
letter was quite inaccurate as to dates.  The next day he wrote to Trevor with
a copy of the letter
from Timmins &amp; Partners and his response and stated
that he would not be able to act further.  On 4 January Trevor wrote to Mr.
Cheney acknowledging the letter and asking for a copy of the agreement or the
transfer payment "which released 'Sussex' to me that
Mr. and Mrs. E.R. Archer
signed on the day of <u>24 November 1998</u> at 12.30 p.m. in your office".
The last two figures in the date were obviously transposed and it has not been
suggested otherwise.
 Trevor had no idea of the claim of Mrs. Archer that she
signed on 1 December when he wrote his letter.
<P>

22   	On 26 January 1993 Trevor went to see his parents at
'Glenroy' and had a conversation with them and quite wrongly taped it
without
their knowledge.  Apart from going some distance towards discrediting Trevor
the taped conversation in the main does acknowledge
that one of the contested
conversations to which I will come at least took place even if what was
discussed is not agreed, and it
is also reasonably clear that the engagement of
Messrs. Timmins &amp; Co was brought about through dissatisfaction of the other
two
sons with what had happened.
<P>

23   	In early 1994, Trevor injured his back at work and
apparently decided to sell 'Sussex'.  In March 1995 Mr. and Mrs. Archer
entered
caveats against the title to 'Sussex'.  These proceedings commenced as a result
of lapsing notices having been served and
on 28 April 1995 after some
procedural difficulties had been overcome because the original caveat had
lapsed, I gave leave to Mr.
and Mrs. Archer to lodge further caveats.  In any
event a statement of claim was filed in May 1995 and the proceedings were
expedited.
<P>

24   	On 19 November 1996 an order was made giving Trevor power
to sell 'Sussex' on condition that the one third of net proceeds
of sale (not
making any allowance for the sums required to discharge any mortgage or
encumbrance) be paid into an account in the
joint names of the solicitors for
the parties to abide the outcome of the appeal to the Court of Appeal.  It is
those moneys, which
now, with interest, total something over $214 000, which
are the subject matter of this new trial.  There is also to be determined
in
this new trial the question of who should pay the costs of the original
proceedings before Simos J.
<P>

25   	When this new trial was opened before me by Mr. Coles QC,
senior counsel for the plaintiff, Mrs Archer, he stated that the
claim was
first for undue influence and second for unconscionable conduct in accordance
with the principles laid down by the High
Court in <b><cite>Bridgewater &amp;
Ors v Leahy &amp; Ors</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20158%20ALR%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 158 ALR 66.</a>  There were some procedural
difficulties about this because the unconscionability claim had never been
allowed as a separate claim
before Simos J but was treated merely as additional
matter on the claim for undue influence.  Thus the claim in respect of which
a
retrial was ordered was really only the claim based on undue influence.
Nevertheless I gave a judgment about this on the first
day allowing an
amendment thereby allowing paragraphs 24 to 26A of the amended statement of
claim to be treated as a claim separate
from the claim based on undue
influence.   As I have explained to counsel, in hindsight I may have made a
mistake in allowing the
claim to be made as it is not clear the Court of Appeal
did not preclude it.  However, it was allowed on the basis the plaintiff
would
call no additional evidence and the defendant did not seek an adjournment,
which I indicated I would have allowed, to deal
with the claim, so that no harm
was done.
<P>

26   	The claim based on undue influence was brought on
allegations that Trevor brought constant pressure on Mr. and Mrs. Archer
to
transfer 'Sussex' to them; that Mr. Archer was in poor health and Mrs Archer
was concerned about this; they were taken to the
office of a solicitor whom
they did not know without any notice, and induced to sign the contract and
transfer without any advice
about the transaction; that they were pressured
into signing the documents immediately on their first visit to Mr. Cheney's
office
without the opportunity of obtaining legal advice on their own position;
and that Mrs. Archer was so concerned about the effect on
her husband's health
if she did not sign that she went ahead and did so.  So far as the claim based
on unconscionability is concerned
it is said in addition that the plaintiff was
in a position of special disadvantage when dealing with Trevor by reason of the
illness
of Mr. Archer, inexperience, inequality of bargaining power and
inability to protect her own interests and that Trevor took unconscionable
advantage of these disabilities.  An important position adopted on both counts
is the allegation that Trevor was concerned and worried
after his father's
heart attack in November that he might die, so that it was necessary to act
immediately to secure his position.
 In dealing with the claim of Mrs. Archer
it is necessary to remember that the claim of Mr. Archer in the original
proceedings was
dismissed.
<P>

<b>Contested facts</b>
<P>

27   	The claim of Mrs. Archer put at its most simple is that
she never agreed to transfer her interest in 'Sussex' to Trevor, or
certainly
no more than a one third interest, that she gave no indication that she was
prepared to do so, that she and her husband
did not give to Trevor a copy of
their 1989 wills and although she recognised their contents she said that as
she was younger she
expected to survive her husband and that having done so she
would make a new will, that after her husband's heart attack he was quite
ill,
that after his discharge from hospital on 17 November Trevor and his wife had
agreed to take them to see Dr. Shannon in Orange
at 2.00 p.m. although in
earlier evidence she had given a later time of 4.00 p.m, that she and her
husband had been picked up by
Trevor at about 11.00 a.m. and driven to Orange,
that the car had stopped outside the office of Messrs. Cheney and Wilson, that
she
had no idea why this was but that they were taken up to the office where
her husband signed some documents and she signed some documents
she saying in
various parts of her affidavit and oral evidence that she understood they had
something to do with giving some authority
to make inquiries about stamp duties
or other matters, that they were for the transfer of 'Sussex' to Trevor, and
that they were
for the transfer of one third of her share to Trevor.  Mr.
Archer said before me that he thought the documents were something to
do with
giving management authority over the farm while he was sick.  Mrs. Archer says
that no proper explanation was given to her,
that she was so concerned about
her husband's health she went ahead, and that she took no part in the
conversation in Mr. Cheney's
office.  She said that after the documents were
signed they left and went to Dr. Shannon.  She then says that on the same night
at
11.00 o'clock she was so concerned after thinking about what she had done
that she wrote the note which is Exhibit 18.  It is necessary
to set that out
in full as follows:
<P>

''Glenroy''
<P>

Cudal
<P>

1st December 1989
<P>

To day I did something I will regret for the rest of my life and to make
matters worse neither Bob nor I had been told what was
on.  I know if Bob had
known he would have said no I feel to [sic] sick to worry.
<P>

Bob had an appointment to day to see Dr. Shannon to see how his heart was and
if he would have to go to Sydney. Trevor said he would
take us up but to our
surprise he pulled up in front of a solicitors which we have never heard of
&amp; I cant remember his name.
 Trevor asked us to go inside with him.  I
didnt wake up what was on.  But he had made arrangments [sic] for us to sign
'Sussex'
over to him.
<P>

We did talk about this one day down at 'Sussex'.  Bob seemed to be in favour
but I said no I wasn't.  I pointed out that I didn't
want to give my
inheritance away to 1 son when I had 3 who should share it, half of 'Sussex'
was all I had all my share of Dads estate
was left in the farm as well as my
fifth share in the money Mum left in the farm.  I would have nothing of my own
after years of
thinking how nice it would be to have something to share with my
3 sons.
<P>

The money which I left in the farm was $3000 from Dad &amp; Mum.  In September
this year $40 000 (Mums remaining share) had to be
paid to the girls.  Well Bob
and I paid this <u>not Trevor</u> and a other $25000 came from my money.  I got
$8000 back from the Law Society.  This was a refund of the money that Stan Wall
had
spent out of Dads probate.  I put this on interest and after 10 years it
was $25000, but I didn't get that either so that was $60000
I put into the
farm.
<P>

Any way the solicitor had all the papers ready.  I was just stuned [sic]
because Trevor never said what he had done, so we were
<u>tricked</u> into it.
Anyway Bob signed he was far to [sic] sick to say anything &amp; I thought what
am I going to do if I say no or even say
something it would only upset him as
he had allready [sic] signed.  So I signed but I was so hurt &amp; mad to think
he was in such
a hurry to get that farm.  He must think Bob is dying and he
doesn't trust me to be fair in my will.
<P>

Now I am home how I wish I had said something, but he new [sic] I wouldn't
cause any trouble (thats me)  I know Trevor works on
the farm, but we found the
money he has only helped pay the banks back and we still owe the State bank
money.  I feel he won't offer
to pay that off.
<P>

I only hope Trevor will come good as one day he said he would have to buy me a
house, he should pay me or the 2 boy (Colin &amp;
Neville) back, because he has
got over 800 acres, and Bob only has 530 left for myself &amp; the boys.
<P>

Trevor gets more from the farm that Bob &amp; I, and he is working in Orange
every week &amp; Bob is doing the work.
<P>

Half of 'Sussex' was all I had so I feel I have lost out.  He should pay 2/3 of
my 400 odd acres to me or Colin or Neville when
I am gone.
<P>

I know he will sell the farm one day.  When Bob is better I will talk to him
about it I just hope and pray something can be done
for the wrong I have
done.

28   	The most convenient way to commence the discussion of the
important matters in issue is to deal with the evidence of Trevor
which is as
follows:  He left employment which he had in Canberra in 1976 to return to
'Glenroy' at the request of his father.  After
'Sussex' was purchased he and
Neville moved into the workman's cottage there in 1980.  His grandmother, who
was still alive, continued
to live in the main residence.  He married Sue in
1982, she having two children.  He said that in 1988 Mrs. Archer had told him
that
one day 'Sussex' would be owned by him and his two brothers, and that he
had expostulated about this because he had stayed on at
'Sussex' and had helped
to get the loans to buy it and pay them off and that his mother had said "I
suppose that's right.  I'll have
to think about that.  Anyway we can't do
anything until we have paid out the Rural Assistance Board."  He said that in
March 1989
his mother had told him about the wills which had been made and had
given him a copy of them and when he saw that 'Sussex' would
be ultimately left
to him his mother had said "Yes, we've agreed to that." And he said "thanks".
He said that later in August 1989
he had a conversation with Mrs. Archer at
'Glenroy' when she said that if Mr. Archer died before her that she would have
to sell
up, by which she meant sell 'Sussex' as well as 'Glenroy' to provide
for her old age.  He said that he was concerned about this and
had a
conversation a few days later with his father near the shearing shed at
'Sussex' at which his wife was also present, when he
related his conversation
with his mother to his father and asked whether there was any chance of getting
'Sussex' transferred into
his name then.  He said that his father replied "Yes,
I suppose it's time that we transferred to you.  You had better make some
inquiries
with the solicitor to see what's involved and let me know."  He said
that at this stage he obtained a recommendation to Messrs. Cheney
and Wilson as
he knew nothing about procedures, and he assumed that the property would be
transferred to his name and that of his
wife.  They visited Mr. Cheney on 21
September, at which stage he became aware of the consequences of joint tenancy.
He said that
when he received the letter from Cheney and Wilson recommending
that 'Sussex' be transferred he told his father that the stamp duty
would be
about $27 000 and he would be prepared to pay for it and that his father had
said "That's OK, go ahead."  He said that on
26 September 1989 in the kitchen
at 'Sussex' he had a conversation with his mother and father when he said "I am
relieved that you
and Dad have agreed to transfer 'Sussex' to me" and his
mother had said "I am prepared to give it to you, but not to Sue.  I won't
have
her name on the papers.  We will give it to you but not to her."  He said that
Sue came into the kitchen and she said "Put it
in Trevor's name, it doesn't
worry me at all."  And he said "I understand the papers will be drawn up in my
name only."  He identified
this as the date the conversation took place because
it was the day on which he and his parents went to the State Bank at Canowindra
to sign the documents regarding the repayment of the Rural Assistance Board
loan with moneys borrowed from the State Bank, he saying
that his father had
told the bank that if they wanted security they should take it on Glenroy
because 'Sussex' was being transferred
to him.  He said that before 16 October
Mr. Archer told him that they were in the process of paying out "the girls" who
were Mrs.
Archer's four sisters, and on 16 October he and Sue saw Mr. Cheney
again and told him that his parents had agreed to transfer 'Sussex'
into his
name only, and that Mr. Cheney had said that he would arrange for a valuer to
visit in due course.  They had then discussed
the amount of the stamp duty and
borrowing the money and discussed the value of the property coming to the
conclusion that $500 an
acre would be the right price to put on it.  He said
that Mr. Cheney had said that he would have the documents typed up and would
contact him when this was ready to be signed and that on 17 October he got a
letter from Mr. Cheney confirming the documents were
ready for signature.
After Mr. Archer came out of hospital on 17 November Trevor saw him on a number
of occasions and thought he
was alert enough.  He said that he told Mr. and
Mrs. Archer that the papers to sign over 'Sussex' were ready and asked when
they
could go in to sign them.  He said that one of them said they could go in
on 24 November as Mr Archer had an appointment to see Dr.
Winkworth that day.
He then made an appointment to see Mr. Cheney and told him parents of that.  He
said he confirmed that early
in the morning on 24 November.  He said that in
Mr. Cheney's office Mr. Cheney had said "Trevor has told me that you have
agreed
to transfer 'Sussex' to him, is that correct?" and "Mum and Dad said
yes."  He then said there was conversation about the purchaser
being himself
alone and his mother had confirmed that.  There was conversation about the
value and the price put in the contract
and some possibility of reduction in
the stamp duty.  He said that Mr. Cheney asked whether it was correct that the
transfer was
to be a gift and that his mother had said yes and that she had
asked who was going to pay for the work and that Mr. Cheney had said
that he,
Trevor, was going to get the property alone and pay for it.  He said that a few
days later his mother had asked whether
he was happy having had the property
transferred over to him and he had thanked her.  Most of the dates deposed to
or in respect
of which Trevor gave evidence are confirmed by diary notes of
himself or of Mr. Cheney.
<P>

29   	Mrs. Sue Archer confirmed first that Trevor had told her
about the conversation with Mrs. Archer selling up everything if
Mr. Archer
died first.  She said that she was present during the shearing shed
conversation of which Trevor gave evidence; at the
appointments with Mr.
Cheney; at the conversation in the kitchen at 'Sussex' about transferring the
property into Trevor's name only;
and at the interview and instructions to Mr.
Cheney to go ahead and prepare the documents on that basis.  She did not go
into the
office of Mr. Cheney when the signing took place, although she drove
to Orange with her husband and his parents and later went from
Mr. Cheney's
office to Dr. Winkworth's surgery.
<P>

30   	Mr. Cheney gave evidence, all of which supported the dates
given by Trevor and supported the evidence given by Trevor, Trevor
telling him
of the agreement of Mr. and Mrs. Archer to transfer 'Sussex' to him but not to
his wife.  It was on that basis that he
said that he prepared the documents.
He said that the interview and the signing took place on 24 November and his
appointment book
and note confirmed that.  He said that he explained what was
happening to them and confirmed that the transfer had been discussed
with them
and had said "You understand that by signing the documents I have prepared the
property will be in Trevor's name and will
no longer be your property.  You
will remain the owners of 'Glenroy' and these documents have nothing to do with
the property 'Glenroy'"
and either Mr or Mrs. Archer had said "Yes, that's
right we continue to own 'Glenroy'".  There was then some discussion about the
valuation figure and the mortgages to be discharged and he had explained the
general terms of the contract and the transfer to them.
 He had also prepared
an authority to the State Bank at Canowindra for the transfer of the title
documents which Mr. and Mrs. Archer
had signed.  This is a significant document
as it is dated 24 November.  He agreed that his first instructions came from
and his
first advice was to Trevor, but that after he was informed Mr. and Mrs.
Archer had agreed to go ahead he considered he was acting
for everyone involved
in the transaction.  He said and I accept that it is not unusual for one
solicitor to act in inter-generational
transfers.  I have not set out in full
the conversation in Mr. Cheney's office because it is not necessary.  I accept
his evidence
and that of Trevor.  The explanation was quite sufficient unless
it could be suggested Mr. Cheney was acting only for Trevor and
really against
the parents.
<P>

31   	Mrs. Archer did not deny the evidence of Trevor about the
conversation when he said she had agreed to think about his claim,
but that
nothing could be done while the Rural Assistance Board loan was outstanding.
Otherwise she denied giving Trevor a copy of
her 1989 will; she denied the
conversation at 'Sussex' on 26 September, at least as to agreeing to the
transfer of all her share,
although this varied from time to time; she denied
the conversation at the bank, when it was arranged that the new mortgage would
be secured on 'Glenroy' alone and she denied being told of the proposed
appointment with Mr. Cheney on whatever day it took place.
 She said that
Trevor and his wife picked her and her husband up at 11.00 a.m.; she expected
to go to the doctor; to her surprise
the car stopped outside Mr. Cheney's
office; she said she had never been there before and that Trevor told her that
she would find
out what was happening.  She said they went in and a
conversation not unlike that Mr. Cheney deposed to took place; that she was
so
worried about her husband that she decided to say nothing and sign.  She said
that after that they took Mr. Archer to an appointment
with Dr. Shannon and
that after she got home she was so concerned she wrote the note, which I have
set out.  She refused to depart
from her evidence that the signing took place
on 1 December.  That was really essential to her as she relied on the note.
<P>

32   	So far as subsequent events were concerned, Mrs. Archer
said that she had no recollection of the authority to the National
Australia
Bank, she explained the 1990 wills by saying that provision she had made for
Trevor was passing a one third share of her
share in 'Sussex' to Trevor, and
she said that it was only when her sons questioned her, and she obtained copies
of the documents,
she had realised that she had transferred all her interest to
Trevor.  This has obvious difficulties when the words of the note are
considered.
<P>

<b>On what date were the documents signed? - The Note of 1 December 1989</b>
<P>

33   	Apart from Mrs Archer's evidence everything else points to
the documents having been signed on 24 November 1989.  Mr. Cheney's
appointment
in his diary was for that date and there is no notification of any other
appointment.  Trevor's diary, which is really
written up as a farm type diary
has an entry for 24 November "Got Dad and Mum.  Went to Orange.  Dad and Mum
signed paper for Sussex.
 Dad to doctor ...", and the letter from Trevor to Mr.
Cheney dated 4 January 1993 at a time when there was no contention about the
dates, nominated the correct date without any difficulty.  Probably the most
critical document is one dated 24 November 1989, which
was an authority to the
State Bank to forward the title deeds to Messrs. Cheney and Wilson, which Mr.
Cheney said was signed on the
same day as the contract and transfer.  That
document came from the State Bank files, not from the files of Mr. Cheney.
Although
it was put to Mr. Cheney that it might have been dated before it was
signed he denied that and that suggestion is so unlikely that
it can be
disregarded.  The copy document which Mr. Cheney had was blank as to date so he
could not have somehow concocted this evidence
to support the defendant's case.
The evidence of Sue Archer also supports this because while she thought that
she was taking Mr.
Archer to Dr. Winkworth's surgery, she certainly did not
take him to Dr. Shannon's surgery.  The fact that Mr. Archer saw Dr. Ridge
and
not Dr. Winkworth has no bearing on this.
<P>

34   	Mr. Archer gave up any attempt to support his wife's story
in the trial before me when he conceded that he saw Mr. Cheney
on 24 November
1989.  However, it is unfair to try to pin too much on this latter statement as
by then I thought he was prepared
to agree with most things that were put to
him, unless he recognised how contrary they would be to his wife's position.
Thus in the
same passage of cross-examination he said he saw Dr. Shannon on the
day he saw Mr. Cheney.
<P>

35   	A very strong attack was made on the credit of Mr. Cheney
by Mr. Coles, based first on his acting for both parties on this
transaction,
second on his lack of proper records, third on the circumstance that the
documents did not bear the date on which they
were signed and provided for a
consideration which it was not intended would be paid and fourthly because it
was claimed he had only
concern for the interests of Trevor.  While it is fair
to say that not everything he did was perfect, it is right to say first that
Mr. Cheney had every reason to prepare the documents when he was told by Trevor
and Sue that Mr. and Mrs. Archer had agreed to transfer
the property to Trevor,
second if he had the conversation which he said he did with them when they came
to the office, then he confirmed
what had been told to him and third, it is in
my view, quite impossible to believe that he placed an entry in his appointment
book
and somehow or other dated a document which he did not have in his
possession for the purpose of supporting the case of Trevor. 
I said during the
hearing and I should say again as strongly as is possible that it is quite
inappropriate for solicitors to prepare
documents which provide for a
consideration which neither party expects will be paid.  The proper course is
to prepare a document
with no consideration and to have the document stamped on
the basis of a valuation which the Stamp Duties authorities will require
in any
event.  Mr. Cheney said that what he did was the way in which he dealt with
inter-generational transfers of property for no
consideration at that time.  I
accept that to be the position. All I wish to point out is that it is not a
proper procedure.  However
that does not mean that I do not accept the evidence
which he gave as to the date of signing or what happened on that day.  I do
accept it.
<P>

36   	The plaintiff said that the note was copied exactly as it
was on the original.  The date of 1 December 1989 appears on it
twice.  There
can be no doubt that her evidence is that date was on the original document
when she wrote it whenever it was she copied
it out, the evidence of which
seemed to vary on many occasions.  She would not retract from her evidence that
the transfer documents
were signed on 1 December.  It is perfectly clear they
were not.  I find as a fact and without hesitation the documents were signed
on
24 November 1989.
<P>

<b>Consequences of the note of 1 December 1989</b>
<P>

37   	The case of Mrs. Archer really relies on acceptance of the
note as a genuine document.  If it were genuine then it would clearly
enough go
to support the case of undue influence.  If it is not genuine then it is
clearly a document concocted and put forward as
a contemporaneous note to
support a claim which is probably without foundation.  Its genuineness depends
upon the appointment with
Mr. Cheney having been on 1 December.  The evidence
is so clear that the appointment was on 24 November, that it is necessary to
find that the document is a fabrication.  This is a serious matter as it
amounts to a finding of forgery.  However, the evidence
is quite clear and I so
find.  It seems likely that the date of 1 December was arrived at because Mrs.
Archer knew that the documents
were not signed on the date that the contracts
and transfer were dated, and she knew that there was an appointment with a
doctor
on the date the documents were signed.  Some support is given to this
theory by a note made on the Medicare refund advice against
the entry for 1
December and the appointment with Dr. Shannon on that day.  It is also of some
significance that Mr. Archer was quite
uncertain about when he knew of the
note's existence, but as Mr. Trebeck pointed out, it is almost certain that the
note must have
come into existence before the taped conversation on 26 January
1993, because Mrs. Archer talked about the actual date of the visit
to Mr.
Cheney on that day and Colin said his mother had shown a note to him even if it
was not clearly identified.
<P>

38   	Once it is found that exhibit 18 is a fabrication then one
is bound to find that it was concocted for the purpose of supporting
the
plaintiff's case on undue influence.  Once that is found then the whole basis
of her case falls to the ground at least on undue
influence.  In spite of this
last statement it is as well to determine those issues of fact which would bear
directly upon the claim
of undue influence and also of unconscionability.
These are the happenings which led up to the meeting in Mr. Cheney's office on
24 November, because irrespective of what happened on that day the prior
happenings bear upon whether the actions of Mrs. Archer
that day were of her
own will or as a result of her will being overborne.
<P>

39   	In determining these matters a substantial difficulty for
the version of Mrs. Archer is that whatever her husband's evidence
before me
and at the previous trial was, his action was dismissed, so the transaction so
far as he was involved cannot be impugned.
 His evidence overall was rather
inconsistent, although he was, I thought being loyal to his wife.  However, the
greatest difficulty
for her is that I have found that she has produced and
attempted to rely on a document which is a forgery and thus it is almost
impossible
to accept any other account of hers unless there is some
corroboration of it from someone other than her husband where there is some
issue between her and Trevor.
<P>

40   	There can be no doubt that Trevor was concerned about his
future and knew of his mother's view that 'Sussex' should go to
the three sons.
However, I find that by the end of 1988 there was some softening of that view.
That is because I accept Trevor's
evidence as to putting his claim and Mrs.
Archer saying "I suppose that's right.  I'll have to think about that.  Anyway
we can't
do anything until we have paid out the Rural Assistance Board".  This
was never denied and before me Mrs. Archer accepted it.
<P>

41   	The next subject matter on which there is a factual
dispute is whether or not Mrs. Archer gave Trevor a copy of the wills
of 1
March 1989.  It was suggested that Trevor must have taken them from 'Glenroy'
and later perhaps that he could have got them
from solicitors in Orange.
Copies retained by Mr. and Mrs. Archer at 'Glenroy' differ from those in the
possession of Trevor.  He
therefore could not have made his copies from the
copies which he is said to have copied, and it cannot be claimed that he got
them
from the solicitors who prepared them.  I find that they were handed to
him by Mrs. Archer and Mr. Archer knew of this.  That is
further reason to
think that Mrs. Archer had changed her mind about the future of 'Sussex'.  Mr.
Archer said they were temporary
wills because the other sons were having
problems with their marriages.  Mrs. Archer did not say that but said she
intended changing
her will if she survived her husband which she thought she
would.  If that was her intention which is possibly likely, she did not
tell
Trevor of it.  Sue Archer said on the first hearing that Trevor had told her
about the wills and she had seen them some time
later.  Whilst some attack was
made on the credit of Sue Archer I thought her evidence given before me was
convincing and she is
a witness I would accept.  She did not attempt to
overstate things; she did not say the important meeting took place on 24
November
1989; and I accept she was more concerned about her house than the
farm.  I find that Mrs. Archer did hand a copy of the 1989 wills
to Trevor.
<P>

42   	The next dispute is about the shearing shed conversation.
If this took place it came about in late August 1989.  According
to Trevor he
was most concerned when his mother indicated that if Mr. Archer died first she
would have to sell everything.  Until
then he had thought the will would
protect him.  Thus there was a reason for bringing this up with his father and
asking for a transfer
at that time.  Both Trevor and his wife gave almost
identical accounts about what was said and this was denied by Mr. Archer,
although
he did say he told Trevor to find out the stamp duty as he thought
that would put him off.  Before me Sue said she was present at
two
conversations which were obviously this one and the one on 26 September 1989.
I find that the conversation did take place.  It
must be borne in mind that the
chain of events in the story of Trevor has logical linkages and would be a very
strange sequence of
events to invent.  Thus the visit to Mr. Cheney after this
conversation was a logical next step to take.
<P>

43   	It is possible now to deal more quickly with the other
matters of factual dispute.  I accept the evidence of Mr. Cheney and
Trevor and
his wife that an estimate of stamp duty was given at the conference on 21
September.  After all if the shearing shed conversation
took place one of the
purposes of the visit was to obtain this information.  I find that Mr. Archer
was informed of this.  Nevertheless
I accept that Mrs. Archer did not know of
this appointment with Mr. Cheney and that a prime reason for Trevor seeing Mr.
Cheney was
to protect his own position, albeit that his father has authorised
him to find out what was involved in the transfer.  In fact, in
cross
examination of Trevor at page 1069 the following passage appears:
<P>

Q:	Is that right, you needed to be protected against your mother's intentions
in dealing with her assets?
<P>

A:	I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.
<P>

Q:	You wanted to cut across your mother's anticipated intentions?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	To intercept her will for your own benefit?
<P>

A:	I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.
<P>

Q:	To thwart her desires for your own advantage?
<P>

A:	I suppose that, yes?
<P>

Q:	Mr. Cheney wrote to you the next day after that interview?
<P>

A:	He did.
<P>

Q:	He recorded:
<P>

As advised in our conference, having regard to the fact Mr and Mrs. Archer
senior held the property as joint tenants, it is important
from your point of
view to discuss with them the possibility of transferring the property to
yourselves at the earliest possible
time.
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q:	Do you agree in light of the letter that was written to you that you
discussed joint tenancy in the interview we have been talking
about?
<P>

A:	I didn't know it was joint tenancy.
<P>

Q:	Mr. Cheney also recorded:
<P>

We will take no further action at the present time.  However, should you wish
us to prepare a schedule of the costs involved in
effecting the transfer, we
will be quite happy to do so.
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	I am looking at page 1383.  Do you want to see that letter?
<P>

A.	No, I think that was what was in it.
<P>

Q.	You were not given the information your father told you to find out?
<P>

A.	He told me prior to that.
<P>

44   	So far as the agreement of Mr. Archer to "go ahead" is
concerned and the disputed conversation at 'Sussex' on 26 September
1989 I also
accept the defendant's evidence.  I do so because I accept his wife's evidence;
because there is an entry on the farm
diary of Trevor which looks genuine; and
Mrs. Archer's evidence vacillated from denial of even going to 'Sussex' to
admitting she
was there as she had to if she relied on Exhibit 18 as correct.
In any event the taped conversation established the fact of the conversation
but not its contents.
<P>

45   	When the natural progression of events is looked at there
is a further reason to accept the evidence of Trevor.  That is because
that it
is admitted that Mr. and Mrs. Archer went to the State Bank at Canowindra with
Trevor on 26 September for the purpose of
re-financing the Rural Assistance
Board loan, which was due for repayment, this being the loan which Mrs. Archer
had said would prevent
anything being done for Trevor, and the new loan was
secured on 'Glenroy' alone.  In ordinary circumstances if the new loan to the
State Bank was provided so that the Rural Assistance Loan could be paid out and
that was obtained for the purchasing 'Sussex', one
would have expected the
substituted security to be taken over 'Sussex' if it were to be taken over one
of the properties alone. 
Thus I accept Trevor's evidence that Mr. Archer said
if security was needed it should be over 'Glenroy', and I do not accept Mr.
Archer's statement that was what the bank manager arranged and he did whatever
the bank manager suggested.  It is important to remember
that by this time the
loan to the sisters of Mrs. Archer had been repaid or was in the process of
being repaid.  As there was very
little debt due to the National Australia
Bank, the fact was that 'Sussex' was relatively free of encumbrance if it were
to be the
subject of transfer to Trevor.  
<P>

46   	Another reason to accept this evidence of agreement is
that the next significant event was the visit to Mr. Cheney's office
on 16
October.  Both Trevor and his wife say that they told Mr. Cheney that agreement
had been reached but that the property was
to be transferred to Trevor alone.
The file note of Mr. Cheney appears to confirm that and it also notes that the
mortgage to the
sisters existed, which is referred to in Mr. Cheney's letter of
the next day.  It is of significance that in his note of the happenings
of 24
November Mr. Cheney noted that this mortgage had been discharged.  However, the
significant point is that it is clear that
on 16 October instructions were
given to Mr. Cheney to prepare the documents for transfer, and unless there
were some nefarious scheme
or trick proposed by Trevor it is at least unlikely
that this cost would have been incurred unless his parents had agreed to the
transfer.  It follows from this that I accept the evidence of the agreement
being reached and Mr. Cheney being informed of this.
 Thus I do not accept that
he was a solicitor acting in the interests of one person in some way to defeat
the legitimate interest
of another.  Finally I accept the evidence of Trevor as
to the appointment with Mr. Cheney on 24 November and his parents telling
him
that would be a convenient day to go because they had a medical appointment
that day.  There was no possible reason why Mr and
Mrs. Archer would be
collected at about 11.30 in the morning to drive to Orange for a medical
appointment at 2.00 p.m. or according
to Mrs. Archer in her original affidavit,
4.00 p.m. 
<P>

47   	It is now necessary to come to the meeting at Mr. Cheney's
office.  I am satisfied that the explanation which he said that
he gave of the
transaction was sufficient.  It is to be remembered that he was operating under
the belief that Mr. and Mrs. Archer
had agreed to the transfer, so that what he
did was to confirm their agreement which was given.  The difficulty of the case
for Mrs.
Archer is that she said at various times  (1) that she thought that
all she was doing was signing an authority for some further inquiries
to be
made as to stamp duty and the like; (2) that she knew she was signing over her
interest, although she did not want to do so;
and (3) that she intended only to
sign over a one third of her interest and thought that is what she had done.
Mr. Archer on this
occasion before me said that he thought he was giving some
authority for the management of the property while he was ill, which was
clearly untrue.  There was no suggestion at that time that he was to have some
further operation, and in any event he finally accepted
before me that he
signed transfer documents on that day.  His evidence to the contrary cannot be
accepted, although it is not really
significant as his claim failed.  Mrs.
Archer must be completely disregarded because she could hardly put forward
Exhibit 18 and
then say she had not signed transfer documents, nor could she
say that when she gave her story about the later will when she said
that she
had only handed over one third of her interest, which of course was quite
inconsistent with some of her evidence as to what
she was signing on the day in
question and quite inconsistent with Exhibit 18.  There is no suggestion that
Mr. and Mrs. Archer were
forced into Mr. Cheney's office, nor that there was
any pressure exerted on them to sign while they were there.  In other words I
find that Mrs. Archer well knew what she was doing and did it freely.
<P>

48   	This finding is say borne out by Mr. and Mrs. Archer both
signing a letter to the National Australia Bank authorising that
bank to
forward the title deeds to 'Sussex' to Mr. Cheney.  That document is dated 2
March 1990.  By that time they may well have
received letters from both the
bank and from Mr. Cheney asking them to do this, albeit that both letters were
addressed to them at
'Sussex'.  In any event there is no suggestion that Trevor
sought their signature because they can give no explanation for signing
it.  I
should say that it is perfectly clear that had Mrs. Archer been tricked then
she would not have signed this authority over
three months later, because Mr.
Cheney was the last person she would have trusted with her deeds.  In any event
her evidence as to
this document was completely unacceptable because she was
reluctant to recognise it, yet it was clear she recognised its importance
to
the case against her when she prevaricated for a considerable period as to
whether or not the signature was hers, although in
the long run it was accepted
that it was.  Finally I find that when she made her will of 12 September 1990
Mrs. Archer was well aware
of the fact that she had transferred her interest to
Trevor; in some ways it was difficult for her to deny this as she was putting
forward Exhibit 18 as true, and in any event she had appointed Trevor as
co-executor which would be a strange thing to do for a son
who had exercised
improper influence on her freedom of will.  Once again the will is a logical
step in the chain of events.
<P>

49   	Having made all these findings the likely conclusion is
that when Mrs. Archer was confronted by her other sons asking about
what she
had done she may have had some misgivings, but it was quite impossible for her
to say that until she received copies of
the documents from Messrs. Cheney and
Wilson she did not know what she had done.
<P>

<b>Decision on undue influence</b>
<P>

50   	It is accepted that the principles as to undue influence
are those as set out in <b><cite>Johnson v Buttress</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2056%20CLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 56 CLR
113</a>, where the following passage appears in the judgment of Dixon J at p134:
<P>

The basis of the equitable jurisdiction to set aside an alienation of property
on the ground of undue influence is the prevention
of an unconscientious use of
any special capacity or opportunity that may exist or arise of affecting the
alienor's will or freedom
of judgment in reference to such a matter. The source
of power to practise such a domination may be found in no antecedent relation
but in a particular situation, or in the deliberate contrivance of the party.
If this be so, facts must be proved showing that the
transaction was the
outcome of such an actual influence over the mind of the alienor that it cannot
be considered his free act.
<P>

51   	I find there was no improper conduct of Mr. Cheney; that
Mr. Cheney gave a proper explanation as to the documents, and that
he did so
having been informed of the prior agreement of Mr. and Mrs. Archer to the
transaction; and that Mr. and Mrs. Archer had
both been informed that they were
to attend an appointment with Mr. Cheney.  I have found Mrs. Archer knew what
she was signing.
 The claim of Mrs. Archer that she was so influenced by her
husband's illness she just signed because he signed, and she was concerned
about the effect on him if she did not sign cannot be accepted and it is
perfectly clear that Mrs. Archer was not a person who could
be dominated.  The
established facts do not establish any wearing down of the will of Mrs. Archer
nor any dominance by Trevor over
her.  The passage which I have quoted from the
evidence given by Trevor as to his intentions must be read having regard to the
time
when it took place, and what happened thereafter; and the conduct of Mrs.
Archer after the event in signing the authority to the
National Australia Bank
and in making the will she did makes it clear that not only did she know what
she was doing, but she was
prepared to do what was necessary thereafter to give
effect to the documents which she had signed, which is quite contrary to a
claim
of influence.  The statement that she thought she was only signing over a
one third interest in the property was quite inconsistent
with anything else
she said, and she does not say that Mr. Cheney said that was what was
happening.  Finally it was said that after
Mr. Archer's heart attack in early
November it was a matter of great urgency for Trevor to get the transfer
signed.  That might have
more force if nothing had been done prior to that time
to put in train the preparation of the documents, but as the documents had
been
prepared it has little force once it is found that Mr. &amp; Mrs. Archer knew
they were to see Mr. Cheney and were not somehow
tricked into going to his
office.
<P>

52   	As I have said it seems to me that the claim based on
undue influence came to an end as soon as I found the document Exhibit
18 was a
forgery, but even without that the claim would not have been made out.  I
should add that as there was no question of dominance
or opportunity to
overbear the will of Mrs. Archer or of any influence over her, the question of
separate advice does not really
arise.  The note was apparently concocted to
give a false impression of being in a situation of pressure and the evidence
concocted
around that.  It must be put aside.  The claim based on undue
influence fails.
<P>

<b>Claim for unconscionability</b>
<P>

53   	The plaintiff's claim based on unconscionable conduct
relied on the same facts as those for the case on undue influence. 
It was
based upon the decision of the High Court of Australia in
<b><cite>Bridgewater</cite></b> which confirmed that undue influence and
unconscionable conduct are separate causes of action confirming the decision in
<b><cite>Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v Amadio</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151
CLR 447.</a>  In <b><cite>Bridgewater</cite></b> at page 80 the majority judges set
out the general principles upon which they relied as follows:
<P>

In Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio, Deane J said that the two
doctrines are distinct, undue influence looking to "the
quality of the consent
or assent of the weaker party", whilst unconscionable conduct looks to the
attempted enforcement or retention
of the benefit of a dealing with a person
under a special disability. Further, the recognition of certain special
relations, the
existence of any of which would itself support a presumption of
undue influence, could provide a particular forensic advantage to
plaintiffs.
<P>

Sir Anthony Mason, with reference to the well developed Australian body of
authority on the subject, has contrasted the two doctrines
as follows:
<P>

My understanding of undue influence ... is that it denotes an ascendancy by the
stronger party over the weaker party such that the
relevant transaction is not
the free, voluntary and independent act of the weaker party. In other words, it
is the actual or presumed
impairment of the judgment of the weaker party that
is the critical element in the grant of relief on the ground of undue
influence.
<P>

...
<P>

Unconscionable conduct, as the term suggests, focuses more on the
unconscientious conduct of the defendant. As a ground of relief
in England
unconscionable conduct has been confined largely to 'catching bargains' with
expectant heirs and others in particular
categories of disadvantage eg those
who are illiterate. ... In Australia, it has been recognized that
unconscionable conduct is a
ground of relief which will be available 'whenever
one party by reason of some condition or circumstance is placed at a special
disadvantage
vis-a-vis another and unfair or unconscientious advantage is taken
of the opportunity thereby created'. Unconscionable conduct is
also recognized
in New Zealand as a ground of relief in these circumstances.
<P>

In Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio, Deane J spoke of unconscionable
conduct as occurring where, in the circumstances,
it is unconscientious to
"procure, or accept, the weaker party's assent to the impugned transaction". It
also should be noted that
in Hart v O'Connor, an appeal from New Zealand, the
Privy Council described unconscionable conduct which provided a basis for
equitable
relief as "victimisation, which can consist either of the active
extortion of a benefit or the passive acceptance of a benefit in
unconscionable
circumstances". In so giving the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Brightman
was reflecting a general proposition
put by James LJ in Torrance v Bolton. This
was that it was the "ordinary jurisdiction" of the Court of Chancery to deal
with instruments
and transactions "in which the Court is of opinion that it is
unconscientious for a person to avail himself of the legal advantage
which he
has obtained".
<P>

54   	None of the pleaded claims of disability stated to arise
from the illness of Mr. Archer; inexperience; inequality of bargaining
power
and inability to protect her own interest is made out.  Trevor was not very
well educated and has difficulty in reading and
there was nothing to show that
Mrs. Archer was in any unequal position as against him.  Her ability to
understand those pieces of
evidence which were against her and to attempt to
reconstruct her evidence accordingly was quite apparent, and her concoction of
the note shows that she knew precisely what she doing.  The medical evidence
does not support the fears for her husband's future
which she said that she had
when she was signing, which evidence was necessary to make good what was said
in the note.  That is not
to say he was in perfect health but to say the stated
concern about  a further heart attack is not true.  The only evidence which
could possibly support the claim based on unconscientious behaviour was that
passage of the cross-examination of Trevor, which I
have set.  That however
must be considered in light of my acceptance that he went to see the solicitor
having been told to do so
by his father and the natural progression of events
after that.  Mrs. Archer was never shown to be under the influence of Trevor;
she was never shown not to have acted as she wished to act; she was not lured
into an office to sign.  It was not unreasonable of
Trevor to put forward his
claims.  What has happened in this unfortunate case is that Mrs. Archer did
what she did because she had
agreed to do so but later changed her mind and
concocted a story probably because of dissatisfaction expressed by her other
sons.
 The claim based on unconscionability must be dismissed.
<P>

55   	The result of all this is that the plaintiff's claim on
the retrial must be dismissed.  The defendant is entitled to the moneys
held to
abide the result of this action.  
<P>

56   	As the defendant has succeeded in his defence of the
claims of both his father and mother, it follows that they should both
pay the
costs of the proceedings before Simos J.  The plaintiff, Mrs. Archer, must pay
the costs of the action before me.  An application
was foreshadowed that these
costs should be on the indemnity basis if I found Exhibit 18 was a forgery.  If
that application is to
be pursued I would list it for argument on a later
date.
<P>

57   	The orders I propose to make are as follows:
<P>

1.	The claim of the plaintiff, Una Evelyn Archer be dismissed.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff, Mrs. Archer, pay the defendant's costs of the trial before
me.
<P>

3.	The plaintiffs, Una Evelyn Archer and Ernest Robert Archer, pay the
defendant's costs of the first trial to the date of the judgment
of Simos J.
<P>

4.	Liberty to apply to relist the matter to claim indemnity costs.  Any such
application to be made after 28 June 1999 and not later
than 9 July 1999 and if
not so made shall be deemed abandoned.
<P>

5.	Exhibits may be returned after 28 days.
