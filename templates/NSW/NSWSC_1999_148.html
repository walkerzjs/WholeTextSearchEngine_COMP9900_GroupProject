<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>WEDNESDAY 24 FEBRUARY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1500/99 - RE WITTA COOLA PASTORAL CO PTY  LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an application by an administrator to extend
the period under s 439A(6) of the Corporations Law for a further three weeks
to
allow the administrator to hold a second meeting of creditors.
<P>

2	I declined to make this order this morning when the summons was filed as it
appeared to me that the material then before the court
 showed that the
administrator's staff had merely been too pleasant in dealing with the
procrastinations of the directors and the
company's accountants.
<P>

3	The operation carried on by the company appears to be the management of a
farm involving a piggery near Gunnedah where there are
ten employees.  It is
said to be a "complex commercial operation" but it hardly seems to me to be so
in the sense that that term
is usually used in these cases.
<P>

4	Too many applications are being made under this section to extend the time.
Some are obviously justified and the court grants
them without ado.
<P>

5	However, the number of borderline applications are increasing.  That should
not prejudice this particular application, but it
makes me again draw attention
to the fact that the legislature has deliberately set a very short time during
which these meetings
are to be convened.
<P>

6	Everyone involved in liquidations and administration must realise the time is
very short when convening meetings in administration
and, accordingly, the
normal pace of work just cannot be observed when an administrator is dealing
with these matters.  The administrator
must undertake an accelerated programme
and instruct his or her staff accordingly.
<P>

7	Indeed, it would seem from some of these applications, not necessarily this
one, that administrators are accepting employment
with inadequate material, as
a result of which they need to spend time assembling the basic material in the
period that the legislature
has laid down for convening the second meeting.
<P>

8	It must always be remembered that the time limits are set under the
legislation to balance the interests of creditors affected
as well as the
interests of the company.
<P>

9	I have already, in<b> Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACSR%20611" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACSR 611</a>,
set down the parameters as to when this sort of application is granted.  I
agree with Mr Robson's comments in his annotation to
s 439A, based on<b> Re
Evening Standard Publishing Co</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=164%20F%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">164 F 517</a> (1908) (DCNY) that the guiding
principle is that there should be an expeditious administration, and
unnecessary adjournments are
discouraged and dilatory delays are refused.
<P>

10	However, the present application I think just gets over the mark.  It has
been helped to get over the mark by the fact the four
major creditors have
consented.
<P>

11	Accordingly, I make order 3 in the summons filed this  morning.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

                                        oOo
