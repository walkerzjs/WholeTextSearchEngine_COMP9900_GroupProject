<b><u>15225/92   -   PERMANENT TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED &amp; ANOR v</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>KEOGH &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In this application, the plaintiffs,
Permanent Trustee Company Limited and Morlend Finance Corporation (VIC) Pty
Limited, financiers,
seek an order for costs against the fourth to seventh
defendants, who are valuers.  I entered judgment for the plaintiffs against
the
valuers on 22 July 1999 but reserved the question of costs.  It is not in
dispute that the valuers should pay the plaintiffs'
costs of the proceedings,
including the costs of a reference which proceeded before Mr W H Nicholas QC.
The issue is whether the
plaintiffs may recover from the valuers, under what is
known as a Bullock order, costs which the plaintiffs became liable to pay
to
the first and second defendants, solicitors, who were dismissed from the
proceedings by Simpson J, following receipt of the report
of the Referee.
<P>

2   	By way of background, I should mention that the valuers and
the solicitors were each sued on a like cause of action.  Both
were given
clearly worded instructions.  In the valuers' case, the letter of instructions
included the following:
<P>

<i>"Please provide the following information in your report:</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>6.	Any details as per the planning approvals or outstanding orders on the
property.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>9.	We further require you to be satisfied and sight all Planning
Certificates and to advise if anything of a detrimental nature including
the
state of the property which could or would inhibit its sale."</i>
<P>

Notwithstanding this instruction, the valuers did not make inquiries of the
Penrith City Council, the relevant municipal council,
and therefore did not
ascertain the existence of an order issued by the Council under s 310 of the
<b><i>Local Government Act 1919</i></b> which specified breaches of both
building and planning approvals and directed that works be carried out on the
property, which was
to be security for a proposed loan to be given by the
plaintiffs.
<P>

3   	The letter of instructions given by the plaintiffs to the
solicitors included the following:
<P>

<i>"61.	Please obtain all relevant Certificates from all relevant authorities
and </i><cite>be satisfied that such Certificates do not prejudice the
Company's position</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

Two relevant certificates would have been a s 317AE Certificate and a s 160
Certificate.  Apparently, the solicitors were later
informed that the s 317AE
Certificate was not required.  The Referee found that the solicitors remained
under an obligation to obtain
a s 160 Certificate and that, had an up-to-date
certificate been obtained, it would have disclosed the existence of the s 310
Order.
 The solicitors did not obtain any certificates from the Penrith City
Council but relied upon a s 160 Certificate obtained from the
prospective
borrowers' solicitors which had been issued several months previously and
which, as a consequence, did not disclose the
s 310 Order.
<P>

4   	The Referee found that neither the valuers nor the
solicitors were liable, notwithstanding that the plaintiffs had expressly
instructed the valuers to obtain all outstanding orders and the solicitors to
obtain all relevant certificates.  If either or both
had done so, the existence
of the s 310 Notice would have been disclosed.  As it was, neither the valuers
nor the solicitors made
inquiries of Penrith City Council.  Simpson J accepted
the Referee's report insofar as it dealt with the solicitors but sent the
case
against the valuers to trial.
<P>

5   	This depiction of the basic facts is unduly simplistic.  I
have avoided stating many subtleties and complexities which, if
the facts were
to be fairly described, would need to be stated.  Nevertheless, the description
I have given is a sufficient background
upon which I can express my view that
the joining of both the valuers and the solicitors in the proceedings was not
only a reasonable
course, but an inevitable consequence of the plaintiffs' need
to recover their loss.  An analysis of the respective responsibilities
of the
solicitors and the valuers was an intrinsic element of proof of liability on
the part of one or both groups of defendants.
 Such an assessment was also
necessary for the purpose of establishing liability for damages.  Indeed, it
would have been unfair
if the plaintiffs had sued either the valuers or the
solicitors without suing the other.  If only one of the two groups had been
sued, that group would have felt a sense of injustice that it had been selected
out, when the written instructions to each were similar
in substance.
<P>

6   	The principle to be applied is that stated by Romer LJ in
<b><i>Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Company</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281903%29%202%20KB%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1903) 2 KB 533</a> at 539 where
his Lordship said:
<P>

<i>"The costs so recovered over by the plaintiff are in no true sense damages,
but are ordered to be paid by the unsuccessful defendant,
on the ground that in
such an action as I am considering those costs have been reasonably and
properly incurred by the plaintiff
as between him and the last-named
defendant."</i>
<P>

There are two elements to be considered.  The first is that the costs in
question have been reasonably and properly incurred.  There
is no issue about
that in the present case.  The second is that the costs must have been incurred
in such circumstances such that,
as between the plaintiff and the defendant
against whom the costs order is sought, it is proper to order that they be paid
by that
defendant.
<P>

7   	In respect of the second element, there are cases which
point to conduct on the part of the unsuccessful defendant which has
been such
as to make it fair to impose a liability on it for the costs of the successful
defendant.  In <b><i>Gould &amp; Anor v Vaggelas &amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%2d1985%29%20157%20CLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983-1985)
157 CLR 215</a>, Gibbs CJ expressed such a view at pp 229-231.  His Honour referred
to comments by Blackburn CJ in <b><i>Steppke v National Capital Development
Commission</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2039%20LGRA%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 39 LGRA 94</a> at 100.  In <b><i>Steppke</i></b>,
Blackburn CJ emphasised the importance of the attitude taken by the
unsuccessful defendant, whether something said or done by it
prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or raised by it in the defence of the
proceedings had led to the joinder of the successful
defendant.  Another
example is <b><i>Besterman v British Motor Cab Company Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281914%29%203%20KB%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1914) 3
KB 181</a> where, before the issue of the writ, the unsuccessful defendant had
endeavoured to throw the blame on others and, as a matter of
fact, the
defendant who was ultimately unsuccessful had accused the other defendant of
being partly to blame and that attitude had
been persisted in right through the
trial.
<P>

8   	However, it is not necessary that there be attitude taken
on the part of the unsuccessful defendant which has led to the joinder
of a
defendant or defendants who were successful in the action.
<b><i>Sanderson</i></b> itself was a case in which defendants were sued in the
alternative.  It was held that the unsuccessful defendant should pay the costs
of the other.  That was because the circumstances of the case were such that
both defendants ought to have been joined.  Romer LJ
and Stirling LJ both
referred to Order XVI rule 7 and as to the prior rule of Chancery that all
persons materially interested in
the subject-matter of the suit ought in
general to be made parties as plaintiffs or defendants, so that the Court might
be enabled
to do complete justice by deciding upon and settling the rights of
all persons interested.  Stirling LJ referred in this respect
to <b><i>Mitford
on Pleading</i></b>, p 164.  <b><i>Bullock v The London General Omnibus Company
&amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%201%20KB%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 1 KB 264</a>, from which the term <i>"Bullock order"</i>
derives, was a case where an order was made in the circumstance that there was
an averment of a joint tort by both sets of defendants,
with a separate charge
of tort against each.  In the reasons for judgment, no particular mention was
made of any express conduct
on the part of the unsuccessful defendant which
brought about the joinder of the successful defendant.
<P>

9   	In <b><i>Altamura v Victorian Railways
Commissioners</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1974/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] VicRp 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20VR%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) VR 33</a>, Kaye J examined the cases.  At p 37, his
Honour held that a Bullock order may be made even though the cause of action
alleged against
the successful defendant was different from that alleged and
made out against the unsuccessful defendant, so long as the nature of
the duty
owed to the plaintiff by all the defendants was the same and arose out of the
same factual circumstances.  He rejected the
contention put for the
unsuccessful defendant that the costs of a successful defendant were not
recoverable from the other defendant
or defendants unless the causes of action
were the same and the unsuccessful defendant had blamed the other party.
Likewise, in <b><i>Norwest Refrigeration Services Pty Ltd v Bain Dawes (WA) Pty
Ltd</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2058%20ALJR%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 58 ALJR 521</a>, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ declined
to make a Bullock order on the ground that, <i>"It was a straightforward action
which was not interdependent with or in any real sense alternative to the claim
against the Co-operative."</i>
<P>

10   	In my opinion, the approach taken by Kaye J in
<b><i>Altamura</i></b> should be followed.  I note that in <b><i>Gould v
Vaggelas</i></b>, Murphy J, Wilson J and Brennan J all took this wider
approach.
<P>

11   	In the present case, both the valuers and the solicitors
had been given written instructions which, had they been complied
with, would
have led to the discovery of the s 310 Order, the failure to ascertain and
disclose which has led to the judgment against
the valuers.  In my opinion, it
was both inevitable and just that both the solicitors and the valuers were
joined in the proceedings.
 The claims were interdependent and alternative.
Although in the end there was no conduct on behalf of the valuers in which
blame
was laid upon the solicitors, other than that the solicitors and the
valuers each had a cross-claim against the other, yet, it was
a necessary part
of the litigation against the valuers that the solicitors be joined.  In this
circumstance, I am of the view that
a Bullock order should be made.
<P>

12   	Accordingly, I shall order that the fourth to seventh
defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings, including the
costs
payable by the plaintiffs to the first and second defendants.  The costs
ordered to be paid include the costs of the reference
to Mr W H Nicholas QC.
