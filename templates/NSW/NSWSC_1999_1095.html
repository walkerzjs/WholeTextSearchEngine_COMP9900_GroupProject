<P>

THURSDAY 11 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>11678/1999</u>	<u>NEIL TIMBER LIMITED v MICHAEL JOHN MURPHY &amp;
ANOR</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 13
July 1999.  The process made a claim for inter alia possession
of a property
known as 330 Singles Ridge Road Winmalee (the property).
<P>

2  	The defendants (who are husband and wife) are the registered
proprietors of the property.  On 3 July 1996, they gave a mortgage
over the
property to the plaintiff.  The mortgage was given to secure a Deed of
Guarantee and Indemnity given inter alia by the first
defendant.  It had been
given to secure an indebtedness owed by International Lumber Products Pty
Limited (the company) to the plaintiff
(an indebtedness that arose out of
trading arrangements between the plaintiff and the company).  On 9 June 1998,
the defendants executed
a Deed Poll.  The Deed Poll was executed at a time when
the company was in grave financial difficulty.  It gave priority to ANZ Bank
in
respect of their re-financing of a business debt owed by the company.  The Deed
Poll acknowledged an indebtedness owed by the
company to the plaintiff and the
validity of the mortgage.
<P>

3  	There has been default under the mortgage.  The claim for
possession is founded on that default.
<P>

4  	The Statement of Claim was served on 29 July 1999.  Following
service, an appearance was filed out of time and a Request for
Particulars was
made.  The plaintiff refused the request and subsequently moved for judgment.
Default judgment was entered on 30
September 1999.  On 1 October 1999, the
second defendant attempted to file a Defence.
<P>

5  	On 18 October 1999, she filed a Notice of Motion.  It seeks inter
alia that the default judgment be set aside.
<P>

6  	This application was heard on 1 November 1999.  The second
defendant has sworn an affidavit.  Her solicitor has sworn an affidavit.
 There
has been no cross-examination.  The second defendant has tendered a proposed
Defence and Cross-claim (Exhibit 1).  It is unverified.
 She has also tendered
a copy of Memorandum 379070J (Exhibit 2).  The plaintiff has not adduced any
evidence.
<P>

7  	I shall refer briefly to some of the material that appears inter
alia from the affidavits.  This reference is not intended as
an exhaustive
recitation of relevant material.
<P>

8  	The second defendant was not a shareholder in the company.  It
had been owned and controlled by the first defendant and John
Ernest Pearce
(Pearce).  She was a director of it for a short period, following Pearce's
resignation.  Also, she worked for the company
during a brief period.
<P>

9  	The second defendant signed the mortgage following pressure and
assurances from the first defendant (including assurances that
the company was
sound and that the house was not at risk).  Further, she had been led to
believe that a mortgage would be given by
Pearce to secure the company's
indebtedness.
<P>

10  	Prior to the signing of the mortgage she did see a solicitor
(who she describes as the solicitor for the company).  Her affidavit
is silent
as to whether or not the solicitor gave her any advice.  She does not say that
he failed to give her any advice as to the
nature and effect of the mortgage.
She does not say that she then lacked understanding of the purpose and effect
of the transaction.
 She does complain that he failed to give her any
explanation concerning the financial position of the company or the financial
or
commercial risk that she would be undertaking by signing the mortgage.
<P>

11  	The second defendant says that she has no tertiary
qualifications and no business experience.  She says that if she had
appreciated
that she was undertaking a substantial risk that she would lose the
house, she would not have signed the mortgage.  She says she
did not read the
mortgage and her attention was not drawn to the fact that the provisions of the
memorandum were to be incorporated
into the mortgage.
<P>

12  	The second defendant says that she has never dealt with any
person on behalf of the plaintiff and that there were no negotiations
between
her and the plaintiff in relation to the mortgage.
<P>

13  	She says that she felt that she had no option but to sign the
Deed Poll (even though she held a belief that the indebtedness
of the company
was substantially less than the acknowledged amount).  She signed it because
she was told by the first defendant and
a solicitor that if she did not sign
the document then the ANZ was not prepared to restructure the business loan.
The consequence
of this would be that the ANZ would take possession and sell
the property pursuant to its mortgage.
<P>

14  	It seems clear from this evidence, that she had given another
mortgage (to ANZ) over the property to secure the indebtedness
of the
company.
<P>

15  	The proposed Defence and Cross-claim is a lengthy document (in
substance, the Defence and the Cross-claim raise similar matters).
 It purports
to raise a number of matters in answer to the plaintiff's claim.  It suffices
to refer to the principal matters raised
therein.  These are matters of duress,
undue influence, unconscionability, unjust contracts and an implied term that a
mortgage was
to have been obtained from Pearce.
<P>

16  	The evidence has unsatisfactory features (inter alia the
affidavit of the second defendant conveys the impression that it has
been
carefully drafted to give a selective presentation of material).  There was no
cross-examination.  Submissions were brief. 
Primarily, the second defendant
says that this is a case similar to that considered in <u>Garcia v National
Australia Bank Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20Aust%20Contract%20Reports%2090%2d096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) Aust Contract Reports 90-096.</a>  The plaintiff says
that the evidence falls well short of showing any entitlement to relief against
the plaintiff.
<P>

17  	The court has a discretionary power to set aside a default
judgment.  The power is exercised so as to ensure that justice is
best served
between the parties.  The applicant bears the onus of satisfying the court that
the relief sought should be granted.
<P>

18  	The single discretionary consideration agitated by the parties
is whether or not the second defendant has a bona fide defence
on the merits to
the plaintiff's claim for possession of the property.
<P>

19  	This is an application which has occasioned me some difficulty.
I have some reservation about the bona fides of matters now
raised by the
second defendant by way of Defence and Cross-claim.
<P>

20  	There is material before the court which has the potential to
support a claim for relief founded on the principles applied
in <u>Yerkey v
Jones</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2063%20CLR%20649" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 63 CLR 649.</a>  Whilst the claim has the potential to be
described as arguable, its prospects of success at any trial may not be good.
Its weaknesses
may be fully exposed if and when the full picture is presented
to the court.
<P>

21  	With some reluctance, I have finally come to the view that
justice would be best served if the default judgment was set aside
and the
second defendant is given an opportunity to present her case at trial.  In my
view, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to
oppose the application.
<P>

22  	I order that the default judgment be set aside.  I give leave to
the second defendant to file a Defence and Cross-claim within
seven days.  The
second defendant is to pay the costs of the Notice of Motion and any costs
thrown away by reason of the setting
aside of the default judgment.  The
exhibits may be returned.
<P>
