<b>1017/1998 CHRISTINE DEL GALLO v NEIL LEWIS FREDERIKSEN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	MASTER:  This is an application under the Defacto
Relationships 1984 brought by the plaintiff for the adjustment of the parties'
property interests.  There were no children of the relationship although the
plaintiff had two children by a former marriage.
<P>

2   	The parties are agreed that that they had a defacto
relationship from late January 1993 until 30 January 1996.  At that time
they
resided in the defendant's house which had recently been reconstructed at 24
Surf Road, North Curl Curl.  The parties first
met in September 1989 after
which they began staying and sleeping at each others homes particularly on
weekends.  The plaintiff contends
that the defacto relationship commenced in
April 1990 when she says that the parties were living together four to five
nights a week
admittedly in two houses, namely, the plaintiff's house at 66
Duncan Street, Maroubra and the defendant's house at 24 Surf Road,
North Curl
Curl.  
<P>

3   	The defendant denies there was a defacto relationship until
January 1993.  The matter is of some moment as the major part of
the
plaintiff's contributions took place between early 1991 and January 1993 when
the parties demolished the building on 24 Surf
Road and built a new house which
they occupied in January 1993.  
<P>

4   	In order to put the matter in perspective it is necessary
to look at some of the chronology in the matter.  The plaintiff was
born in
1956 and is now aged 43 years.  She has two children, Katie born 11 June 1981
and John born 13 August 1983.  In April 1990
Katie would have been 8 years of
age and John 6 years of age.  Accordingly there is little possibility of either
child giving appropriate
evidence as to the disputed period of the defacto
relationship given their ages.
<P>

5   	In 1990 the parties commenced going out together and slept
at each other's home at weekends.  In April 1990 the plaintiff says
that a
regular pattern of residence emerged in which she says that the defendant spent
Thursday, Friday and Saturday and each second
Monday evening at the plaintiff's
Maroubra home while she spent Sunday night at the defendant's home.  The
defendant for his part
asserts that he spent Monday or Thursday or Friday night
and occasionally more than one night at the plaintiff's home.  He agrees
that
the plaintiff and her children would often stay on Sunday night at his home.

<P>

6   	On 7 May 1990 the plaintiff mortgaged her home at 66 Duncan
Street, Maroubra for $50,000 for three years and the funds were
used to
discharge a liability which she had to her sister.  She had previously acquired
the property by buying out her husband's
interest in it and to do this she
needed assistance from both her sister and her father who gave that assistance.

<P>

7   	On 2 February 1991 the defendant moved from his home at 24
Surf Road to the nearby property 26A Surf Road which he had leased.
 This was
to facilitate the demolition of 24 Surf Road which demolition appears to have
commenced in July 1991 and continued for
about seven weeks.  The plaintiff and
the defendant as well as others were involved in the demolition and the extent
of the individual
contributions is a matter to which I will return later in
this judgment.  
<P>

8   	In October 1991 work started on the building of the new
home at 24 Surf Road.  The parties had been involved in drawing up
plans and
obtaining their approval.  At this stage the plaintiff had started making
payment for various amounts incurred by the defendant
in the work.  She paid
bills amounting to $52,432.37 and according to her she was reimbursed by the
defendant as to the sum of $50,327.
 The home, of course, cost more than this
and the balance of the funds were supplied by the defendant.  The actual
building cost
was $140,000.
<P>

9   	Both parties worked on the construction of the new house
together with subcontractors and numerous friends of the defendant.
 
<P>

10   	By April 1992 the defendant was able to move back into the
partly completed residence at 24 Surf Road and in January 1993
the plaintiff
and her children moved into 24 Surf Road and commenced to live with the
defendant.  Thereafter there was work done
by the parties in finishing the
premises.  At this stage the plaintiff let her premises at 55 Duncan Street,
Maroubra, initially
at $333.  From time to time thereafter she would repay her
father sums which owed him and in May 1993 the plaintiff discharged the
mortgage for $50,000 which she had earlier taken out.  Some assistance was
provided by her father who advanced somewhere between
$5,000 and $10,000 to
enable this to happen.  The plaintiff also received an inheritance of $15,000
which may also have been used.
 In January 1994 the rent for the plaintiff's
premises at 66 Duncan Street was increased to $380 per week.
<P>

11   	In November 1994 the parties occupied separate bedrooms at
the home and this continued until Easter 1995.  On 10 March 1995
the plaintiff
sold her house at Maroubra for $388,000.  There is evidence of some assistance
by the defendant in making the residence
ready for sale.  On 30 June 1995 the
plaintiff purchased a property at 1 Delaigh Avenue, North Curl Curl for
$335,000.  On 14 July
1995 she rented it out for $400 per week.
<P>

12   	On 16 January 1996 the plaintiff and her children left 24
Surf Road and took up residence in her property at Delaigh Avenue.
<P>

13   	The question of whether or not the plaintiff and the
defendant were living together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic
basis must be determined in accordance with the principles referred to by the
Court of Appeal in <b>Light v. Anderson &amp; Ors </b>(1992) D.F.C. 95 120.
They referred to the decision of Mr. Justice Kearney in <b>Simonis v. Perpetual
Trustee Co. Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2021%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 21 N.S.W.L.R. 677</a> where His Honour in dealing
with the expression in the Act after reviewing the authorities said at page 685
the following:
<P>

 "I consider that the expression under consideration constitutes a single
composite expression of a comprehensive notion or concept,
and therefore has to
be approached by considering the expression as a whole and not in several
parts.
<P>

	This approach, as adopted by Powell J, was also the approach preferred by the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Waterford's case
(see 106).  I consider that
the factors referred to by Powell J, while not being regarded as a complete
test, serve the purpose adequately
in the present case to determine the
question of eligible person.  The factors indicated by Powell J are as follows
(at 459):
<P>

"1	the duration of the relationship;
<P>

2.	the nature and extent of the common residence;
<P>

3.	whether or not a sexual relationship existed;
<P>

4.	the degree of financial interdependence, and any arrangements for support,
between or by the parties;
<P>

5.	the ownership, use and acquisition of property;
<P>

6.	the procreation of children;
<P>

7.	the care and support of children;
<P>

8.	the performance of household duties;
<P>

9.	the degree of mutual commitment and mutual support;
<P>

10.	reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship."
<P>

	His Honour also referred to the support to be gained for this approach from
the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission
concerning de facto
relationships (LRC 36 (1983)).  His Honour quoted the following passage in the
report (at 459):
<P>

"17.10.  The application of the basic definition to the myriad facets of
private personal relationships between men and women will
inevitably be a
matter of degree and proportion.  The attributes and circumstances of such
relationships differ greatly, ranging
from what is little more than a casual
liaison, to a continuing affectionate companionship, to a long term merging of
lives and resources.
 Moreover, the nature and quality of a particular
relationship may change and develop over time, making it sometimes very
difficult
to pin-point a time when the relationship should assume a new legal
significance."
<P>

	As I understand it, the parties substantially treated Powell J's approach as
being appropriate to the circumstances of the present
case."
<P>

14   		Obviously, the list is not immutable and in particular
cases other factors will have to be considered.  The list is of use
and it is
convenient to discuss many of the incidents of the relationship between the
plaintiff and the defendant under the headings
set out above.
<P>

<b>1.	The duration of the relationship</b>
<P>

15   	The overall relationship was of a little under six
years.
<P>

<b>2.	The nature and extent of the common residence</b>
<P>

16   	The critical question is of course the period between
April 1990 and January 1993.  I have previously set out the assertions
of the
two parties.  
<P>

17   	The defendant was by occupation a naturopath and he would
carry on his practice at his home and also in a clinic at Chatswood.
 The
defendant was a teacher and she had employment with the Department of
Education.  In addition her children were enrolled at
schools in the Maroubra
area which is course quite a distance from North Curl Curl.  There is little
outside evidence concerning
the extent of the common residence at this stage.
There does not seem to be much dispute that the plaintiff stayed with the
defendant
along with her children on a Sunday night.  They would leave early on
Monday morning to return to Maroubra so the children could
go to school.  The
defendant concedes that on occasions the plaintiff also stayed on Saturday
night.  The real contest seems to be
how often the defendant stayed at the
plaintiff's home at Maroubra during the week.  He concedes one night a week,
usually Monday
night.  
<P>

18   	Essentially it is the case that the plaintiff who did yoga
would engage in that activity on a Wednesday night.  It is also
clear that the
defendant had his clinic at home at North Curl Curl on Wednesday in contrast to
Thursday, Friday and Saturday when
he would attend his practice at
Chatswood.
<P>

19   	When giving his evidence about what time he started his
practice on the Wednesday morning the defendant appeared to me to
be a little
evasive.  The true explanation may have been that he would go surfing that
morning rather than being there early to attend
his patients.  The only other
evidence about whether the defendant attended on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
night at the plaintiff's
home is some evidence from the plaintiff's mother, Mrs
Green that on occasions she would telephone her daughter who would tell her
that the defendant was staying at her home.  She said this occasionally
happened on Friday and Saturday nights.  
<P>

20   	This evidence does not really assist in determining the
frequency.  The plaintiff alleges that it was a consistent pattern.
 The
defendant says it was occasionally.  There was nothing in the way the plaintiff
gave her evidence which would tend to indicate
she was not speaking truthfully.
However, the defendant in cross examination did tend to down play the extent of
his residence at
times in a manner inconsistent with his sworn evidence.  See
for example his evidence about Monday nights.  In the circumstances
I think the
only safe conclusion is that the parties' usually cohabited on Sunday night at
the defendant's place and for three or
four nights at the plaintiff's home on
Monday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday nights.  
<P>

<b>3.	Whether or not a sexual relationship existed</b>
<P>

21   	It is clear that there was a sexual relationship between
the parties except for a period of some five months when they were
going
through difficulties arising from the defendant's insistence that the plaintiff
sign some agreement dealing with their property
rights.  At that stage the
defendant moved into a separate bedroom.
<P>

<b>4.	The degree of financial interdependence, and any arrangements for
support, between or by the parties</b>
<P>

22   	One of the clear indicators of financial interdependence
in the period April 1990 to January 1993 is the payment of bills
on behalf of
the defendant by the plaintiff which payment commenced in May 1991.  The
parties appear to have met the outgoings on
their respective properties from
their own resources. 
<P>

<b>5.	The ownership, use and acquisition of property</b>
<P>

23   	The relevant property always remained in the defendant's
name and there appeared to be no other jointly owned property.  Each
party had
cars but it appeared that by preference the parties would use the plaintiff's 4
wheel drive vehicle for outings together.
 There was in the evidence some
dispute on various conversations about whether or not the parties were building
a home for them together
or a house together.  The defendant attached
significance to this maintaining that there was always reference to a home
rather than
a house.  To my mind this distinction is of no significance given
the way in which people, not conscious of any dispute about ownership,
use the
words "home" and "house" interchangeably.
<P>

<b>6.	The procreation of children</b>
<P>

24   	In this case the parties had no children.
<P>

<b>7.	The care and support of children</b>
<P>

25   	For the relevant period in dispute from April 1990 until
January 1993 it is clear that the plaintiff's children were based
in Maroubra
where their friends and school were located.  The defendant conceded that he
did take a role in caring and supporting
the children but that this rarely
occurred until the parties commenced living together at Surf Road in January
1993.  It would seem
to me, given the nature of the arrangements that the
defendant's version on this matter is to be preferred. 
<P>

<b>8.	The performance of household duties</b>
<P>

26   	There is little evidence on this aspect for the relevant
disputed period.  However it seems likely that apart from cooking
meals for
each other, there was not a great deal of performance of household duties.  The
plaintiff alleges that she would do the
defendant's washing which he would
bring to her once a week.  This was denied by the defendant but I am prepared
to accept the plaintiff
on this aspect.
<P>

<b>9.	The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support</b>
<P>

27   	For the relevant period the main thrust of the parties'
endeavour was the demolition and building of a new house at Surf Road.
 It is
perfectly clear from the evidence that both parties participated in this in
different ways.  There are disputes about precisely
how much of the physical
work the plaintiff did but leaving that to one side, it is clear, and the
defendant concedes this, that
the plaintiff spent a lot of time researching the
project for appropriate fittings, materials and other matters concerned with
the
building and the planning of the new house.  The plaintiff's father helped
at times with plans and suggestions and clearly there
was a mutual effort in
this whole enterprise.  I would have thought that there was a substantial
mutual commitment and support between
each other in respect of this venture and
that such support continued over into the period after January 1993.
<P>

<b>10.	Reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship</b>
<P>

28   	There was little evidence given by outsiders about the
public aspects of the relationship.  Some friends gave evidence but
they did
not touch on these public aspects other than pointing to the plaintiff as the
defendant's girlfriend.  
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

29   	The defendant in this case emphasised in submissions the
fact that the parties chose between April 1990 and January 1993 not
to conduct
their relationship from a single residence.  This failure was linked to the
failure of the defendant to take any effective
role in the parenting of the
plaintiff's children and the separation of their financial affairs to indicate
that no defacto relationship
existed.  On many occasions I have emphasised the
importance of the public face of the relationship.  In the present case there
was
little evidence to show a public face of the relationship as being the
parties living together as man and wife.
<P>

30   	I have earlier referred to the decision of Powell J in
<b>Roy v Sturgeon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20NSWLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 NSWLR 454.</a>  At page 458 His Honour had the
following to say:-
<P>

It seems to me that, to attempt, as Young J appears to have done, to breakdown,
into discrete elements, a single phrase intended
to describe a single concept,
and then to proceed to examine the facts with a view to ascertain whether, in
the particular case,
each such discrete element can be said to exist, is likely
to be productive of error. Thus, while I accept that the concept of a
man and
woman living together as man and wife does not necessarily imply that the two
persons in question are always living together
under the same roof (see, eg, Re
Fagan (at 464; 822)), it does not necessarily follow that a man and woman, each
of whom maintains
a separate home, are to be regarded as living together
because they are accustomed regularly to spend time together, and even sleep
together, in the home of one. So, too, while I accept that, while, in the
normal course of events, one would expect to find that
a man and woman living
together as husband and wife, whether de jure or de facto, were accustomed to
provide emotional support to
each other, it does not necessarily follow that
the presence of such support establishes, while the absence of such support
denies,
that the basis of their relationship is a bona fide domestic one.
Finally, while I accept that the presence, or absence, in a particular
case, of
one or more of the factors referred to by Young J as "the main guidelines" is a
matter to which one might properly have
regard in determining whether the
relationship under consideration involved a man and woman living together as
husband and wife on
a bona fide domestic basis, it does not necessarily follow,
either, that his Honour's list of "guidelines" is exhaustive of the matters
to
which regard might be had, or, that the presence of those factors establishes,
while the absence of any one of them denies, that
the relationship under
consideration has, or had, the relevant character.
<P>

31   	Of interest is His Honour's words where he refers to the
question of the parties living together under the same roof.  In
the present
case it is not without significance that the parties commenced to sleep
together in 1990 and over a period formulated
a plan for the construction of
the new house.  One might be forgiven for imagining that if there were a
defacto relationship one
might have found the defendant upon the demolition of
the house moving in to live with the plaintiff at her home.  That arrangement
could well have been beneficial for both of them.  That, however, did not occur
and the defendant took the step of leasing a property
nearby.  The evidence did
not really explore whether this was because of his part-time work from home or
perhaps a desire to be near
the site of the demolition and reconstruction.  Be
that as it may the fact that the parties did not take this step does, I think,
have to be taken into account.  There would be many factors perhaps why the
plaintiff may have left it to the completion of that
project before moving such
as, for example, the placement of her children at school and local friends.
Although the evidence shows
some commitment together with the project and some
inter-dependence in respect of contributions to that project, I think the
appropriate
conclusion is that the defacto relationship did not commence until
January 1993 when the plaintiff moved in to the completed property
on 24 Surf
Road, North Curl Curl.
<P>

<b>Can pre-relationship contributions be taken into account in the adjustment
process?</b>
<P>

32   	This brings me to the question which was debated in
submissions about whether one can take into account contributions prior
to the
commencement of the relationship.  In <b>Roy v Sturgeon </b>(supra) this matter
was dealt with at length by His Honour Mr Justice Powell then sitting at first
instance.  At pages 460 through
to 466 His Honour analysed the provisions of
the <b>Defacto Relationships Act</b> and the <b>Family Law Act</b> and
ultimately came to a conclusion that, contrary to the approach taken by the
Family Court in applications under s 79 of the <b>Family Law Act</b>, it was
not open to this Court when dealing with applications under s 20 of the Act to
have regard to contributions said to have
been made prior to commencement of
the of the particular "defacto relationship".  His Honour pointed out that
there was no injustice
in this result for it would still remain open to a
defacto partner to rely upon prior contributions as supporting a claim under
the
general law.  (See the Act ss 7, 14(2), 38(1), 38(2).)
<P>

33   	This aspect of the decision which was not over-turned on
appeal from the particular decision has been referred to at first
instance in
two cases.  The first of these is <b>Griffiths v Brodingham </b>Fam LR 822 a
decision of Chisholm J of the Family Court who was hearing an application under
s 20 of the <b>Defacto Relationships Act</b> pursuant to the cross-vesting
legislation.  His Honour concluded that it was open to the court to have regard
to the contributions
of the kind mentioned in s 20 notwithstanding that those
contributions might have been made before or after the period of the defacto
relationship.  His Honour's conclusion is at page 834 to 835.  His Honour's
reasons, particularly his consideration of the Family
Law Act decisions do not
seem to take account of the significant differences between the Family Law Act
and the Defacto Relationships
Act.  However, I will not go into His Honour's
reasons at this stage in detail for reasons to which I will later refer.  The
second
decision is a decision of Mr Justice Bryson in <b>Foster v Evans</b>
(1997) DFC 95-193.  He was there concerned with contributions which were made
after the conclusion of a relationship.  His Honour
did not accept that s 20
within its own terms contained a limitation for the period during which there
was a defacto relationship
as a period during which any contributions to the
welfare of the family might have been made.  He ultimately held that there
could
be contributions after the defacto relationship in circumstances where
one of the partners continued to care for a child.  
<P>

34   	So far as I am concerned I think the matter is put to rest
by the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in <b>Fotheringham v
Fotheringham.  </b>In that court the Judges were Powell JA, Beazley JA and
Stein JA.  One of the principle matters in issue was whether it is possible
for
a court to have regard to contributions made during an earlier period of a
defacto relationship which pre-dated the relationship
which was brought forward
in the proceedings.  The question which arose was whether it might be necessary
for there to be leave to
bring the action in respect of the earlier period of
the relationship.  Inherent in the judgment of Mr Justice Powell is an
acceptance
of the proposition which he had adumbrated in <b>Roy v Sturgeon</b>
that it is not possible to take account of contributions prior to a defacto
relationship.  Justice Beazley agreed with the decision
of Justice Stein who
held that the relevant six week interruption did not mean that there were two
periods of cohabitation.  Accordingly,
it was not necessary for either of these
two justices to address the point in question in these present proceedings. 
<P>

35   	However, the decision of Powell J is a decision of a judge
of an appellate court reaffirming a decision which he had made
at first
instance.  In these circumstances I feel constrained to follow his Honour's
decision in <b>Roy v Sturgeon </b>and for this reason it is fruitless for me to
embark upon a consideration in detail of the decision of Bryson J and Chisholm
J and
to contrast them with Mr Justice Powell's decision in <b>Roy v Sturgeon
</b>on this point.  However I do note that <b>Griffiths v Brodingham
</b>predated <b>Evans v Marmont </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a> in which the majority
relied upon the difference between the provisions of the Family Law Act and the
Defacto Relationships Act.
 They were of the view that those differences were
conspicuous and deliberate.  They noted the lack of the application of s
75(2)(o)
which is fundamental to views taken by Powell J in <b>Roy v
Sturgeon</b>.  Mr Justice Bryson does not seem to have been referred to these
aspects of the approach of Powell J.
<P>

36   	I turn first to consider the property of the parties at
the commencement of the relationship which I have found, namely, in
late
January 1993.  At the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff owned the
property at 66 Duncan Street, Maroubra.  The
evidence does not establish its
value at that time.  However, some years later it was sold for $388,000.  The
plaintiff also had
an outstanding loan of $50,000 to a private lender at that
stage.  She no doubt had furnishings and personal possessions.  She had
a
Mitsubishi car the value of which does not appear in the evidence.  She had
superannuation of a minor amount.  Apparently the amount
of her superannuation
outstanding at 30 June 1993 was about $1,000.  
<P>

37   	So far as the defendant is concerned he had the following
property:-
<P>

1.	24 Surf Road, North Curl Curl which had a value of $385,000 and was
unencumbered.
<P>

2.	Unit 1/20 Pindara Crescent, Lismore unencumbered.  The evidence does not
disclose its value at the date of commencement of cohabitation.
<P>

3.	Household furniture and effects.
<P>

4.	1982 Model BMW 318i.
<P>

5.	Savings of approximately $20,000.
<P>

6.	Naturopath practice.
<P>

38   	At the conclusion of the relationship the plaintiff
owned:-
<P>

1.	The house at 1A Delaigh Avenue, North Curl Curl which had been purchased in
June 1995 for $335,000 and subsequently rented. 
It was unencumbered.
<P>

2.	A car now estimated to have a value of $24,000.
<P>

3.	Furniture now estimated to have a value of $5,000.
<P>

4.	Superannuation which as at January 1997 amounted to some $12,000.
<P>

5.	Cash of an amount which is not clear.
<P>

39   	Since the separation the plaintiff has purchased another
property.  In mid December 1998 she purchased a unit at 42 Evans
Street,
Harboard for $245,000 using finance of $205,000.  The property is tenanted and
currently has a shortfall of $50 per week.
 The defendant in July 1995
purchased 39 Griffin Road, North Curl Curl for the sum of $280,000.  He
borrowed $220,000 from Westpac
and used his savings for the balance.  He rented
out the property for $350 per week.  
<P>

40   	The defendant's situation therefore at the conclusion of
the relationship was as follows:-
<P>

1.	Property at Surf Road, North Curl Curl $460,000
<P>

2.	1/20 Pindara Crescent, Lismore          
<P>

3.	39 Griffin Road, North Curl Curl
<P>

4.	The car
<P>

5.	Furniture and effects
<P>

6.	Some savings
<P>

7.	Telstra and AMP shares worth several thousand dollars.  At that stage he had
a liability to Westpac at something under $220,000
which he had borrowed to
purchase Griffin Road.
<P>

41   	The parties have agreed a number of present values of
properties.  
<P>

1.	39 Griffin Road, North Curl Curl has a current value of $600,000.  
<P>

2.	The property 1 Pindara Crescent, Lismore, has a current value of $80,000.
<P>

3.	The property at 1A Delaigh Avenue, North Curl Curl owned by the plaintiff
has a current value of $425,000.
<P>

4.	Valuation evidence establishes a fair market value of 24 Surf Road, North
Curl Curl at $650,000.
<P>

42   	I turn to the contributions which are alleged to have
occurred since the commencement of the relationship which I have found
was in
January 1993.  I will first deal with the financial contributions.
<P>

43   	So far as the plaintiff is concerned I have earlier
referred to her efforts in assisting by financing some payments with the
defendant repaying her thereafter.  Some of these did occur in or after late
January 1993 but they are of a small amount.  However,
there is the balance
which was then due being the difference between the amount which she had paid
and had been reimbursed.  The
amount which the plaintiff has provided in this
way is $2,105.64.  The plaintiff also identified four other financial
contributions
to the house.  These were:-
<P>

1.	Payment of a landscape design in the sum of $90.
<P>

2.	Payment of interior decorator's fees of $160.
<P>

3.	Payment to a tradesman for $160 for one day's work to do the cornices in the
defendant's clinic area.
<P>

4.	Payment to a painter of $240 to paint the defendant's clinic area.
<P>

44   	Given the evidence I am prepared to accept that the
plaintiff paid for these items.  Apart from this it is important in this
matter
to appreciate that it was the defendant who paid substantially for the
construction of the house.  This was in the order of
$140,000.  The house was
built on land which he already owned unencumbered at the commencement of the
relationship.  The parties
also met the major expenses in respect of each of
their own houses individually.  By this I mean that the plaintiff met either
from
the rent or her own income the expenses in connection with her house at
Maroubra and subsequently at Delaigh Avenue while the defendant
met expenses
such as council rates, water rates in respect of Surf Road.  The plaintiff did
however, I accept, pay the house contents
insurance for Surf Road.  The
plaintiff paid with assistance from the children's father, all the education
related expenses of her
children.  Each party met his or her medical and dental
expenses.  So far as the contribution to household expenses the plaintiff
suggests that she paid the most of these while the defendant suggests that he
paid one third and the plaintiff two thirds.  There
is no evidence which would
allow me to assess these claims particularly as the parties have not put
forward a detailed analysis of
their financial affairs over the three years of
the relationship.  I accept that the plaintiff paid most of the household
expenses.
<P>

45   	I turn to the non-financial contributions.  The first of
the non-financial contributions which have to be considered are the
contributions to the finishing of Surf Road and some work done on the parties
other properties.  So far as Surf Road is concerned
it is clear that by the
time the plaintiff and her children moved in at the commencement of the
relationship that the property was
substantially completed.  There were a
number of matters that had to be done.  The plaintiff alleges that she spent
hundreds of hours
working on the premises finishing it including:
<P>

(1) The planning and execution of landscaping work.
<P>

(2) Watering.
<P>

(3) Sweeping.
<P>

(4) Vacuuming.
<P>

(5) Cleaning.
<P>

(6) Undertaking painting jobs.
<P>

(7) Repairing jobs such as lose handles.
<P>

(8) Restoring gyprock walls in the downstairs bathroom.
<P>

(9) Painting those gyprock walls.
<P>

(10) Removal of debris and rubbish after works. 
<P>

46   	I have no doubt that she did these tasks.  In respect of
some of them it is clear that there would have been some assistance
from the
defendant.  However, when looking at these works it should be appreciated that
they pale into insignificance compared with
the amount of work which was done
by the parties during the construction of the house.  Although the landscaping
took some work in
preparation it is clear that, although attractive, the garden
is not a substantial one.  
<P>

47   	The plaintiff alleged that she assisted in certain work at
the Griffin Road property which the defendant had purchased and
subsequently
had let.  This was clearing the back yard and wall papering a room over one
weekend.  There was also the erection of
a gyprock wall.  The defendant denies
that he was assisted by the plaintiff in these tasks.  However, he does admit
that the plaintiff
made him lunch on the day when the gyprock wall was created.
Given the evidence that I have heard I think I would assume that the
plaintiff
was there and that she provided lunch and also would have been assisting.
Accordingly, I accept the plaintiff on this aspect.
 
<P>

48   	The defendant for his part suggests that when the Delaigh
Avenue was purchased that he did work to assist in preparing the
property so it
could be rented out to tenants.  The defendant also suggested that he did some
work on the Maroubra property to prepare
it for sale.  The work seems to have
been limited to painting on one weekend and fixing the side gate and some
fences.  So far as
his work on the Delaigh Avenue property is concerned, he
says:
<P>

(1) He helped an electrician install new light fittings
<P>

(2) He wheel-barrowed soil from the front of the garden to the back.
<P>

(3) He cut down two trees in the back yard.
<P>

(4) He repaired a phone socket.
<P>

(5) He installed some brackets to mount the clothes dryer.
<P>

(6) He pruned the back yard trees and shrubs.
<P>

(7) He watered various plants.
<P>

(8) He mowed the lawns.
<P>

49   	Most of these matters were admitted by the plaintiff. 
<P>

50   	So far as the contributions to the properties other than
Surf Road are concerned it seems to me that the parties did something
for each
other in respect of each other's property.  If anything the properties of the
plaintiff might have received some more attention
than that of one property
purchased by the defendant although the amounts involved and the effort
involved is not substantial unlike
the pre-relationship work done on Surf Road.

<P>

51   	I turn to the non-financial contributions which are
respectively the roles of homemaker and parenting.  Both parties throughout
the
relevant three year period of the relationship were working and the plaintiff's
two children were living with the parties.  
<P>

52   	So far as the carrying out of ordinary household chores
are concerned the parties' versions differed but mainly on matters
of emphasis.
It seems that the majority of the housework was done by the plaintiff with the
children as well as the defendant assisting.
 In particular it seems the
washing up used to be done by the defendant during the last four months of the
relationship.  The defendant
suggested that when the plaintiff was at yoga
classes on Monday and Wednesday nights he would cook dinner and look after the
children.
 The plaintiff gave more detail on that aspect and it seems that the
majority of the work was probably done by the plaintiff before
she left in the
morning.  The plaintiff normally got home at 8.30 pm and this is not far
removed from the defendant often returning
home by 8 pm.
<P>

53   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff did the major part of
the household work.  She was also primarily responsible for the parenting
of
the children although there was some assistance from the defendant from time to
time.  
<P>

54   	In considering what is an appropriate order to make in the
present matter there are a number of matters put forward which
need to be
further considered.  The first of these is the fact that the parties, in
particular the defendant, seems to have over-capitalised
the property at Surf
Road.  There was valuation evidence of this property which indicated that the
value of the property in January
1993 was $385,000, in January 1996 $460,000
and at 17 May 1999 $650,000.  The parties also had it valued on the basis that
the original
property still remained on the site.  This property would have
been valued in 1993 at $300,000 to $320,000 in 1996 $360,000 to $370,000
and
$500,000 to $520,000 in 1999.  Given the price of the building of the new
house, namely, $140,000 and the enormous amount of
work of the parties involved
one can see that there has been some over capitalisation.  However, given my
decision on the commencement
date for the relationship, there was in fact the
new house on the property at that time and, accordingly, one has this as a
starting
point.  The property increased in value during the period of the
relationship by $75,000.  How much of this was due to the matters
such as the
landscaping and other minor matters done by the plaintiff in contrast to the
natural effects of inflation, does not appear
in the evidence.  It is
appropriate, however, that I give consideration to this work and take some
account of it in the figure to
which I will arrive.
<P>

55   	The other major matter which was advanced by the defendant
was the effect on the plaintiff's financial situation as a result
of the
decision to live together at 24 Surf Road.  This meant that the plaintiff could
let out her Maroubra residence and Delaigh
Avenue which was purchased once she
had sold Maroubra.  The amount received by her was not insubstantial.  The
evidence would seem
to establish that she was able to use the rent to
substantially repay a major part of her loan of $50,000 less the amount of her
inheritance of $15,000.  By the time the matter was at the preparation stage
when she swore her affidavits she was able to accumulate
reasonable savings.

<P>

56   	Having regard to these facts and what was alleged to be
the over capitalisation which I have treated somewhat differently
the defendant
submitted that there should be no adjustment as in the words of <b>Evans v
Marmont</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a> at 76 the case was one which could be regarded
as "involving shared activities or reciprocal benefits not giving rise to any
disproportionate
burden which would be just and equitable to satisfy by an
adjustment of interest in property".
<P>

57   	In the present case I do not think this is appropriate.
First I have already dealt with what I perceive to be the correct
way of
approaching the starting point, namely, the value of the property at the
commencement of the relationship.  Second, the suggestion
that the plaintiff
received benefits from her Maroubra properties ignores two crucial factors.
These are:-
<P>

1. That it was the parties' decision to live together jointly at Surf Road.  At
that time the defendant well knew that the plaintiff
would be letting her house
and the decision to live together was one made in that knowledge.  There is
some incongruity later, after
the relationship ceases to exist, in maintaining
a different position.
<P>

2.	During the relationship the defendant himself acquired the Griffin Road
property and he has had the benefit of the very substantial
increase in the
value of that between the time of its acquisition and the present time.
<P>

58   	The plaintiff in her evidence referred to opportunities
for promotion which she did not pursue during the course of the relationship.
These matters were not referred to in submissions.  These matters are not
appropriate to take into account for two reasons:-
<P>

1.	It involves a determination of the likelihood of her being promoted if she
applied for a position and sufficient facts are not
available.
<P>

2.	It is an attempt to penalise a party for lost opportunities as the
relationship did not work out in the end.  The plaintiff refrained
from
applying for promotion for reasons which were no doubt satisfactory to her at
that time.
<P>

59   	I think it is appropriate to take into account the
plaintiff's contributions in the way I have indicated and a small balance
in
the defendant's favour in respect of the contributions to properties other than
Surf Road.  There is also to be taken into account
the greater proportion of
the household parenting task undertaken by the plaintiff over the three years
of the relationship.  Given
these factors it is appropriate that there be an
adjustment of the parties' property interests by an order for the defendant to
pay
the plaintiff a sum of $35,000.  
<P>

60   	I have not dealt in these reasons to this point with any
of the contributions prior to the commencement of the relationship
in January
1993.  In case the matter goes on appeal and another court takes a different
view of the commencement of the relationship
I record the following
observations in respect of some of the earlier contributions.  
<P>

1.	The plaintiff clearly spent a substantial amount of time researching the
matters connected with the design of the property. 
The defendant acknowledged
this and was indeed grateful for the effort which she put into pricing items
and even attending courses
at Sydney Building Information Centre which gave her
the appropriate knowledge to help the parties in the project they had
undertaken.
 
<P>

2.	The first area of work on the reconstruction project was the demolition of
the old house.  That took place over a number of weekends
and I accept the
plaintiff's evidence that this was seven weekends.  She assisted on five
weekends and the demolition work as can
be imagined involved the physical
demolition of the building.  It included stacking of tiles and bricks and also
cleaning the bricks
so they could be used for the new foundations.  The work
was done on the weekends and there was also assistance from other friends
of
the defendant.  It seems to me that each of the two parties in this matter did
work to the best of their ability on this part
of the endeavour and although
the type of work that each could do was probably different the contribution was
a shared one and I
would regard it as one where the plaintiff has done a
substantial amount of work.  It was not as much as that of the defendant but
was not far from it.  The defendant should be credited with help he had from
his friends.
<P>

3.	The next area of work consisted of the actual construction.  In this area,
as with the demolition there was some evidence from
friends of the defendant
speaking of what they observed the plaintiff to do.  Given their intermittent
appearance on the site I do
not place a great deal of store on this evidence.
The construction took place over about four months and the plaintiff says that
she did a lot of physical work on the property averaging about ten hours per
week.  In some areas the plaintiff was shown to be incorrect
in precisely what
work was done but I have no doubt she did assist in a substantial way, even if
it might have been ancillary work
such as driving to get building items, during
the weekends when the parties were working.
<P>

4.	There is evidence of over-capitalisation touched on earlier and this needs
to be more carefully considered if the commencement
date of the relationship is
April 1990.
<P>

61   	The orders of the Court are:-
<P>

1.	I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff by way of adjustment of the
parties' property interests the sum of $35,000.
<P>

2.	Subject to submissions, I make no order as to costs.
