<b>2298/99 - AAPT LIMITED  v  CABLE &amp; WIRELESS OPTUS LIMITED &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings arise out of a contested takeover
bid and have been conducted on an extremely urgent basis. 
After some
interlocutory skirmishes in the previous week, the case was heard on a final
basis on 17 and 18 May 1999.  On 20 May 1999
I delivered an ex tempore summary
of the reasons for judgment which are set out more fully below, and made an
order dismissing the
plaintiff's summons.  I dealt with costs after the parties
had the chance to consider my full reasons for judgment.
<P>

2  	AAPT (`AAPT') and the first defendant (`CWO') are listed
companies which are competitors in the information technology and
telecommunications
industry.  CWO, by its wholly owned subsidiary, the second
defendant (`CWOI'), has announced a takeover bid for AAPT.  It is a cash
bid at
$5 per share, subject to conditions which include a 90% minimum acceptance
condition and a condition (clause 8.1(e) of the
offer) relating to approval of
the acquisition by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (`ACCC').
Documents purporting
to be a Part A statement and Offer were registered with
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (`ASIC') on 27 April
1999
and copies of them were served on AAPT on 28 April 1999.  By virtue of s 637 of
the Corporations Law, the Part A statement and
Offers could not have been sent
to AAPT's shareholders prior to 13 May 1999.
<P>

3  	On 4 May 1999 AAPT's solicitors wrote to the defendants'
solicitors setting out AAPT's concerns as to alleged deficiencies in
the Part A
statement.  Subsequent correspondence and a meeting between the solicitors did
not resolve the differences between the
parties and consequently AAPT commenced
the present proceedings by summons filed on 10 May 1999.  AAPT seeks various
orders which
would either enjoin the defendants from sending the Part A
statement and Offers or require the dispatch of supplementary disclosure
material.
<P>

4  	As presented at the hearing, AAPT's case is that the Part A
statement fails to comply with the content requirements of s 750
of the
Corporations Law in four respects, and that the dispatch of the Part A
statement would be misleading or deceptive conduct
or conduct likely to mislead
or deceive for the purposes of s 995 of the Corporations Law.  A challenge to
CWOI's purchase of 10.65%
of the shares in AAPT on 16 April 1999, based on s
698 of the Corporations Law, was abandoned at the hearing.
<P>

5  	The four challenges to the Part A statement are:
<P>

(a)	it does not adequately or accurately state the intentions of CWOI for the
purposes of clause 20 of Part A of s 750 of the Corporations
Law;
<P>

(b)	it does not disclose the anticipated synergies or benefits which would
arise from the merger as required by clause 17 of Part
A of s 750 of the
Corporations Law;
<P>

(c)	it does not disclose material information with respect to negotiations with
the ACCC as required by clause 17;  and
<P>

(d)	it does not disclose certain aspects of funding arrangements for the bid as
required by clause 17.
<P>

6  	I propose to set out the facts relevant to these contentions, and
then to examine each of them in turn.  Since I regard the
question of
disclosure of the offeror's intentions as a much more substantial question than
the plaintiff's other complaints about
the Part A statement, most of my reasons
for judgment are directed to that question.  However, before I turn to any of
those matters
I shall deal with some issues about the admissibility of the
evidence of the plaintiff's financial expert, Mr Lonergan.
<P>

<b>Mr Lonergan's evidence</b>
<P>

7  	Wayne Lonergan is a partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers, working in
the Financial Advisory Services Group of the firm.  He has
practised for over
25 years as a chartered accountant specialising in valuations and associated
financial advice.  He says that during
the course of his career he has advised
many companies and their shareholders in takeover bids, at times advising an
offeree and
at times advising an offeror.  He has held many positions of
responsibility in his chosen field, and is presently a member of the
Australian
Accounting Standards Board and president of the National Council of the
Securities Institute of Australia.  However, he
admitted in cross-examination
that in the past five years he had not assisted anyone in the drafting of a
Part A or Part B statement,
or in the drafting of a prospectus.  He also
admitted that his expertise is largely centred on valuing assets such as shares
or assets
belonging to publicly listed companies.  
<P>

8  	According to his letter to AAPT's solicitors dated 10 May 1999,
Mr Lonergan's retainer was to provide an assessment as to whether,
from a
financial perspective, he believed that the Part A statement provided
sufficient information to enable a shareholder in AAPT
to make an informed
decision as to whether or not to accept the takeover offer for the shares.
However, in his affidavit of the same
date Mr Lonergan expressed his opinion as
to the information material to the decision of an AAPT shareholder whether or
not to accept
the offer.  The affidavit is not expressed to be limited to `a
financial perspective'.
<P>

9  	The defendants have identified particular parts of the affidavit
which they contend to be inadmissible.  As the hearing developed,
it emerged
that the most appropriate course would be for me to rule on that contention in
these reasons for judgment, and I shall
now do so.  The defendants object to
paragraph 7(c), in which Mr Lonergan says he would expect to see a separate
discussion of the
offeror's intentions should the minimum acceptance condition
be waived, and he expresses opinions as to the importance of such disclosure
and says it is a reasonable commercial expectation that it is likely that the
90% minimum acceptance condition will be waived.  The
defendants also object to
paragraph 15(d), where Mr Lonergan expresses his opinion that in view of the
then current market price
for AAPT shares, the offer would need to be increased
and that the current disclosure may mislead investors into thinking that the
offeror is unable to increase the bid.  Mr Lonergan also expresses the opinion
that it is unlikely that the full amount of the offeror's
funding has been
obtained.  The defendants also object to part of paragraph 15(e), in which Mr
Lonergan expresses the opinion from
a commercial perspective that it is likely
that the offeror will obtain less than 100% control of AAPT.  The defendants
object to
paragraph 20 of the affidavit, in which Mr Lonergan identifies
certain information about the offeror's intentions regarding AAPT
(including
such matters as future dividend policy and the basis upon which transactions
between AAPT and CWO will occur), and says
that facts about these matters will
`impact the risk' associated with continued investment in AAPT and the likely
post-bid value
of AAPT shares.  He further expresses the opinion that
consideration would have been given to and intentions formed as to the matters
which he specifies.  Finally, the defendants object to paragraph 24, in which
Mr Lonergan comments on the briefing notes for the
meeting with analysts on 3
May 1999, saying amongst other things that in his experience the type of
information contained in the
notes is the result of a long and careful
analysis, and that substantially more details on areas of integration was
provided in the
presentation compared to the Part A statement.  The defendant
submits that the remainder of the affidavit should be given little
or no
weight.
<P>

10  	The defendants contend that the specified paragraphs in Mr
Lonergan's affidavit are inadmissible either because they are irrelevant
to
these proceedings or they are inadmissible opinion evidence.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW) evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the
existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.
However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> provides that if a person has specialised knowledge based on the
person's training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not
apply to
evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on
that knowledge. 
<P>

11  	I have decided that the paragraphs of the affidavit to which the
defendants object should be ruled inadmissible by virtue of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a>, and that they
are not saved by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79.</a>  The paragraphs of the affidavit to which the defendants
object are evidence of Mr Lonergan's opinions.  They are entirely `inferences
from observed and communicable data':  see <i>Allstates Life Insurance Co v
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No.5) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2064%20FCR%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 64 FCR 73.</a>  Mr
Lonergan's affidavit expresses opinions about matters which are either matters
of fact falling within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> or matters of law.  To the extent that he expresses
opinions about matters of law, they are matters for the Court to determine by
the application of legal principles without the aid of expert evidence:  see,
for example, <i>Yates Property Corporation (In Liq) v Boland </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20157%20ALR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 157 ALR
30</a>, 55 ff.
<P>

12  	Opinion evidence is admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> only if two conditions
are satisfied.  The first is that the witness has specialised knowledge based
on his training, study or experience.
 Whatever be the precise scope of the
requirement of `specialised knowledge' (see <i>R v G</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 451</a>,
459), it is obvious that Mr Lonergan has specialised knowledge of the requisite
kind.  
<P>

13  	However, Mr Lonergan's field of specialisation has its limits.
He is an expert in the valuation of businesses and companies
and company
shares, and the interpretation of financial statements and other financial
information.  That expertise qualifies him
to provide financial advice to
shareholders and others, and he frequently gives such advice.  Specialised
knowledge and experience
of those kinds does not, in my opinion, qualify him to
give evidence of the kind which he purports to give in the paragraphs of the
affidavit to which objection has been taken.  The opinions in those paragraphs
are expressed too widely to be wholly or substantially
based on Mr Lonergan's
specialised financial knowledge.  He purports to speak `from a commercial
perspective' rather than strictly
from a financial perspective.  Some of his
opinions are about what he regards as proper or standard or reasonably expected
disclosures
and practices in Part A statements, though he claims no recent
experience in assisting in the drafting of those documents and in
answer to
questions in cross-examination, was not able to display any detailed
familiarity with the contents of Part A statements
in recent widely discussed
takeovers.  All things considered, his position is analogous to the position of
the specialist US securities
lawyer in <i>Allstate Life Insurance Co v
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No.6)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2064%20FCR%2079" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 64 FCR 79</a>, who
was found not to be qualified to give expert opinion evidence of investor
behaviour.  
<P>

14  	It is true that considered in isolation, some of the sentences
in the paragraphs of the affidavit to which objection has been
taken could be
regarded as evidence of opinions based on Mr Lonergan's specialised knowledge,
but in their context, those statements
are components of broader evidence of Mr
Lonergan's opinion of what is material to the decisions of AAPT shareholders.

<P>

15  	Beginning with instructions to assess the Part A statement from
a financial perspective, Mr Lonergan has in the end provided
an affidavit which
is not in any meaningful way limited to the financial perspective, and
therefore is evidence which has drifted
away from his specialised knowledge
base.  It seems to me that this observation, which leads me to uphold the
defendant's objection
to admissibility of the specified paragraphs, is
applicable to the affidavit as a whole, and leads me to the view that I should
give
little or no weight to those parts of the affidavit which are in evidence.

<P>

16  	Some of the questions for me to determine in this case are not
questions which admit of evidence, but are simply questions
of law - for
example, whether paragraph 18 of the Part A statement complies with clause 20
of Part A of s 750 of the Corporations
Law.  Mr Lonergan's opinion, expert or
otherwise, is simply not relevant to such issues.  There may be room for expert
opinion evidence
on some of the matters which I have to determine, particularly
as the standard of materiality for the purposes of clause 17 of s
750 requires
the Court to consider whether certain kinds of information might reasonably
affect the decision of the ordinary investor
whether to accept the offer.  But
I am not convinced that Mr Lonergan has specialist knowledge of the field of
investor behaviour
generally, as opposed to specialist knowledge of matters of
valuation and other financial matters which constitute some but not all
of the
factors which might reasonably influence investor behaviour.  
<P>

<b>Facts - introduction</b>
<P>

17  	In my judgment of 12 May 1999 I held that notices to produce and
a subpoena served by AAPT on the two defendants and their
solicitors
respectively were valid to the extent that they required production of
documents relating to the statement of intentions
in the Part A statement.  At
the hearing on 17 and 18 May 1999 the evidence as to the offeror's intentions
comprised documents produced
by the defendants and the affidavits and oral
evidence of the defendants' two witnesses.  
<P>

18  	Mr Peter George is the Director, Strategy and Policy Development
of CWO.  While his title is `Director', he is not a member
of the board of CWO
though he is member of the board of CWOI.  He reports directly to Mr Chris
Anderson, the Chief Executive Officer
of CWO.  His responsibilities for CWO
include consideration of acquisition opportunities and one of his specific
responsibilities
has been `integration planning' in respect of the proposed
acquisition of AAPT.  This has involved identifying major issues in relation
to
the integration of AAPT and CWO, and also formulating the draft intentions
clause of the Part A statement for the board of CWO
to consider.  The
defendants' other witness was Paul O'Brien, CWO's company secretary.
<P>

19  	No evidence was given by the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Chris
Anderson, or by the Director of Corporate Financial Services
of CWO, Jacqueline
Giles, who was involved in the preparation of some of the relevant documents,
or by the Director of Regulatory
and Public Affairs of CWO, Stephe Wilks, who
gave the briefing to analysts on 3 May 1999.  AAPT submitted that I should draw
the
inference that those witnesses would not have assisted the defendants' case
and that to have led evidence from those witnesses would
have exposed facts
unfavourable to the defendants.  Counsel for AAPT cited <i>Jones v Dunkel</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298</a>, 320-321;  <i>Commercial Union Assurance Co Australia Ltd v
Ferrcom Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 389</a>, 418-419;  and <i>White Industries
(Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/806.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 806</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20156%20ALR%20169" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 156 ALR 169</a>, 226-228.  Though the
submission is made in broad terms, a particular inference AAPT wishes me to
draw is that the board did not
form any intentions different from those
disclosed in certain specified documents, including the board paper for the CWO
board meeting
of 22 April 1999 and the document referred to as the `preliminary
integration plan'.  I propose to consider at length the content
and status of
the documentary evidence in this case.  However, I do not regard it as
appropriate to apply the <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> principle in view of the
existence of other evidence which enables me to reach conclusions about the
offeror's intentions.  The witnesses
who gave evidence for the defendants were
the person responsible for integration planning and the drafting of the
intentions clause
in the Part A statement, and the person who as company
secretary attended the board meeting at which the CWO board decided to modify
the draft statement of intentions.  They were appropriate witnesses and in
particular, Mr George was in a position to give evidence
as to the status of
the documents, and he did so in cross-examination.  In the circumstances, I see
no room for any <i>Jones v Dunkel </i>inference.
<P>

20  	It is not easy to piece together the significance and sequence
of the documentary evidence, because substantial segments of
the documents have
been masked on the ground that the concealed portions are confidential and
irrelevant.  Hence, some of what follows
is based on inference.
<P>

21  	The documentary evidence shows that the possibility of CWO (and
at an earlier stage, Optus Communications Ltd) acquiring AAPT
was conceived no
later than in July 1998.  The acquisition project was named `Project Merlin'.
An Optus Communications paper on Project
Merlin dated 24 July 1998, probably
prepared by the Optus Corporate Finance Department referred to the advantages
of a merger, which
would combine the Optus and AAPT market shares in the small
to medium business area, and achieve other identified advantages for
specified
areas of Optus' business.  The project was developed between July 1998 and
March 1999.  
<P>

22  	A paper headed `Issues Relevant to the Determination of the
Amortisation Period - Key Drivers to the Acquisition of Merlin',
whose author
was not identified, was evidently written no earlier than November 1998, since
it refers to AAPT's then recent acquisition
of the exclusive rights for LMDS
Spectrum technology in Australia, an acquisition which according to Mr George
occurred in about
November 1998.  The paper indicates that by this time, CWO's
investigation of Project Merlin had reached a more specific stage. 
The paper
identifies `key drivers' which provide the opportunity to enhance and
complement CWO's existing business in specified areas,
including AAPT's
exclusive rights to LMDS Spectrum technology (described in this paper as
`perhaps Merlin's biggest strategic asset').
 These matters are quantified in
the paper by reference (where appropriate) to figures on market share, numbers
of employees and
numbers of customers.  The evidence does not enable me to
conclude that this paper was adopted or approved by the CWO or CWOI boards,
Mr
Anderson or Mr George.
<P>

<b>The preliminary integration plan</b>
<P>

23  	By early March 1999 a team comprising Jacqueline Giles
(Director, Corporate Financial Services), Paul Donovan (Chief Commercial
Officer) and Peter George were drafting what appears to have been a fairly
substantial `Merlin paper' which was finalised on about
9 March 1999.  The full
paper is not in evidence, but a draft of it comprising 28 pages was faxed to
London on 9 March 1999 and the
final version was dispatched for delivery on the
same day.  It appears to have included sections on `strategic context' and
`integration
approach' which were adapted into a three page paper identified by
Mr George as the `preliminary integration plan'.  
<P>

24  	This preliminary integration plan was referred to in a board
paper for a meeting of the board of Cable &amp; Wireless plc later
in March
1999, and in a CWO board paper which was probably, having regard to the date of
facsimile transmission, a paper for the
board meeting of either 15 or 22 April
1999 (though at one stage in his evidence Mr George said it may have been for a
March meeting).
 On balance, I find it was a paper for the CWO board meeting of
22 April 1999.  On that basis, the preliminary integration plan appears
to have
been or been part of the `management's current plans' referred to in the
minutes of a meeting of the directors of CWO held
on 22 April 1999.  Mr George
said he thought the plan had become `largely historical' in the board by 22
April and referred to a
`change of heart' regarding sale of CDMA, but since the
preliminary integration plan does not envisage sale of CDMA, but only internal
transfer, whereas the draft board paper of 12 March 1999 envisages external
sale, I infer that in this evidence Mr George was confusing
the two papers.  I
conclude that the preliminary integration plan is a document of some
importance.
<P>

25  	The preliminary integration plan sets out succinctly a number of
strategic considerations for CWO.  They include an frank assessment
of CWO's
market position as Australia's second carrier and the business strategies which
arise from that assessment, implications
for CWO's involvement in the mass
consumer market, and in light of that, a presentation of synergies which AAPT
would offer, having
regard to the latter's cost structure and market position.
The document proceeds to set out the `ideal split of businesses
post-acquisition',
in a way which proposes the transfer of some of the
businesses of each of CWO and AAPT to the other.  The paper states that `in due
course, part of Merlin could be divested by re-flotation or trade sale'.  Under
the heading `Integration Issues', the preliminary
integration plan proposes
some `guidelines' for the post-acquisition transition period, including the
appointment of a designated
full-time integration manager and the establishment
of a transition steering committee, and explicit efforts to retain key
personnel.
 It is true that the paper itself is merely a series of bullet
points, some of which are little more than headings.  However, the
reader is
left in no doubt that the document is a distillation of the fruits of a
substantial planning process.  
<P>

26  	At about the same time as preparation of the preliminary
integration plan, Mr George wrote by hand a single page paper headed
`Merlin
Integration Initiatives', indicating that he had engaged the former head of
AAPT's corporate advisers to assist him, and
that a full-time integration
manager would be appointed.  I do not regard this document as indicating any
intention or possible course
of action beyond what is disclosed in the Part A

<b>The draft board paper dated 12 March 1999</b>
<P>

27  	A `final draft' board paper dated 12 March 1999 (which may be
the document faxed in draft to London on 9 March 1999) contains
sections on
`business integration' and `key risks'.  As with the preliminary integration
plan, this document outlines a process of
reorientation of business, government
and consumer customers between CWO and AAPT after the acquisition, and outlines
plans for the
Connect.com and Microplex networks and business operations, and
proposals for the conduct of Cellular One's business.  The document
proposes to
`investigate and assess' the potential to sell residual assets and business
areas not complementary to CWO's ongoing
strategy, and one of those assets is
specified.  Mr George's evidence is that the draft board paper of 12 March
1999, which he refers
to as `preliminary material', represented the view of
management regarding the business and assets of AAPT at that time, based on
the
publicly available information.
<P>

28  	Also in evidence is an undated document headed `Merlin Synergies
- Breakdown', prepared by the Corporate Finance Department
of CWO.  The
document includes `values' for various business subdivisions, expressed in
terms of estimated earnings before income
tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The document includes estimated cost savings resulting from rationalising the
direct sales forces
and tele-marketing, head office operations, network
management centres, and customer service operations.  It estimates the number
of staff who would become redundant.  It appears to me likely that this
document was produced before the UK board meeting of March
1999, and in any
event before the CWO board meeting of 15 April 1999.  The evidence does not
indicate that this paper was adopted
or approved by the CWO or CWOI board, Mr
Anderson or Mr George.
<P>

<b>Cable &amp; Wireless plc's board meeting, March 1999</b>
<P>

29  	This appears to have been the documentary state of affairs when
the proposed acquisition was reported to a meeting of the Cable
&amp; Wireless
plc board in March 1999.  That meeting had before it a board paper containing
headings `Synergies and Benefits', `Business
Integration/Organisational Issues'
and `Key Risks'.  It was prepared by Robert Lerwill, Chief Financial Officer of
the UK company,
who is also a director of CWO.  It was based, at least in part,
on the preliminary integration plan and the draft CWO board paper
of 12 March
1999.  It expresses CWO's plans in concrete and positive terms.  It says that
CWO `has established' the total value of
synergies and states a figure.  It
says that CWO believes the synergies to be `realistic and achievable'.  Some of
the synergies,
according to the paper, are derived from anticipated savings in
carrier spend, lower interconnect charges and operational savings
in network
areas.  According to the paper, CWO believes that these benefits can be
captured quickly with relatively low risk.
<P>

30  	The paper continues:
<P>

`Further synergies will be realised from merging customer service, operations
and administrative functions in the key long distance
and mobile product area.
The timing of the realisation of these synergy benefits will be determined post
transaction after a brief
assessment of the feasibility of the CWO management
approach to business integration.  Provision has been made for loss of
customers
resulting from the merger.'
<P>

31  	The paper then refers to longer term opportunities for savings
from combining billing systems and from the abandonment or more
selective
application of a certain specified technology.  Then the paper refers to the
preliminary integration plan, some of which
it summarises, and notes key
risks.
<P>

32  	Some time in April 1999 Jacqueline Giles prepared a paper which
gives a quantitative comparison of CWO and AAPT in terms of
total business and
business divisions.  Again, the evidence does not indicate that this paper was
adopted or approved by the CWO
or CWOI boards, Mr Anderson or Mr George.
<P>

<b>CWO's board meetings, 15 and 22 April 1999</b>
<P>

33  	At a meeting on 15 April 1999 the board of CWO resolved to
authorise the acquisition of the issued shares of AAPT and to appoint
a
committee to determine certain specified matters.  On 16 April 1999 CWOI
purchased 10.65% of the shares in AAPT and announced a
takeover bid for the
company.  CWO's public relations department prepared written questions and
answers on the AAPT bid.
<P>

34  	The CWO board met again on 22 April 1999.  According to the
agenda, the first item for discussion was Project Merlin, and Mr
Anderson was
responsible for presenting the matter to the board.  The paper which (as I have
found) was before the board was to the
extent it was relevant to these
proceedings, almost identical with the board paper considered by the Cable
&amp; Wireless plc board
in March.  It stated that CWO had established the
total value of synergies at a figure which was expressed, and that those
synergies
were believed to be realistic and achievable.  It referred to and
summarised the preliminary integration plan.  The principal and
possibly the
only difference between this paper and the previous UK paper is that on this
occasion, the paper referred to `an assessment
of the feasibility of the CWO
management approach', rather than a `brief assessment'.  I infer that the word
`brief' was deleted
so as bring the paper into line with the draft intentions
clause in the Part A statement, which had been sent to London on 20 April
1999.

<P>

35  	The minutes of the meeting of 22 April 1999 contain the
following:
<P>

`Chris Anderson assured directors that the statements made in the draft offer
document tabled at this meeting concerning the company's
intentions regarding
AAPT's business, assets and employees represented a true and fair view of
management's current plans.  These
intentions however, may need to be
reconsidered following the proposed review of the AAPT business at the end of
the offer period
as stated in the offer document.
<P>

Following further discussion <b>IT WAS AGREED</b> that the intention statement
concerning current employees of AAPT be reviewed to the satisfaction of the
Chief Executive and external
legal advisers to ensure that it represents a true
reflection of management's current intentions based upon all relevant materials
available to the company.'
<P>

36  	It is clear that the reference to the `draft offer document' is
a reference to the draft Part A statement, and the reference
to the draft
concerning the company's intentions is a reference to paragraph 18 of that
document.  Mr Anderson assured the directors
that the draft paragraph 18 was a
true and fair view of `management's current plans'.  What were `management's
current plans' at
that time?  On one construction of the minute, Mr Anderson
was telling the board that as far as management's thinking was concerned,
the
draft board paper of 12 March 1999 and the preliminary integration plan had
been superseded by draft paragraph 18.  An alternative
construction of the
minute is that Mr Anderson was assuring the board that the draft paragraph 18
was a true and fair view of the
thinking of management as expressed in those
other documents, to the extent necessary to comply with the disclosure
requirements
of the Corporations Law. 
<P>

37  	In my opinion the latter is the correct construction of the
minute.  I find nothing in the evidence to indicate that management,
and in
particular Mr George, resiled from the preliminary integration plan and the
draft board paper of 12 March 1999 prior to the
board meeting of 22 April 1999.
The board paper on Project Merlin for the 22 April meeting referred without
qualification to the
preliminary integration plan.  Had there been a basic and
wholesale change in management thinking, one would have expected to see
a
minute expressed in more specific terms than the minute set out above.  The
evidence shows that management's thinking evolved during
the period from 12
March to 22 April.  Management's thinking about the post-acquisition
relationship between CWO and AAPT with respect
to the residential and small
business customer bases appears to have been changed or clarified (see Mr
George's affidavit of 13 May
1999, paragraph 7(e)).  Thinking appears also to
have evolved on the LMDS technology and CDMA spectrum.  But I find that most of
the views in the 12 March paper, and all of the preliminary integration plan,
remained management's current thinking on 22 April.
<P>

38  	It is plausible to infer that at the meeting of 22 April 1999,
one or more directors may have expressed disquiet at the rather
subdued level
of disclosure of the offeror's intentions, in light of what the directors knew
about the amount of planning which management
had already undertaken.  I
construe the minute of the meeting to mean that Mr Anderson gave an assurance
to the directors that draft
paragraph 18 was true and fair disclosure
notwithstanding the extent of management's current plans.  In giving that
assurance, he
would have been fortified by the views of Mr George.  Though Mr
George did not attend the meeting, it is reasonable to infer that
he had
discussed the agenda with Mr Anderson.  Mr George's view, disclosed in his
affidavit of 13 May 1999, was that in the absence
of AAPT's confidential
information concerning its business and assets, it was `not possible to be
certain that integration was either
possible or desirable'.  He said that `it
would only be with the benefit of that information that it would be possible to
identify
with precision what steps would be implemented'.  Taking that view, he
was satisfied with the draft intentions clause from management's
point of view.
Evidently he saw a distinction between `intentions', which could only be formed
with the benefit of AAPT's confidential
information, and `integration plans'
which could be developed and refined, and used as the basis for a decision to
make a bid, without
ever becoming intentions.  
<P>

39  	As the minute notes, the board decided to review the intention
statements concerning employees of AAPT.  The draft clause which
had been
placed before the board stated that the integration of activities which the
proposed Business Review and Integration Committee
may recommend could give
rise to some reductions in the number of employees.  CWOI would ensure that
appropriate redundancy arrangements
would apply.  Mr O'Brien's evidence is that
a director expressed concern that the company was making too much of the issue
of redundancies,
and that AAPT's skilled employees should be redeployed in
other parts of the business.  Clause 18 was subsequently revised and approved
by Mr George in its revised form.  As revised, it stated that the integration
of activities would be likely to result in duplication
of functions and where
that occurred, it was intended to consider whether the employees concerned
could be redeployed in other areas
of the combined businesses, and that
re-training would be provided to employees.  
<P>

40  	On 23 April 1999 the board of CWOI approved the Part A statement
and Offer documents.  
<P>

<b>Events after board approval of the Part A statement</b>
<P>

41  	Subsequently CWO's Public Affairs Department produced more
questions and answers and the Human Resources Department prepared
an e.mail
which was sent to all CWO staff on 28 April 1999.  The e.mail announced that
the Part A statement had been released and
described the proposal for a
Business Review and Integration Committee.  The document proceeded:
<P>

`Our intentions are to:
<P>

*	expand the range and depth of products and services available to AAPT
customers, for example, we'll offer Optus Local Calls to
AAPT customers who
live in cabled (HFC network) areas;
<P>

*	integrate corporate and government customer bases to provide unmatched
customer focus and depth of product innovation;  
<P>

*	integrate network infrastructures of both companies to achieve broader
coverage and cost efficiencies;
<P>

*	in the Internet/data area, integrate Microplex and Connect.com to achieve
efficiencies and broader coverage;
<P>

*	sell any assets that are seen as being surplus to our future requirements;
<P>

*	seek to reduce any duplication of corporate office costs and support
functions.'
<P>

42  	The letter stated that `all this is subject to the review, which
will start once the deal has been done.'  The letter said
that `our immediate
intention is to ensure that the AAPT business continues uninterrupted'.
<P>

43  	Then on 3 May 1999 CWO held a briefing for analysts.  Present
were Stephe Wilks (Director, Regulatory and Public Affairs of
CWO) and Lisa
Carver (a trade practices lawyer from Gilbert &amp; Tobin, CWO's lawyers).  A
set of briefing notes comprising 37 pages
of headings, evidently copies of
overhead transparencies, is in evidence.  The briefing notes addressed, inter
alia, `synergies and
network/asset complementarity'.  The notes on that subject
imply that substantial thinking had been devoted to the matching of the
businesses of the two companies.  While most of the briefing notes concentrate
on competition issues, there is particular coverage
of the LMDS Spectrum, which
draws attention to the advantage to CWO of acquiring that technology indirectly
through the acquisition
of AAPT, and the likely auction of additional LMDS
Spectrum later this year.
<P>

<b>Offeror's intentions - clause 20 of Part A, section 250</b>
<P>

44  	Section 750 of the Corporations Law sets out the requirements
with which a Part A statement is to comply.  They include the
following:
<P>

`20(1) The statement shall set out particulars of the offeror's intentions
regarding:
<P>

(a)	the continuation of the business of the target company;
<P>

(b)	any major changes to be made to the business of the target company,
including any redeployment of the fixed assets of the target
company;  and
<P>

(c)	the future employment of the present employees of the target company.'
<P>

(2) Without limiting the generality of subclause (1), if the offeror has not
made a decision on a matter referred to in paragraph
(1)(a), (b) or (c) but is
considering a possible course of action, or 2 or more possible courses of
action, in relation to that matter,
the statement shall set out that fact and
specify the course of action or courses of action concerned and the reason why
the offeror
has not made a decision on the matter.'
<P>

45  	In my judgment delivered on 12 May 1999 I noted that as a matter
of literal construction, clause 20 of s 750 is not subject
to any overriding
requirement of materiality. The legislature has itself determined, by
prescribing disclosure of the matters set
out in clause 20, that disclosure of
those matters is to be made to shareholders and therefore they are presumed to
be material.
 This is not to deny that there may be information about the
offeror's intentions which is material information and must be disclosed
under
clause 17, even thought it does not fall within the wording of clause 20.  Nor
is it to deny that clause 20, like every other
clause in s 750, must be
construed by reference to the object of s 750 as a whole, which is that offeree
shareholders should be in
possession of the information required to enable them
to make an informed and critical assessment of the offer and an informed
decision
as to whether to accept it:  <i>Samic Ltd v Metals Exploration Ltd

<P>

<b>The defendant's disclosure of intentions in the Part A statement</b>
<P>

46  	Paragraph 18 of the Part A statement, which runs for three
pages, contains the defendants' disclosure with respect to their
intentions.
The intentions of CWO are the same as the intentions of CWOI (para 18.1).
There are two matters of disclosure of intentions
which are relatively
self-contained:
<P>

*	CWOI intends to seek the appointment of nominees as directors of AAPT and in
doing so, it will take into account the percentage
holding of AAPT shares which
it has at the end of the offer period (para 18.3);
<P>

*	if at the end of the offer period CWOI is entitled to proceed to compulsory
acquisition, it will do so and will seek to remove
AAPT from the official list
of the Australian Stock Exchange.
<P>

47  	The remainder of paragraph 18 discloses the following:
<P>

*	CWOI's intentions are based on its review of publicly available information,
since it has not had access to internal, confidential
information of AAPT
concerning its operations, business plan, financial position, strategic
objectives and other relevant matters
(para 18.2);
<P>

*	at the end of the offer period CWOI intends to propose to AAPT's board that a
Business Review and Integration Committee be established,
comprising senior
executives of CWO and AAPT, to conduct a strategic and financial review of each
of AAPT's businesses, develop a
detailed integration plan for those businesses
of CWO and AAPT which the Committee decides should be integrated, and consider
whether
the steps listed in para 18.6 can and should be implemented (para
18.5);
<P>

*	CWOI intends to consider whether the steps set out in para 18.6 should be
implemented with respect to the businesses, activities
and assets of AAPT;
<P>

*	`final decisions' on the matters set out in para 18.6 will be made following
the results of the review referred to in para 18.5
and implementation will be
subject to para 18.8 (para 18.2);
<P>

*	apart from the intention to establish the Business Review and Integration
Committee and intentions concerning some of the businesses
of AAPT which are
referred to in para 18.6, CWOI has not formed any intention concerning any of
the businesses, assets and employees
of AAPT other than to continue the
businesses as going concerns and to maintain the required capital support and
management resources
for and the existing employment of all current employees
of those businesses (para 18.7);  and
<P>

*	the steps referred to in para 18.6 can only be implemented by the directors
of AAPT agreeing to do so, and this is subject to
the directors complying with
all legal and regulatory requirements and their duties, including the
requirement that they act in the
best interests of AAPT and its shareholders,
and unless AAPT is a wholly owned subsidiary at the time, any plan to integrate
the
assets and businesses of AAPT with those of CWO may require the approval of
the shareholders of AAPT (para 18.8).
<P>

48  	Paragraph 18.6 is of central importance.  It lists the steps
which CWOI intends to consider regarding the businesses, activities
and assets
of AAPT through the Business Review and Integration Committee which it will
propose to the board of AAPT at the end of
the offer period.  The steps which
are listed are:
<P>

`*	increase the range of products acquired by AAPT from CWO on a wholesale
basis;
<P>

*	integrate the corporate and government customer bases and the corporate and
government sales and management divisions of both
CWO and AAPT in order to both
retain and provide enhanced services to the corporate and government customers
of CWO and AAPT;
<P>

*	integrate the network and business operations of Microplex Pty Ltd ACN 076
698 756 with the network and business operations of
Connect.com.au Pty Ltd ACN
054 112 435;
<P>

*	integrate the network infrastructure and related resources of both CWO and
AAPT;
<P>

*	integrate the corporate office functions, network management functions and
customer service functions of AAPT with those of CWO
in order to eliminate
duplicated activities and costs;
<P>

*	dispose of any assets which are identified by the Business Review and
Integration Committee referred to in paragraph 18.5 as being
surplus to the
ongoing requirements of the CWO and AAPT Groups.'
<P>

49  	Paragraph 18.6 then points out that the integration of these
activities is likely to result in duplication of functions, particularly
in the
corporate office, network management and customer service areas.  Where there
is such duplication, the intention is to consider
whether the employees
concerned can be redeployed within the CWO and AAPT Groups, and redeployment
will be facilitated by retraining
where appropriate.  If in spite of this it is
necessary to reduce the number of employees, CWOI will ensure that appropriate
redundancy
arrangements will apply.  Selection of employees of the integrated
activities will as a general principle be based on merit.
<P>

<b>History of clause 20 of Part A of section 750</b>
<P>

50  	Some guidance as to the scope and purpose of clause 20 of s 750
can be obtained from a brief examination of its history.  Prior
to the
enactment of the National Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme during
the period 1979 to 1982, Australian companies
legislation did not require a
takeover offeror to make any statement about its intentions for the business
and employees of the target.
 Part A of the Tenth Schedule to the Companies Act
1961 (NSW) required the Part A statement to set out `full particulars of the
takeover
offer' but that was interpreted as a relatively formal requirement.
Much broader disclosure requirements were proposed in Schedules
6 and 7 to the
Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1974 (Cth).  Clause 5 of Schedule 6
would have required the offer document
to set out particulars of `any plans or
proposals that the offeror has formulated with respect to the target
corporation or any related
corporation for implementation if the takeover
scheme is wholly or partially successful'.  Clause 6 proceeded to specify a
number
of matters, including disclosure of plans or proposals for
re-organisation or merger of the target corporation or the sale of its
assets,
or any other major change in the business or structure of the target.
According to the explanatory memorandum (para 212),
the Bill aimed to give
effect to the recommendations of the Eggleston Committee in its Second Interim
Report (Company Law Advisory
Committee to the Standing Committee of
Attorneys-General, February 1969).  However the Eggleston Committee had
recommended only modest
revisions to the offeror's disclosure document, not
relating to disclosure of intentions.  It is probable that the inclusion of
disclosure
of `plans and proposals' had its origin in US federal securities
law, which was a strong influence upon the drafters of the Bill.
 
<P>

51  	The Williams Act amendments to the Securities <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Exchange Act</a> of
1934 (US), which took effect in 1968, made it unlawful for any person `to make
a tender offer for, or request an invitation for
tenders of' any class of
registered equity security if consummation of the offer would make that person
the beneficial owner of more
than 5% of the class, unless a disclosure document
was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 14(d)(1)).</a>  The
content of the disclosure document, a tender offer statement, is prescribed in
Schedule 14D-1 to the Rules, item 5 of which
requires a statement of the
purpose or purposes of the tender offer, and a description of `any plans or
proposals' which relate to
or would result in various matters, including a
merger or re-organisation, sale of a material amount of assets of the target, a
change
in board composition of the target, a material change in the target's
capitalisation or dividend policy, and any other material change
in the
target's corporate structure or business.  Additionally, section 13(d)(1)(C) of
the 1934 Act, which imposes a `substantial
shareholder' disclosure obligation
where a person is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of registered
equity securities,
states that if the purpose of the purchase is to acquire
control of the business of the issuer of the securities, the purchaser must
disclose any plans or proposals to liquidate the issuer, to sell its assets or
to merge it with another entity, or to make any other
major change in its
business or corporate structure.  Item 4 of the Schedule 13D form of disclosure
required by the Rules is in terms
broadly similar to item 5 of Schedule 14D-1.

<P>

52  	Case law under section 13(d) indicates that the purpose behind
the acquisition must be disclosed even if there is no present
implementation
plan or the plan is less than definite:  <i>K-N Energy, Inc v Gulf Interstate
Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=607%20F%20Supp%20756" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">607 F Supp 756</a> ( D C Colo 1983).  However, in <i>Susquehanna Corp v Pan
American Sulphur Co </i><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA5/1970/281.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] USCA5 281</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=423%20F%202d%201075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">423 F 2d 1075</a> (1970) Ainsworth J remarked (at 1085)
that section 13(d) requires a potential bidder to disclose only material
information, and therefore
the disclosing party need not `walk a tortuous
path':
<P>

`He must, of course, be precise and forthright in making full and fair
disclosure as to all material facts called for by the various
items of the
schedule.  At the same time he must be careful not to delineate extravagantly
or to enlarge beyond reasonable bounds.
 The securities market is delicately
arranged and needs only slight impetus to upset it.  As Judge Friendly has
pointed out in the
only other appellate court decision thus far involving the
new tender offer provisions of the Act, `It would be as serious an infringement
of these [SEC] regulations to overstate the definiteness of the plans as to
understate them.'  <i>Electronic Speciality Co. v. International Controls
Corp</i>., 2 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 937, 948.  Judge Friendly finds that the
congressional standard of disclosure is one requiring `basic honesty
and fair
dealing' by the offeror.  <i>Id</i>. At 948.  In the cited case the Second
Circuit rejected an attack against the offeror's Schedule 13D statements, Judge
Friendly observing,
`Probably there will no more be a perfect tender offer than
a perfect trial.'  <i>Id.</i> At 948.  Though the offeror has an obligation
fairly to disclose its plans in the event of a takeover, it is not required to
make
predictions of future behaviour, however tentatively phrased, which may
cause the offeree or the public investor to rely on them
unjustifiably.  See
Note, Cash Tender Offers,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=83%20Harvard%20Law%20Review%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">83 Harv.L.Rev. 377</a>, 394, 395 (1969).  Target
companies must not be provided the opportunity to use the future plans
provision as a tool for dilatory
litigation.  83 Harv.L.Rev. at 394.'

1988).)
<P>

53  	When the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill was abandoned
after a change of government in 1975, the reform of takeover
regulation became
part of the proposals for the National Co-operative Companies and Securities
Scheme.  Although the self-regulatory
model of the London City Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers was not adopted, much attention was given to the
substantive provisions of
the London City Code.  Rule 15(2) of the London City
Code said at that time:
<P>

`The offeror will normally be expected to cover the following points in the
offer document and the board of the offeree company
should, in so far as
relevant, comment upon such statements in a letter to its shareholders:
<P>

(a)	its intentions regarding the continuation of the business of the offeree
company;
<P>

(b)	its intentions regarding any major changes to be introduced to the
business, including any re-deployment of the fixed assets
of the offeree
company;
<P>

(c)	the long-term commercial justification for the proposed offer;  and
<P>

(d)	its intentions with regard to the continued employment of the employees of
the offeree company and of its subsidiaries.'
<P>

54  	Rule 15(2) (now Rule 24) did no more than set out the
expectations of the Panel in normal circumstances, in the context of
a
self-regulatory system in which the Panel is available to give confidential
advance rulings on points of interpretation.  
<P>

55  	The national takeover legislation when first enacted (Companies
(Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980) did not include any requirement
to disclose
the offeror's intentions with respect to the business and employees of the
target.  However, the first amending Bill
(Companies (Acquisition of Shares)
Amendment Bill 1980) introduced paragraph 5A to Part A of the Schedule to the
Act, which took
effect prior to the Act's commencement on 1 July 1981.
Paragraph 5A was identical to the present clause 20(1) of s 750.  The
explanatory
memorandum to the amending Bill, para 43, stated without further
explanation that `similar requirements' were contained in Rule 15
of the London
City Code and section 13(d)(1)(c) of the Securities <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Exchange Act</a> of 1934.
<P>

56  	In my opinion the history of clause 20 of s 750 is not merely of
interest to the comparativist or antiquarian.  The history
shows that the
London City Code was the direct precedent for the drafter of clause 20.  But
the wording of the City Code was developed
in a commercial rather than a legal
context, in a system of regulation by principles to be applied according to
their spirit.  In
that context it is unlikely that the word `intentions' would
be taken either as confined to strict corporate intentions formally
adopted at
board level, or as extending to all management proposals postulated during
planning of the bid;  and compliance with the
disclosure rule would be judged
by the quality and pertinence of the information considered as a whole.  The
acknowledged influence
of the US federal regulatory system points in the same
direction.  Although the US system contains much more `black-letter'
prescription
than London's, the US courts insist on a purposive interpretation,
shown in the US cases to which I have referred.  Given the direct
and indirect
influence of US Law on the drafter of clause 20, the US cases are an available
source of guidance to the proper interpretation
of our law.

<b>Case law before the enactment of clause 20(2)</b>
<P>

57  	The scope and content of paragraph 5A were considered in
<i>Cumberland Credit Corporation Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20ACLR%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 ACLR

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2039%20NSWLR%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 39 NSWLR 214</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=13%20ACLR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">13 ACLR 129 (Bryson</a> J).
<P>

58  	In <i>Cumberland Credit </i>the bid was apparently for cash and
no conditions were referred to in the judgment.  The company's sole assets were
a large amount
of cash on deposit and some shares.  The Part A statement said
that if the takeover was successful, the offeror's intention was to
replace the
majority of directors, and to review and evaluate the activities, investments
and assets of the target.  The review might
or might not lead to the conclusion
that activities should be developed, assets reinvested and staff changed.  The
offeror did not
have the information necessary to form specific intentions
concerning those possibilities.  Pending the outcome of the review, the
offeror's intention was to continue the business and employees of the target
and make no major changes.  
<P>

59  	Beach J held that this level of disclosure was inadequate to
comply with paragraph 5A, on two grounds.  First, he found that
the Part A
statement was inconsistent with other evidence which indicated that the offeror
had in fact made a final decision to make
major changes to the business of the
target, including redeployment of fixed assets.  Four days before service of
the Part A, the
offeror's managing director had said on television `we know
what we will do with the company'.  Two days before service of the Part
A, he
was reported in a newspaper as saying that the offeror would simply absorb the
target's cash if the bid was successful.  
<P>

60  	Secondly, there was evidence that management of the offeror had
given consideration to three alternative possibilities, namely
to redeploy the
assets of the target within the offeror's business, to liquidate the target's
share portfolio, or in the event that
the offeror did not acquire 100% of the
target, to manage the target as a public listed company.  In his Honour's view,
it was incumbent
on the offeror to reveal those alternative intentions in the
Part A statement.  The offeror could not circumvent paragraph 5A by
simply
saying that it had considered various alternatives but would not come to a
final conclusion until the offer has proved to
be successful.  That approach
would not be consistent with the Code's purpose of ensuring that the
acquisition of shares takes place
in an informed market.  He observed that the
word used in clause 5A was `intentions', rather than `intention', and he
referred to
the meaning of the word `intention'.  Noting dictionary definitions
that an intention is a `purpose or design', he referred to <i>Betty's Cafes Ltd
v Phillips Furnishing Stores Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%20AC%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] AC 20</a>, where Viscount Simonds (at
33) approved of Asquith LJ's observation in <i>Cunliffe v Goodman </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%202%20KB%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 2
KB 237</a> that a party `intending', rather than merely contemplating, decides to
bring something about by his own act of volition.  In Beach
J's view, a person
may have intentions in this sense even if they are in the alternative.  
<P>

61  	The defendants in the present case sought to distinguish the
<i>Cumberland Credit </i>case on the ground that there, the evidence caused the
court to disbelieve the offeror's statement that it had not made a final
decision.
 However, this overlooks the second ground for Beach J's decision.
Even so, in my opinion Beach J's second ground for decision was
based closely
on the facts before him, which enabled him to characterise evidence about
`various alternative possibilities' as revealing
`alternative intentions'.  On
other facts, a court might conclude that consideration of possibilities has not
matured into the adoption
of alternative intentions, assuming that the word
`intentions' has the meaning which his Honour attributed to it.  
<P>

62  	The <i>ICAL </i>case related to a Part C statement, but the
requirement to disclose intentions is and was at that time the same for a Part
C as for
a Part A statement.  The Part C statement disclosed that the offeror's
intention was to seek board appointments consistent with its
shareholding after
expiry of the offers.  As regards major changes to the business of the target,
it said that the offeror's intention
was to rationalise those aspects of the
target's operations where duplication existed within the operations of the
offeror's group.
 A strategic review would also be conducted in respect of the
target's properties and investments.  The offeror would assess the
strategic
value of the fishing interests of the target's wholly owned subsidiary, but
otherwise intended to continue the subsidiary's
business as presently
conducted.  Subject to all those matters, the offeror's intention was that the
target's business would continue
as a separate trading entity and the target
would continue to employ its present management and employees.  
<P>

63  	Bryson J found this disclosure to be inadequate.  He said that
although the word `rationalise' meant on its face to make rational
any
duplicated operations, and that the reader might suspect that the word was used
as a euphemism for closing down or selling off
some unidentified aspects of the
target's operations, the words used were not capable of indicating the
offeror's intention as to
what would be done with the target's operations.  His
Honour described the expression `strategic review' as indeterminate figurative
language with vaguely military connotations, leaving to guesswork the meaning
of that expression in relation to particulars of the
offeror's intentions for
continuation of and major changes to the target's business.  
<P>

64  	In that case evidence was given by the person who was the
decision-maker for the offeror, and therefore its directing mind
and will.
Bryson J reviewed that evidence fully and concluded that in several respects
the Part C Statement had failed to disclose
the offeror's intentions as deduced
from that evidence.  It should have indicated that if the takeover was
successful, the prospect
of advantage to the target from subcontracting for the
ANZAC Ship Project would be significantly reduced, since the offeror intended
that decisions on subcontracting would be taken with a view to protecting its
own investment and interests.  Further, there was evidence
that the offeror's
group would dispose of operations of the target and its subsidiary which did
not fit its consortium's objectives.
 Business activities of the target had
been identified and a probable sale price had been calculated.  On the basis of
a substantial
amount of evidence, Bryson J concluded that the offeror had
formed a `fairly firm' intention to sell off a large part of the target's
assets, although that intention was open to reconsideration with respect to
timing, amount and identification of particular assets.
 
<P>

65  	The offeror had decided not to disclose this intention to the
target's shareholders because it was apprehensive that to do
so might injure
its future relations with the target's staff.  On that point, Bryson J observed
(at 239) that `if a disclosure is
required by Part C it must come out, no
matter how much alarm it causes or how much it complicates future business'.
He found (at
240) that there was an intention to sell significant assets of the
target, `no less so because the intention is not complete, unreserved
and
final, and there is room for further consideration of the choice of particular
assets and the time of sale'.  In his opinion
the case was not one about
disclosure of alternative intentions, because there was an actual intention
which ought to be disclosed,
`even if contingent and subject to further
consideration or possible review'.
<P>

66  	Again, the court's conclusions in the <i>ICAL </i>case were
closely related to the evidence, which appears to have been voluminous.  The
case indicates that depending on the facts,
the court may conclude that the
offeror's consideration has moved beyond mere contemplation to the stage of
decision - that is, the
adoption of a purpose or design - even though
contingent or subject to further consideration or review.  The case did not
imply that
under the law as it then stood, everything which is under
consideration must be disclosed, because some matters under consideration
may
not have matured from the realm of contemplation to the realm of decision.
<P>

<b>Case law after the enactment of clause 20(2)</b>
<P>

67  	The Corporations Law replaced the Companies (Acquisition of
Shares) Codes on 1 January 1991.  Clause 20(1) of Part A of s 750
replicated
paragraph 5A of the Code, while clause 20(2) was added.  The explanatory
memorandum for the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/cb1988182/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Bill 1988</a>, para 2310, states somewhat
uninformatively:
<P>

`The requirement to set out particulars of the offeror's intentions (clause 20)
is different to the requirement found in clause
5A of the Part A to the
Schedule of CASA in that it provides that, where a relevant intention has not
been finalised but the offeror
is considering possible courses of action, those
possibilities are to be specified (sub-clause 20(2)).'
<P>

68  	It appears to me that clause 20(2), while confirming Beach J's
second ground of decision in <i>Cumberland Credit</i>, expands the disclosure
requirement.  In <i>ICAL</i>, Bryson J was careful to find, on the basis of
substantial evidence, that an actual intention had been formed, albeit
dependent on
conditions and subject to possible review;  and in <i>Cumberland
Credit</i> Beach J treated evidence about possible courses of action as
signifying that the offeror had formed some alternative intentions .
 On the
reasoning in those two cases, it would not have been necessary, prior to 1
January 1991, to disclose possible courses of
action which were merely under
consideration or, in Asquith LJ's words, a state of affairs which the offeror
had done no more than
`merely contemplate'.  Clause 20(2) advances the
disclosure obligation to merely possible courses of action, provided that the
offeror
`is considering' them.  
<P>

69  	The expanded disclosure obligation in clause 20 has been the
subject of discussion in the following cases:  <i>QIW Retailers Ltd v Davids

Resources Ltd v Pasminco Investments Pty Ltd </i>(1998) 30 ACSR 1.
<P>

70  	In the <i>QIW </i>case the Part A statement said that the
offeror `has not yet formulated a detailed merger plan', and the offeror
contended that no
`detailed' plans had been made as to precisely how the merger
would take place, how it would be funded, and what precise assets would
be
transferred.  Heerey J observed that the qualifiers `detailed' and `precisely'
suggested that there were in fact plans of some
sort, and referred to evidence
of discussions between the offeror and the target well before the making of the
bid which indicated
that even then, details of funding proposals had been
worked out.  He concluded that according to the evidence, the offeror had a
present intention with respect to major changes to the target's business, even
though a decision may not have been made as between
a number of possible
courses of action.  
<P>

71  	In the <i>Samic</i> case the target's assets were entirely in
cash.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/cb1988182/index.html#p100" class="autolink_findacts">Part C</a> statement said that the intention of the offeror was to
identify investments for the target which would earn a higher yield than
existing bank deposits, with the ultimate objective of increasing the value of
shareholders' interests in the target.  The judge
at first instance found that
the offeror intended to use the target's cash for corporate acquisitions or
investment in substantial
holdings in companies, rather than merely for passive
investment in listed securities.  One of the witnesses explained the
transaction
as `a case of buying cash at a discount'.  The Full Court of the
Supreme Court of South Australia concluded that the statement of
intention in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/cb1988182/index.html#p100" class="autolink_findacts">Part C</a> statement concealed rather than revealed the offeror's true
intentions.  King CJ observed (60 SASR at 303) that the true nature of
the
offeror's intentions could affect the assessment by offeree shareholders of
whether the offeror was likely to improve its offer,
the prospects of a
competing offer, and the prospects for the shares if they were retained under
new management.  
<P>

72  	In the <i>Associated Dairies</i> case, the Part A statement for
a cash bid which was subject to a 50% minimum acceptance condition, made the
following points about
the offeror's intentions:  if the offer became
unconditional, the offeror would conduct a review of the target's business in
conjunction
with existing management to examine whether opportunities existed
to improve operating and organisational efficiencies and increase
overall
profitability;  pending the results of the review, and on the basis of the
information known to it, the offeror's intention
was to continue the business
and employees of the target and not to make any major changes;  if the offeror
became entitled to all
of the target's shares, its intention was to de-list the
target and `integrate its operations with those currently conducted' by
the
offeror, with the result that the target would continue as the subsidiary
responsible for developing the group's presence in
the Victorian market.  Ryan
J found that the concept of `integration' which had been used in the Part A
statement was ambiguous,
just as the word `rationalise' had been found to be
ambiguous by Bryson J in <i>ICAL.</i>  The word might have connoted the
amalgamation of some head office functions with consequent redundancies of
employees, and might
have connoted the redeployment of fixed assets.  Therefore
the Part A statement failed to comply with clause 20.
<P>

73  	In the <i>Gantry Acquisition</i> case the Part A statement of
one of two competing offerors who had made cash bids contained a lengthy clause
dealing with intentions.
 The clause stated that the offeror intended
ultimately to concentrate its activities within the United States, and
consequently
it intended to cause the target to divest its non-US operations
and assets at an appropriate time and on the most favourable terms.
 It
identified several options under consideration, namely a sale of assets in
whole or in part, and a possible Australian public
offering of all or a
proportion of the non-US assets.  The offeror had not made a decision in
respect of those options in the absence
of sufficient information, and any
decision would be made only after it had examined the operations and assets and
further considered
its position.  Its intention was that the non-US assets
would continue to be managed in their best long term interests.  The offeror
said it intended to cause a royalty interest to be sold for an approximate
purchase price which was specified.  Subject to those
matters, the offeror
intended to continue the business and employees of the target and did not
intend to made major changes to the
business.
<P>

74  	Sheppard and Burchett JJ held, Beazley J dissenting, that the
Part A statement failed to comply with clause 20 of s 750.  Sheppard
J regarded
the disclosure as generally satisfactory, but found that the subparagraph which
disclosed the intended sale of a royalty
interest was expressed in a confusing
and incomplete manner.  Noting that clause 20(1) requires `particulars', and
that clause 20(2)
requires the offeror to `specify' possible courses of action,
he said (51 FCR at 560):
<P>

`Accordingly, an offeror must do the best it can to be particular and specific
about its intention.  Nevertheless the document is
dealing with a commercial
situation.  It is being delivered in a context in which the offeror does not
have control of the target
company.  In those circumstances it is not only
reasonable, it is also necessary to express itself in a guarded way.  If it
does
not do this, it runs the risk that statements it makes may, because of
their very particularity, be found to have been misleading.'
<P>

75  	As to the sale of the royalty interest, he reasoned that further
particularisation and an indication of the ultimate destination
or use of the
sale proceeds would give the offeree shareholder an idea of how important the
acquisition of the target was to the
offeror;  this would better enable the
offeree shareholder to gauge the likelihood of being able to gain an increased
offer by refusing
acceptance for the time being.  He said (51 FCR at 561):
<P>

`It is a question of being given full and sufficient information to make a
judgment concerning how valuable the acquisition will
be to the appellant and
thus of making an informed assessment of whether the appellant may be prepared
to pay more for the shares
than its offer suggests.'
<P>

76  	Burchett J also stressed the use of the words `particulars' and
`specify', which left him in no doubt that precision was essential
for
compliance with clause 20.  Finding that the disclosure of intentions fell far
short of what was required by clause 20, he observed
that words such as
`ultimately' and `at an appropriate time' reduced the disclosure to such
generality that the information which
it provided was useless (51 FCR at
569).
<P>

77  	In <i>Stirling Resources</i> the Part A statement for a scrip
bid stated the offeror's intentions if the bid was `successful' and its
nominees constituted the
majority of directors on the board of the target.  The
intentions in those circumstances were to continue the target's business in
its
present form but to focus the target more on its core activities of petroleum
exploration and production, and to evaluate non-core
businesses in terms of
their strategic value and future benefits.  The divestment of non-core assets
that produce a marginal return
and have no strategic value might be considered.
Subject to that, no major changes were intended to be made to the business of
the
target, other than that the offeror would consider pooling office
administration and technical facilities.  The staffing requirements
of the
combined group would be reviewed and the present employees would be given due
consideration for continued employment, but
to the extent that there would be a
duplication of functions, the employment of surplus staff could be
terminated.
<P>

78  	Hill J rejected a submission that this disclosure was simply too
vague to be satisfactory.  However, he held that the disclosure
did not comply
with clause 20 because it dealt only with intentions in the event that the bid
was successful and the offeror's nominees
became a majority of the board of the
target.  He held that clause 20 is not satisfied by disclosure of particulars
of the offeror's
intentions only in limited circumstances but not in other
circumstances.  He also rejected a submission that the Part A statement
was
inaccurate because some correspondence between two directors indicated that
they had formed a more specific intention.  In Hill
J's opinion, views in the
minds of individual directors not communicated to other directors nor made the
subject of board decisions
could not be taken to be the plans of the company.
He said that `a company's intentions can only be judged by reference to the
intentions
of the directors, not the directors singularly but the directors
acting as a board', although there may be cases in which `a particular
person
may be found as a fact to be the governing mind of a company so that that
person's intentions may be taken as being the intentions
of the company' (14
ACLC at 1010).
<P>

79  	In the <i>Ampolex</i> case the Part A statement for a
conditional cash bid stated that the offeror's intention, if the bid was
successful, was that the
target's business and the employment of employees
would be continued and no changes would be made.  However, if the bid were
successful,
the offeror's executives would discuss with executives of the
target the best way to utilise the assets and the experience and expertise
of
the target's employees for the benefit of the group.  In accordance with usual
practices of the offeror, the target's assets would
be subject to regular
scrutiny and review.  The Part A statement referred to a review which the
target had announced with respect
to its United States assets, and said that
the offeror proposed to discuss that review process with executives of the
target to determine
whether the United States assets should be retained, merged
with existing assets of the offeror's affiliates or divested.  The offeror
stated that it recognised that an issue which will need to be resolved is the
rationalisation of functions presently carried out
by the respective Australian
offices of the offeror and target, and that the offeror intended to identify
and realise potential costs
savings associated with avoiding duplication of
functions. 
<P>

80  	Sackville J held that the statement of intentions did not comply
with clause 20 and was misleading.  There was significant
evidence to indicate
that the offeror had a well developed strategy to integrate the business of the
target into the offeror's worldwide
operations.  In particular, a director of
the offeror's parent set out the strategy in a letter to the managing director
of the target,
after the letter had been reviewed by the offeror's chairman and
managing director.  Sackville J said that the bland statement that
the offeror
intended to discuss with executives of the target the best way to utilise the
assets and experience of the target for
the benefit of the offeror's group,
obscured the true position and was apt to mislead shareholders.  A shareholder
reading the Part
A statement would gain the impression, not merely that the
offeror contemplated no change in relation to the business and assets
of the
target, but that the offeror had been unable to form a clear view as to the
future conduct and direction of the business until
discussions with the
target's management had taken place.  He said (14 ACLC at 769):
<P>

`The point is not that MEPA is obliged to specify in a Part A statement the
details of all plans it is considering for Ampolex's
future operations.  In
order to avoid misleading shareholders it is clearly necessary for an offeror
to couch its language carefully.
 It is also necessary to avoid speculation.
General statements may well be enough, especially if intentions cannot be
formulated
precisely until after a takeover is completed.  ... But the defect
in [the Part A disclosure of intentions] in my opinion, is not
merely that it
omits material information, it is that it creates the impression that MEPA is
much less advanced in its planning with
respect to the development and
exploitation of Ampolex's under performing resource base than is in fact the
case.'
<P>

81  	In <i>Kresta Holdings</i> the Part A statement for a partial
takeover bid said that the offeror's overall strategy was to `re-engineer' the
target into a professional,
lean and fighting fit company, successful in
Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East and Asia.  The first plan was to stem
losses
and return the target to profitability quickly.  Thereafter the target
would be expanded aggressively into the Middle East and Asia
by `leveraging' on
the bidder's extensive overseas business network.  Templeman J conceded that
this disclosure may have been little
more than advertising puff, but he said
that it did provide some indication of intentions, and the matter could be made
the subject
of comment in the Part B statement.
<P>

82  	In the <i>Savage Resources</i> case, the Part A statement for a
cash bid subject to a minimum acceptance clause set out the offeror's
intentions concerning the
target in the event that the target became its wholly
owned subsidiary.  Those intentions included the achievement of synergistic
benefits from operating the target's US zinc assets in conjunction with the
offeror's Australian and European zinc operations;  disposal
of the target's
coal interests and its interest in a copper and gold project;  a review of
whether to continue to develop or dispose
of certain other exploration assets;
and the probable closure of the target's Sydney head office as part of a
process of reducing
or eliminating costs arising from the maintenance of a
separate share registry, secretarial and head office functions for the target.
No complaint was made about the sufficiency of this disclosure.  However, the
target complained that the offeror had not adequately
disclosed its intentions
should the target become a controlled entity but not a wholly owned subsidiary.
The Part A statement said
that although the offeror had no present intention of
waiving the minimum acceptance condition in the offer, if this were done and
the target became a controlled entity but not a wholly owned subsidiary, the
offeror would review whether continuation of the target's
listing was
worthwhile, replace some or all of the directors of the target to reflect the
offeror's ownership interest, and implement
such of its intentions as were
consistent with the target being a controlled entity but not a wholly owned
subsidiary.  The Part
A statement said that the offeror would only make a
decision on these possible courses of action following receipt of legal and
financial
advice, and its intentions must be read subject to the legal
obligation of the board of directors of the target to have regard to
the
interests of all of the target's shareholders.
<P>

83  	Hely J held that the statement of intentions was adequate, and
that there was no evidence which would establish that the offeror
had any
intentions which had not been disclosed.  He noted the law's rigorous
insistence that a majority shareholder cannot dictate
to directors how they
should discharge their duties of office, and took the view that clause 20 does
not require the formation of
specific intentions which would pay only lip
service to the basis company law.  He said that statements as to the offeror's
intention
should its preferred position that there be no waiver of the minimum
acceptance condition change must necessarily be guarded, because
in that event
the reconstituted board would have to act in the interests of the target's
shareholders as a whole.  
<P>

<b>Management plans and corporate intentions</b>
<P>

84  	It is plain from my account of the facts that various management
groups and individuals within CWO had developed plans prior
to 22 April 1999
relating to the business, assets and employees of AAPT.  It would be absurd to
require that all of these plans be
disclosed in the Part A statement.  Clause
20 does not do so.  It confines the disclosure obligation to particulars of the
offeror's
intentions regarding stated matters, and  possible courses of action
which the offeror is considering.  
<P>

85  	Although clause 20(2) is undoubtedly very wide, a possible
course of action need not be disclosed in the Part A statement unless
it is
being `considered' by the offeror.  In my opinion, clause 20(2) does not
require disclosure of possible courses of action which
have no rational
attraction or likelihood of adoption, even if they have been discussed at board
or senior management level, since
mere discussion does not imply that the
offeror `is considering' the matter which is discussed.  Disclosure of such
matters would
be likely to mislead offeree shareholders, because disclosure
that a course of action is being considered implies that there is at
least a
plausible possibility of implementation.  The commonsense observations in the
<i>Susquehanna Corp</i> case (cited above), that the offer must be careful not
to `delineate extravagantly' or `overstate the definiteness of the plans',
are
adaptable to the proper construction of clause 20(2), and are reinforced by the
observations of Sheppard J in <i>Gantry Acquisition</i> (51 FCR at 560) and
Sackville J in <i>Ampolex </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=14%20ACLC%20769" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(14 ACLC 769)</a> which I have extracted above.
<P>

86  	In the present case it cannot and has not been asserted that any
distinction should be drawn between the intentions of and
consideration of
possible courses of action by CWO and CWOI.  But counsel for the defendants
submits there is an important distinction
between the intentions of and
consideration by those companies and the intentions of and consideration by
individuals and working
groups within the CWO management.  He says that when
clause 20 requires disclosure of the intentions of and consideration by a
corporate
offeror, what must be disclosed are the intentions and consideration
of the offeror's board of directors.  According to counsel,
the court may
examine the evidence in order to determine whether the Part A statement
accurately and completely states the intentions
of and consideration by the
board, but it cannot impute to the corporate offeror intentions held and
considerations undertaken by
management which have not expressly or impliedly
been adopted or undertaken by the board.  He submits that there are indications
in the Corporations Law that it is the board's intentions and considerations
that matter:  s 637(1)(a)(ii) requires that the Part
A statement by signed by
directors of the offeror;  s 704(2)(b)(i) attributes liability to the
directors, unless they were not present
when the board authorised the signing
of the Part A statement or they voted against that resolution.  He also seeks
to draw support
from ss 656 and 657, which limit the circumstances in which an
offer can be varied, and s 663(2) which limits the circumstances in
which the
offeror may declare the offer to be free from the condition, though it seems to
me that these sections are of no assistance
because they relate to the offer
rather than the content of the Part A statement.  Counsel concedes that the
documentary evidence
shows an evolution of thinking on the part of CWO's
management personnel, but he submits that this is no more than one would expect
to find.  
<P>

87  	This is an important submission with which I propose to deal
fully.  For the sake of simplicity, I shall refer only to the
disclosure of
particulars of the offeror's intentions under clause 20(1).  However, the
observations which I shall make in response
to counsel's submissions also
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the offeror's obligation in clause 20(2) to specify
possible courses of
action which the offeror is considering.  
<P>

88  	I cannot agree with the defendants that the disclosure
requirement of clause 20 is confined to the intentions adopted by the
board,
either expressly or by virtue of their implied assent to board papers written
by management.  If the submission were correct,
the offeror's management could
emasculate clause 20 by strictly limiting the amount of information about
planning which they presented
to the board.  On the other hand, it cannot be
right that the Part A statement must disclose a statement of intention
expressed by
an officer of the offeror whenever the officer has corporate
authority to make the statement - for example, I would not think it
necessary
in normal circumstances to disclose in the Part A statement representations
about the offeror's intention made by its Public
Relations Department.  
<P>

89  	In the <i>Stirling Resources</i> case Hill J declined to
attribute to the offeror some statements of intention expressed by individual
directors, on the ground that
a company acts through its board of directors
rather than through individual directors (14 ACLC at 1010).  He contemplated an
exception
to that proposition where a particular person is as a matter of fact
the directing mind and will of the offeror.  In the <i>ICAL</i> case evidence
given by a witness who was found to be the controlling mind and decision-maker
for the offeror was treated as evidence
of the offeror's intention.  In other
cases, however, including <i>Cumberland Credit</i> and <i>Ampolex</i>, evidence
by an executive officer was treated without discussion as going to the
offeror's intention.  
<P>

90  	In my opinion evidence about the intentions of the directors of
the offeror as a body, including evidence about intentions
implied from the
fact that they have not demurred from a management paper, and evidence about
the intentions of a person (if any)
who is the directing mind and will of the
offeror, can safely be regarded as evidence of the intentions of the corporate
offeror.
 However, in my view, evidence of the intentions of the offeror may
arise from another source.  If an individual has the board's
authority to plan
the acquisition as a whole, or to develop an integration plan for the acquired
entity, that individual's intentions
with respect to relevant matters may be
evidence of the intentions of the offeror, even if they have not been placed
before the board
or the chief executive (if the person is not the chief
executive), and even if the individual concerned would have no separate
authority
to implement the plans.  
<P>

91  	The knowledge of a corporate officer may be attributed to the
company for the purpose of applying statutory provisions, if
the policy
underlying those provisions makes it appropriate to do so:  <i>Meridian Global
Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/1995_5a.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 500.</a>  Thus,
an investment officer's knowledge about a securities transaction may be
attributed to his employer even though its managing
director and board were
unaware of the transaction, for the purpose of determining whether the company
has failed to comply with
a statutory obligation to disclose a substantial
shareholding, because the policy of the substantial shareholding provisions is
to
compel immediate disclosure.  That is a case where, to use Lord Hoffmann's
words, neither the company's `primary rules of attribution'
nor the general
principles of the law of agency would be adequate to identify the individuals
whose knowledge should be attributed
to the company, and so a special rule of
attribution is needed.
<P>

92  	By analogy, it seems to me that a special rule of attribution is
needed for the purpose of identifying the corporate officers
whose intentions
are capable of being attributed to their company for the purposes of clause 20
of s 750.  In my opinion, the intentions
of those corporate officers who are
responsible for planning an acquisition or the integration of the acquired
entity may be attributed
to their company for the purpose of establishing the
offeror's intentions which must be disclosed under clause 20, having regard
to
the policy underlying that clause, which is to put shareholders in possession
of the information required to enable them to make
an informed and critical
assessment of the offer and an informed decision as to whether to accept it:
<i>Samic</i>, 60 SASR at 303 per King CJ.  Management plans developed by those
who are responsible for planning may form part of the information
which the
offeree shareholder needs in order to make a critical assessment of the offer
and an informed decision, if the plans are
current and have not been disavowed
by the offeror's board.  
<P>

93  	Any question about the status of such management intentions is
answered when the board reviews a draft Part A statement which
sets out all
relevant management intentions.  If the board adopts the draft, then clearly
the stated intentions are then the intentions
of the offeror.  If a management
plan is incorporated into the draft Part A statement and the board rejects that
part of the draft,
then the plan is not, at least thereafter, part of the
offeror's intentions.  In effect, this is what happened to the disclosure
in
the Part A statement of CWO's intentions with respect to AAPT's employees.  The
board disagreed with management's draft and the
draft was revised to accord
with the board's intention.  But if the draft which is reviewed and adopted by
the board omits a relevant
management intention, held by an officer with
responsibility for planning the acquisition or developing an integration plan
for the
acquired entity, the Part A statement is open to challenge for failure
to comply with clause 20.  Though the outcome will depend
on the facts, it is
unlikely that the Court would conclude that management's intention has been
effectively countermanded and extinguished
by the board's adoption of the Part
A statement, if the board's attention has not been drawn to that intention -
even if the Part
A statement adopted by the board purports to be an exhaustive
statement of the offeror's intention.
<P>

94  	It is a consequence of this view that directors may be liable
for a deficiency in a Part A statement caused by the omission
to refer to
relevant management intentions in the statement of the offeror's intentions.
The risk of liability to directors may be
addressed by the responsible officers
ensuring that all relevant intentions are set out in the draft Part A statement
placed before
the board for approval;  and by the directors satisfying
themselves that management has not omitted any such matters.   
<P>

95  	In the present case there is no evidence to suggest that there
was any dominant `directing mind and will' in CWO or CWOI. 
However, the
evidence indicates that Mr Anderson had overall responsibility for planning the
acquisition, and that Mr George was
responsible for integration planning.  My
opinion is that the Part A statement should have included in the offeror's
intentions the
intentions which had been formed by Mr George as well as by Mr
Anderson, having regard to their respective positions and responsibilities,
except to the extent that the board considered and rejected those intentions or
they had been abandoned.  This conclusion entails
that I must assess the
adequacy of paragraph 18 of the Part A statement by reference to the evidence
of Mr George and the documents
which, according to my findings, disclose Mr
George's current intentions at the time of adoption of the draft Part A
statement by
the boards of CWO and CWOI on 22 and 23 April 1999.  I shall
undertake this assessment later in my reasons for judgment.  
<P>

96  	If I am wrong with respect to the relevance of management
intentions to the disclosure obligation in clause 20, it nevertheless
seems to
me that in the present case the contents of the preliminary integration plan,
the board papers for the UK board's March
1999 meeting and the CWO board's 22
April meeting, and probably also the draft board paper dated 12 March 1999,
should all be treated
as relevant to the disclosure of the offeror's intentions
in this case for another reason.  The paper of 12 March and the board paper
for
22 April 1999 (based closely on the UK board paper) were considered by CWO's
board which made decisions in light of them.  It
can be inferred, in the
absence of other evidence, that the board approved and impliedly adopted the
plans which they contained.
 The preliminary integration plan was summarised in
the board paper for the 22 April meeting and to that extent, the CWO board
impliedly
adopted that plan as well.  The plans and intentions in those papers
therefore became part of the offeror's intentions for the purposes
of Part A
disclosure.
<P>

97  	As I have indicated previously, the observations which I have
made about disclosure of intentions under clause 20(1) are also
applicable to
the disclosure of possible courses of action considered by the offeror, for the
purposes of clause 20(2).  In my opinion
clause 20(2) requires disclosure of
possible courses of action considered by the board, either through express
discussion and resolutions
or by virtue of the fact that the course of action
is contained in a board paper impliedly adopted by the board, and also courses
of action considered by those who had the responsibility for the conduct of the
acquisition and integration planning - in this case
Mr Anderson and Mr George.

<P>

<b>The adequacy of the defendants' disclosure of intentions in the Part A
statement</b>
<P>

98  	The plaintiff attacks paragraph 18 of the Part A statement on
many grounds.  However, on analysis there are only two kinds
of criticism:
first, that paragraph 18 inherently fails to comply with clause 20;  and
secondly, that paragraph 18 is inaccurate
or incomplete and therefore
misleading, because it contradicts or omits external facts about the
defendants' intentions.
<P>

99  	As to the first category of complaints, I agree with the
plaintiff that paragraph 18 is not especially informative.  It is
expressed in
relatively legalistic rather than commercial terms and uses guarded and
qualified language.  But these matters do not
of themselves render paragraph 18
deficient.  
<P>

100  	Some of the language used in paragraph 18 is vague.  The word
`integrate' figures prominently in paragraph 18.6, notwithstanding
Ryan J's
criticism of the use of that word in the <i>Associated Dairies </i> case (44
FCR at 343).  A `strategic and financial review' is proposed.  In <i>ICAL</i>,
Bryson J criticised the expression `strategic review' as indeterminate language
with vaguely military connotations.  The addition
of the word `financial' makes
the matter worse, vaguely suggesting collaboration between the military and
business worlds.
<P>

101  	In the present case, however, paragraph 18 uses these
inherently vague words in a context which adds meaning to them.  Thus,
here we
are not merely told of an intention to integrate the operations of the offeror
and the target, as were the shareholders of
<i>Associated Dairies</i>;  we are
told the particular business operations which are possible candidates for
integration.  Paragraph 5.2 gives some further
content to paragraph 18.6 by
summarising CWO's business divisions.  It is true that paragraph 18 does not
identify the kind of integration
which is to be considered or the way in which
it will be proposed to be achieved.  Paragraph 18.2 says, in effect, that the
offeror
does not and cannot make decisions on these questions until the
proposed review has taken place.  In the <i>Cumberland Credit</i> case Beach J
contemplated that there may be cases where, in effect, clause 20 imposes a duty
on the offeror to form an intention
before issuing the Part A statement.  But
in <i>Savage Resources</i>, Hely J pointed out that clause 20 should not be
used to override the basic principle of company law that a majority shareholder
cannot dictate management decisions to the board, which must act in the best
interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole.
 In the present
circumstances, it may well be misleading to set out specific mechanisms for
integration even if they are only presented
as intentions or possible courses
of action, because their specificity might suggest to the lay reader that the
target board has
no option but to comply, even if the minimum acceptance
condition is waived.  Both Sheppard J in <i>Gantry Acquisition</i> and
Sackville J in <i>Ampolex</i> drew attention to the need for careful language
which reflects the commercial situation and avoids encouraging speculation, in
a
case where intentions cannot be formulated precisely until the takeover is
completed.  Here the language heeds those warnings and
paragraph 18.8 reminds
the reader of the overriding responsibilities of the target board, as did the
statement of intentions in the
<i>Savage Resources</i> case.
<P>

102  	Details of the agenda and procedures of the Business Review and
Integration Committee are not given in the Part A statement,
but paragraph 18
goes beyond the disclosure of intentions in the <i>ICAL</i> case, because it
tells us that the strategic and financial review by the Committee will
encompass the steps listed in paragraph 18.6,
and will not merely be a review
of business operations at large. 
<P>

103  	In the <i>Savage Resources</i> case the Part A statement
contained a list of intentions in the event that the target became the
offeror's wholly owned subsidiary,
that list being at approximately the same
level of generality as the bullet points in paragraph 18.6.  That aspect of the
Part A
statement was not challenged.  The target's challenge was to a paragraph
in the Part A statement which said that if the offeror waived
the minimum
acceptance condition and the target became a controlled but not wholly owned
entity, it would implement such of the listed
intentions as were consistent
with that position.  In the present case, Mr George considered whether the
statement of intentions
should distinguish between 100% ownership and a lesser
level of control, and concluded that the defendants' intentions would be the
same whether the outcome was complete ownership or merely control, although the
prospect of achieving the integration which would
be considered after close of
the bid would obviously be affected by the level of ownership.  Assuming for
the time being that the
Part A statement is in that respect an accurate
reflection of the offeror's intentions, there can be no objection to disclosure
in
that form.  Specifically, I reject the notion that an offeror whose
intentions are the same whatever the level of control might be
has a legal duty
to subdivide the disclosure of its intentions by reference to whether it
achieves 100% ownership.  And I also reject
the submission that clause 20
imposes a duty on the offeror to form an intention which it otherwise would not
have formed, regarding
such matters as business plans, asset disposals and
dividend policy for the target in the event that it is not wholly owned after
the bid.  An objection would arise, relevantly, only if the disclosure of
intentions was contingent and incomplete, as in the <i>Stirling Resources</i>
case.  
<P>

104  	The last bullet point of paragraph 18.6 has been the subject of
particular criticism.  It says that the offeror will consider
whether to
dispose of assets identified by the Committee as being surplus to the ongoing
requirements of the combined groups.  There
are two problems here - one, which
is discussed later, is that this broad statement would be inadequate if the
evidence indicated
that the offeror had a more specific intention;  the other
is that the statement is so broad that it might be seen as meaningless.
 On the
latter point, it seems to me that the statement conveys some limited
information to the reader, and is therefore not inherently
objectionable.  It
tells the reader that one of the agenda items for the Committee's review is the
question of asset disposal, and
that the criterion for decisions on that
question will be whether the assets are surplus to ongoing requirements.  The
criterion
may be broad and obvious, but it is not without content.  One may
have wished for a more informative statement, but if the statement
accurately
reflects the offeror's intention and there is nothing more to say about asset
disposals at this stage (see below), then
the complaint must fail.  
<P>

105  	Perhaps the principal complaint about paragraph 18 is that it
proceeds on too narrow a view of the concept of `intention',
and overlooks the
requirements of clause 20 that the offeror disclose intentions which are
alternative or contingent or subject to
further consideration or review
(requirements arising out of the <i>Cumberland Credit </i>and <i>ICAL</i>
cases), and that it disclose all possible courses of action which the offeror
is considering.
<P>

106  	In my opinion paragraph 18 is not confined to disclosure of
`final decisions'.  If it were, the paragraph would be much shorter,
as the
defendants say that no final decisions have been reached.  The point of
paragraph 18.6, for example, is to disclose a series
of intentions which amount
to less than final decisions, namely intentions to consider the listed steps.
Echoing the reasoning of
Heerey J in the <i>QIW</i> case, AAPT says that the
reference in paragraph 18.22 to `final decisions' implies that there must be
some decisions or formed intentions
of an interim kind, which have not been
disclosed.  I agree that the expression `final decisions' implies that there
has been or
will be a process of thinking about the issues prior to finality
being reached.  In my opinion, however, the Part A statement makes
disclosure
of this interim stage, principally in paragraph 18.6.  There we are told that
the offeror intends to consider various
steps in light of the Committee's
review;  it will make `final decisions' at that stage.  
<P>

107  	I was initially more troubled by AAPT's submission that
paragraph 18 was incorrectly confined to the disclosure of intentions,
and
failed also to disclose of possible courses of action which are under
consideration.  On reflection, however, I have concluded
that there is adequate
disclosure of possible courses of action in paragraph 18.6, combined with the
procedural course of action
constituted by the proposal to establish the
Committee and conduct a review.  The fact that paragraph 18.6 identifies the
listed
steps as matters which the offeror `intends to consider' does not
preclude me from treating those steps, for the purpose of clause
20(2), as
possible courses of action.  My conclusion would have been easier if the
matters listed in paragraph 18.6 had been expressly
identified as possible
courses of action and it had been made clear that the offeror is already
considering them, while intending
to give them further consideration and make
final decisions after the Committee's review has been completed.  However, to
accept
nothing less than explicit drafting of that kind would be to place form
over substance.  The present drafting implies, clearly enough,
that the listed
steps are being considered as possible courses of action, for otherwise it
would be hard to explain their appearance
in the Part A statement.  I
specifically reject the submission that the language of paragraph 18.6 implies
as a matter of construction,
that no consideration has yet been given to the
listed matters.
<P>

108  	My conclusion is that the challenge to paragraph 18 fails, in
so far as it relies on patent deficiencies in the drafting of
the paragraph.

<P>

<b>The Part A disclosure and extrinsic evidence of the offeror's
intentions</b>
<P>

109  	The next question is whether paragraph 18 is an accurate and
complete account of particulars of the offeror's intentions,
and the possible
courses of action being considered by the offeror, relating to the matters set
out in clause 20.  This requires
me to return to the evidence.
<P>

110  	I have already given my reasons for concluding that the
documentary evidence relevant to the offeror's actual intentions is
limited to
the documents authorised or adopted by the CWO board (and the CWOI board), Mr
Anderson or Mr George.  The following are
the relevant documents:
<P>

&#183;	the minutes of the board meetings of CWO of 15 and 22 April 1999, and
CWOI of 23 April 1999;
<P>

&#183;	the CWO board paper for the meeting of 22 April 1999;
<P>

&#183;	the Cable &amp; Wireless plc board paper for the March 1999 meeting;
<P>

&#183;	the preliminary integration plan;
<P>

&#183;	the draft CWO board paper of 12 March 1999.
<P>

Also relevant is the evidence of Mr George and Mr O'Brien with respect to what
occurred at the CWO board meeting of 22 April 1999,
and the consequent changes
to paragraph 18 of the Part A statement.
<P>

111  	The July 1998 paper has not been attributed to the board or any
executive with special responsibility concerning the acquisition,
and in any
case it does not add to or contradict paragraph 18 in any meaningful way.  The
`amortisation/key drivers' paper has not
been attributed to any persons whose
intentions are relevant for the purposes of clause 20, and neither has the
`Merlin synergies-breakdown'
paper or the single page `comparison of CWO and
AAPT'.  The various question and answer papers by the Public Affairs Department
are
in the same category.
<P>

112  	As to Mr Anderson's e.mail of 28 April 1999, it is unnecessary
to determine whether it represents a statement of intentions
which should be
attributed to him, for even if it were, it would not in my opinion imply or
even suggest that paragraph 18 was inaccurate
or incomplete, particularly as
what is said there is expressed to be `subject to the review'.
<P>

113  	The briefing notes show that the defendants were in possession
of a great deal of information relevant to their negotiations
with the ACCC,
but for reasons I shall explain, this is not information which was required to
be included in the Part A statement.
 On the question of intentions, my opinion
is that while the briefing notes imply that a great deal of planning had
occurred within
CWO's management, the notes do not identify any matter which
constitutes an intention or possible course of action and which contradicts
or
is omitted from the Part A statement, even if one assumes that the author of
the briefing notes was a person whose intentions
and consideration counts for
the purposes of clause 20.  The nearest one comes to relevant information about
intentions is the information
about LMDS on page 33 of the notes.  But that
information is directed towards an analysis of market power rather than
intentions,
and while it notes some restrictions on deployment of the LMDS
Spectrum and a likely auction of additional LMDS Spectrum in 1999,
none of this
suggests anything about continuation of or major changes to AAPT's business and
assets.
<P>

114  	Moreover, in my opinion it has not been shown that the briefing
notes, in so far as they may relate to intentions and consideration
of possible
courses of action, reflect intentions of and consideration by a person whose
intentions and consideration count for the
purposes of clause 20.  Mr George's
evidence is that he did not know about the briefing notes until 13 May 1999.
There is no evidence
that either Mr Anderson or the board expressly or
impliedly approved them.
<P>

115  	The provisional integration plan was prepared by Mr George,
whose intentions and consideration count, in my opinion, for the
purposes of
clause 20.  In part, the plan is an analysis of the market position, weaknesses
and needs of CWO.  Those matters, presumably
confidential, are not intentions
or considerations of courses of action and are therefore not required to be
disclosed by clause
20.  There is then a statement of synergies offered by the
acquisition of AAPT.  In my opinion, to the extent that the synergies
identify
or imply intentions or possible causes of action, paragraph 18 in fact
discloses the integration steps which are to be considered
in order to take
advantage of those synergies.  The `integration issues' which the paper
discusses, are best regarded as matters
of process and pitfalls of
implementation, not relating to the intention of integration but rather to its
satisfactory implementation.
 They are therefore not required to be disclosed
by clause 20.
<P>

116  	This leaves us with the disclosure in the plan of the `ideal
split of businesses post acquisition'.  This is a list of business
segments of
CWO and AAPT connected by arrows which signify the direction in which
`integration' will be achieved.  In some cases,
the arrow appears to signify
that a business segment of AAPT will be integrated into a business segment of
CWO, and in other cases
the reverse will occur.  The notes immediately below
this table speak of the `transfer' of businesses.  AAPT therefore contends that
paragraph 18 is deficient because the plan discloses a more specific set of
intentions than the `integration' which the offeror `intends
to consider',
according to paragraph 18.6.  
<P>

117  	In my opinion, it would be incorrect to regard this part of the
provisional integration plan as a statement of intentions
or a consideration of
possible courses action going beyond what is disclosed in paragraph 18.6.  In
reaching this conclusion I have
taken into account several factors.  The plan
is described in the UK and CWO board papers as a `provisional' plan, and its
drafting
reflects this characterisation.  It is a commercial rather than legal
document.  Consequently the reference to the `transfer' of
business should not
be construed in a precise legal manner, but rather as signifying a commercial
intention that various business
units be folded together and in that process,
one or other of the existing business units would be dominant.  The legal
mechanism
for achieving the `transfers' to which the plan refers could not be
determined at this stage, since much will depend upon whether
AAPT is wholly
owned or merely controlled after the takeover is complete.  That is made clear
in paragraph 18.8.  In those circumstances,
it is wrong-headed to criticise
paragraph 18.6 for use of the vaguer word `integration', since use of the word
`transfer' would be
misleading.  
<P>

118  	Mr George's oral evidence reinforces my view that the word
`transfer' was used in the preliminary integration plan in a broad
commercial
sense, rather than to designate a particular form of legal transaction.  He
used the expressions `transfer', `merge' and
`integrate' interchangeably.  He
distinguished between his commercial concept of `transfer' and what he called
`the actual method'
by which integration would be achieved.
<P>

119  	I have reached a similar conclusion concerning the draft CWO
board paper of 12 March 1999.  Under the heading `Business Integration',
the
paper recommends a carefully planned integration, to be achieved by taking a
number of steps.  The steps listed in the paper
may be compared with the bullet
points in paragraph 18.6.  As with the provisional integration plan, the paper
uses the word `transfer'
in a commercial and imprecise way, and for the reasons
already given I reject any criticism of paragraph 18.6 based on the use of
the
word `integrate' in the corresponding bullet points.  The first specific step
mentioned in the paper no longer represents management
thinking, according to
the evidence of Mr George.  Some of the matters disclosed in the paper do not
go to the matters relevant to
clause 20.  Other matters are, in my opinion,
adequately covered by paragraph 18.  
<P>

120  	I should mention, in particular, the question of redeployment
of fixed assets, in view of the relative vagueness of the last
dot point of
paragraph 18.6.  Fortunately, on the view which I take of the facts, it is
unnecessary for me to form an opinion on
the meaning of `fixed assets', a
concept borrowed, perhaps unhappily, from the London City Code.  The paper of
12 March 1999 proposes
to `investigate and assess the potential to sell
residual assets including the CDMA spectrum and specific business areas not
complementary
to CWO's ongoing strategy'.  This suggests a more particular
intention or possible course of action than is disclosed in paragraph
18.6.
However, the matter is explained in Mr George's affidavit of 13 May 1999.  He
says that in formulating the draft intentions
clause during the period between
31 March and 22 April 1999, he decided that consideration should only be given
after the acquisition
of AAPT to any potential sale of the CDMA spectrum, since
no view could be formed until a review had been undertaken of AAPT's
confidential
information concerning this asset.  Considered together, the
evidence suggests that in March 1999 the eventual sale of the CDMA spectrum
was
being considered as a possible course of action, though it probably could not
be said that it had been elevated to the status
of an intention, or even an
alternative intention.  But by 22 April 1999, when the CWO board approved the
Part A statement, further
consideration had been suspended by Mr George, and it
was not true at that time that the sale was even being considered as a possible
course of action.  Mr George had decided that the matter should no longer be
considered for the entirely plausible reason that no
view could be formed until
AAPT's confidential information was obtained.  
<P>

121  	Those conclusions are consistent with the evidence about
thinking on the LMDS technology.  The board papers for the UK board
meeting of
March 1999 and the CWO board meeting of 22 April 1999, in the context of
`longer term opportunities for savings', say
`there may also be considerable
savings arising from the abandonment or more selective application' of the LMDS
technology.  That
was not presented as a factor in the calculus of `synergy
benefits' and was postponed for later consideration.
<P>

122  	As to the two board papers, AAPT seeks to make much of the fact
that the word `brief', which appeared in the UK paper, was
omitted from the CWO
paper.  But in my view this merely suggests that thinking about the proposed
review by the Business and Integration
Committee had matured during the period
between mid-March and mid-April, and by the latter time management realised, no
doubt after
receiving legal advice, that the review would need to be more than
a `brief assessment'.  I reject AAPT's submission that according
to the
evidence, CWO and CWOI did not intend the Committee to consider whether to
integrate, but only to carry out a brief review
of the process of integration.
Mr George's evidence, in particular, implies that paragraph 18.5 accurately
states the offeror's intentions
and proposals with respect to the Committee.
<P>

123  	As to the `established' synergies which are `realistic and
achievable', according to the board papers, the evidence does not
show that the
relevant calculations by management were made or adopted by Mr Anderson or Mr
George, and therefore the board papers
do not reflect or imply any intentions
or the consideration of any possible courses of action for the purposes of
clause 20, other
than as disclosed in paragraph 18.6.  The reference to
abandonment or more selective application of the LMDS technology does not,
in
my opinion, denote an intention or consideration of a possible course of
action, the board papers being consistent with the view
that any consideration
of such matters should be undertaken only after the defendants have obtained
access to AAPT's confidential
information.
<P>

124  	My conclusion is that there is nothing in the provisional
integration plan, the draft CWO board paper of 12 March 1999 or
the two board
papers, nor in the evidence of Mr George and Mr O'Brien, which would lead me to
the view that paragraph 18 is inaccurate
or incomplete.
<P>

125  	I turn to AAPT's complaint about disclosure of the offeror's
intentions regarding the future employment of present employees
of the target,
and possible courses of action being considered.  I reject AAPT's submission on
this point for reasons which I have
already given.  To recapitulate:  some of
the material on which AAPT relies to show a more specific intention on CWO's
part than
is disclosed in paragraph 18 is contained in documents which the
evidence does not show to have been adopted or approved by the CWO
or CWOI
boards, Mr Anderson or Mr George.  As to the intentions of Mr Anderson and Mr
George, their views were embodied in the draft
Part A statement which was
considered by the CWO board on 22 April 1999, and the board rejected the draft
on this point.  The Part
A statement was then redrafted to reflect that board's
opinion.  There is no basis for suggesting that it failed to do so nor, in
my
opinion, any ground for concluding that the statements about employees in the
final document were an inaccurate or incomplete
account of the offeror's
intentions and the possible courses of action which, at the time of adoption of
the Part A statement by
CWOI's board on 23 April 1999, were being considered by
the offeror.
<P>

126  	Consequently AAPT's challenge under clause 20 of Part A of s
750 to the disclosure of the offeror's intentions in the Part
A statement
fails.  AAPT also submitted that the fact that the defendants have engaged in
extensive analysis with respect to AAPT
should have been disclosed under clause
17 of Part A of s 750.  I accept that clause 17 may require disclosure of
aspects of the
offeror's intentions not required to be disclosed by clause 20.
But in my opinion the bare fact that extensive analysis has been
undertaken is
not a material fact required to be disclosed under clause 17.
<P>

<b>The other grounds of challenge - clause 17 of Part A of s 750</b>
<P>

127  	AAPT's other three grounds for challenging the Part A statement
are that it fails to disclose other material information in
contravention of
clause 17.  The other material information relates to synergies and benefits,
competition issues and aspects of
funding.  
<P>

128  	Clause 17 states:
<P>

`The statement shall set out any other information material to the making of
the decision by an offeree whether or not to accept
an offer, being information
that is known to the offeror and has not previously been disclosed to the
holders of shares in the target
company.'
<P>

It was introduced into Australian takeover law, without explanation in the
explanatory memorandum, by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cosa1980316/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980</a>.  It
is not unlike what was then Rule 15(1) of the London City Code (see now Rule
23).
<P>

129  	The principles to be applied in determining what is and is not
material for the purposes of clause 17 have been elucidated
in several recent
cases, including <i>Cultus Petroleum NL v OMV Australia Pty Ltd </i>(Supreme
Court of New South Wales, Santow J, 5 May 1999), <i>Aberfoyle Ltd v Western
Metals Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 ACSR 187</a>, <i>Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Marsh
Electrical Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 ACSR 245</a> and <i>Pancontinental Mining Ltd v
Goldfields Ltd </i>(1995) 16 ACSR 463.  Questions of materiality were also
considered in some of the cases dealing with clause 20, cited earlier in this
judgment.  In the <i>Pancontinental </i>and <i>Cultus Petroleum </i>cases
Tamberlin J and Santow J respectively have usefully summarised some of the most
important principles concerning materiality.
<P>

130  	Before considering AAPT's submissions as to the specific
inadequacies of the Part A statement, I wish to make some remarks
about a
question of principle which was agitated between the parties.  The basic
standard of materiality is whether the information
in question might reasonably
affect or tend to affect the decision of the ordinary investor whether or not
to accept the offer: 
<i>Cultus Petroleum</i>, at 13 and cases there cited.
There is a question whether it is necessary to prove that the information, if
disclosed, would have
been likely to alter the investor's decision, or merely
that the information would have assumed actual significance in the investor's
deliberations (<i>Cultus Petroleum</i> at 13, citing US authorities), but it is
unnecessary to say more about that issue here.  
<P>

131  	The issue which has arisen in the present case arises in the
following way.  AAPT submits that the question for the ordinary
investor to
consider, when confronted with a Part A statement and offer, is not merely
whether to accept or reject the offer.  AAPT
submits that offeree shareholders
have five options:  to accept the offer for all their shares;  to accept for
part of their shares;
 to reject the offer;  to sell their shares on the stock
market;  or to wait and see whether a competing bid emerges, whether the
offeror increases its bid, or, in the case of a conditional bid, such as the
bid in the present case, whether the conditions are
satisfied or waived.  It
follows, according to AAPT, that pursuant to clause 17, the Part A statement
must contain information known
to the offeror which is material to any of the
offeree's choices.  Therefore, says AAPT, the offeree shareholders are entitled
to
information which will help them to decide whether they should remain in the
company, for all or part of their holding, as minority
shareholders after
control has passed to the offeror;  and information going to the value of the
target to the offeror, relevant
to the offeree's assessment of the prospects of
an increase in the bid price and waiver of the minimum acceptance condition.
<P>

132  	The expanded concept of materiality for which AAPT contends has
some support in the cases.  In the <i>Samic</i> case, King CJ thought it
relevant for the offeror to disclose information which could well affect the
offeree shareholders' assessment
of whether the offer was likely to be
improved, the prospects of a competing offer, and the prospects of the shares
if they were
retained in the company under new management (60 SASR at 303).
This reasoning was endorsed by Tamberlin J in the <i>Pancontinental Mining
</i>case (13 ACLC at 581, proposition 6), and he added (at 581-582):
<P>

`7.  Consideration of a Part A statement involves a question as to whether full
and sufficient information has been given to enable
the offeree to make a
judgment concerning how valuable the acquisition will be to the offeror, and
thus making an informed assessment
of whether the offeror may be prepared to
pay more for the shares than its offer suggests.'
<P>

133  	In the <i>Gantry Acquisition</i> case Sheppard J approved of
King CJ's observations and said that they were just as relevant for Part A as
for Part C statements (51
FCR at 561).  
<P>

134  	If it were necessary to disclose in the Part A statement all
information known to the offeror which might reasonably affect
the offeree
shareholders' decisions in any of the options outlined above, some strange
consequences would follow.  It would become
necessary for the offeror to
disclose the highest amount it would be prepared to pay for target shares, or
at least the matters of
fact known to it which would be relevant to that
assessment.  It would be necessary to disclose any matter of fact or intention
(in
addition to intentions required to be disclosed by clause 20) which would
be relevant to the position of minority shareholders of
the target in the event
that the offeror acquired control but not full ownership;  and any decisions
taken or facts relevant to decisions
with respect to timing of any increase in
the bid and the likelihood that another bidder might emerge.  
<P>

135  	It seems to me that to draw these implications would be
contrary to the observations of Bryson J in the <i>Metal Manufacturers
</i>case, where his Honour emphasised that questions of materiality under
clause 17 are to be approached with due regard to the practicalities
of a
market (29 ACSR at 250).  In the <i>Aberfoyle </i>case Finkelstein J said that
in a cash bid, the offeree shareholders must decide whether to accept or reject
the cash offer and it
is of no consequence to them how the bid, if successful,
will impact on the target or its shareholders (28 ACSR at 210).  In <i>Savages
Resources</i> Hely J noted that Finkelstein J's statement placed a narrower
construction on clause 17 than the statement by Tamberlin J in the
<i>Pancontinental </i>case, which I have set out above.  Presumably the
difference which his Honour had in mind was that Finkelstein J seemed to limit
materiality
to information relating to only two of the offeree's choices,
namely whether to accept or reject the cash offer.  
<P>

136  	Hely J remarked that irrespective of whether the two approaches
may be reconciled, it would be an exaggeration of the role
of clause 17 to
require that all perceptions, opinions and assumptions of the offeror as to why
the acquisition is expected to deliver
value to the bidder should be itemised
in the Part A statement.  He said (17 ACLC at 12):
<P>

`The statement in <i>Pancontinental</i> ... cannot in my respectful opinion, be
taken at the flood.  For example, an offeror cannot be expected to disclose, in
a market
situation, how high it might be prepared to go in order to secure
control.'
<P>

137  	It seems to me that two points flow from Hely J's observations,
with which I respectfully agree.  The first is that material
information for
the purposes of clause 17 does not include information that is speculative or
based on mere matters of opinion or
judgment.  I shall return to this point
later.   The second is that, at least in the case of a cash bid, it cannot be
the case that
clause 17 requires disclosure of all facts material to a decision
by offeree shareholders to remain in the target company or to wait
and see
whether the bid is increased or a competing bidder emerges.  Hely J's remarks
imply that the offeror would not be required
to disclose how high it is
prepared to go even if its board has specifically resolved on a figure, so that
the matter goes beyond
speculation or opinion into the realm of fact.  Nor, I
would think, would an offeror be required to disclose otherwise confidential
factual information about a potential competing bidder.  
<P>

138  	If that is so, the challenge is to articulate a principle which
excludes from the realm of material disclosure at least some
of the information
which would be relevant to the offeree shareholders' decisions to wait and see
or to sell in the stock market
or to remain as a minority shareholder of the
target.  Having regard to the view I take as to the factual materiality of the
matters,
about the omission of which AAPT complains, it is not necessary for me
to make a decision in this case at the level of principle.
 Since, however,
issues of principle were raised in argument, I shall comment briefly.  
<P>

139  	A partial reconciliation of the inconsistent approaches
identified by Hely J could be achieved by holding that:
<P>

(i)	in the case of a Part A offer, in contrast with a Part C, it is not
material to disclose to offeree shareholders information
about the prospects of
an increase in the bid price, because they will receive the increased price
whether they accept before or
after the increase occurs (s 655(2);  compare
<i>Gantry Acquisition</i>, 51 FCR at 561 per Sheppard J);
<P>

(ii)	it is unnecessary to disclose in the Part A statement information which
would assist the offeree shareholders to decide whether
to sell on the stock
market, because the disclosure obligation under clause 17 relates only to
information material to their decision
whether or not to accept the takeover
offer, not their decision to enter into a different transaction; 
<P>

(iii)	similarly, information which is relevant to the prospects of a competing
bid need not be disclosed in the Part A statement
because that information is
outside the province of the bidder's takeover offer, and is not properly
characterised as material to
the offeree shareholders' decision whether or not
to accept the bidder's offer;  and
<P>

(iv)	it is material for offeree shareholders to know information which helps
them to decide whether to remain shareholders of the
target for all or part of
their holdings, but there must in fact be such information (as opposed to mere
speculation etc) and that
information must be known to the offeror.  
<P>

<b>Synergies and benefits</b>
<P>

140  	AAPT submits that the Part A statement gives no information
which would allow offeree shareholders to assess the benefits
that might flow
to them if they decide to remain as shareholders of the target after it comes
to be controlled by the offeror.  Of
course, there is no obligation to make
disclosure under clause 17 except where information is known to the offeror,
and so AAPT seeks
to establish that information about the benefits and
synergies which might flow from the success of the bid was contained in CWO's
documents.  
<P>

141  	AAPT refers in particular to the preliminary integration plan;
the quantification of synergies contained in the `Merlin Synergies
- Breakdown'
paper prepared by the Corporate Finance Department of CWO;  and the board
papers for the UK board meeting in March 1999
and the CWO board meeting on 22
April 1999, which assert that CWO has established the total value of synergies
at a figure which
is stated, and that CWO believes the synergies to be
realistic and achievable.  Additionally, AAPT submits that a limited amount
of
information as to synergies and benefits was provided in the briefing to
analysts of 3 May 1999.  The briefing notes refer to
`synergies and
network/asset complementarity' and contain certain assertions of fact which
include the assertion that `CWO has premium
wide bandwidth networks focused on
large corporate and government, and AAPT SME focus in data services and
Internet', and `CWO has
a GSM mobile network and AAPT has Cellular One's
distribution network'.  
<P>

142  	APPT does not seek disclosure of the present quantification of
the values of the synergies, but submits that the Part A statement
should have
disclosed the fact that CWO had made such an assessment, and the substance of
the facts and circumstances known to CWO
as to how and where those benefits
might be achieved, so that AAPT shareholders could make a properly informed and
not speculative
assessment for themselves.  Finally, AAPT submits that the
offeror has clearly contemplated a scenario in which the minimum acceptance
condition is waived and the target becomes a partly owned subsidiary of the
offeror, but has failed to identify the synergies which
might be available in
that event.
<P>

143  	For the purpose of assessing these contentions, I am prepared
to assume that offeree shareholders are entitled to all material
information
known to the offeror to enable them to assess whether to sell on the stock
market, and whether the offeror is likely
to improve its offer or a competing
offer is likely, and to give an idea of how important the acquisition is to the
offeror.  Even
so, offeree shareholders are not entitled to receive everything
that may bear on the offeror's rationale for the bid, the benefits
which the
offeror has identified, how the offeror proposes to obtain those benefits, and
how the company will appear and function
after the close of the bid.  At a
general level, the offeror must be `careful not delineate extravagantly or to
enlarge beyond reasonable
bounds' (<i>Susquehanna Corp</i> case, 423 F 2d at
1085), and the Part A statement must be a document which can be understood and
which will not confuse readers,
so that a degree of selectivity is permissible
in order to confine the information to that which is really useful
(<i>Pancontinental Mining </i>13 ACLC at 582, paragraph 10).  Additionally, it
is not necessary for the Part A statement to canvass the commercial
desirability
of the offer, since the framework of the takeover legislation
assumes that that issue may be taken up in a critical fashion in the
Part B
statement (<i>Pancontinental Mining</i> 13 ACLC at 581, paragraph 3;  see also
<i>Savage Resources </i>17 ACLC at 11).  
<P>

144  	A submission very similar to AAPT's submission in the present
case was considered and rejected by Finkelstein J in the <i>Aberfoyle</i> case.
His Honour rejected the contention that clause 17 requires an offeror to
disclose its evaluation of the target shares or the
economic assumptions upon
which the evaluation is being based;  or that it requires disclosure of matters
of opinion about which
minds may differ, assessments that are based on variable
assumptions or predictions, or the assumptions or predictions upon which
those
assessments are based.  Such `information' would not usually assist a
shareholder in making an informed decision whether to
sell his shares.  AAPT
seeks to distinguish these observations on the ground that it does not seek, as
the plaintiff did in that
case, disclosure of the offeror's quantification of
the value of the synergies.  Additionally, AAPT submits that the decision in
<i>Aberfoyle</i> was only that disclosure of matters of opinion and assessment
would not be of assistance in that case, where the merger was between
two
established mining companies operating in a mature and well understood market
where the possibilities for synergistic gains were
obvious and easy to
understand;  in the present case, given that the telecommunications industry is
new and the factors driving valuations
are not easy to understand, a discussion
of synergistic benefits would be of greater assistance to shareholders.  
<P>

145  	I disagree with AAPT's submissions on synergies and benefits
for the following reasons.  First, in my opinion an indication
of the synergies
and benefits which may flow from the takeover emerges from clause 18.6, when
read together with the information
on CWO's present business in paragraph 5.2
of the Part A statement.  Paragraph 18.6 indicates the steps which will be
investigated
after the takeover.  One can infer that the integration steps
which are there described will be undertaken in order to strengthen
the
combined business operations for the benefit of the merged group.  
<P>

146  	Secondly, I am not persuaded that the documents in which
synergies are analysed and quantified have any particular status
within CWO,
beyond the status of working papers of the Corporate Finance Department.  This
is particularly so of the `Merlin Synergies
- Breakdown' paper.  
<P>

147  	Thirdly, though the board papers for the UK board meeting of
March 1999 and the CWO board meeting of 22 April 1999 assert
that CWO `has
established the total value of synergies' and believes the synergies to be
`realistic and achievable', I am not satisfied
that any document which is in
evidence, other than the board papers themselves, was considered by the boards.
The board papers indicate
in general terms the various sources of the
synergies, in a manner which correlates reasonably closely to the disclosure of
integration
steps in clause 18.6.  
<P>

148  	Fourthly, as to the briefing notes for the meeting with
analysts of 3 May 1999, they contain some factual assertions as well
as some
broad expressions of opinion but I do not regard the factual assertions in the
briefing notes as useful information for offeree
shareholders.  
<P>

149  	Fifthly, the statements about synergies and benefits in the
documents (including, in particular, the preliminary integration
plan) appear
to me to be matters of speculative assessment and opinion of the kind to which
Finkelstein J referred in <i>Aberfoyle</i>.  I conclude that the documents in
evidence do not identify useful information about synergies and benefits known
to the offeror
but not disclosed expressly or impliedly in the Part A
statement.  
<P>

150  	Sixthly, I am not persuaded that it is necessary or would be
useful for the offeror to make the kind of disclosure which AAPT
contends for.
AAPT says that the plaintiff need not quantify the value of synergies but
should disclose the fact that an assessment
of synergies has been made, and the
substance of the facts and circumstances known to it as to how and where the
benefits might be
achieved.  To the extent that such information is to be found
in the documents in evidence, I do not believe that there is any useful
disclosure to be made, other than perhaps in the documents produced by the
Corporate Finance Department which, as I have said, do
not appear to be
anything more than working papers not necessarily adopted or approved by
management.  
<P>

151  	Finally, assuming that offeree shareholders are entitled to
information which will allow them to assess the target's prospects
as an
independent but controlled entity, it has not been shown that there is any
relevant information known to the offeror which
ought to have been disclosed.

<P>

152  	All in all, it seems to me that the submission on synergies and
benefits here is very similar to the submission rejected in
the
<i>Aberfoyle</i> case, and also to the submission about benefits which was
unsuccessfully made in the <i>Savage Resources</i> case.  In the latter case,
Hely J concluded (17 ACLC at 12), admittedly on different facts, that it was by
no means apparent to him
that the greater specificity for which the target
contended in that case would have any real bearing on the decision by offeree
shareholders
whether or not to accept the offer.  I hold the same view with
respect to the matters which AAPT says should have been disclosed
in the
present case.
<P>

<b>Competition issues</b>
<P>

153  	Clause 8.1(e) of the offer makes the offer subject to a
condition that at the end of the offer period either the ACCC has
not commenced
legal proceedings seeking to restrain the acquisition, or it has confirmed in
writing to the offeror that it does not
propose to intervene or does not object
to the acquisition.  By clause 8.7 the offeror may, subject to the Corporations
Law, declare
the offer to be free from this condition.
<P>

154  	AAPT submits that in view of this condition and the obvious
competitive implications of the second largest player in the telecommunications
industry acquiring the third largest where there are only three substantial
players, information should have been given about competition
issues in the
Part A statement.  At one stage AAPT submitted that the information should have
been such as to enable offeree shareholders
to make an assessment of the
competitive implications of the bid.  Expressed in those broad terms, the
proposition is clearly unsustainable.
 Takeover law does not require an offeror
to disclose the effect of the proposed acquisition on competition within the
industry in
which the offeror and the target operate.  
<P>

155  	AAPT's more plausible submission is that the Part A statement
should have disclosed such information about the process of
ACCC approval as
would enable offeree shareholders to make an assessment of the likelihood that
condition 8.1(e) will be satisfied
and also an assessment of the kinds of
concessions which the offeror might be prepared to make in order to obtain ACCC
approval.
 AAPT says disclosure of these matters is material to the offeree
shareholders' decision whether to accept the offer or to take some
other course
of action such as selling into the market.  I shall assume for the purpose of
considering this submission that the law
requires the offeror to disclose
information material to a decision by offeree shareholders to sell into the
market, but I doubt
that this is correct for reasons which I have already set
out.  
<P>

156  	In the present case, counsel for the defendants conceded that
if a decision had been taken by the Commission, it would have
been necessary to
disclose the decision.  I infer from the evidence that no such decision has
been made. 
<P>

157  	AAPT says that the offeror should have disclosed at least the
following:  whether there have been discussions or correspondence
with the ACCC
in relation to the proposed acquisition and if so, the outcome;  whether CWO is
willing to dispose of assets in order
to obtain ACCC approval, and the effect
of any such disposal;  the likelihood that assets may have to be disposed of in
order to
obtain ACCC approval;  CWO's willingness to give undertakings under s
87B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth);  and some general indication of the
assets of CWO or AAPT which may have to be disposed of in order to obtain ACCC
approval.
<P>

158  	In my opinion information of this kind need not be disclosed in
the Part A statement, and there would be a real risk that
its disclosure would
be misleading.  As Tamberlin J said in the <i>Pancontinental Mining</i> case
(13 ACLC at 582), the Part A statement should illuminate the issues rather than
confuse them, and a degree of selectivity is
permitted in order to confine the
information to that which is really useful.  It would not, in my opinion, be
useful for offeree
shareholders to be told about the state of incomplete
negotiations between the offeror and the ACCC, particularly as the making of
the bid would itself be likely to add a new dimension to those negotiations,
since one can assume that the target will itself make
strenuous representations
to the regulator, if it has not already done so.  As I said in my judgment of
12 May 1999 (in which this
issue arose in the context of a contest as to the
validity of a subpoena and notices to produce), matters of negotiation and
planning
for ACCC approval are inherently unstable.  Disclosure prior to
inclusion of the negotiations would be a disclosure of `matters of
opinion
about which minds may differ, assessments that are based on variable
assumptions or predictions' (<i>Aberfoyle</i>, 28 ACSR at 210).  Disclosure of
the bare facts of the negotiation or correspondence could only generate
speculation which would
be likely to mislead offeree shareholders.  It is true
that, as Santow J pointed out in <i>Cultus Petroleum</i> at 15, there may be
occasions when matters of opinion and assessment based on variable assumptions
or predictions may be material
information for the purposes of clause 17, where
it is properly substantiated in a way which avoids it being misleading.  Profit
forecasts in a scrip bid, where the assumptions underlying the forecasts are
carefully set out, preferably with a sensitivity analysis,
may be an example.
But disclosure of information which predicts, or is intended to provide the
basis for predicting, the outcome
of negotiations with a regulator is likely,
at least in most cases, to be disclosure of merely speculative material for
which there
can be no proper substantiation.  
<P>

159  	Similarly, the fact that the offeror may have decided to
dispose of a particular asset if required by the ACCC, or to give
an
undertaking if required, or even the fact that an offer to dispose of an asset
or to give an undertaking has been made by the
offeror to the ACCC, seems to me
to be in the same category, because until the Commission responds to any such
offer an assessment
of its significance to offeree shareholders must be purely
speculative.
<P>

160  	Of course, once a decision has been made by the regulator, the
matter ceases to be one of pure speculation, and if the regulator's
decision is
made before the date of the Part A statement it is likely to be disclosable.
That would probably be so even if the regulator's
decision is subject to review
or appeal, or the offeror has submitted additional information in an effort to
change the regulator's
mind.  I shall refrain from any further generalisation,
because the question of disclosure will inevitably depend on the precise
facts.
One can imagine difficult situations, such as where the offeror is aware that a
decision has been recommended to the Commission
by its officers but the
Commission has not taken it.  
<P>

161  	Additionally, AAPT submits that the Part A statement should
contain the information referred to in the briefing to analysts
on 3 May 1999
and the material which underlay what was disclosed at the briefing.  The
submission is that the tenor of the presentation,
gleaned from a perusal of the
briefing notes, is that the defendants had formed a view that the bid will not
contravene the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.  That view, and the basis for it, are
highly material and should have been disclosed to offeree shareholders.  I
disagree.  The
Part A statement is not a proper vehicle for the offeror to
communicate its case for regulatory approval.  The offeror's view that
the
acquisition would not contravene the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> is simply an opinion,
and in all probability disclosure of the basis for that opinion in the Part A
statement would merely encourage
speculation and would potentially mislead
offeree shareholders.  It would be surprising if the law required an offeror in
a hostile
bid to disclose its hand publicly on the key issue of regulatory
approval, to the principal advantage of those who may wish to counteract
the
offeror's submission to the ACCC (including the target and potential competing
offerors).  
<P>

162  	My conclusion, therefore, is that clause 17 of Part A of s 750
does not require the offeror to disclose any of the matters
to which AAPT's
submission refers.
<P>

<b>Funding issues</b>
<P>

163  	In clause 10 of the Part A statement the offeror states
that:
<P>

(a)	funding for the offer will be provided under a loan facility which CWOI has
entered into with Optus Administration Pty Ltd (`Administration')
(`CWOI
Facility')';  and
<P>

(b)	the funds to be advanced by Administration to CWOI under the CWOI Facility
will be available to Administration by drawing down
funds under two
multi-option syndicate facility agreements (`Credit Facilities').
<P>

164  	Clauses 10.4 and 10.5 of the Part A statement state that the
total amount of cash which the offeror may become obliged to
pay offerees is
approximately $1,384,661,255 and the amount of the CWOI Facility is
$1,390,000,000.  The conditions precedent for
draw down under the Credit
Facilities are summarised in clause 10.7 of the Part A statement.  They include
that certain representations
and warranties remain true, and those
representations and warranties are summarised in clause 10.8.  Another
condition precedent
to draw down is that no potential event of default has
occurred which has not been waived, and the events of default are summarised
in
clause 10.9, supplemented by an explanation of some definitions in clause
10.11.  Clause 10.10 states that the offeror is not
aware of anything which
would prevent the conditions precedent to draw down from being satisfied, and
that Administration will not
draw down the Credit Facilities in a way that
would render it unable to provide the offeror with funds to meet acceptances
under
the bid.  
<P>

165  	The disclosure of sources of funding in clause 10 runs to some
eight pages of a 20 page document (excluding schedules).  This
makes clause 10
by far the longest clause in the Part A statement.  
<P>

166  	AAPT makes a number of specific criticisms of the disclosure of
sources of funding.  The submissions appear to be directed
towards clause 17,
not clause 11 of s 750.  I propose to state and then deal with each one in
turn.
<P>

167  	First, AAPT says that the Part A statement fails to disclose
the source of any additional funding which might be needed if
the offer is
increased.  In my view, neither clause 11 nor clause 17 of s 750 requires any
such disclosure.  Clause 11 applies only
to the acquisition of the shares to
which the takeovers relate.  The takeover offers are the offers accompanying
the Part A statement,
at the price which is stated in the offer document.
Clause 17 requires disclosure of information material to the making of a
decision
by offeree shareholders whether or not to accept the offer.  Again,
the offer is that which is contained in the offer document accompanying
the
Part A statement.  It is not suggested that the offeror has decided to increase
the offer price and in those circumstances, the
only material disclosure
relates to the funding of the price stated in the offer.
<P>

168  	Secondly, AAPT complains that there is no disclosure of the
additional funding which may be required to meet costs and expenses
(for
example, stamp duty, advisers' fees and the cost of marketing the offer).
There is no evidence as to how much these costs and
expenses may be, but AAPT
says they are likely to exceed the difference between the total consideration
payable to accepting offeree
shareholders and the amount of the CWOI Facility.
Even assuming that this is the case, however, my view is that no such
disclosure
was required in the circumstances of this case.  Clause 11 of s 750
does not require disclosure of the source of funding for costs
and expenses:
see <i>Associated Dairies</i>, 44 FCR at 340-341.  I do not accept that the
disclosure of the source of funding for costs and expenses would be material
information
for the purposes of clause 17, in the circumstances of the present
case.  This is a $1.385 billion takeover bid where the Part A
statement
indicates that there is a source of funds of $1.39 billion.  A reasonable
offeree shareholder would assume that there would
be no difficulty funding
costs and expenses in a transaction of that size, given that the offeror is a
wholly owned subsidiary of
a large Australian telecommunications company, the
majority shareholder of which is in turn a very large United Kingdom company.
The reasonable offeree shareholder would not regard it as material to know the
source of funding of costs and expenses.  In any event,
Mr George's evidence is
that costs and expenses will be borne by CWO rather than by CWOI, and it would
be a reasonable assumption
that CWO would be able to bear those costs and
expenses out of operating revenue or other resources. 
<P>

169  	Thirdly, AAPT draws attention to clause 18.7 of the Part A
statement, which says that CWOI has not formed any relevant intention
other
than, inter alia, to maintain the required capital support for the businesses
of AAPT.  AAPT complains that the source of funds
to maintain that capital
support is not disclosed.  In my opinion no such disclosure is required by
clause 17. According to clause
18.7 it is CWOI which has formed the intention
to maintain capital support, but it would be absurd to infer that CWOI's
intention
is to maintain that capital support from its own resources.  The
reasonable assumption is that AAPT's businesses will be financially
supported
by the post-acquisition group, in a manner which may differ depending upon the
level of ownership which has been achieved.
 This is not a matter disclosure of
which might reasonably affect the decision of the ordinary investor whether or
not to accept
the offer:  see <i>Cultus Petroleum </i>at 13.
<P>

170  	Fourthly, AAPT complains that the Part A statement fails to
disclose whether CWOI's source of funding is conditional on a
minimum
acceptance level.  The Part A statement sets out the terms of the CWOI Facility
in paragraph 10.5, and makes no mention of
any such condition.  In the absence
of any evidence to indicate that there is such a condition, AAPT's submission
fails.
<P>

171  	Fifthly, AAPT draws attention to a representation and warranty
by CWO in the Credit Facilities (set out in paragraph 10.8(b)(2)
of the Part A
statement) that:
<P>

`there is no subsidiary of CWO, with an aggregate of net tangible assets and
net intangible assets exceeding 1% of the value of
the shareholders' funds of
CWO and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis (as disclosed in
the last published financial
statements of those companies), which has been in
existence for more than two months and which has not executed guarantees as
required
by the negative pledge deed dated 28 June 1996 relating to the Credit
Facilities to which Administration is a party.'
<P>

One of the conditions precedent which must be satisfied before Administration
can draw down under the Credit Facilities is that
the representations and
warranties (including this one) remain true and correct in all material
respects and are not materially misleading
as at the date of the draw down
notice (paragraph 10.7 of the Part A statement).
<P>

172  	AAPT says that if CWOI acquires more than 50% but less than
100% of the shares in AAPT it will be uncertain whether this warranty
will be
satisfied, and therefore uncertain whether a draw down can take place to pay
for the acquired AAPT shares.  The uncertainty
arises because in that event,
AAPT will not be able to give the guarantee under the negative pledge deed
without AAPT shareholder
approval, because the transaction would be a related
party transaction caught by Chapter 2E of the Corporations Law, and would
amount
to the provision of financial assistance in connection with the
acquisition by CWOI of AAPT shares for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p2j.3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2J.3</a> of the
Corporations Law, and may not satisfy the common law principles which require
that such a transaction be approved by shareholders
unless it is for the
corporate benefit of AAPT's shareholders.  AAPT says that the Part A statement
should draw attention to these
difficulties and provide relevant information
about them.
<P>

173  	The question is whether such disclosure would be material
information for the purposes of clause 17.  In my opinion, it would
not.  The
Part A statement discloses that a condition precedent to draw down under the
Credit Facilities may be waived (paragraph
10.10(c)).  If there were evidence
that the offeror intends to waive the minimum acceptance condition to permit
AAPT to become a
subsidiary but not a wholly owned subsidiary, and that in
those circumstances the financiers under the Credit Facilities would refuse
to
waive the requirement that AAPT give a guarantee, then it seems to me
disclosure would be required under clause 17.  But there
is no such evidence.
By a letter of 6 May 1999, the solicitors for the defendants informed AAPT's
solicitors that the assumption
that the offeror would waive the minimum
acceptance condition, in circumstances where AAPT would then be required to
give a guarantee
without being a wholly owned subsidiary of CWOI, was an
unwarranted and incorrect assumption.  This only says that it is unwarranted
to
assume that the minimum acceptance condition would be waived;  it does not
assert or imply a disclosable intention not to waive
the minimum acceptance
condition in the stated circumstances.  Thus the position as to waiver of the
minimum acceptance condition
is that there is no evidence to justify an
assumption that it would or that it would not be waived if by waiver, the
offeror could
obtain control of AAPT but not 100% ownership.  Further, the
evidence indicates that on 6 May 1999 CWO applied for the consent of
the
financiers to the waiver of the requirement that AAPT give a guarantee in
accordance with the negative pledge deed prior to AAPT
becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary.  The waiver was given in a letter from the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia as agent for the financiers,
on 11 May 1999.
<P>

174  	Counsel of AAPT says that the tender by the defendants of
evidence of the waiver amounts to admission that as at the date
of the Part A
statement (23 April 1999) and the date of registration (27 April 1999), the
Part A statement was defective or misleading.
 Further, to the extent that the
effect of the new material is not disclosed, the Part A statement is factually
incorrect and should
not be permitted to be dispatched.  I do not regard the
tender of the additional material as an admission.  To my mind, it demonstrates
that there was no basis for assuming, as at the date of the Part A statement
and the date of its registration, that the funding problem
which AAPT asserts
is a problem which would actually arise.  Clause 17 does not require the
offeror to close off all possible problems
which could eventuate, by discussion
in the Part A statement.  A problem which was anticipated by the offeror or
would have been
anticipated by a reasonable person in the offeror's shoes may
well be subject to the disclosure obligation in clause 17, but the
evidence
does not show that the subject matter of AAPT's submission is such a problem.
Nor has it been shown that the Part A statement
is factually incorrect with
respect to this aspect of the disclosure of funding;  nor that the offeror's
statement in clause 10.10,
that it is not aware of any circumstance which would
prevent the condition precedent to draw down being satisfied, is correct.
<P>

175  	Finally, AAPT complains that paragraph 10.5 of the Part A
statement refers to terms and conditions of the CWOI facility set
out in a
letter of offer from CWO, rather than from Administration.  In my opinion the
reference to CWO is clearly a typographical
error, and should be a reference to
Administration. The Part A statement makes it clear that the Credit Facilities
from external
financiers have been granted to Administration, and that
Administration will in turn provide funds to CWOI to finance the acquisition.
The letter setting out the terms of that funding is obviously a letter from
Administration.
<P>

176  	CWOI has applied for and obtained from ASIC a s 728 exemption
which will permit it to send Part A statements to AAPT shareholders
which
differ from the registered Part A statement by correcting the typographical
error.  There is therefore no substance to AAPT's
complaint.
<P>

177  	I conclude that none of AAPT's complaints about the disclosure
of funding in the Part A statement should be upheld, and consequently
that
there is, in those respects, no failure to disclose material information under
clause 17 and nothing misleading or deceptive
or likely to mislead or deceive
in the Part A statement.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

178  	All of AAPT's assaults on the Part A statement have failed.
The summons has therefore been dismissed with costs.
<P>
