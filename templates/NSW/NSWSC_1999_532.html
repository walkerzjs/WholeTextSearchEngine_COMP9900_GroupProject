<i>Thursday, 3 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2948/97	ROGER MICHAEL HOPE   -v-   NEIL LYON, ESTATE OF MYRTLE WINIFRED
ALICE FOWLER</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before the Court a Notice
of Motion filed by the applicant, Nigel Douglas Hope, on 19 May 1999.  By that
Notice
of Motion, which has been filed by the applicant in person, he seeks the
following orders: 
<P>

1.	That the applicant be joined as a party to the proceedings. 
<P>

2.	That the proceedings be dismissed under Part 13 rule 5 of the Supreme Court
Rules. 
<P>

3.	That the applicant and the presently named defendant, Neil Lyon, be awarded
their costs on the indemnity basis.
<P>

2   	It should here be recorded that the applicant (to whom I
shall refer as "Mr Nigel Hope") has appeared in person upon the hearing
of the
Notice of Motion.
<P>

3   	The defendant does not oppose --- indeed he consents to ---
the relief which is sought in the Notice of Motion.  The plaintiff,
Roger
Michael Hope, does not oppose the joinder of the applicant as a defendant.  He
does, however, oppose more than one set of costs
being awarded to what will be
the two defendants to the proceedings.  Further, the plaintiff opposes the
application for summary
dismissal of the proceedings.
<P>

4   	The proceedings were instituted by the plaintiff by summons
filed on 24 June 1997.  By that summons the plaintiff seeks, pursuant
to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act </i>1982</a>, an order that provision be
made for his maintenance, education or advancement in life out of the estate of
the late Myrtle Winifred
Alice Fowler (to whom I shall refer as the
"deceased"). 
<P>

5   	The plaintiff is a son of the deceased.  The applicant, Mr
Nigel Hope, is the only other child of the deceased.  The deceased
died on 30
September 1996.  She left a will dated 19 December 1975, probate whereof was on
4 December 1996 granted to the present
defendant, Neil Lyon, who is the
executor named in such will.
<P>

6   	By that will the deceased left her house property situate
at and known as 42 Arcadia Avenue, Gymea, to Mr Nigel Hope, together
with all
the household furniture, furnishings and effects and other articles of
household use or ornament.
<P>

7   	The deceased gave to the plaintiff a one half share in her
residuary estate.  However, the only assets which she left were
the house
property at 42 Arcadia Avenue, Gymea, and the contents of that house.  The
practical effect of the testamentary disposition
of the deceased is that Mr
Nigel Hope receives the entire estate of his late mother.
<P>

8   	As the sole beneficiary under the estate it seems to me
appropriate that, if he so desires, Mr Nigel Hope should be entitled
to be
joined as a defendant to the proceedings so that he will have the substantive
carriage of the proceedings in resisting the
claim of the plaintiff.  
<P>

9   	However, I consider, in accordance with the practice which
is almost always adopted in the case of a major beneficiary seeking
to be
joined as an additional defendant, that such joinder should be at Mr Nigel
Hope's own risk as to costs.  That is, there is
no guarantee that if he be
ultimately successful in the proceedings he would receive an order that his
costs be paid by some other
party. In the circumstances of the instant case,
that would mean that there would be no certainty that Mr Nigel Hope, if he be
ultimately
successful, would be entitled to receive a costs order against the
plaintiff.
<P>

10   	In cases brought under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>,
the executor almost always is entitled to have his costs paid, since the
executor is under a legal obligation to uphold the terms
of the will.  
<P>

11   	In due course, therefore, I propose to make an order that
Nigel Douglas Hope be joined as a defendant to the proceedings at
his own risk
as to costs.
<P>

12   	I turn now to the application by Mr Nigel Hope for summary
dismissal of the plaintiff's claim under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> rule 5 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  Mr Nigel Hope submits that the proceedings should be dismissed upon
each of the three grounds
sets forth in subrule (1) of that rule, being:
<P>

(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;  
<P>

(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; 
<P>

(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff, as a son of the deceased, is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  As such he has the standing
to bring the present proceedings.  It will be appreciated that Mr Nigel Hope is
also an eligible person
within the same paragraph of the definition.  Indeed,
he is the only other eligible person, apart from the plaintiff, in relation
to
their late mother.
<P>

14   	Essentially it is the submission on the part of Mr Nigel
Hope that the evidence filed on behalf of the plaintiff discloses
that the
plaintiff is in a far better financial and material position than is Mr Nigel
Hope, that the plaintiff has not demonstrated
need and that the plaintiff's
claim, if it goes to a final hearing, will be unsuccessful.
<P>

15   	Those submissions are addressed to the ground that no
reasonable cause of action is disclosed.  It does not seem to me that
those
submissions are appropriate in relation to a submission that the proceedings
are frivolous or vexatious, or in relation to
a submission that the proceedings
are an abuse of the process of the Court.  I do not see any basis upon which
the claim of the plaintiff
can be summarily dismissed on the ground that the
proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or that they are an abuse of the
process
of the Court.
<P>

16   	As to the submission that no reasonable cause of action is
disclosed, it is for Mr Nigel Hope to satisfy the Court that the
plaintiff
must, of necessity, fail at a final hearing of the proceedings.  It is not,
upon an application such as this, for the plaintiff
to establish that he will
inevitably win and be successful at a final hearing.  It is for Mr Nigel Hope
to establish that the plaintiff
cannot succeed at a final hearing.
<P>

17   	I do not express any views as to the likely outcome of
such a final hearing.  I restrict myself to saying that the evidence
is such
that it cannot be said that the plaintiff must inevitably lose.  The plaintiff
is, therefore, entitled to have the matter
proceed to a final hearing before
the appropriate tribunal, with an opportunity being given to all parties, not
merely to rely upon
affidavit evidence, but to cross-examine the deponents of
affidavits filed on behalf of other parties.
<P>

18   	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that Mr Nigel Hope has
established that the plaintiff has no reasonable cause of action. 
It follows,
therefore, that that part of Mr Nigel Hope's application must be dismissed.  I
will formulate my orders. 
<P>

19   	(The parties addressed on costs)
<P>

20   	I make the following records: 
<P>

1.	I order that Nigel Douglas Hope be joined as a defendant to the proceedings,
at his own risk as to costs. 
<P>

2.	I order that paragraph 2 in the Notice of Motion filed by Nigel Douglas Hope
on 19 May 1999, be dismissed.
<P>

3.	I order that the costs of the plaintiff and of the defendant, Neil Lyon, of
the aforesaid Notice of Motion be the costs of those
parties in the
proceedings, and that there be no order in respect to the costs of the
defendant, Nigel Douglas Hope, of the aforesaid
Notice of Motion, to the intent
that he will bear his own costs thereof.
