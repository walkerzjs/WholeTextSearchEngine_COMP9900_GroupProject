030023/98	<b>SHELLHARBOUR GOLF CLUB LIMITED   v   LYNNE ISABEL WHEELER &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : This is an appeal from the decision of the Equal Opportunity
Tribunal.  The Tribunal entertained a complaint of sexual
harassment against
the appellant Shellharbour Golf Club Limited and the former president of that
club.  By its decision delivered
on 13 May 1997 the Tribunal found the
complaint to have been established and that the club and its former president
were jointly
and severally liable.  Both were ordered to pay damages to the
complainant in the sum of $15,500 and legal costs in the sum of $4757.65.
<P>

2	The appeal is brought by the Shellharbour Golf Club Limited.  The Tribunal
and the former president, to whom I shall refer as
the "second respondent",
each filed submitting appearances before this Court.
<P>

3	Under s 118 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act, </i>1977</a> appeal lies to this
Court on a question of law only, and this Court cannot correct errors of fact:
see <i>Haines v Leves</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 442</a> and the judgment of Kirby P at
469-470.
<P>

	<b>The nature of the complaint before the Tribunal</b>
<P>

4	The complaint before the Tribunal was directed at sexual harassment.  The
complainant, the first respondent on this appeal, was
at the time of the events
complained of employed by the appellant as a clerk and in that capacity had
work association with the second
respondent as the president of the appellant
and one of the directors of the club.
<P>

5	The sexual harassment the subject of the complaint was by words and by
conduct.  The first respondent accused the second respondent
of the
following:
<P>

(i)	Saying to the first respondent at work after she had coloured her hair,
words to the following effect:  <i>"Every woman's hair should be the same
colour as her pussy."</i>
<P>

(ii)	Saying to the first respondent at work:  <i>"I like a woman with long legs
right up to her crutch."</i>
<P>

(iii)	Finally, at a staff Christmas party at the golf club attended not only by
staff but by directors of the club, the second respondent
danced with the first
respondent and in the course of doing so repeatedly rubbed his genitals against
her left leg.
<P>

6	The Tribunal found that the second respondent had said that which had been
alleged and further that he had done what it was alleged
he had done at the
staff Christmas party. The Tribunal in the reasons for its decision recorded
that it was widely accepted that
sexual harassment can constitute unlawful
discrimination on the ground of sex within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> of the statute
and it held that the second respondent's behaviour constituted unlawful
discrimination within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination
Act</a></i>.  That has not been challenged on this appeal.  There has not been, nor
could there be, any challenge to the findings which the Tribunal
made as to the
misconduct of the second respondent.  This appeal concerns the basis upon which
the appellant was found to be liable
for that misconduct by the second
respondent.
<P>

	<b>The decision of the Tribunal</b>
<P>

7	Central to the determination of the liability of the appellant were the
findings expressed at pp 27-28 of the reasons for the
decision of the
Tribunal:
<P>

	<i>"We accept the Complainant's evidence that she was at work when the Second
Respondent made the offensive comments to her about her
hair and her legs in
November 1993 and mid 1994 respectively.  Similarly, we are satisfied that the
Second Respondent was acting
in his capacity as the Club's President on both
occasions.  We also accept that the Complainant attended the staff and
directors'
Christmas party on 10 December 1994 in her capacity as an employee
of the Club.  Similarly, we are satisfied that, notwithstanding
the social
nature of the occasion, the Second Respondent attended in his capacity as the
President and a director of the Club, and
that the relevant acts were committed
while he was ostensibly performing his duties as the Club's President.
Accordingly, we find
that in respect of all three incidents the Second
Respondent was acting in his capacity as the Club's President and that he was,
therefore, the Club's agent."</i>
<P>

8	The Tribunal then went on to consider whether the appellant had established
<i>"that it did not authorise, either expressly or by implication, the second
respondent's conduct"</i>.  It will be necessary to examine the Tribunal's
approach to this question more closely later, but for the present it suffices
to
record that the Tribunal determined that the appellant failed to establish
that it did not authorise the second respondent's conduct.
<P>

	<b>The alleged errors of law</b>
<P>

9	The appellant has submitted that the Tribunal erred in law in four ways:
<P>

(i)	the Tribunal fell into error in determining that the findings of fact
earlier expressed were sufficient to attract liability
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a></i>;
<P>

(ii)	the Tribunal fell into error in the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> by determining
the section imposed an onus of proof upon the appellant;
<P>

(iii)	the Tribunal fell into error in the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> by determining
that the appellant had failed to prove it had not authorised the conduct of the
second respondent;
<P>

(iv)	the Tribunal fell into error having regard to the facts as found by it in
failing in consequence to find that the appellant
had discharged the onus
attributed to it under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1).</a>
<P>

10	I shall now consider each of these grounds in turn.
<P>

	<b>Ground 1</b>
<P>

11	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53</a> has been amended from time to time but it is common ground that
for present purposes the section provided:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	An act done by a person as the agent or employee of the person's
principal or employer which if done by the principal or employer
would be a
contravention of this Act is taken to have been done by the principal or
employer also unless the principal or employer
did not, either before or after
the doing of the act, authorise the agent or employee, either expressly or by
implication, to do
the act.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	If both the principal or employer and the agent or employee who did the
act are subject to any liability arising under this Act
in respect of the doing
of the act, they are jointly and severally subject to that liability."</i>
<P>

12	Mr Neil, on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the findings of the
Tribunal which I set out earlier were insufficient to
attach liability to the
appellant for what the second respondent did.  It was not enough to find that
the second respondent said
what he said and did what he did at the Christmas
function whilst he was ostensibly performing his duties as the president of the
club.  It was further necessary, Mr Neil submitted, for the Tribunal to be
satisfied that what he did he did <i>"as the agent"</i> for the club.  Mr Neil
referred to the very well known decision of the High Court in <i>Deatons Pty
Limited v Flew</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2079%20CLR%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 79 CLR 370.</a>  In that case, concerned with the
employment of a barmaid, the High Court held that the barmaid's employer was
not liable for the
harm its barmaid caused when, whilst serving a customer, she
threw first the contents of a glass and then the glass itself into the
face of
a customer.  The employer was not liable because what the barmaid did was
outside her employment.
<P>

13	In his judgment Latham CJ said at 378:
<P>

	<i>"The liability of the employer depends upon the scope of employment of the
barmaid and the authority which her employment conferred
upon her, such
authority to be exercised on behalf of the employer.  An employer is liable for
the act of his servant only if the
act is shown to come within the scope of the
servant's authority either as being an act which he was employed actually to
perform
or as being an act which was incidental to his employment."</i>
<P>

14	The Chief Justice went on to cite a familiar passage from <i>Canadian
Pacific Railway Co. v Lockhart</i>  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1941/1941scr0-278/1941scr0-278.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1942] AC 591</a> at 599:
<P>

	<i>"It is clear that the master is responsible for acts actually  authorized
by him: for liability would exist in this case, even if
the relation between
the parties was merely one of agency, and not one of service at all.  But a
master, as opposed to the employer
of an independent contractor, is liable even
for acts which he has not authorized, provided they are so connected with acts
that
he has authorized that they may be regarded as modes - although improper
modes - of doing them.  In other words, a master is responsible
not merely for
what he authorizes his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it.
On the other hand, if the unauthorized
and wrongful act of  the servant is not
so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an
independent act,
the master is not responsible:  for in such a case the servant
is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside
of
it."</i>
<P>

15	Dixon J, as he then was, categorised the barmaid's conduct in this passage
at 381-382:
<P>

	<i>"The truth is that it was an act of passion and resentment done neither in
furtherance of the master's interests nor under his express
or implied
authority nor as an incident to or in consequence of anything the barmaid was
employed to do.  It was a spontaneous act
of retributive justice.  The occasion
for administering it and the form it took may have arisen from the fact that
she was a barmaid
but retribution was not within the course of her employment
as a barmaid."</i>
<P>

16	Williams J said at 386-387:
<P>

	<i>"A barmaid who throws an empty glass at a customer is not doing an act of
the class which she is employed to do.  To throw the beer,
much less the glass,
at a customer is not a mode, although an improper mode, of serving a customer
with beer, and even less a glass
of beer...In the present case the only
reasonable inference from the evidence is that the glass was thrown for a
purpose of Mrs Barlow's
own and was an independent act on her part not so
connected with any act which she was authorized to do as to be a mode of doing
it, and not an act of excess and violence in the course of her employment not
justified by the occasion."</i>
<P>

17	Mr Neil submitted it was not enough for the Tribunal to find that the second
respondent was ostensibly performing his duties
for the club at the time he
misconducted himself any more than it availed the plaintiff, Flew, to prove
that the barmaid was the
employee of the defendant at the time she injured the
plaintiff.  It was argued that on a correct approach to the construction of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
53</a> it was necessary for the complainant to satisfy the Tribunal that the very
act complained of was done <i>"as the agent"</i>.  What was essential therefore
was for the Tribunal to be satisfied that in saying what he said to the first
respondent in the work
environment and later in doing what he did on the dance
floor, the second respondent was then acting <u>in such conduct</u> as the
appellant's agent.
<P>

18	Counsel were not able to refer to any decision of this court which bears
upon Mr Neil's submission as to the construction of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53.</a>
<P>

19	It is necessary when considering <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> to have regard to the statutory
framework and to the objectives of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a></i>.  One of
the objectives, dealt with in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a>, is sex discrimination, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> Div 2, in
which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> is to be found, focuses upon discrimination in the workplace.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/index.html#p2a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
2A</a>, when added to the Act, was specifically directed towards the prohibition of
sexual harassment, with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s22b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22B</a> dealing specifically with the sexual harassment
of employees.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s22b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22B(2)</a> now provides:  
<P>

	<i>"It is unlawful for an employee to sexually harass a fellow
employee."</i>
<P>

20	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s22b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22B(6)</a> now provides:
<P>

	<i>"It is unlawful for a workplace participant to sexually harass any
workplace participant at a place that is a workplace of both those
persons."</i>
<P>

21	<i>"Workplace"</i> is defined for the purposes of the section as meaning 
<P>

	<i>"a place at which a workplace participant works or otherwise attends in
connection with being a workplace participant."</i>
<P>

22	<i>"Workplace participant"</i> is defined as meaning:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	an employer or employee;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a commission agent or contract worker;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	a partner in a partnership;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	a person who is self employed;</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	a volunteer or unpaid trainee."</i>
<P>

23	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/index.html#p2a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2A</a> was not added to the Act until 1997 (by Act No. 9 of 1997), but
before its introduction it was, as I have observed, already settled
that
misconduct of the type found to have been committed by the second respondent
was unlawful under Pt 3 of the statute.
<P>

24	Part 9 deals inter alia with the functions of the Tribunal.  Once, as in
this case, the Tribunal has inquired into a complaint
it may dismiss the
complaint or upon finding the complaint substantiated do one of a number of
things, under s 113:
<P>

(i)	order the respondent to pay damages;
<P>

(ii)	make an order enjoining the respondent from continuing or repeating any
unlawful conduct;
<P>

(iii)	order the respondent to perform any reasonable act to redress the harm
suffered by the complainant.
<P>

25	It is significant that before the amendments in 1997 it was not possible to
lay a complaint against a fellow employee.  That
person could only be joined
and hence the subject of the Tribunal's decision through the operation of s
53.
<P>

26	Even had it been in force at the relevant time, Pt 2A would not have been
broad enough to attach liability directly to the second
respondent because he
was not "<i>an employee</i>" for the purposes of s 22B(2), nor was he by
definition a "<i>workplace participant</i>" for the purposes of s 22B(6).
Nevertheless the significance of the amending statute in the provisions I have
reviewed was the further
emphasis it places upon the objectives of the
statute.
<P>

27	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a></i> must be construed so as to give
preference to a construction that gives effect to its statutory purposes.
Section 33 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</a></i>, 1987 so requires.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53</a> must
be construed accordingly.  It is apt to cite the dicta of Mason CJ and Gaudron
J in their joint judgment in <i>Waters v The Public Transport Commission</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d92%29%20173%20CLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-92) 173 CLR 349</a> at 359:
<P>

	<i>"However, the principle that requires that the particular provisions of the
Act must be read in the light of the statutory objectives
is of particular
significance in the case of legislation which protects or enforces human
rights.  In construing such legislation
the courts have a special
responsibility to take account of and give effect to the statutory
purpose."</i>
<P>

28	See also <i>Australian Iron &amp; Steel Pty Ltd v Banovic</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%20165" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR
165</a> and in particular the judgment of McHugh J at 195-197.
<P>

29	The principle stated in <i>Waters</i> and set out above applies here.
<P>

30	I have concluded that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> should not be construed in the manner for which
Mr Neil contends.  To do so would defeat one of the statutory objectives, even
as
the Act stood prior to the 1997 amendments.  A body corporate can only act
through its servants or agents. An employer would not
ordinarily employ an
employee to engage in misconduct such as that committed by the second
respondent in this case.  Nor would a
principal ordinarily engage his agent to
do so.  Hence the construction for which Mr Neil contends, viewing the Act as
it stood at
the relevant time, would preclude redress to an employee who has
been sexually abused by another employee, or by the agent of a principal,
even
though the misconduct occurred in the workplace environment.
<P>

31	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53(1)</a> must be read as a whole.  The key to the sub-section is to my
mind to be found in what should properly be considered as the exception:
<P>

	<i>"Unless the principal or employee did not, either before or after the doing
of the Act, authorise the agent or employee, either expressly
or by
implication, to do the Act."</i>
<P>

32	If Mr Neil's submission was correct that exception would have no work to do,
applying the general principles relating to the
law governing principal and
agent.
<P>

33	However, as I construe <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1)</a> once it was established that the misconduct
occurred in the workplace environment and the offender was ostensibly at the
time acting
in the discharge of responsibilities as agent for his principal,
what he did was deemed to be done by his principal, <u>unless</u> the conduct
was unauthorised by the principal either expressly or by implication.
<P>

34	I therefore do not consider that the Tribunal was wrong in its approach to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
53</a> when it concluded that the second respondent <i>"was acting in his capacity
as the club's president and that he was, therefore, the club's agent."</i>
<P>

35	The first ground of appeal fails.
<P>

	<b>Ground 2</b>
<P>

36	Mr Neil submitted that the proper approach to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1)</a> was that it rendered
the principal's authority a condition of its liability and that the sub-section
imposed no onus upon the principal.
<P>

37	Mr Neil referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Langley v
University of New South Wales</i> (1984) EOC 902-018.  This was a case in which
P complained of discrimination against her by O, the university being the
employer
of both P and O.  There was no evidence that the university authorised
O to do that which was the subject of the complaint.  Hope
JA, with whose
judgment Hutley JA and Glass JA agreed, said at 75-466:
<P>

	<i>"I may say that the respondent is the University, the employer both of Mr
O'Neill and of Ms Langley, and as such may be liable for
any discriminatory
acts in breach of the Act by Mr O'Neill in respect of Ms Langley, but only if
the University either before or
after the doing of the relevant acts authorised
Mr O'Neill, either expressly or by implication, to do those acts:  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec. 53.</a>
I will deal with the matter disregarding the provisions of that section, but I
may say there is no evidence which, in my opinion,
establishes that the
University at any time, expressly or by implication, authorised Mr O'Neill to
use the appellation `Mrs' to Ms
Langley."</i>
<P>

38	The above passage suggests that his Honour approached this case upon the
basis that there was no onus on the employer under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53.</a>  However the remarks
were obiter, as their context discloses, and the case was decided on the basis
that there was no evidence of
discrimination within the meaning of the statute.
Neither Hutley JA nor Glass JA addressed the onus issue under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1).</a>
<P>

39	In <i>Samuels Real Estate v Lamb &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20EOC%2092%2d923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) EOC 92-923</a>, James J
had occasion to consider the issue of onus under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1).</a>  His Honour said at
78,148:
<P>

	<i>"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53</a> expressly provides that a principal or employer can authorise
an act by an agent or employee, either before or after the doing of
the act.
Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> the onus on the issue of authorisation is cast on the principal or
employer; it is for the principal or employer to establish that
it did not
authorise the act of the agent or employee."</i>
<P>

40	I agree with his Honour's conclusion on the issue of onus.  It seems to me
that such a construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1)</a> is in harmony with the scheme of the
statute and that indeed s 109 directly addresses the onus issue with which this
ground is concerned:
<P>

	<i>"Where by any provision of this Act or the regulations, conduct is excepted
from conduct that is unlawful under this Act or the regulations
or that is a
contravention of this Act or the regulations, the onus of proving the exception
in any inquiry lies upon the respondent."</i>
<P>

41	The conduct of the appellant which the Tribunal had to consider was unlawful
under the Act unless the appellant did not authorise
the second respondent to
say and to do what was the subject of the complaint.  This analysis leads me to
the conclusion that s 109
imposed an onus upon the appellant to prove the
absence of authority contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(1).</a>
<P>

42	I therefore conclude that ground 2 fails.
<P>

	<b>Ground 3</b>
<P>

43	Mr Neil submitted that the Tribunal's stated reasons indicate that it
misdirected itself as to what was involved in establishing
that the appellant
did not authorise the second respondent to say and do what he did.
<P>

44	It is necessary to examine the reasons of the Tribunal closely for the
purposes of considering this ground, and this includes
consideration of the
evidence of the club's secretary/manager as reviewed by the Tribunal.
<P>

45	The secretary/manager gave evidence of posting a notice on the staff notice
board on the subject of sexual harassment.  In respect
of the publication of
this notice, the Tribunal said at pp 28-29:
<P>

	<i>"The Third Respondent said that she had received a circular dealing with
sexual harassment in the workplace from the Registered Clubs
Association
sometime prior to the events in question.  Although a copy was not given to
either the staff or the directors, she attached
the circular to the Staff
Notice Board in the office where she and the Complainant worked.  The wording
of the circular is as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>`STAFF PLEASE NOTE</cite>
<P>

<i>	1.	</i><cite>Sexual harassment</cite><i> is not tolerated in this Club.
</i><cite>Unlawful</cite><i> under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a>.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	The Company will promptly and confidentially treat these complaints
seriously and sympathetically.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	The Correct procedure to be taken as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	The complaint to be brought to the attention of the Secretary Manager.
Under the guidelines as above the complaint will be dealt
with
impartially.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Complainants and Witnesses will not be victimised in any way.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	Action will be taken to ensure that misconduct does not
continue.'</i>
<P>

<i>	The Third Respondent said that although the circular was not given to the
directors or discussed by them at a Board Meeting, they
were aware of it
because it was pinned up on the Staff Notice Board in her office.  The
Complainant said that she saw it on the Notice
Board but had probably never
read through it.  In direct contrast to the Third Respondent's evidence, the
Second Respondent said
the circular had `gone through the Board'.  However,
there were no Board Minutes tendered to support this assertion.  On balance,
we
prefer the evidence given by the Third Respondent on this issue.  Accordingly,
we are not satisfied that the circular was ever
formally bought [sic] to the
attention of the directors or discussed by them as a Board."</i>
<P>

46	The Tribunal went on to observe that the secretary/manager gave no evidence
that there was any special procedure prescribed for
lodging a sexual harassment
complaint.  Then the Tribunal went on to state at pp 29-30:
<P>

	<i>"We are not satisfied that there was any training on sexual harassment
available to the staff or any guidance given to them about
how to handle
conduct, engaged in by either management or the directors, which might be
classified as sexual harassment.  Significantly
too, there does not appear to
have been any real attempt made to communicate to the directors the existence
of the sexual harassment
circular and the importance of not engaging in conduct
which might contravene the relevant provisions of the Act.  This was all the
more critical in circumstances where the Third Respondent had been told by the
Complainant that the President had uttered rude comments
of a sex-based nature
to her on two occasions and where the Third Respondent herself had been
subjected to demeaning and rude behaviour
by the Club's President on numerous
occasions."</i>
<P>

47	The Tribunal found that after the complainant lodged her complaint with the
appellant's board of directors on 13 December 1994
in relation to the events of
10 December 1994, the second responded was cited to appear before a meeting of
directors on 20 December
1994.  Having heard both the complainant and the
second respondent and other witnesses, the board determined that the second
respondent
was guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the club and it
suspended him from membership for twelve months.  The Tribunal said
at pp
32-33:
<P>

	<i>"We accept that the club acted quickly and efficiently to resolve the
complaint of sexual harassment arising out of the incident which
occurred at
the Christmas party."</i>
<P>

48	The Tribunal then went on immediately to state:
<P>

	<i>"Nonetheless, taking into account the circumstances which existed prior to
the Christmas party, we are not satisfied that the First
Respondent has
established that it did not authorise the Second Respondent's conduct.
Accordingly, we are satisfied that pursuant
to both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.25(2)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">25</a>(2)(c),
the First Respondent is liable for the Second Respondent's discriminatory
conduct."</i>
<P>

49	It is the finding in the above passage which Mr Neil has submitted involved
an error of law.
<P>

50	It was submitted that the finding of the prompt reaction to the complaint,
after the second respondent's conduct was drawn to
the notice of the directors,
was a clear demonstration of the appellant's disapproval of the second
respondent's behaviour ten days
after the club function.  It was argued that
other evidence considered by the Tribunal, so far as it referred to
inadequacies in
instruction and guidance of staff, was not directly in point
when considering whether the appellant authorised the second respondent's
misconduct.
<P>

51	In considering this ground however it is important to bear in mind that the
onus was upon the respondent to prove a negative
and as the present case
illustrates this was not an easy task.  The appellant was required to satisfy
the Tribunal by evidence that
it had not authorised the second respondent to do
and say what he did, either expressly or by implication.
<P>

52	Mr Neil referred to the decision in <i>Samuels Real Estate v Lamb</i>
(supra) to support the submission that the Tribunal fell into error in the
manner contended for in this third ground.  In <i>Samuels Real Estate</i> the
Tribunal addressed the onus upon the employer under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> and said that it was
not enough for the employer to prove 
<P>

	<i>"that it issued general, vague and inconsistent verbal instructions to
employees on the commencement of their employment and that
an employer must
show that it had an effective policy in place which was capable of being
effectively applied."</i>
<P>

53	James J found that in stating that requirement the Tribunal was in error.
He upheld a submission (at 78,148)
<P>

	<i>"that the question which arises under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53...is</a> whether an employer or
principal has expressly or impliedly authorised the doing of the act by its
agent or employee which contravenes
the act, not whether the employer or
principal has put in place an effective Anti-Discrimination policy."</i>
<P>

54	Mr Neil submitted that the findings I have recorded in paragraphs 45-48
above indicate that the Tribunal made a similar error
to that detected by James
J in <i>Samuels Real Estate</i>.
<P>

55	Mr Neil referred to the decision in <i>Ex parte Johnson; re MacMillan</i> 47
SR 16 for authority for the meaning of the word "authorise".  In that case,
which was a decision considering the word "authorising"
in a regulation made
under the <i>National Security (War Service Moratorium) Regulations</i> Jordan
CJ said at 18:
<P>

	<i>"The word `authorise', according to its natural meaning, signifies the
conferring upon a person of a right to do something which,
apart from the
authorisation, he does not possess."</i>
<P>

56	The above definition cannot be taken as a rigid definition of the word
"authorise" for all purposes. The meaning may differ depending
upon the
statutory provision in which it is found.  Thus in <i>University of New South
Wales v Moorhouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%2d75%29%20133%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974-75) 133 CLR 1</a> the High Court had occasion to
consider the word "authorise" in the setting of s 36 of the <i>Copyright
Act</i>, 1968.  In this context Gibbs J said at 12-13:
<P>

	<i>"The word `authorize', in legislation of similar intendment to s 36 of the
Act, has been held judicially to have its dictionary meaning
of `sanction,
approve, countenance':  Falcon v Famous Players Film Co.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1926%5d%202%20KB%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1926] 2 KB 474</a> at
491' Adelaide Corporation v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2040%20CLR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 40 CLR 481</a> at 489, 497..  It can also mean `permit', and in Adelaide
Corporation v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2040%20CLR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 40 CLR 481</a>
`authorize' and `permit' appear to have been treated as synonymous.  A person
cannot be said to authorize an infringement of copyright
unless he has some
power to prevent it:  Adelaide Corporation v Australasian Performing Right
Association Ltd (1928) 40 CLR at 497-498,
503.  Express or formal permission or
sanction, or active conduct indicating approval, is not essential to constitute
an authorization;
`Inactivity or "indifference, exhibited by acts of commission
or omission, may reach a degree from which an authorization or permission
may
be inferred"':  Adelaide Corporation v Australasian Performing Right
Association Ltd (1928) 40 CLR at 504.  However, the word
`authorize' connotes a
mental element and it could not be inferred that a person had, by mere
inactivity, authorized something to
be done if he neither knew nor had reason
to suspect that the act might be done.  Knox CJ and Isaacs J referred to this
mental element
in their dissenting judgments in Adelaide Corporation v
Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd.  Knox CJ (1928) 40 CLR at
487
held that indifference or omission is `permission' where the party charged
(amongst other things) `knows or has reason to anticipate
or suspect that the
particular act is to be or is likely to be done'.  Isaacs J apparently
considered that it is enough if the person
sought to be made liable `knows or
has reason to know or believe' that the particular act of infringement `will or
may' be done."</i>
<P>

57	Jacobs J, with whose judgment McTiernan A-CJ agreed, gave to the word
authorise, at p 20-21, an equally broad interpretation.
 
<P>

58	The decision in <i>University of New South Wales v Moorhouse</i> has been
much followed in copyright cases and the broad concept of "authorise" reflected
in the above passage has been frequently
applied for the purposes of statutory
construction under the copyright legislation.  For present purposes, bearing in
mind the nature
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a>, </i>I consider that the word
"authorise" should be given an equally broad meaning to that given to the word
in the copyright cases.  Accordingly,
it seems to me that for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
53</a> the word "authorise" embraces "sanction, approve, countenance and permit".
Permission may be inferred from inactivity and indifference
where the person
sought to be made liable is aware that some particular behaviour may occur.
<P>

59	With this concept of the word "authorise" in mind, I return to the judgment
of the Tribunal and in particular to its review of
the evidence of the
secretary/manager of the appellant at pp 30-31.
<P>

60	The Tribunal found that the first respondent had complained to the
secretary/manager of the appellant of <i>"rudeness of a sex based nature on two
occasions"</i>, and that the secretary/manager had <i>"herself been subjected
to demeaning and rude behaviour by the second respondent on numerous
occasions"</i>.  In the Tribunal's judgment, because these events occurred
prior to the Christmas party, the secretary/manager should have arranged
for
the circular concerning sexual harassment to be formally discussed by the Board
of Directors <i>"so as to ensure that they were aware of the consequences of
engaging in conduct that might be classified as sexual harassment."</i>
<P>

61	Further, the Tribunal specifically rejected the secretary/manager's
assertion that she knew of no inappropriate sexual behaviour
of the second
respondent before the Christmas party.  It reviewed the content of the
secretary/manager's affidavit, addressing the
complaint that the first
respondent made to her about the second respondent after the incident at the
Christmas party:
<P>

	<i>"`She [i.e. the Complainant] said:</i>
<P>

<i>	"Jim Gough rubbed himself up against me while we were dancing and kept
pulling me towards him.  He was embarrassing me.  I asked
him to stop and he
laughed at me and said, `I'm just a dirty old man'.  He is so rude."</i>
<P>

<i>	I said:</i>
<P>

<i>	"I should have warned you about Jim Gough's behaviour."'"</i>
<P>

62	The Tribunal went on to express the following relevant conclusion:
<P>

	<i>"Clearly, in the context in which the Complainant was talking, namely
recounting what had happened on the dance floor and stating
that the Second
Respondent had said, `I'm just a dirty old man', the comment, `He is so rude',
can only have been referable to the
Second Respondent's sexual behaviour.  For
the Third Respondent to reply that she should have warned the Complainant about
the Second
Respondent's `behaviour', as distinct from his `rudeness', strongly
suggests that she had some prior knowledge that he had engaged
in inappropriate
sexual behaviour on prior occasions or, at the very least, that he was renowned
for doing so."</i>
<P>

63	The Tribunal therefore made findings as to prior relevant knowledge of the
secretary/manager concerning the second respondent.
 It also addressed the
absence of evidence of any effective measure taken by the appellant,
notwithstanding that knowledge, at least
in its secretary/manager, to guard
against sexually inappropriate behaviour by the second respondent.
<P>

64	The amendments introduced to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a></i> by Act No. 9
of 1997 added to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> two additional sub-sections:
<P>

	<i>"(3)	Despite subsection (1), a principal or an employer is not liable under
that subsection if the principal or employer took all
reasonable steps to
prevent the agent or employee from contravening the Act.</i>
<P>

<i>	(4)	For the purposes of subsection (1), the principal or employer of a
volunteer or unpaid trainee who contravenes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/index.html#p2a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2A</a> is the person or body on
whose behalf the volunteer or unpaid trainee provides services."</i>
<P>

65	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 53(3)</a> as it now stands introduces an analogous concept to that found
in s 106(2) of the <i>Commonwealth Sex-Discrimination Act</i>, 1984.  It may be
that there is scope for tension between s 53(1) and s 53(3) as the Act now
stands, but this is not the occasion
to explore that issue.
<P>

66	The Tribunal determined from the terms of the exchange between the
complainant and the third respondent reviewed above (at paragraph
61) that such
was strongly suggestive that the secretary/manager had some prior knowledge
that the second respondent <i>"had engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour on
prior occasions or, at the very least, that he was renown for doing so."</i>
In these circumstances, even though the complainant may not have told the
secretary/manager the detail of the offensive remarks that
the second
respondent had made, the Tribunal regarded it as incumbent upon the
secretary/manager to ensure that the circular as to
sexual harassment was
discussed by the board of directors <i>"so as to ensure that they were aware of
the consequences of engaging in conduct which might be classified as sexual
harassment."</i>
<P>

67	In considering whether the appellant had discharged its onus under s 53, the
Tribunal's task was not to determine whether the
appellant had taken reasonable
steps to prevent the second respondent from misconducting himself; rather the
Tribunal's task was
to determine whether the appellant had proved that what the
second respondent had done was not authorised either expressly or by
implication.  Failure to address the appropriate issue under s 53 would plainly
have constituted error of law of the very type identified
by James J in
<i>Samuels Real Estate</i>.
<P>

68	However, it seems to me to be clear from the terms of the reasons for its
decision that the Tribunal did not misdirect itself
as to its task under s 53.
The Tribunal referred to cases upon which the complainant had relied before it
to demonstrate the vicarious
liability of a principal for sexual harassment
committed by its agent.  Those cases however were cases which the Tribunal
identified
as being under different legislation.  Specific reference was made
to s 106 of the <i>Commonwealth Sex-Discrimination Act</i> which imposes
liability on an employer for the acts of an agent done in connection with its
duties as an agent.  However, under s
106(2) that liability does not arise
<i>"if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent
the employee or agent from doing acts of the kind referred
to in that
paragraph."</i>  The Tribunal correctly recognised the distinction between s
106 of the Commonwealth statute and s 53(1) of the relevant Act when
it
observed at p 32 concerning the cases to which it had been referred under the
Commonwealth statute:
<P>

	<i>"However in our view these cases are of limited assistance because s 53(1)
of the New South Wales Act provides the club with a defence
if it can establish
it did not authorise the second respondent to engage in the conduct in
question.  It, therefore, appears to be
a less difficult defence to establish
than s 106(2) of the Commonwealth Act.  While we acknowledge the distinction,
we nonetheless
accept Ms Winters' submission that s 53 of the Act should be
interpreted broadly so as not to defeat the objects of the legislation."</i>
<P>

69	In my opinion there is no error of law in the above passage.
<P>

70	There was certainly no evidence before the Tribunal to warrant a positive
finding that the appellant authorised the second respondent
to engage in
misconduct by word or by deed.  However, no such finding was required before
the Tribunal could find the complaint of
unlawful sexual discrimination
substantiated.  Rather, it was for the appellant to prove that it had not
authorised the second respondent
to say and to do what he did.  In practical
terms the task which the appellant had in discharging its onus was not an easy
one, particularly
having regard to what the Tribunal considered that the
secretary/manager knew about the second respondent.  Clearly on the view that
the Tribunal took of the evidence of the secretary/manager her evidence did not
satisfy the Tribunal that the misconduct was not
authorised.  The Tribunal
specifically rejected the evidence of the second respondent that the sexual
harassment circular had been
considered by the Board of Directors (reasons for
decision p 29).
<P>

71	I am not persuaded that the decision which the Tribunal reached that it was
not satisfied that the appellant had established
that it did not "authorise"
the second respondent's conduct amounted to an error of law.  It was for the
Tribunal to assess the facts
and in making that assessment it found that the
appellant had not discharged the onus of proof imposed on it.  It seems to me
that
that was a decision which the Tribunal was entitled to reach, and no error
of law has been proved.
<P>

	<b>Ground 4</b>
<P>

72	Mr Neil submitted finally that since the appellant's board decided that the
second respondent was guilty of conduct unbecoming
a member of the club and
suspended him from membership for twelve months this should have satisfied the
Tribunal that the appellant
had discharged its onus under s 53.  That the
appellant had acted <i>"quickly and efficiently to resolve the complainant's
complaint"</i> in relation to the Christmas party behaviour was a specific
finding of the Tribunal.  It was submitted that the appellant's quick
and
efficient action should have been regarded as proof, <u>after</u> the conduct
of the second respondent, that the appellant did not authorise such
misconduct.
<P>

73	This submission assumes that it would necessarily suffice for the purposes
of s 53, in the discharge of the principal's onus,
for the principal to prove
it did not authorise the misconduct <u>after</u> the event.  It assumes further
that given such proof, it was not necessary for the principal to prove also
that it did not authorise
the misconduct <u>before</u> the event.  I do not
consider that s 53(1) should be so construed.
<P>

74	In my opinion the sub-section imposes the requirement upon the principal to
prove that  it did not authorise the agent at any
time.  It does not
necessarily suffice for the principal to prove, after the event, conduct on its
part inconsistent with the conferring
of authority on the agent to do what he
had done.  For example, in a case where a principal permitted sexual harassment
of a type
the subject of a subsequent complaint to be committed by its agent,
it could not escape liability under s 53(1) by the device of
a decision made
only after the event that such conduct was not authorised. 
<P>

75	Plainly what the appellant did in this case after the event was to be
weighed by the Tribunal in deciding whether the onus imposed
on the principal
had been discharged; but for the purposes of s 53(1), the principal must
shoulder the added requirement to prove
that, before the misconduct of the
agent complained of, it did not give authority either expressly or by
implication.
<P>

76	In my opinion ground 4 fails.
<P>

77	In the result no ground for relief has been established and accordingly the
summons is dismissed.  I order the appellant to pay
the first respondent's
costs.
