<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 13 July, last Tuesday, application
was made to me ex parte for injunctions to restrain the defendants engaging in
various forms
of tortious and criminal conduct, including public nuisance,
intimidation, assault and malicious damage to property.  I granted those
injunctions because I was satisfied on the evidence then presented that the
defendants were acting in combination in the sense that
they were all
associating together outside the plaintiffs' various premises in furtherance of
an industrial dispute, and some of
them were engaging in particular acts of the
kind referred to by way of physically blocking access to and from some of the
premises,
throwing missiles, interfering with the free passage of vehicles on
public roads, (for example, by removing keys from the ignition
of vehicles),
cutting and spiking motor vehicle tyres, deliberately scratching motor
vehicles, verbal abuse, and so on.  These activities
were in conjunction with a
picket formed outside the plaintiffs' premises by certain of its employees,
members of the first defendant,
who are presently and have for some time been
on strike in support of a claim for increased wages and conditions.  The
targets of
their activities were other employees who were continuing to work,
or seeking to do so, and suppliers and carriers of goods to and
from the
plaintiffs' premises.
<P>

2   	A large number of affidavits were before me and these were
supplemented by video tape evidence taken at the scenes.  Mr Robinson,
who
appeared for the plaintiffs, also tendered Ex A which consisted of three
notices of intended industrial action dated 2 June 1999
relating to the
plaintiffs' different premises, and he drew my attention to the provisions of s
166A of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/" class="autolink_findacts">Workplace Relations Act</a> (Cth) 1996</i></b> (the Act) and to
the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in <b><i>Patrick Stevedores Operations Pty Ltd v
Maritime Union of Australia &amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2082%20IR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 82 IR 237.</a>  Having granted
the ex parte injunctions, I granted leave to the plaintiffs to serve short
notice of the summons which I made returnable
for 2 pm the following day, 14
July 1999.  I should add that the proceedings before me on Tuesday 13 July
commenced at 11.03 am and
concluded at 12.50 pm.  
<P>

3   	On the return of the summons at 2 pm on Wednesday 14 July
1999, Mr Crawshaw SC and Mr Winters appeared for the first, second
and third
defendants, and there was no appearance for or on behalf of the other
defendants.  Further affidavits were filed and read
on  behalf of the
plaintiffs showing in more detail the conduct complained of and two damaged
tyres and a number of tyre spikes were
also tendered, (Exs F and G).  In
addition, the plaintiffs tendered letters from the first defendant to the first
plaintiff dated
15 April 1999 and 12 May 1999, being Notices pursuant to s
170MI of the Act of an intention to try and reach a Certified Agreement
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/index.html#p6b" class="autolink_findacts">Pt VIB</a> of the Act.
<P>

4   	No evidence was led to contradict any of the evidence led
by the plaintiffs, but on behalf of the defendants Mr Crawshaw tendered
Ex 1,
which was a copy of an Application to the Australian Industrial Relations
Commission (the Commission) for an Order to Stop
or Prevent Industrial Action
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> of the Act, which the date stamp from the Australian Industrial
Registry New South Wales indicated was apparently filed at about
11.30 am.  
<P>

5   	Mr Crawshaw then made three main submissions as to why I
should dissolve or not continue the existing injunctions.  Firstly,
he
submitted that the first defendant was wrongly named, the correct defendant
being the federal body and not the New South Wales
Branch.  This matter has now
been rectified by a consent amendment of the summons which was made yesterday,
and is no longer an issue.
<P>

6   	His second submission was that there was no evidence of
sufficient weight to link the first, second and third defendants with
the
specific acts which were the subject of evidence, or with the unlawful acts,
and I should not grant injunctions against persons
who were not the subject of
evidence of particular acts.  I dealt with this matter in some short detail in
my judgment on that afternoon
and I see no reason to change what I said then.

<P>

7   	The third submission of Mr Crawshaw was that the injunction
should be dissolved because full disclosure had not been made on
the ex parte
application in that I had not been informed of the Application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127.</a>
The plaintiffs' representatives sought time to deal with that submission and I
accordingly continued the injunction until 5 pm yesterday,
15 July 1999, and
stood the matter over until 2 pm.  
<P>

8   	When the matter came before me yesterday, Mr Warburton
appeared for the first, second and third defendants.  Once again there
was no
appearance for any of the other defendants, although affidavits of service were
filed in court which, without reading them
all in detail, I am informed
establish that thirty-five of the other defendants have been personally served
with the summons.  There
were some further affidavits read and no evidence of
any change of conditions at the site.  In addition to adopting the submissions
of Mr Crawshaw on the previous day, Mr Warburton made two main submissions.
<P>

9   	Firstly, he again submitted the injunction should be
dissolved or not continued because of non-disclosure on the ex parte
application,
and secondly, that the injunction should be refused on
discretionary grounds because of the well-established reluctance of the Common
Law and Equity courts to become involved in industrial disputes, and their
preference for leaving the resolution of such disputes
to the specialised
industrial tribunals.
<P>

10   	The application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> sought orders that the
relevant employees cease and refrain from industrial action in the form of any
strike, restriction or ban
or other limitation and make themselves available
for work as required by the company in accordance with the relevant award.
There
were supplementary orders sought to give effect to the main orders.
<P>

11   	The grounds of the application were set out and referred
to the employees of the plaintiffs, the majority of whom are members
of the
first defendant, commencing strike action on 8 July 1999 and also commencing a
picket line while the strike action was continuing.
 Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 were
as follows:
<P>

"6.	Representatives of the AFMEPKIU and certain  employees present on the
picket lines have refused, and continue to refuse, access
to or egress from the
Smithfield operation.  Without the direct assistance of the New South Wales
Police access to the Smithfield
operation, and egress from that operation is
almost impossible.
<P>

7.	Representatives of the AFMEPKIU and / or certain Employees present on the
picket lines have caused damaged (sic) to the motor
vehicles attempting to
enter and leave the Smithfield operation.
<P>

8.	Representatives of the AFMEPKIU and / or certain Employees have made threats
to the life and personal safety or health of employees
of the Company who have
continued to perform work at the Smithfield operation.  Such threats have also
been made to contractors,
and employees of contractors to the Company who have
sought access to the Smithfield operation in the course of duties."
<P>

12   	In an attempted explanation for the failure to disclose
this application when seeking the ex parte injunction, there was an
affidavit
from Helen McKenzie, solicitor for the plaintiffs, in which she said, inter
alia, that the sole purpose in seeking the
injunction was to remove the illegal
pickets and end other unlawful conduct relating thereto with the object of
securing unimpeded
access to the plaintiff's premises, and that the purpose of
the application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> was to secure a resumption of work by the striking
employees.  She went on:
<P>

"The definition of industrial action in the Act <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 4)</a> does not in my
view, include participation in a picket and accordingly, the Commission does
not have jurisdiction to make orders
in respect of the conduct of pickets
(whether legal or illegal)."
<P>

13   	It was also her view that proceedings in this Court were
quite separate and unrelated to the decision by the plaintiffs to
attempt to
achieve cessation of the strike and resumption of normal work by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a>
application.  She said it was not her intention to mislead the Court or
withhold relevant information, that it was only after the
commencement of the
proceedings before me that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> application was finalised and filed with
the Commission, and accordingly that counsel appearing for the plaintiffs had
not been instructed
that such application had been filed.
<P>

14   	Mr Robinson, who appeared for the plaintiffs, said, and I
accept, he did not know of the application to the Commission.  He
also said if
he had known, he would have disclosed it.
<P>

15   	I shall consider later in this judgment whether the orders
sought or the powers of the Commission under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> extend to the type of
conduct complained of in these proceedings, but I have already drawn attention
to the fact that reference to
the conduct complained of in these proceedings
was included in the paragraphs I have quoted from the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> application.
<P>

16   	The principle as to the duty of disclosure when seeking ex
parte relief was authoritatively stated by Isaacs J in <b><i>Thomas A Edison
Limited v Bullock</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1912] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%2015%20CLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 15 CLR 679</a> at 681-2.  After pointing out that
as a general rule no order should be made to the prejudice of a party unless he
has had the opportunity
of being heard, his Honour said that in cases of
urgency where the court is asked to disregard the usual requirement of hearing
the
other side, the party moving incurs a most serious responsibility, and
stated the principle as being:
<P>

"...it is the duty of a party asking for an injunction ex parte to bring under
the notice of the court all facts material to the
determination of his right to
that injunction and it is no excuse for him to say he was not aware of their
importance.  <i>Uberrima fides</i> is required, and the party inducing the
court to act in the absence of the other party, fails in his obligation unless
he supplies
the place of the absent party to the extent of bringing forward all
the material facts which that party would presumably have brought
forward in
his defence to that application."
<P>

17   	The test is not whether the additional material would
ultimately have been determinative of the judge's decision whether or
not to
grant the ex parte injunction, but whether the omitted material is such that
the other party would have brought it forward
in opposition to the grant of the
injunction if he had been present. 
<P>

18   	The test of what material must be disclosed was similarly
expressed in <b><i>Town and Country Sport Resorts (Holdings) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors
v Partnership Pacific Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2020%20FCR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 20 FCR 540</a> at 543.  See also
<b><i>Ritchie: Supreme Court Procedure NSW </i></b>para [28.1.1]; <b><i>Bentley
v Nelson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20WAR%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] WAR 89</a>; <b><i>Gilfillan v Gilfillan</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%206%20SASR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 6
SASR 330.</a>
<P>

19   	Mr Robinson submitted that it was not necessary to
disclose matter which was not material to the grant or refusal of relief
and
that approach is reflected in Miss McKenzie's affidavit.  But that cannot be
the proper test as it throws the judgment of what
is material or what might be
material onto the applicant's lawyers instead of on the Court.  The test of
what must be disclosed is
as I have indicated, such material as the opponent
would have disclosed or brought forward, if present.  It was not for Miss
McKenzie,
or any other representative of the plaintiffs, to decide whether or
not the matter was such as would be determinative of the decision
to grant
relief.
<P>

20   	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the ex parte injunction
should not have been obtained at the time it was on account of the
failure to
make relevant disclosure.  But that does not permanently or otherwise
disqualify the plaintiffs from obtaining relief.
 In <b><i>Thomas A Edison Ltd
v Bullock</i></b>, although his Honour was satisfied that the injunction should
not have been granted ex parte, he went on to say at p 683:
<P>

"This would not prevent the plaintiffs from applying de novo for an injunction
upon the merits as they now appear."
<P>

21   	His Honour apparently dealt immediately, and without any
further initiating process, with the substantive merits of the case,
although
the plaintiffs were ultimately unsuccessful.
<P>

22   	Likewise in <b><i>Town and Country Sport Resorts
(Holdings) Pty Ltd v Partnership Pacific Limited</i></b>, the Full Federal
Court indicated that it would be appropriate to make a fresh application,
although the note at p 546 indicates
that such fresh application was not
successful.
<P>

23   	A similar situation arose in <b><i>Barneys Blu-Crete Pty
Ltd v Australian Workers Union</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2043%20FLR%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 43 FLR 457</a> where Northrop J said
at 475:
<P>

"In my opinion, those facts were not and are not relevant to the question of
whether the interim injunction should have been granted
or not, but in any
event, the principle relied upon applies to cases where an application is made
to dissolve an interim injunction.
 The suppression of the relevant facts does
not prevent a fresh application for an injunction being heard and determined in
the light
of all the relevant facts,"
<P>

and he referred to <b><i>Thomas A Edison Limited v Bullock</i></b>.
<P>

24   	The matter was also considered in this State in
<b><i>Bennett v Excelsior Land Investment &amp; Building Company
Limited</i></b> (1893) 14 NSWR (Eq) 179 at 182 when Owen CJ in Eq said:
<P>

"If the defendants were coming to dissolve an injunction the court would grant
that relief if it was satisfied that there had been
a suppression of a material
fact, but the plaintiff is now moving the court to continue an injunction which
expires today so that
there is nothing to dissolve.  This is a fresh
application made today which the court deals with de novo upon the evidence now
before
it, so that the principle contended for does not apply ...  Of course, I
can deal with a past application so far as the costs were
concerned, by making
the party who obtained an order upon suppression of a material fact pay them,
but such a suppression is not
a bar to a plaintiff's motion for the
continuation of an interim injunction."
<P>

25   	Mr Robinson has submitted if I was minded to dissolve the
injunction, he sought a fresh injunction in the same terms on the
same
material.
<P>

26   	The second main submission of Mr Warburton was that the
injunction should be refused on discretionary grounds because the
matter is
within the province of the industrial tribunal specifically constituted to deal
with disputes of this nature.  In this
regard he drew my attention to
<b><i>Harry M Miller Attractions Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Actors and Announcers
Equity Association of Australia &amp; Anor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%201%20NSWR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 1 NSWR 614</a> at 615
where Street J said:
<P>

"But, in point of discretion, it is a well-settled approach in this Court that
injunctive relief will not ordinarily be granted
where it can be seen that
there is another tribunal particularly suited to deal with the matter in issue
and having the requisite
power and authority to resolve the issues between the
parties."
<P>

It is, however, important to note the passage which immediately preceded
this:
<P>

"It may well be that in particular circumstances, whether by reason of shortage
of time, or by reason of some other consideration,
the aid of this Court might
be appropriately made available to prevent some irremedial infringement of the
rights of some individual
involved in an industrial dispute or otherwise to
vindicate the due observance of the ordinary principles of law which must be
enforced
throughout the community."
<P>

27   	Similar statements were made in <b><i>Slattery &amp; Ors v
Public Service Board</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%203%20NSWLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 3 NSWLR 41</a>; <b><i>Mahony v Industrial
Registrar of New South Wales</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20NSWLR%20315" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3 NSWLR 315</a>, <b><i>Australian
Broadcasting Corporation v Australian Public Sector and Broadcasting Union
&amp; Ors</i></b> (unreported, 18 March 1991, Kearney J), <b><i>Australian
Paper Limited v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information,
Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union
of Australia</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2081%20IR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 81 IR 15</a>
at 24 and <b><i>Patrick Stevedores Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of
Australia</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2082%20IR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 82 IR 237</a> at 247.
<P>

28   	From these cases I deduce a general proposition that as a
matter of general principle or judicial policy, the Common Law and
Equity
courts will refrain from interfering in industrial or other types of dispute
where there is another specialist tribunal which
has jurisdiction and
sufficient power to provide effective relief in the matter, and it becomes
necessary to consider the extent
of the powers of the Commission to provide
adequate relief in respect of the matters complained of.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 127</a> of the
Act gives the Commission power to make orders to stop or prevent "industrial
action" which is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a> of the Act, and in general terms relates to
bans, limitations or restrictions on the performance of work or on acceptance
of or offering
for work, the type of conduct often referred to as a "strike",
although not limited to such conduct.  Whether that definition of
"industrial
action" includes picketing, has apparently not been determined, although I am
informed that it is the subject of a reserved
decision in the Commission at the
present time.  
<P>

29   	The answer to that question may depend on what is meant by
"picketing", and for present purposes I respectfully adopt what
was said by the
Full Federal Court in <b><i>Australian Builders Labourers Federal Union of
Australia, Western Australian Branch v J Corp Pty Ltd </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/266.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 266</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20114%20ALR%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 114 ALR
551</a> at 556 where other authorities are referred to, and I am satisfied that
"picketing" properly so called is an orderly and peaceful
collection of persons
outside particular premises in an effort to persuade people not to enter the
premises, the object of the picket
being the communication of information; but
it does not include obstruction, molestation or intimidation of such people.
It involves
endeavouring to persuade people to take a certain course of action.
It does not include using physical force or other violence or
obstruction to
prevent them taking the opposite course if they are not persuaded.
<P>

30   	Such picketing is not unlawful, subject to any specific
statutes that may apply; and is part of the common law rights of freedom
of
association and freedom of speech.  It is unnecessary for me to determine in
these proceedings whether "industrial action" within
the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a> of the
Act includes picketing of such a nature, because it certainly does not include
public or private nuisance by blocking public
roads or access to property, and
it does not include assault or malicious damage to property which constitute
breaches of the criminal
law and in torts law constitute trespass to the person
and to goods respectively.
<P>

31   	The power of the Commission under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> extends to making
orders relating to "industrial action".  It may, as I have indicated, extend to
picketing in the form described
above, but I can see no authority in the
Commission to make orders preventing conduct such as that which is complained
of here. 
It may be that the Commission will make orders under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a>, in which
case the conduct complained of may cease; but it may be that for a variety of
reasons the Commission will not make orders
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a> thereby permitting the
defendants to remain on strike and impose other bans etc, but that situation
would not entitle them to engage
or continue in the type of conduct here in
question.
<P>

32   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that in the
nature of things when large numbers of people congregate there will
be some
interference with the enjoyment of life of other persons and this should be
regarded as in some way a normal incident of
picketing.  I reject that
submission.  Lawful picketing does not include tortious and criminal conduct as
described in this case.
<P>

33   	I was also referred to s 170MT of the Act which confers
certain immunity to engage in "industrial action" which is "protected
action",
which term is in turn defined in s 170ML and is industrial action during the
bargaining period for a certified agreement
engaged in for the purpose of
supporting or advancing claims made in respect of the proposed agreement.  Such
industrial action must
not involve secondary boycotts: s 170MM.  It may be, in
light of Ex H, that the strike action presently engaged in by the defendants
is
"protected action" within s 170ML.  If it is, s 170MT(1) would render <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s127.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127</a>
unavailable to the plaintiffs, but it is also important to refer to s 170MT(2)
which provides:
<P>

"Subject to subsection (3) (which relates to defamation) no action lies under
any law (whether written or unwritten) in force in
a State or Territory in
respect of any industrial action that is protected action unless the industrial
action has involved or is
likely to involve:
<P>

(a)	personal injury; or
<P>

(b)	wilful or reckless destruction of, or damage to, property; or
<P>

(c)	the unlawful taking, keeping or use of property."
<P>

34   	If the bargaining period is still current, the subsection
expressly excludes from the immunity, at least some, if not all,
of the conduct
complained of which has involved, or is likely to involve, personal injury or
reckless destruction of, or damage to,
property.  Even if the bargaining period
is not still current, so that the current industrial action is not protected
action, the
provision evinces a clear legislative intention that parties are
not to enjoy any immunity or be deprived of their ordinary common
law rights in
respect of such types of conduct.
<P>

35   	I refer again to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/s166a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 166A.</a>  I have some doubt whether that
section is in operation in the present case as it is within Div 7 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt VI</a> (see
ss 156 to 156A) which, as I read the Act, only applies to boycotts (s 156) as
defined in the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s163.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 163).</a>
<P>

36   	If the section is applicable, I am satisfied that these
proceedings are not prohibited by s 166A for the reasons given by
Wood CJ at CL
in <b><i>Patrick Stevedores Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of
Australia</i></b>.
<P>

37   	I am therefore satisfied that the ex parte injunction
should not have been obtained when it was because of a failure to make
a
material disclosure.  However, the proceedings before me on Wednesday and
yesterday were not technically proceedings to dissolve
the injunction but
proceedings to continue the injunction which had initially been limited to
expire at 5 pm on Tuesday 14 July 1999.
<P>

38   	In those circumstances, it seems to me that the principle
set out by Owen CJ in <b><i>Bennett v Excelsior Land</i></b> and some of the
other cases applies.  I should therefore not dissolve the existing injunction
which I have extended until 12 o'clock
today, but I should determine whether to
continue the injunction beyond that time in light of the circumstances as they
now exist,
subject to any outstanding questions as to costs.
<P>

(The parties sought and were granted a short adjournment.  On resumption a
video tape (Ex. 2) was tendered and viewed, and counsel
further addressed.)
<P>

39   	Since delivering my reasons earlier this morning, I have
admitted into evidence and viewed a video tape said to be taken in
the last two
days.  The video was not strictly proved, and to that extent was not
admissible, but I admitted it to ensure that no
relevant evidence was omitted
which could be material to determining whether the injunction should be
continued.  The video shows
a number of trucks entering and leaving one of the
plaintiffs' premises.  It is not clear which premises, but nevertheless, a
number
of trucks entered and then a number of trucks left.  There were a
significant number of police present and in view of the other evidence
in the
case, I am by no means satisfied that those trucks would have entered or left
if it had not been for the police presence and
the injunctions which I granted
earlier this week.
<P>

40   	The second part of the video contained a number of
interviews with people at the site, apparently members of the union, and
probably defendants.  The interviewer was not identified and the questions were
what are commonly described in political circles
as "Dorothy Dixers".  I regard
the interviews as of no value in determining the issues in this case.  I
therefore propose to continue
the injunctions previously granted until further
order.
<P>

41   	The defendants other than the first, second and third, may
be notified of this order in the manner set out in order 8 of 13
July 1999.
<P>

(Counsel addressed on costs)
<P>

42   	In relation to the costs of the proceedings, Mr Warburton
on behalf of the first, second and third defendants, has submitted
I should
make an order in favour of those defendants for costs on an indemnity basis to
uphold a very important principle, namely
that full disclosure must be made
when seeking ex parte relief.  I agree that the principle is important and must
be upheld, but
as indicated by Owen CJ in Eq in <b><i>Bennett v Excelsior
Land</i></b>, that principle can be upheld by an appropriate order for
costs.
<P>

43   	It seems to me that this is not an appropriate case for
indemnity costs.  The plaintiffs should not get any costs for making
the ex
parte application and should pay the costs of the appearances at Court
yesterday and the day before when the material not
disclosed was raised and
argued.  However, the plaintiffs have ultimately succeeded in obtaining a
continuation of the injunction.
 Although there may have been good reasons for
doing so, as a means of upholding the principle of full disclosure, to require
the
plaintiffs to present an entirely fresh case, that would have involved a
considerable waste of time and money, and it cannot be ignored
that the
plaintiffs have succeeded on the evidence which they adduced on both the ex
parte application on Tuesday and the return
of the summons on Wednesday.
<P>

44   	It seems to me, therefore, that the plaintiffs should get
the costs of the preparation of the case in the sense of the preparing
and
filing of affidavits and the costs of today when they have ultimately
succeeded.
<P>

45   	I therefore make the following orders:  As to the costs
reserved on Tuesday 13 July 1999, I make no order for such costs.
 I order the
plaintiffs to pay the first, second and third defendants' costs of the
appearances at court on Wednesday 14 July and
Thursday 15 July.  I order the
defendants to pay the plaintiffs' costs of preparation of the material,
including affidavits, and
the plaintiffs' costs of the appearance in Court
today.  Liberty to any party to apply on twenty-four hours notice.
<P>
