BRANCH &amp; ORS </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

(On application for continuation of injunction - see p 9
transcript)</center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an application for continuation
of the injunction I granted ex parte yesterday to prevent the continuation of
allegedly
tortious and criminal acts outside the premises of the plaintiffs.
The activities of which evidence has been given are, it would
appear, in
association with what is colloquially known as a "picket line" outside the
plaintiffs' premises in furtherance of an industrial
dispute relating to wages
and conditions.
<P>

2   	The evidence at the interlocutory stage discloses
activities involving public and private nuisance, intimidation, unlawful
interference with contractual relations, interference with trade and business
by unlawful means, assault and malicious damage to
property.
<P>

3   	I will not detail all the evidence but Mr Crawshaw SC, who
appears on behalf of the first, second and third defendants submits
that the
injunction should not be continued against his clients for a number of
reasons.
<P>

4   	Firstly, he submits that the first defendant, which is the
New South Wales branch of the union and is a body registered under
the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act 1996</a> (NSW)</i></b>, is a different corporate
entity to the union or industrial organisation which is involved in the
industrial dispute and which is
the federal organisation, a body registered
under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/" class="autolink_findacts">Workplace Relations Act 1996</a></i></b> of the Commonwealth.
<P>

5   	This may or may not be a substantial and valid point, but
it is not appropriate for detailed consideration at this stage of
the
proceedings.  I notice that the letters, Exhibit H and Exhibit A, are both
signed by a person who designates himself as the "NSW
Assistant State
Secretary".  I appreciate that that designation may be appropriate to an office
holder in the federal organisation,
and it does not necessarily mean that he is
an office holder of the New South Wales Branch.  But, as I say, it may be that
there
is no real difference in practical terms in the common law, as opposed to
the industrial relations sense, between the two organisations.
This matter may
require further consideration at a later stage, or it may be necessary or
appropriate to substitute a different first
plaintiff.
<P>

6   	Mr Crawshaw's next submission is that there is no evidence
of sufficient weight to link the first, second or third defendants
with the
specific tortious or criminal acts which have been the subject of evidence.  It
is true that  neither the second nor third
defendants have been identified as
engaging in any of the specific tortious acts, but there is ample evidence from
which an inference
can in my opinion be drawn that the whole activity outside
the plaintiffs' premises are the activities of a group of persons acting
together.  I won't use the term "in combination" at this stage, but certainly
acting together for a common purpose and in addition
to that, there is specific
evidence of Messrs Henderson and King being on the premises and in this regard
I refer to the affidavit
of Mr Brotherson, particularly at paragraph 12, and
there is also the affidavit of Mr Diggs and I refer to paragraph 4 and also,
in
particular, to paragraph 7(h) which details a meeting at which Messrs Henderson
and King were present on behalf of the Union at
which a number of threats were
made by other defendants also present on behalf of the Union, and it does not
appear that Messrs King
or Henderson took any steps to contradict what was said
by other defendants or to calm the situation down in any way.
<P>

7   	There is also the evidence in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Mr
Brotherson's affidavit and paragraph 4 of Mr Diggs' affidavit which
links the
Union to the activity taking place, to say nothing of the sign to which
reference is made in the evidence.
<P>

8   	I am therefore satisfied that there is evidence of
sufficient weight to link the first, second and third defendants with the
specific acts which have been the subject of evidence.
<P>

9   	Mr Crawshaw submits that I should refuse the injunction in
the exercise of my discretion because of the application that has
been made to
the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a copy of which is Exhibit 1.
This application was made yesterday and
I was not informed of it at the time
that the application was made for the ex parte injunction. The fact that I was
not informed
of it concerns me, but there may be an explanation for that and I
consider the plaintiff should have an opportunity to furnish such
explanation
as may be available.
<P>

10   	That application is directed to the strike action,
whatever that might encompass, and does not specifically refer to the allegedly
tortious or criminal acts involved.
<P>

11   	In those circumstances I do not consider it appropriate at
this stage to exercise my discretion against the continuation of
the
injunction.  The order I make is that the injunctions granted yesterday are
extended to 5 pm tomorrow, 15 July 1999.
<P>

12   	Notice of continuation of the injunction to all defendants
other than the first, second and third is to be given as in paragraph
8 of the
order made on 13 July 1999.
