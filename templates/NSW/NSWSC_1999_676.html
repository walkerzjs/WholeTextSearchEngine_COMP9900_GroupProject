<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  The Plaintiff by way of summons seeks declarations in the
following terms: 
<P>

1) A declaration that, when the second Defendant convicted the Plaintiff on
11th March 1998, at Bidura Children's Court of offences
pursuant to ss.<b>154A
and s.527C <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.4</a> and s.6 of<b> Traffic Act 1909</b>,
those convictions were invalid and seeks an order that the convictions be
quashed.
<P>

1   	On 29th December 1997 the Plaintiff was arrested and
charged at Mascot Police Station with offences pursuant to <b>ss154A and 527 C
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b> (Illegal use of motor vehicle and  goods in custody)
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 4(1)</a> &amp; 6(1) (a)</b> of the<b> Traffic Act 1909</b>,( driving in a
manner dangerous and unlicensed driver). He was initially refused bail, but
conditional bail was granted at the Police
Station on 30th December 1997. He
signed a bail undertaking to attend Bidura Children's' Court on 20th January
1998.
<P>

2   	On 20th January 1998 at Bidura Children's' Court the
Plaintiff did not appear and Mr. Scarlett, S.C.M. adjourned the matters
to 18th
February 1998. The bench papers indicate the purpose of the adjournment was ex
P. Bail was continued and the papers were
marked R to N.(Registry to
notify).
<P>

3   	A notice of continuance of bail addressed to the Plaintiff
at his home address notifying him of the adjourned date was signed
by a
prescribed officer, certified that this form was given to the child <i>"by
delivering it to the person personally", </i>the Clerk of the Local Court also
signed a notice of adjournment addressed to him at his home address.
<P>

4   	On 18th February 1998 the Plaintiff did not appear,  and
the matter was adjourned to 11th March 1998.  A notice of a continuance
of bail
was sent to the Plaintiff at his home address notifying him that the matter was
adjourned to that date. A notice of adjournment,
addressed to the Plaintiff at
his home address was also signed by the Clerk of the Local Court.
<P>

5   	On 11th March 1998 the Plaintiff did not appear, the second
Defendant,  a Children's Court Magistrate, heard the matter, on
that day, he
found the offences proved beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the Plaintiff and
ordered <b>s.80 AA </b>warrants to issue for the arrest of the Plaintiff. On
22nd September the Plaintiff applied for an annulment of the convictions under
<b>s100A </b>of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> on the basis that he was not notified
of the adjourned date.  That application was dismissed, the Magistrate taking
the view that
the convictions were not pursuant to <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss. 75</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">75A</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75b.html" class="autolink_findacts">75B</a> or
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">76</a></b> of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.</b>
<P>

6   	Prior to amendments which commenced in August 1998 the
power of a Magistrate to hear a matter ex parte was governed by <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 75</a>,<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">75A</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75b.html" class="autolink_findacts">75B</a> </b>and <b>76</b> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b>. The <b>Justice Act</b>
applies to criminal proceedings before the Children's' Court subject to <b>Part
2</b> of the <b>Children's ( Criminal Proceedings ) Act,1987</b>, the rules of
the Children's' Court <b>s. 27.2 </b>of the <b>Children's (Criminal
Proceedings) Act</b>, there is nothing in the rules or <b>Part 2</b> of this
Act which prohibits a Children's' Court Magistrate from hearing a matter ex
parte.
<P>

7   	<b>S.12.1</b> of the <b>Children's (Criminal Proceedings)
Act</b> provides that the nature of any allegations and the facts that must be
established before a child can be guilty, are to be explained
to the child.
<b>Subsection 2</b> provides that until those matters are explained to the
child the Court shall not proceed further, however, <b>s.12.2A</b> provides if
(a) the child fails, apparently without reasonable excuse, to appear in
criminal proceedings or before the Court and
(b) those matters have not been
explained to the child, subsection (2) does not, in the child's absence,
prevent the Court from proceeding
further.
<P>

8   	<b>S.75 </b>and<b> 75A </b>of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> , as
they then were, applied only where a summons or attendance notice had been
issued, <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75B</a></b> only applied to prosecutions of the <b>Public Service
Act</b> or other prescribed Acts. However, <b>s.76.(1)</b> applies to the
hearing of information's and complaints. This section gives a power to
Magistrates to hear or further hear a matter
in the absence of either or both
of the parties, if the matter has been adjourned.
<P>

9   	Information may be in any form as long as it is
sufficiently states the offence the laying of the information invests a
Magistrate
with jurisdiction, it is not necessary for the existence of
jurisdiction of the person charged to be present when that information
is laid,
see <b>ex-parte</b> <i>Walker; Re Goodfellow,(<b>1944),45SR (NSW) 103 at
106/108 </b> Young -v- Kenny &amp; Ors </i>SC  <b>unrep. 1992 Abadee J. </b>
<P>

10   	The Plaintiff was charged by the Police on 27th December
1997 the information's were laid 20th January 1998 when these charge
sheets
were placed before the Magistrate in the Children's Court, the Magistrate was
invested with jurisdiction and the power to
adjourn the matters, once the
matters had been adjourned the second Defendant had power to hear the matters
ex-parte and proceed
to conviction, <i>R-v-Hodder,(</i><b>1988) 33A Crim R
295</b>.  There was material before the second Defendant to indicate the
Plaintiff had been notified of the adjourned date, he had power
under
<b>s.76</b> to hear and determine the matters and he had a discretion to record
convictions as the Plaintiff was over 16 years of age, <b>s.</b> <b>14.1(b)
</b>of the <b>Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act</b>, therefore it is
submitted the convictions are valid. 
<P>

11   	The learned Magistrate before whom an application was made
pursuant to <b>s.100(A)</b> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> for an application to
annul the convictions under that section came to the conclusion for some reason
not really clear to me to conclude
that she had no power to do so <b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.100</a>
(A)</b> is in the following terms:
<P>

(1) Subject to this section, application may be made by or on behalf of any
person ( in this part referred to as the applicant):
 (a) against whom, in his
absence, a conviction has been made upon the hearing and determination of his
case under<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a>,<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">75A</a></b> or<b> 76</b> or (b) - for the annulment of that
conviction or penalty.
<P>

12   	It appears the learned Magistrate having concluded that
she had no power dismissed the application. The matter now comes before
me by
the Plaintiff  to seek a declaration in the terms that the convictions recorded
are invalid.
<P>

13   	<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.76</a></b> of the Act as it then was has been subject to
consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>R-v-Hodder</i>, (<b>1988)
33 A Crim R at 295. </b> In that case it was held that as a matter of
construction of the relevant provisions in the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> NSW <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s74.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.74</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">75</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">75A</a>,<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">76</a></b>, permitted the Magistrate to convict and sentence in the absence
of the Defendant. The Court held to construe <b>76</b> in that way does not
import any risk of injustice in as much as the hearing from which the
adjournment arose would have in itself
have been a validity constituted
hearing, either with the Defendant present or else with proof of service
having been presented.
<P>

 Street CJ said at  298: 
<P>

<i>"The specific phrase in<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.76</a></b> authorising the Court to proceed with
the hearing as if such party or parties were present appears to me to confer on
the Court all
the powers available to it, if the parties were present at the
hearing including the power to convict and to sentence."</i>
<P>

14   	Attached to an affidavit of Mr. Peter Bruckner, the
Plaintiff's solicitor is a copy of the transcript of the proceedings before
Children's Court Magistrate J.A. Huber, I must say that I have had some
difficulty in understanding exactly and why it was that Her
Worship came to the
conclusion that she did not have power to deal with these matters. Her Worship
noted it was an ex parte hearing
: "<i>Which she said which  isn't a<b> 75</b>
application",</i> and then she said: <i>"I don't have the power</i>", the
reference was made to <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75B</a></b>.
<P>

15   	The learned Magistrate in argument referred to the
application as being an ex parte hearing, which she said: <i>"Isn't a
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75</a></b> application."</i> Mr. Bruckner who then appeared for the
Plaintiff, stated the determination was made pursuant to <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a></b>, which the
learned Magistrate replied, that section was based upon a summons or attendance
notice, noting that he was refused bail
and then entered bail, (see T.6), then
for some reason the Police Prosecutor seemed to accept that the matter was
governed by the
provisions of <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75.</a></b>
<P>

16   	The Police Prosecutor in argument referred to
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s100a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.100A(3)(b</a></b>) which enabled a Magistrate to annul a conviction or penalty
where the hearing of the information was adjourned because the Defendant
would
not have been aware of the adjourned date. The learned Magistrate accepted that
provision enabled her to deal with the matter.
She recognised she had the power
to annul the convictions, she recognised she only has the power to annul the
convictions if the
convictions  falls within sections <b>75,75A,75B</b> and
<b>76</b>. She then referred to the provisions of <b>s.80AAA</b>, which forbids
an order that a person be imprisoned unless that person was present at the time
the order of imprisonment was made.
<P>

17   	The transcript of the proceedings in the Children's Court
before Mr. Lalley, SM, are annexed to the affidavit of Ms. Scheepers,
(28.05.99). It appears whilst His Worship recorded convictions on each of the
matters, he did not proceed to make an order for imprisonment,
and authorise
the issue of <b>s.80AA</b> warrant for the apprehension of the Plaintiff for
the purpose of sentencing.
<P>

18   	The learned Magistrate in the present matter concluded
because it was a <b>s.80AA</b> matter, that she did not have the power to deal
with the application then before the Court, and went on to say he was not
convicted
by means of <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a></b>. As I have stated previously, the Police
Prosecutor appeared to agree with that statement. His Worship noted the various
charges
which he referred to, related to <b>s.80AA</b>, and then went on to say
that these matters were all dealt with in the Plaintiff's absence and they do
not fall within <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a></b>. She then dismissed the application. 
<P>

19   	It is not disputed between the parties that a summons or
attendance notice had not been served on the Plaintiff and therefore
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a></b> did not apply. S<b>.76</b>, however, applies to hearings of
information's and complaints and enables a Magistrate power to hear a matter in
the absence of either
party.
<P>

20   	There was no reason, therefore, to prevent the original
Magistrate from hearing and determining in the action in the absence
of the
Defendant, I see no valid reason why pursuant to <b>s.100AA(3)(b)</b> to have
prevented the Magistrate from hearing the application based on the Plaintiff
being unaware of the adjourned date.  In my
view the learned Magistrate was in
error in determining she had no such power.
<P>

21   	It is now submitted that  in the light of that decision it
would be an abuse of process for the first Defendant to argue that
the
convictions were pursuant to either <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a>,<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">75A</a>,<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s75b.html" class="autolink_findacts">75B</a></b> or <b>76 </b>of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>. </b>It is submitted that would involve re-litigation of an
issue already decided. The authority quoted is<i> Rogers -v- The Queen,</i>
<b>(1994)181 CLR 251</b>. That was a case that related to records of interview
or other records of interview made at the same time that had previously been
held by a Court to be involuntary or not, on the base of that judgment it is
submitted that Her Worship's finding was a final determination
and consequently
that an argument should not be allowed in this respect, on the basis of  res
judicata or issue estoppel.
<P>

22   	I cannot accept that submission, the question here to be
determined is whether the local Magistrate, who originally dealt
with the
matter ex parte, was exercising a jurisdiction conferred by <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.76</a></b> of
<b>the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.</b> The conclusion reached by Magistrate Huber relates to
a possible error of law, in my view there is nothing to prevent the Plaintiff
from seeking an order of this Court correcting that error. In my view there is
no basis for the submission, it is not necessary in
these circumstances to
consider in detail the ambert of raised res judicata and issue estoppel. In my
view it was clear that the
section that the matter was dealt with pursuant to
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.76</a> </b>and I cannot understand why that was overlooked by the Magistrate
in her determining that she had no power.
<P>

23   	Alternatively it is submitted the convictions were not
pursuant to <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.76</a></b>, no oral argument was addressed to this matter, it only
arose when the Plaintiff's Counsel volunteered that he would make written
submissions. If it was being relied on, I should have had oral submissions on
the matter.
<P>

24   	It is now submitted, however, that pursuant to
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.76(2)</a>,</b> that the proceedings must be determined on the date in which
they were adjourned. It is submitted that under those circumstances
the local
Court does not have the power to adjourn the matter for ex parte hearings and
thus the convictions are ultra vires.
<P>

25   	The Defendants submits whilst it is conceded that the
papers were marked ex P. by Scarlett SM on 20th January 1998, it was
also noted
that the Plaintiff's bail was to continue and the Registry was to notify the
Plaintiff of the adjourned date. A notice
of continuance of bail was served on
the Plaintiff and a notice of adjournment addressed to the Plaintiff at his
home address was
completed by the clerk of the local Court. A similar procedure
was carried out on the adjournment of 18th February 1998.
<P>

26   	Quite clearly the purpose of the adjournment was to notify
the Plaintiff of the date for hearing of the matter and had he
attended Court
the matter could be heard in his presence. When the matter was called on, the
Plaintiff's name was called outside
the Court, and that being the case, there
was no expectation the matter would proceed automatically in his absence.
<P>

27   	In my view, in the circumstances, the second Defendant had
the power under <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.76(2)</a></b> to deal with the matter, in those circumstances
a summons will be dismissed.
