<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The Crown has, for a second time, sought
leave to cross examine a Crown witness, Mrs Spathis.  I determined that leave
should be
given in respect of certain issues, which were then enumerated (T
1003).  I<b> </b>indicated that I would later provide reasons for my ruling.  I
now do so.
<P>

<b>Background</b>
<P>

2  	In April 1996 Mrs Spathis, then Ms Figueira, was engaged to the
accused, Mr Alexios Spathis.  They lived together at the home
of Mr Spathis'
parents at 18 St Paul Street, Randwick.
<P>

3  	The body of the deceased was discovered early on Friday 12 April
1996.  At 6.00pm, or thereabouts, information was communicated
to the police
concerning a vehicle, POZ.344, which was observed in the area in which the body
was discovered at a time when the body
had been set alight.  That vehicle was
registered in the name of Mr Spathis.  Through the Motor Registry records, the
police were
able to determine the address of Mr Spathis.  Police were
thereafter despatched (soon after 7.00pm) to carry out surveillance on
Mr
Spathis' home.
<P>

4  	One gathers that, by this means, Ms Figueira (now Mrs Spathis)
was stopped by police at approximately 9.15pm.  She was driving
another motor
vehicle.  She was taken to the Botany Police Station, where she was
interviewed.  A statement was prepared.  It included
the following
paragraphs:
<P>

"8.	During the afternoon and evening I spoke with Alex on a number of
occasions.  I rang him on the mobile and he also called me
using the mobile.
As I said we were organising the holiday and Alex was apparently doing some
running around for the holiday in between
finishing lunches at the bistro and
re-opening.  He rang me about 7pm.  He was apparently on his way back to work
and the car had
broken down.  Alex owns a green Datsun 240Z coupe.  I don't
know the number, it's POZ something.  He was driving this car at the
time.  He
had in fact driven to work in that car earlier in the morning.  I said to him,
"What are you doing?'.  He said, `I'm in
the middle of Parramatta Road, the
car's broken down and I'm waiting for a tow.  I'm still trying to get it
started if I can.'  We
spoke about the car a bit more and then hung up.
<P>

9.	From this time on we spoke about every half hour or so.  I rang him on a
number of occasions and he also rang me.  I also rang
and spoke with Peter,
Alex's partner at the bistro.  Peter was aware of Alex's difficulty and Alex
had also contacted him saying
that Alex could not make it to work in the
evening because the car was stopping and starting all the time.  On each
occasion I spoke
to Alex he was on the mobile phone.
<P>

10.	The last time I spoke with Alex would have been about 11.00pm.  He had got
the car going but I don't know at what time he actually
got it going.  I
remember asking him where he was at the time and he said, `I'm coming through
Earlwood, I'm about ten minutes away.'
 He would have arrived home about 11.30
or 12.
<P>

11.	When he arrived home he was frustrated about the car.  He had been able to
drive the car home.  I remember he had oil all over
him and he smelt like the
car.  At the time he was wearing his work uniform, dark trousers and a light
grey or whitish collared shirt.
 I don't remember what he had on his feet, he
usually wears block boots.  When he came home we talked briefly about the car
and he
then went and had a shower pretty much straight away.  I soaked the
clothes he had on over night and then washed them today, I can't
remember if I
did the top because they weren't as dirty as the pants, I think the top might
still be in the washing basket.  After
he had showered he came to bed and we
stayed up and talked about the holiday and the car and we went to sleep."
<P>

5  	From the viewpoint of the Crown, this statement was significant.
It is apparent from the account given by Mr Spathis to police
the same evening
(which was not known to Mrs Spathis at the time of her interview), that Mr
Spathis did not on 11 April 1996 spend
hours broken down on Parramatta Road,
waiting for a tow truck.
<P>

6  	At 1.30am on Saturday 13 April 1996, the police conducted an
electrically recorded interview (ERISP) with Ms Figueira (hereinafter
referred
to as Mrs Spathis).  The interview dealt with a matter which had come to light
after the statement had been taken.  Mrs
Spathis, in her earlier statement, had
said that she had travelled to the city with Mr Spathis early on Friday 12
April 1996.  She
had paid cash for certain airline tickets.  The cash had been
obtained from her account.
<P>

7  	In fact, as Mrs Spathis readily acknowledged when later
interviewed, part of the cash had been provided by Mr Spathis.  The
travel
agent still had the cash which had been paid.  By reference to the serial
numbers, certain notes could be traced to money
which had been in the
possession of the deceased before his death.
<P>

8  	Mrs Spathis furnished a further statement (dated 13 April 1996).
The statement was prepared by police, based upon the answers
provided in the
ERISP interview.
<P>

<b>Evidence Before this Court</b>
<P>

9  	Mrs Spathis was called to give evidence by the Crown.  She was
asked, in a non-leading way, to recount conversations she had
with her husband
on the evening of Thursday 11 April 1996.  She did so at some length.  Her
account included the conversations referred
to in the concluding lines of para
8 above, and the concluding lines of para 10.  It also included much more.  Mrs
Spathis, for instance,
said this:  (T 902/903)
<P>

"Q.  Can you tell the court what he said?
<P>

A.  He was speaking very quickly.  He sounded like he was running a marathon
and he said, `Where are you?'  And I said, `I'm at
home where you called'.  He
said `No, whereabouts?  Where's mum and dad?  Nobody go anywhere.  Don't even
go outside.'  I said, `What,
we are not going anywhere.  Why?  What is the
matter?  You sound full of anxiety.  Where are you anyway?'  And then I said,
`What's
wrong with you?  You sound full of anxiety.  What's wrong with you?
Where are you?'  He said, `The car, it's broken down.  It won't
start.  I'm
waiting for a tow.  Don't go outside' and then he hung up."
<P>

10  	Evidence in respect of later conversations was in similar terms.
The examination continued:  (T 905)
<P>

"Q.  He did eventually get home, did he?
<P>

A.  Yes, he got home about 11.30.
<P>

Q.  when he got home did you notice something about him?  What was he wearing,
for a start?
<P>

A.  He had a white collared greyish T-shirt, he had a pattern coloured jacket,
cardigan style, and some dark grey greenish trousers.
<P>

Q.  Did you notice anything about his appearance?
<P>

A.  Not about his appearance, no.
<P>

Q.  What about the way he smelt in terms of the way he normally smelt when he
came back from work?
<P>

A.  Nothing out of character, nothing that I noticed was strange."
<P>

11  	Mrs Spathis added:  (T 905)
<P>

"Q.  After you arrived home did you do something with that jacket, did you put
it somewhere or do something with it?
<P>

A.  The next day I soaked it."
<P>

12  	The Crown then made its first application for leave under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(1)</a>
to cross examine Mrs Spathis.  Having heard argument, I refused leave at that
point (Judgment No. 9).  I did so on the basis that
the examination in chief
was not yet complete, and Mrs Spathis was about to be cross examined by a party
hostile to the interests
of her husband (cf 38(6)).
<P>

13  	Mrs Spathis resumed her evidence.  She was reminded of questions
which had been directed to her concerning the way in which
her husband appeared
when he returned on the evening of Thursday 11 April (T 938).  Her answers were
read to her.  The following
was then put:  (T 938)
<P>

"Q.  having reflected upon it, was there anything that you can add to that
evidence that you gave before about his appearance when
(he) returned on that
--
<P>

A.  As I said, he was in his work clothes, from what I saw him leave in the
morning.  He had like oil stains on him and when he
came home and he just come
up to me and see that I was all right and embraced me and he smelt like, you
know, like oil, the car smell,
that type of thing."
<P>

14  	She was then taken to the conversation with her husband before
they went to sleep.  The following was asked:  (T 939)
<P>

"Q.  do you recall whether you had any conversation before you went to
sleep?
<P>

A.  I was mainly doing the talking.  Alex was just lying there staring up at
the ceiling and I just was questioning him.  `Where
is the car?  Is it outside
now?'  And he wasn't really responding so I started to go on about the holiday
and he just wasn't responding
so I thought I wouldn't go into it any more about
the night or the car.   And I tried to relax him and embraced him and I
remember
his heart just beating so fast and I got up and I said, `Are you all
right?  Are you OK?  Your heart is beating so fast, what's wrong
with you?  It
sounds really bad, are you okay?'"
<P>

<b>Cross Examination by Counsel for Mr Patsalis</b>
<P>

15  	Mrs Spathis was then cross examined by counsel for Mr Patsalis.
She was invited to read onto the record paragraphs 8 to 11
of her statement of
12 April 1996, extracted above.  Counsel then read to Mrs Spathis the evidence
she had given in this Court in
answer to the Crown, concerning her
conversations with her husband during the course of 11 April 1996 (T 959-960).
Counsel for Mr
Patsalis then put the following:  (T 961)
<P>

"Q.  ... What I am putting to you is that what you have said in your particular
transcript is different to what you said in your
statement, would you agree
with that?
<P>

A.  It's more personal.
<P>

Q.  It's a fuller account of what you can recall?
<P>

A.  It's a more honest account."
<P>

16  	And there the matter was left.
<P>

17  	Mr Campbell, appearing for Mr Spathis, then cross examined Mrs
Spathis.  At the point of re-examination, the Crown again sought
leave under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(1).</a>
<P>

<b>Submissions by the Crown</b>
<P>

18  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 38(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> is in the following
terms:
<P>

"<b>38(1)</b>  A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court,
question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the
witness,
about:
<P>

(a)	evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party;  or
<P>

(b)	a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge
and about which it appears to the court the witness
is not, in examination in
chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence;  or
<P>

(c)	whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent
statement."
<P>

19  	The Crown relied upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(1)(a)</a> and (c).  Specifically, it
pointed to four matters:
<P>

&#183;	First, the elaboration by Mrs Spathis upon her initial statement was a
significant departure from the account previously
given.  The Crown had sought
a short adjournment to confer with Mrs Spathis before she gave evidence.
Nothing was said in that conference
which signalled the additional evidence
which ultimately emerged.  Had the Crown been on notice of such evidence, it
would have given
consideration to whether she should be called in the Crown
case.  Thought would need to have been given as to whether she could be
relied
upon as a witness of truth.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, there was a contradiction in her evidence as to when she
soaked the clothing of Mr Spathis.  Washing the clothing
was material because
of the possibility of bloodstains, or other indicia (including smell) which may
have connected Mr Spathis with
the events of the previous evening.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, her description of Mr Spathis, then her fiancee, after his
arrival home was significantly different from the description
she provided in
her evidence.  It is the difference between "frustration" and "acute anxiety".
A specific cause had been identified
for the frustration, namely the car.  The
acute anxiety, on the other hand, was largely unexplained.
<P>

&#183;	Fourthly, Mrs Spathis' description of her conversation with her fiancee
before she went to sleep was again significantly
different from her statement
that "we stayed up and talked about the holiday and the car and went to
sleep".
<P>

20  	There were other matters to which the Crown drew attention,
including a conversation between Mrs Spathis and her husband on
the way to the
travel agent.  The original statements did not deal with those matters (either
expressly or by implication).  They
therefore seem to me to be in a somewhat
different category.
<P>

<b>The Response of Mr Spathis</b>
<P>

21  	Counsel for Mr Spathis responded in a number of ways.  The
statements provided by Mrs Spathis were clearly not an exhaustive
account of
her conversations with her fiancee that evening.  They were confined to the
subject of immediate interest to the police
at that time, namely the
whereabouts of Mr Spathis, and his car.  There had been many conversations in
the course of the evening.
 It was reasonable to suppose that other things were
said.  The Crown, by the very general questions directed to Mrs Spathis,
invited
disclosure of the additional material.  They cannot now be heard to
complain.  The elaboration could not be characterised as either
"unfavourable"
or "inconsistent".
<P>

<b>Analysis of the Evidence </b>
<P>

22  	In <b><i>R v Lozano</i></b> (CCA, unreported, 10 June 1997).
Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Barr J agreed) made a number of comments in relation
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38</a>, and specifically <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(1)(a).</a>  He said this:  (at 10)
<P>

"Section 38 was intended by the Law Reform Commission to abrogate the common
law relating to hostile witnesses (26 ALRC vol 1, par
625), and the Act has
been successful in doing so (<b>Regina v Ivan Robert Marko Milat</b> (Hunt CJ
at CL, 23 April 1996, unreported) at 4-5).  The word `unfavourable' which is
used in the section (and which is not defined
in the Act) should not therefore
be interpreted as <i>necessarily</i> requiring either the witness or the
evidence itself to be hostile or adverse to the case of the party calling the
witness, in the
sense that the evidence denies that case or attacks other
evidence upon which that party relies.  In <b>Regina v Souleyman</b> ((1996)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=40%20NSWLR%20712" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">40
NSWLR 712</a> at 715), Smart J adopted a dictionary meaning of unfavourable as `not
favourable'.  I am content, too, to adopt that meaning."
<P>

23  	See also <b><i>R v GAC</i></b> (CCA, unreported, 19 December
1996) and <b><i>R v Richard Adam</i></b> (Wood CJ at CL, unreported, 3.12.98)
especially p 14.
<P>

24  	The impression created by the statements of Mrs Spathis is of a
series of calls to Mr Spathis concerned with the break-down
of his car, and
delay whilst he waited for a tow truck.  Nothing was said which indicated
anxiety, or concern on his part for the
welfare of his wife, or members of his
family.  In para 8, having recounted in the first person the conversations
concerning the
break down, Mrs Spathis concluded her account with these
words:
<P>

"We spoke about the car a bit more and then hung up."
<P>

25  	The impression is reinforced by the opening words of paragraph
11, namely:
<P>

"When he arrived home he was frustrated about the car.  He had been able to
drive the car home.  I remember he had oil all over
him and he smelt like the
car."
<P>

26  	The car was still prominent in Mrs Spathis' account as she spoke
with her fiancee in bed.  Her statement is in these terms:
<P>

"After he had showered he came to bed and we stayed up and talked about the
holiday and the car and we went to sleep."
<P>

27  	I have some misgivings about whether the elaboration by Mrs
Spathis may be regarded as "unfavourable", within the meaning of
s38(1)(a).
Simply because a witness may add something favourable to an accused does not
render the evidence "unfavourable" to the
Crown.  If the elaboration is
patently truthful it could not be so regarded in my view.  It is
"unfavourable", within the meaning
of s38(1)(a), where it may rationally be
inferred that the elaboration may be untruthful, and motivated by a desire to
assist the
accused.
<P>

28  	On balance, I believe the evidence of Mrs Spathis can be
characterised as "unfavourable" to the Crown in this sense.  However,
I prefer
to determine the matter by reference to s38(1)(c).
<P>

29  	The evidence given by Mrs Spathis on 5 August in this Court,
taken as a whole, is inconsistent with the statement made to the
police on 12
April 1996 in the various respects identified by the Crown.  The
inconsistencies are open to the construction that Mrs
Spathis may have coloured
her evidence to assist her husband.  Her husband asserted that he was
threatened by Mr Patsalis.  He sought
to explain his actions on 11 April 1996,
in part, by reference to such threats.
<P>

<b>Discretionary Matters</b>
<P>

30  	Leave under s38(1) is discretionary.  Questions of fairness also
arise under s135, s137 and, specifically, s192(2)(b).  For
a number of reasons,
I believe it is appropriate to give the Crown leave to cross examine Mrs
Spathis.  The cross examination, however,
should be limited to certain
issues.
<P>

31  	First, given the cross examination of Mrs Spathis by counsel for
Mr Patsalis, the Crown would, in any event, be entitled to
seek from Mrs
Spathis an explanation for the differences between her statement to the police,
and her evidence.  Much of the cross
examination that can be expected, were
leave given, would be material which could be pursued in re-examination without
leave (although
by non-leading questions).
<P>

32  	Secondly, the Crown, however, seeks to go further.  It wishes to
challenge Mrs Spathis, and suggest that she is colouring her
evidence to assist
her husband.  Given the way in which the issue arose, I believe that the Crown
should be allowed to put that suggestion
(cf s192(2)(b)).  I also believe that
it is fairer to Mrs Spathis (cf s192(2)(b)).  At the conclusion of the cross
examination on
behalf of Mr Patsalis, the issue was left hanging in the air,
unresolved.  Although insight may have been provided by re-examination,
I
believe that cross examination, in the circumstances, is more appropriate.  It
will provide the jury with a more substantial foundation
(which is less
speculative) upon which to make its judgment in respect of Mrs Spathis.  The
conversations which Mrs Spathis recounts
are important evidence
(s192(2)(c)).
<P>

33  	Thirdly, the disadvantage to Mr Spathis, were leave given, is
ameliorated, in my view, by the timing of the cross examination.
 Mrs Spathis
has been permitted to give her evidence in chief without challenge by the
Crown.  She has now been cross examined by
counsel for the co-accused.  As
mentioned, that cross examination left certain issues unresolved.  Those issues
may now be addressed
by cross examination by the Crown.  I have indicated to Mr
Campbell that he may ask further questions of Mrs Spathis at the conclusion
of
the Crown's cross examination.  Leave was therefore given, confined to the
following issues:
<P>

&#183;	First, the suggestion in conversations at 8.44 and 8.46pm and later that
there was a need for Mrs Spathis and members of
her family to stay indoors, and
a concern on the part of Mr Spathis for their safety.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, the issue raised by para 11 concerning the presentation of Mr
Spathis upon his arrival home, whether frustration
or anxiety.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, para 11 generally, including the topic in the final sentence
concerning the conversation before going to sleep.
<P>
