<b>20139/98   -   CHAPMANS LIMITED  v  </b>
<P>

<b>ROBERT WALTER YANDELL </b>
<P>

<b>t/as YANDELLS</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Strike out paragraph of statement of claim;</b>
<P>

<b>  directions)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By motion of motion filed 9 April 1999 the
defendant seeks that pursuant to Pt 15 r 26 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>,
paragraph 7(ii) of the statement of claim dated 7 May 1998 be struck out.  The
plaintiff sought leave to seek an order that it be
permitted to file an amended
statement of claim.  Such leave was not opposed and granted.  The defendant
relied on an affidavit of
Damien Bruce Sturzaker sworn 7 April 1999 and the
plaintiff relied on an affidavit of Donald Wayne Chaffey sworn 6 July 1999.

<P>

2  	Briefly, the statement of claim pleads that the defendant was
retained by the plaintiff as its solicitor for the period commencing
December
1993.  The plaintiff is a publicly listed company.  In late 1992 the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX) had raised requisitions
for which it required answers.  On
3 December 1993 the requisitions had not been answered and the plaintiff
although still listed
on the stock exchange was given a suspended status.
<P>

3  	From December 1993 to December 1994 the plaintiff retained the
defendant to provide legal advice.  In accordance with the defendant's
advice,
proceedings were commenced in the Federal Court of Australia.  The plaintiff
alleges that the defendant failed to advise
of the ASX listing rule 3J15.  This
rule was not pleaded as part of the plaintiff's further amended statement of
claim in the Federal
Court.  The proceedings were dismissed and the plaintiff
was ordered to pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court.
On 21 June 1996 the court dismissed the appeal but remitted the
matter to the
ASX for further consideration.  The Full Federal Court found that the ASX
failed to comply with its own listing rules
when it purported to delist the
plaintiff in November 1993.  Since that time, the company has been relisted and
the company shares
have been requoted.  The appeal was dismissed on the basis
that the stock exchange listing rules did not constitute an enactment
as
defined in the <b>Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act</b> 1997.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff alleges that the solicitor, in failing to advise of
listing rule 3J15 constituted breach of contract and negligence.
 The plaintiff
has claimed the costs for running the case before the Federal Court and the
costs involved in the appeal to the Full
Court of the Federal Court.  The
defendant raises no objection to that claim for damages.  However para 7(ii)
gives particulars of
damage as follows:
<P>

<b>"(ii)	The Plaintiff has suffered consequential loss as a result of being
unable to acquire business assets in Hong Kong during the
period from the end
of the hearing of the Proceedings at first instance up until the hearing of the
Appeal."</b>
<P>

6  	The defendant submitted that this claim for damages is hopeless
and should be struck out.  Part 15 r 26 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>
provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where a pleading -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the pleading;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings, or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the
whole or any part of the pleadings be struck out.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an
order under subrule (1)."</b>
<P>

7  	In <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for
Railways</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> Barwick CJ, who heard the application
alone, at p 29 stated: 
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

8  	Barwick CJ referred to Dixon J's passage quoted at p 130:
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  `be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense."</b>
<P>

9  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to
remind himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway
Commissioners</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%2d49%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948-49) 78 CLR 62</a>, <b><u>General Steel</u></b>
and<b><u>Webster &amp; Anor v Lampard</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  
<P>

10  	Master Allen (as he then was) in <b><u>Contribution Fund of
Australia v Hunt</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2044%20ALR%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 44 ALR 365</a> at pp 373-374  said:
<P>

<b>"...It is not by any means rare in the history of the development of the
common law that a high appellate court, in enunciating a
novel development in
the law, albeit one avowedly based on a miscellany of old cases, has chosen to
use general words of imprecise
limits in meaning to facilitate the arrival, in
later cases, of the final form of the development without the need to overrule
what
earlier had been stated.  That being so I am of opinion that a court at
first instance should be particularly astute not to risk
stifling that
development of the law by summarily throwing out of court actions in respect of
which there is a reasonable possibility
that it will be found, in the
development of the law, still embryonic, that a cause of action does lie.  The
risk of injustice to
the plaintiff, which summary termination of his claim
would entail, is real.  One cannot predict, with firm assurance, what the
future
holds as the final formulation of the new development."</b>
<P>

11  	This passage was quoted with approval by Justice Badgery-Parker
in <b><u>Gibson v Parkes District Hospital</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d92%29%2026%20NSWLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-92) 26 NSWLR 9</a> at p
35.
<P>

12  	As previously stated, the defendant submitted that the
plaintiff's case is so hopeless it should be struck out.  Alternatively,
the
defendant submitted that the proceedings should be struck out because the
plaintiff is unable to provide any proper particulars
for the claim of
consequential loss or damage.  The defendant also submitted that the court
should take into account the extraordinary
size and unusual nature of the claim
for consequential damages, and the considerable opportunity that has been
afforded to the plaintiff
to properly formulate its case.  
<P>

13  	Before I embark on a history of the supply of particulars it is
appropriate that I should repeat what is perhaps trite law
namely that the onus
is on the plaintiff in the statement of claim to set out the facts upon which
it relies so that the defendant
can become aware of the precise allegations
made against them and hence what it is that they have to meet.  Material facts
should
be pleaded.  
<P>

14  	On 1 June 1998 the defendant's solicitors sought particulars in
relation to para 7(ii).  The plaintiff's solicitors replied:
<P>

<b>"The consequential losses suffered by the plaintiff relate to the lost
opportunity for the plaintiff to complete the conditions subsequent
to an
Agreement reached regarding acquisition of a substantial property portfolio.
The value of the portfolio to be acquired was
to range from $20 million to $100
million, and upon completion of the Agreement, the plaintiff could earn amounts
ranging from $1
million to $5 million per annum.  This is calculated on a
conservative basis where the property portfolio yielded a return of 4%
per
annum.  We are instructed that the plaintiff estimates that the yield could
reasonably be expected to be 7.5 to 10% per annum
which would have increased
the annual earnings to 10 million dollars per annum.  The losses of annual
income have occurred since
mid 1994 and are continuing to date."</b>
<P>

15  	By letter dated 18 September 1998 the defendant asked for a copy
of the agreement and asked:
<P>

<b>"How is it alleged that the negligence/breach of contract of the defendant
caused the plaintiff to lose the opportunity to complete
the conditions
subsequent to the Agreement?  What were the conditions subsequent?  How is it
alleged (by reference to the defendant's
actions) the opportunity to complete
the conditions subsequent was lost?"</b>
<P>

16  	By letter dated 22 January 1994 the plaintiff's solicitor
provided copies of a letter from Austvest Holdings Pty Limited (Austvest)
to
the plaintiff, a letter dated 22 February 1994 from the plaintiff to Blossoms
Pty Limited (Blossoms) and an agreement dated 28
March 1994.  
<P>

17  	The letter from Austvest stated:
<P>

<b>"We wish to confirm our recent discussions regarding our company's interest
in taking a placement of shares in your company, subject
to the following terms
and conditions:</b>
<P>

<b>1.	Maximum number of shares to be taken up by our company in a placement:
Twenty million (20,000,000) ordinary shares at par, subject
to Chapmans
obtaining shareholders' approval for the placement.</b>
<P>

<b>2.	Purpose:  For the acquisition of real estate investments in China and
Hong Kong to the value of approximately Ten million dollars
(10,000,000).</b>
<P>

<b>3.	That Chapmans retains its listing on the Australian Stock Exchange and
within six (6) months of our company's investment in Chapmans,
quotation of the
shares will be restored on the Australian Stock Exchange.</b>
<P>

<b>Please advise whether your Board will agree to proceed on the above basis
and formalise such a proposal.  If an agreement in principle
is reached, please
prepare the necessary draft agreement for our approval."</b>
<P>

18  	As I understand the plaintiff's case, it says that because its
shares were not requoted and relisted on the ASX, Austvest did
not take a
placement of shares.  However, the agreement stipulates that the plaintiff had
six months after Austvest's investment
to have its shares requoted and relisted
on the ASX.  It is my view this claim should have been pleaded.  However, had
it been pleaded
in its current form, it could not be sustained.  It is
hopeless.
<P>

19  	In the letter dated 22 February 1994 the plaintiff wrote to
Blossoms.  The plaintiff stated that if Blossoms submitted a property
investment portfolio to the plaintiffs with an independent valuation ranging
from $20 million to $100 million then the plaintiff
would recommend to its
shareholders that a payment of between $2 million and $2.5 million over and
above the valuation would be made
for the acquisition of the portfolio.  The
letter continued that if approval of the shareholders was not obtained then the
transaction
need not proceed unless some other arrangement acceptable to both
parties could be agreed on.  
<P>

20  	The agreement was executed on 28 March 1994 (the agreement) and
provided:
<P>

<b>"Recital</b>
<P>

<b>Alexander Securities Limited, Blossoms, and the plaintiff agreed "that upon
Blossoms providing a portfolio of investments, say to
the value of $20 million,
free of any encumbrance, Chapmans shall either acquire this "portfolio" by way
of cash payment or by way
of an issue of shares (Shares)"."</b>
<P>

21  	The general terms of the agreement were stated as:
<P>

<b>"Clause 1	In consideration of Blossoms purchasing the shares in Chapmans or
being issued fully paid shares in Chapmans, Blossoms shall
provide the
Portfolio free of any encumbrances within a period of sixty days from the date
of this Agreement.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Clause 4	In the event that Blossoms is unable to provide the Portfolio
within Sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, the
parties shall
confer and agree either to extend this Agreement or terminate this
Agreement.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Clause 6	It shall be the objective of the directors of Chapmans that
Chapmans shares be re-quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange
Limited and the
directors shall use their best endeavours to achieve such re-quotation.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Clause 7	In the event that the shares are removed from the official list of
the Australian Stock Exchange Limited, then this Agreement
will be void  <i>ab
initio</i>."</b>
<P>

22  	Under the agreement, there was an obligation upon Blossoms to
provide a portfolio of investments to the value of $20 million
to Chapmans,
free from encumbrances within 60 days from the date of the agreement, ie., by
27 May 1994.  If Blossoms did not provide
the portfolio within 60 days, the
parties were, according to the agreement, obliged to confer and either extend
or terminate the
agreement.  Once the portfolio was provided, the directors of
Chapmans were to use their best endeavours to have Chapmans shares
requoted on
the ASX.  There is no evidence to suggest that Blossoms provided a portfolio
and the plaintiff has conceded that Blossoms
did not do so.  However, it is not
known whether the parties conferred and if they did what was the outcome of
these negotiations.
 Although it is difficult to ascertain how the plaintiff
lost an opportunity set out in the agreement when Blossoms failed to provide
the portfolio, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff's claim is hopeless.
<P>

23  	By letter dated 1 February 1999 the defendant's solicitor
replied to the plaintiff's solicitor's letter of 22 January 1999
and said:
<P>

<b>"Your client's response to our request for further particulars does not
provide the particulars sought.  In particular, your client's
response to
paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 fails to establish any causal link between the alleged
delay and the alleged damage.  The alleged
damage is also not sufficiently
particularised.  CCW reserve our client's rights to make application to the
court in respect of these
deficiencies."</b>
<P>

24  	By letter dated 1 March 1999 the defendant's solicitor forwarded
a draft notice of motion to the plaintiff's solicitor.
<P>

25  	By letter dated 19 March 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to
the defendant's solicitor and said:
<P>

<b>"(i)	The negligence and breach of contract of the defendant is in not
advising the plaintiff of its rights pursuant to ASX Listing
Rule 3J(15) and
not pleading such rights in the plaintiff's favour.  Had the plaintiff had the
benefit of such pleading in the case
at first instance a decision from the
Federal Court or indeed a negotiated settlement with the ASX for re-quotation
of our client's
shares (which shares were requoted <u>after</u> the decision of
the Full Court) would have been achieved to allow our client to comply with the
conditions of the said Agreement
and, in particular the <u>time</u>
requirements;</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	See clause 6 of the Agreement and in particular, the requirement to
have the plaintiff's shares requoted by the ASX.</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	As stated in (I) above."</b>
<P>

26  	This restatement of the claim for damages does not overcome the
problem previously identified namely that in the Austvest agreement
the
plaintiff had 6 months from the investment to have quotation of shares relisted
on the ASX.  In the case of Blossoms, once the
investment portfolio was
provided by Blossoms (and it never was) the plaintiff had to use its best
endeavours to achieve a requotation.
 The plaintiff was never obliged to
achieve a quotation.
<P>

27  	By letter dated 11 May 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor stated:
<P>

<b>"The negligence/breach of contract claimed by our client caused the delay in
having the shares re-quoted and having the threat of
the delisting of the
company removed.  This delay was a direct cause of the proposed transaction for
the acquisition of the large
Hong Kong/China property portfolio not proceeding.
This has caused a financial loss to our client, which loss will be quantified
by expert accounting and actuarial evidence in the eventual hearing of this
matter."</b>
<P>

28  	It is not clear whether this is a further reference to the
Blossoms agreement.  However on 2 July 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor
wrote to
the defendant's solicitor and particularised a far more wide ranging claim for
damages and also disclosed that there had
been allegedly further discussions
between the parties to the Blossoms agreement.  It stated:
<P>

<b>"The plaintiff has suffered consequential losses in that its ability to
transact commercial activities was restricted during the period
when the
defendant was retained as its solicitor and also subsequently until the appeal
was determined by the full Federal Court.</b>
<P>

<b>As a result of the defendant's negligence pleaded in the Statement of Claim,
the plaintiff lost the opportunity to aquire (sic) interest
in commercial
property assets in Hong Kong and China and it lost the opportunity to be the
vehicle for a reverse take over or back
door ASX listing for Chinese property
groups.</b>
<P>

<b>The plaintiff company entered into an agreement with Blossoms Pty Limited
dated 28 March, 1994. The agreement was extended by the
parties from time to
time in discussions between Mr Ganke (for Chapmans Limited) and Ms Tina Liu
(for Blossoms Pty Limited) (and
further see copy letter Chapmans Limited to
Tina Liu dated 8 June, 1994) but was then terminated.</b>
<P>

<b>The plaintiff was unable to progress the arrangement with Blossoms Pty
Limited because it was unable to have its shares requoted on
the ASX.  If the
defendant has not been negligent in the conduct of the proceedings, the
plaintiff would have had an opportunity
to have its shares requoted at an early
time.  If its shares had been requoted at an early time, then the plaintiff
would have been
in a position to take up the opportunities open which then
existed, and it would have been able to conclude an arrangement with Blossoms
Pty Limited or to conclude a similar arrangement with some other commercial
property interests in China or elsewhere.</b>
<P>

<b>We confirm that there is no allegation that Blossoms Pty Limited provided
the portfolio of property interest.  The allegation made
by the plaintiff is
that it has lost an opportunity to conclude the agreement with Blossoms Pty
Limited or profit from some other
similar arrangement.  The plaintiff's case is
that it has lost a valuable chance.  For example, the negotiations with
Blossoms stalled
at the stage demonstrated in the written agreement.  If the
plaintiff's shares had been requoted or the threat of delisting removed
at an
early time then the plaintiff stood a real and substantial chance to conclude
the agreement.</b>
<P>

<b>The plaintiff intends to lead expert evidence at the hearing that:-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	It was cheaper and quicker for chinese commercial property interest to
utilise the plaintiff than to attempt conventual listing
on the ASX through an
initial public offering.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	It was an appropriate vehicle to enter into profitable transactions, if
its shares were requoted or the threat of delisting were
removed in 1994 and
1995.</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	There were other chinese or other commercial property interests actively
seeking such a vehicle in 1994 and 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

29  	The defendant has agreed to replead para 7(ii) in accordance
with its proposed amended statement of claim which was handed
up to the court.
It has also agreed to serve evidence relating to its claim for consequential
damage and for damages, and loss of
opportunity including expert evidence.  It
is my view that the proposed amended statement of claim does not adequately
plead the
plaintiff's claim for consequential loss and/or damages for loss of
opportunity.  The claim should be pleaded in such a way so as
to put the
defendant in a position so he knows the case he has to meet.  He needs to be
able to investigate the plaintiff's claim
for damages so he is not caught by
surprise at the trial, ie., he needs to investigate whether the Blossoms
agreement could have
been concluded and the like.  In the exercise of my
discretion, the plaintiff should be afforded a further opportunity to replead
its statement of claim as outlined above.  Additionally, the plaintiff is
directed to file and serve affidavit and expert evidence
it relies upon in
relation to its claim for consequential loss and/or loss of opportunity within
3 months. It is my view that the
appropriate order for costs is that costs be
costs in the cause. 
<P>

30  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The defendant's notice of motion filed 9 April 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to file a further amended statement of claim on or before
29 July 1999.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff is to file and serve affidavit and expert evidence it intends
to rely upon in relation to its claim for consequential
loss and/or loss of
opportunity on or before 15 October 1999.
<P>

(4)	Costs be costs in the cause.
