<b>			CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STATE</b>
<P>

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Dismissal of summons;  Summary judgment;</b>
<P>

<b>					Appeal;  Pay-roll tax)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 24 May 1999 the
defendant seeks that the plaintiff's summons filed 16 July 1997 be dismissed
pursuant
to Part 13 r 5 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  The defendant
relied on the affidavit of David Anthony Martin sworn 24 July 1999.  The
plaintiff did not rely on any affidavit
evidence.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff by summons filed 16 July 1997 seeks pursuant to s
32(8) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Pay-roll Tax Act</a></b> 1971 (the Act) to appeal the decision of
the defendant dated 17 March 1992 (the objection decision) whereby the
defendant disallowed
the plaintiff's objection (the objection) dated 9 November
1992 against the defendant's refusal to grant a refund of pay-roll tax
(the
refund) to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff seeks an order that the objection
decision be set aside and that the objection be allowed
and the refund made.
The grounds of appeal are set out in the summons and are:
<P>

(1)	Payments made by the plaintiff to persons who provide temporary assistance
to the plaintiff's clients are not wages for the
purposes of the Act.
<P>

(2)	The contractual arrangements between the plaintiff and persons who provide
temporary assistance to the plaintiff's clients do
not fall within paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c) of s 3A(1) of the Act.
<P>

(3)	Alternatively, if the contractual arrangements between the plaintiff and
persons who provide temporary assistance to the plaintiff's
clients fall within
paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of s 3A(1) of the Act (which is denied), then the
pay-roll tax assessed is excessive
in that it includes amounts paid to these
persons in circumstances where sub-paragraphs (e)(iii) of s 3A(1) of the Act
operate to
exclude liability in respect of such payments.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff is entitled to a refund of all, or part of the pay-roll tax
it has paid to the defendant.
<P>

3  	It is common ground that the appeal raises the issue of the
plaintiff's liability to pay pay-roll tax.  
<P>

4  	The following facts are not disputed.
<P>

(1)	The relevant business of Drake is to provide to its clients the temporary
services of people (temporaries) who have indicated
to Drake that their
services are available to be so provided.
<P>

(2)	On 30 June 1992 the plaintiff requested a refund of pay-roll tax totalling
$392,682.56 for the year ended 30 June 1992.  An
annual reconciliation to 30
June 1992 was furnished pursuant to s 13(1)(b) of the Act.
<P>

(3)	On 11 September 1992 the defendant wrote to Drake advising that its
application for refund had not been approved.
<P>

(4)	On 9 November 1992 a notice of objection was issued by the plaintiff.  The
notice asserted that the taxpayer is not an employer
of the contractors and
that the contractors are not employees of the taxpayer.  Hence the amounts paid
by the taxpayer to the contractors
do not constitute wages.  The plaintiff
asserted that it was entitled to a refund of the overpayments.  It is common
ground that
the grounds of objection raise the plaintiff's liability to pay
pay-roll tax.
<P>

(5)	On 9 March 1993 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff advising of its
intention to issue a s 18 assessment for unpaid pay-roll
tax for the financial
years ended 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992.
<P>

(6)	On 17 March 1993 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff advising that each
ground of objection had been disallowed and gave reasons
for doing so.
<P>

(7)	On 5 April 1993 an assessment notice pursuant to s 18 of the Act issued.
The notice of assessment sought payment of the sum
of $170,762.34 by 27 April
1993 (Ex A).
<P>

(8)	On 7 April 1993 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff advising that a s 18
assessment had been issued in respect of the period
June 1992.
<P>

(9)	On 7 April 1993 the plaintiff wrote to the defendant requesting approval to
appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision
on the objection.
<P>

(10)	Eventually on 10 June 1997 (over 4 years later) the plaintiff again wrote
to the defendant requesting approval to appeal to
the Supreme Court against the
decision.
<P>

(11)	On 4 July 1997 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff advising that approval
had been granted for the plaintiff to lodge an appeal
to the Supreme Court
pursuant to s 32(8) of the Act.
<P>

(12)	On 16 July 1992 the summons was filed.
<P>

(13)	On 24 May 1999 the motion was filed.
<P>

5  	Part 13 r 5 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules (SCR)</b> refers to
summary judgment.  It states:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to
the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for
relief in the
proceedings -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious;</b>
<P>

<b>	or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or
in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings."</b>
<P>

6  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to remind
himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway
Commissioners</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%2d49%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948-49) 78 CLR 62</a>, <b><u>General Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways</u> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> and <b><u>Webster &amp;
Anor v Lampard</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  I have reproduced some of the
passages quoted.
<P>

7  	In <b><u>General Steel</u></b> Barwick CJ, who heard the
application alone, referred to Dixon J's passage in <b><u>Dey</u></b> at p 130.
He then stated:
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

8  	Barwick CJ also said:
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense."</b>
<P>

9  	More recently in <b><u>Webster</u></b>, Mason CJ, Deane and
Dawson JJ reinforced the rigorous testing stating, at p 602:
<P>

<b>"The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with `exceptional
caution' and `should never be exercised unless it is clear
that there is no
real question to be tried."'</b>
<P>

10  	According to Rolfe AJA in <b><u>Zarb</u>:</b>
<P>

<b>"The demanding nature of the test is in no way lessened in circumstances
where there are the potential for difficult factual and legal
issues to arise.
Rather, as the decision in Webster made clear, it is heightened:  see also
Wickstead &amp; Ors v Browne  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1</a> and Esanda Finance Corporation
Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241."</a></b>
<P>

11  	The defendant submitted that the plaintiff's appeal is
incompetent for two reasons.  Firstly, it cannot be an appeal in accordance
with s 32(1)(a) because at the time the objection was lodged no assessment had
been made and secondly, the appeal cannot be brought
under s 32(1)(b) of the
Act because it permits an objection which relates to the amount of the
assessment only.  According to the
defendant, the objection cannot dispute the
underlying liability.  It is common ground that the grounds of objection and
the appeal
raised the issue of the plaintiff's liability to pay pay-roll tax.
The plaintiff submitted that although s 32(1)(a) refers to an
assessment it can
include a rejection of a refund where it is anticipated that an assessment will
follow.  The plaintiff also submitted
that s 32(1)(b) properly interpreted does
not limit the objection to a calculation of the mathematics but includes the
right to object
in relation to the underlying liability to pay pay-roll tax.
Both parties submitted that the explanatory note assists in their
interpretation
of s 32.
<P>

12  	In 1988 paragraph (b) was added to s 32.  Act No 221 of 1989
amended paragraph 32(b).  Prior to the 1989 amendment, s 32(b)
read that a
person who had paid tax and who was dissatisfied with a decision of the Chief
Commissioner with respect to the refunding
of the whole or any part of the
tax..."
<P>

13  	The <b>Stamp Duties (Further Amendment) Bill </b>1987 introduced
the current s 32.  The explanatory note states:
<P>

<b>"Division 1 contained a new section 32.  The proposed section replaces the
existing sections 32-34 with provisions that correspond
to the procedures
contained in section 124 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> for dealing with
objections to assessments of pay-roll tax and the stating of cases to the
Supreme Court."</b>
<P>

14  	The liability for pay-roll tax does not depend upon any
assessment of the Commissioner, but is imposed by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Pay-roll Tax Act</a></b>
on an employer in respect of wages (other than exempt wages) paid or payable by
him or her at the rate set out in the Act <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 6</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a>).  The forms of return
in evidence required the employer to state the wages paid, and the tax payable
at the rate set out in the
form. Every employer who is registered or required
to apply for registration in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a> is required to furnish
returns in the prescribed form, and to specify the taxable wages paid.  The
return and payment are to be forwarded
to the Chief Commissioner within 7 days
after the close of each month.  Adjustment for over and underpayments are made
within 21
days after the close of the month in each year <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 13(1)</a> and (2)).

<P>

15  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10</a> makes provision for wages not liable to pay-roll tax.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12</a> (dealing with registration of employers) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> (dealing with
returns from employers who are registered or required to be registered) do not
impose an obligation of registration
or of furnishing returns upon an employer
who pays no taxable wages;  but by s 15 the Commissioner may, by notice in
writing, call
upon any person to furnish him with such return as the
Commissioner requires.  Thus s 15 enables the Commissioner to obtain
information
from a person (whether an employer as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> or not)
relating to wages paid, whether or not the person claims the wages to be exempt
(see also s 16).  But there is no provision
enabling the employer to have a
determination made as to whether wages paid by him are exempt or taxable.  
<P>

16  	It is only when no tax, or less tax than is payable by law, is
paid within the period ending seven days after the month in
which taxable wages
are paid that any assessment and calculation is made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(1).</a>  The Chief
Commissioner may cause an assessment to be made of the amount upon which, in
his judgment, pay-roll tax or further tax
ought to be levied where any employer
fails or neglects duly to furnish any return as required, or the Chief
Commissioner is not
satisfied with the return made by any employer;  or has
reason to believe or suspect that any employer (though he may not have
furnished
any return) is liable to pay pay-roll tax <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 18(2)).</a>
<P>

17  	Section 19 provides that where the Chief Commissioner finds in
any case that tax has been overpaid, he may upon application
return to that
person the amount of tax found to be overpaid.  The Chief Commissioner may make
a refund without the necessity of
an application being made.
<P>

18  	The current <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Pay-roll Tax Act</a></b> 1971

<b>(b)	who has paid tax and who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Chief
Commissioner with respect to the amount of tax refunded

19,</b>
<P>

<b>may, within 60 days after the issue of the assessment or the making of the
decision. object to the assessment or decision by lodging,
at an office of the
Chief Commissioner, a statement in writing of the grounds of the
objection.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A person entitled to make an objection may, whether before or after the

considers to be reasonable.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Chief Commissioner shall consider any objection and may -</b>

<b>(a)	allow the objection wholly or in part and modify the assessment or alter

<b>(b)	disallow the objection and confirm the assessment or decision to which

<P>

<b>(4)	On making a decision on an objection, the Chief Commissioner shall

decision.</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	An objector dissatisfied with the decision of the Chief Commissioner on
an objection may request the Chief Commissioner to approve

<P>

<b>(6)	Such a request must be in writing and be lodged with the Chief

<P>

19  	The Commissioner shall consider the objection, and may either
disallow it, or allow it, either wholly or in part (s 32(3)).
<P>

20  	A person dissatisfied with a decision of the Commissioner on an
objection may within 30 days request the Chief Commissioner

that request, the person dissatisfied
with the decision can within the 60 days
provide any information the Chief Commissioner requests and lodge a notice in
writing requiring
him to comply with the request.  The Chief Commissioner must
comply with that request within 30 days.
<P>

21  	I turn to consider the parties submissions in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
32(1)</a> of the Act.  It is not necessary to resort to the explanatory note which
can be used as an aid to interpretation.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18</a> makes provision for the
Chief Commissioner to issue an assessment notice.  The objection was lodged on
9 November 1992 to the Chief
Commissioner's decision to deny the refund of

of the Chief Commissioner.  The time for lodging the objection is stipulated in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(1).</a>  The objection is to be lodged within 60 days from the date of the
assessment.  A notice of assessment issued on 5 April 1993.  No
objection was
lodged to that assessment.  The objection was made in relation to the
Commissioner's decision not to make a refund
under s 19.  It was not an
objection to the notice of assessment.  The plaintiff's claim pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
32(1)(a)</a> is hopeless.  It is my view that the words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(1)(a)</a> cannot be
construed to include a rejection of a refund where it is anticipated an
assessment will follow.  This argument is also
hopeless. 
<P>

22  	The issue in relation to the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(1)(b)</a> is
whether the objection can properly raise the issue of the liability to pay
pay-roll tax or such objection is it limited to only
the amount of tax
refunded.  
<P>

23  	On 30 June 1992 the plaintiff requested a refund of pay-roll tax
totalling $392,682.56.  On 11 September 1992 the Chief Commissioner
made a
decision that the application for refund was not approved.  On 9 November 1992
the plaintiff lodged a notice of objection
and disputed its liability to pay
pay-roll tax.  The objection was made in time.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 32(1)(b)</a> specifically
refers to the words "with respect to the amount of tax refunded".  The former <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
32(b)</a> referred to "refunding the whole or any part of the tax..."  It can be
argued that the current (32(1)(b) limits the amount of tax
objected to and does
not extend to the liability to pay the tax.
<P>

24  	The defendant referred to the decision of the Full Federal Court
of <b><u>Layala Enterprises Pty Limited (in Liq) v FC of T</u></b> 98 ATC 4858.
Cooper J in <b><u>Layala</u></b> referred to the decision of <b><u>Witney v
Commissioners of Inland Revenue</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1926%5d%20AC%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1926] AC 37</a> where Lord Dunedin with
whom Lord Carson agreed said at p 52:
<P>

<b>"My Lords, I shall now permit myself a general observation.  Once that it is
fixed that there is liability, it is antecedently highly
improbable that the
statute should not go to make that liability effective.  A statute is designed
to be workable, and the interpretation
thereof by a Court should be to secure
that object, unless crucial omission or clear direction makes that end
unattainable.  Now,
there are three stages in the imposition of a tax:  there
is the declaration of liability that is the part of the statute which
determines
what persons in respect of what property are liable.  Next, there is
the assessment.  That, ex hypothesi, has already been fixed.
 But assessment
particularizes the exact sum which a person liable has to pay.  Lastly, come
the methods of recovery, if the person
taxed does not voluntarily pay."</b>

His Honour said (at
280:)</b>
<P>

<b>`It was objected by the Commissioner that the board of review had no
jurisdiction to determine the objections raised in the present
case because
those objections were not merely objections to the amount or value upon which
the Commissioner had assessed sales tax
but were objections that sales tax was
not payable at all.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>The contention of the Commissioner is that only objections to `amount or
value' can be dealt with under these provisions, and that
an objection that no
tax at all is payable must be dealt with, if at all, in a proceeding for the
recovery of the tax.  In my opinion
this objection is not well founded.  A
contention that the Commissioner is seeking to tax a transaction which does not
involve any
dealing in `goods' within the meaning of the Act, or that the
alleged goods have no sale value within the meaning of the Act, is
a ground for
an objection to the amount or value upon which the Commissioner requires the
taxpayer to pay sale tax.  The objection
of the taxpayer is that there is no
amount or value upon which he is bound to pay tax, that is, that the alleged
amount or value
should, for the reasons relied upon by him, be reduced to
nil.'</b>
<P>

<b>In the view I take of it, "overpayment" is not confined to a situation where
some tax is payable but more than that sum has been paid,
but can encompass the
situation where no tax is payable, with the consequence that the entirety of
that which has been paid is an
overpayment.</b>
<P>

<b>Notwithstanding my view as to what constitutes an "overpayment", s 26 has no
application in the present circumstances because, in
my opinion, payments made
by SPASA pursuant to the agreement were not "taxes" within s 26."</b>
<P>

27  	In <b><u>Chippendale</u></b>, the issue was whether the
statutory regimes comprised an exhaustive and exclusive code as to the
circumstances and conditions under
which a claimant can recover an overpayment
of sales tax or whether, alternatively a co-existence with the statutory right
and procedures
there is a general right to a refund under the general law.  In
examining the <b>Sales Tax Amendment Act (No 1)</b> 1930, s 26 stated that
where the Chief Commissioner finds in any case that tax has been overpaid by a
person he or she shall refund
the amount of any tax overpaid.  Tamberlin J
stated:
<P>

<b>"As the question as to the existence of an exclusive code is one of
statutory construction it is not appropriate, in my view, to approach
the
matter on the basis that the legislation constitutes an exhaustive code at
least in some overpayment situations, but not necessarily
in others.  Section
26(1) simply refers to tax which has been `overpaid'.  There are no words which
limit the Commissioner's duty
to any particular type of overpayment or any
particular circumstances of overpayment.  This consideration is, in my view,
central
to the resolution of the questions posed.</b>
<P>

<b>In my opinion, s 26(1) gives a right in all situations in which sales tax
has been overpaid.  Overpayment means the payment of a greater
amount of tax
than was lawfully payable.  The subsection does not focus on the <i>reasons</i>
which give rise to the overpayment, but rather on the circumstance that there
has been in <i>fact</i> an overpayment, of tax.  If one adopts a literal or
natural reading of the words use, free from authority, s 26 would operate
immediately
there has been an overpayment found by the Commissioner.  The
reason, ground or form of the overpayment is irrelevant.  Accordingly,
it is
appropriate, as a matter of statutory construction, to consider whether the
legislation in each period excludes <i>all</i> overpayments and not just
whether it excludes one or more classes of overpayment.  To carry out the
statutory construction exercise
involved in deciding whether there is an
exhaustive and exclusive code properly it is relevant to consider whether all
overpayments
are covered by the legislation and not just one or more specific
types of overpayment.</b>
<P>

<b>As his Honour points out the words "in any case" in s 26(1) support the
conclusion that the statutory right is to be given a wide
reading.  In other
words, it is directed to overpayment made <i>in any case</i> or <i>in every
case</i> where there has been a greater amount paid than that which is legally
due, regardless of the circumstances leading to or the nature
of the
overpayment."</b>
<P>

28  	and Lehane J stated:
<P>

<b>It will be noticed that whereas the old legislation does not define
"overpayment of tax", Table 3 tells us, for the purposes of the
new
legislation, that "tax overpaid" refers to the fact that the "claimant has paid
an amount as tax that was not legally payable".
 Lindgren J held, and I agree,
that the new statutory definition expresses equally what the old legislation
meant by the term "overpayment".
 It may be noted that it includes both a
payment exceeding an amount of tax actually due and a payment made, as tax,
where no amount
of tax was actually due:  <i>Precision Pools Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Taxation  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20FCR%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) FCR 554</a> at 563:  cf </i>Jax Tyres Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Taxation<i> (Cth)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20329" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 329</a> at 334."</i></b>
<P>

29  	Section 32(1)(b) simply refers to "the amount of tax refunded".
While the wording in s 32(1)(b) differs from s 26(1) of the
<b>Sales Tax
</b>
<P>

<b>Amendment Act (No 1)</b> 1930, it is my view that it is arguable that it
could be interpreted to mean an amount of tax which has been refunded. The
amount
could be the whole amount.
<P>

30  	It can be argued that s 32(1)(b) is directed to an amount paid
which is greater than that which is legally due regardless of
the circumstances
leading to or the nature of the overpayment.  Further, the plaintiff argued a
similar case in the Supreme Court
of Victoria in <b><u>Drake Personnel Limited
&amp; Ors v Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic)</u></b> 98 ATC 4915.  The
plaintiff was unsuccessful in seeking a refund of pay-roll tax because one
claim was held to be statute barred
and the other claim failed because s 32 of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Pay-roll Tax Act</a></b> 1971 (Vic) did not confer on a tax payer a right to
object to a decision refusing a refund of pay-roll tax paid.  There was no
decision
or assessment of determination made by the Commissioner.  Thus there
was no right to lodge an objection.  The matters were fully
argued in the
Supreme Court of Victoria.  There are different facts and circumstances in this
present case.  It is my view that the
plaintiff should be afforded an
opportunity to fully argue it on its merits.  Accordingly, it is not
appropriate that the appeal
be summarily dismissed.  The plaintiff should have
the opportunity to argue the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(1)(b)</a> on its merits.  I dismiss
the notice of motion.
<P>

31  	The plaintiff sought costs on an indemnity basis and that those
costs be payable forthwith.  Costs are discretionary.  Costs
should follow the
event.  There are no special circumstances that warrant the making of orders
that costs be payable on an indemnity
basis nor that they be payable forthwith.
The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

32  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The defendant's notice of motion filed 24 May 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
