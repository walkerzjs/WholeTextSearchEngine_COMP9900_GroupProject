<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before me an application made by way of
Notice of Motion filed by the defendant, Karsten Light, on 11 December
1998.
By that Notice of Motion the defendant (who has acted for himself in respect to
the filing of that and associated documents
and who has appeared in person
before me at today's hearing), seeks an order that the proceedings be
transferred to the District
Court of New South Wales sitting in Sydney or, in
the alternative, that the proceedings be transferred to the District Court of
New
South Wales sitting at Lismore.
<P>

2		The proceedings were brought by the plaintiff, Hannelore Margarete
Kesselbacher in the Local Court at Lismore.  They were subsequently
transferred
to the Local Court at Mullumbimby.  Those proceedings seek orders for relief
under the<i> De Facto Relationships Act</i> 1984.
<P>

3		On 11 December 1997 the Local Court at Mullumbimby ordered that the
proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court.  The matter
has been mentioned
before the Registrar on various occasions since that date.
<P>

4		On 26 October 1998 the Registrar stood the matter into the Master's List.
It presently remains in the Master's List and in due
course should come up for
call-over in about May or June of this year.  If so, it is likely that it would
be heard two months later,
that is, in about July or August of this year.
<P>

5		The basis upon which the defendant seeks that the proceedings be transferred
to the District Court at Lismore is that both parties
reside at Ocean Shores,
which falls within the area with which the District Court sitting at Lismore
normally deals, and the property
which is the subject of the substantive
proceedings is also located in that area. 
<P>

6		I would here interpolate that it would appear that each of the plaintiff and
the defendant currently resides in that subject
property, one party residing in
the upper section thereof and the other party residing in the lower section
there.  It also would
appear that there are practical problems associated with
the fact that the two parties reside in the subject property. Despite there
not
having been, as I have been informed, any contact at the present time, there
have apparently in the past been incidents which
have given rise to apprehended
violence orders being sought --- and possibly indeed having been made --- at
the instance of each
of the two parties. 
<P>

7		Further, it would appear that most, if not all, of the witnesses who will be
giving evidence in the proceeding reside in the
Lismore area.  
<P>

8		There appears to be no dispute between the parties in relation to the value
of the subject property, or that the nature of any
order which might be made
under the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i> falls within the monetary
jurisdiction of the District Court of New South Wales.
<P>

9		There has been placed before me in the present application an affidavit by
Andrew Nicholas Sochacki sworn 5 February 1999.  He
is the solicitor for the
plaintiff.  Mr Sochacki, who has been a legal practitioner for some twenty
years, says in his affidavit
that in his experience the matter would be heard
more quickly in the Supreme Court rather than in the District Court at Lismore.
Further, that he has made enquiries of the Registry of the District Court in
Lismore and has been advised that the matter will be
delayed for a further
twelve months should it be transferred to that court.  He also said that he had
experience of matters being
transferred from one court to another and that, in
his opinion, if the matter is transferred to the District Court at Sydney,
there
would be what he described as unnecessary delay.
<P>

10		It is desirable for all parties that the matter should be brought on for
hearing as soon as possible.  
<P>

11		The plaintiff wishes the matter to remain in the Supreme Court and opposes
an application that it be transferred to the District
Court, be it the District
Court sitting at Lismore or the District Court sitting at Sydney.
<P>

12		The evidence of Mr Sochacki, that if the matter is transferred to the
District court at Lismore, it will not come on for hearing
for twelve months
persuades me that I should not transfer the proceedings to Lismore, although I
do recognise that all the witnesses
reside, and the subject property is
located, in the Lismore area.
<P>

13		As to the proposal that the proceedings be transferred to the District
Court in Sydney, there is no evidence which assists me
one way or the other as
to whether that transfer will result in the matter coming on for hearing sooner
than it would come on for
hearing if it remained in the Supreme Court.
<P>

14		According to what I have been told by Ms Manuell of Counsel, for the
plaintiff, speaking from the Bar table, there would appear
to be no very great
advantage to the parties concerning costs between having the proceedings heard
in the Supreme Court and having
them heard in the District Court at Sydney.
<P>

15		In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that I should make an order
transferring the hearing from the Supreme Court to
the District Court either at
Lismore or in Sydney.
<P>

16		Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the present application.
<P>

17		(submissions as to costs)
<P>

18	<b>MASTER</b>:  I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the Notice of Motion filed by the 		defendant on 11 December
1998 be dismissed.
<P>

	2.	I order that the costs of the aforesaid Notice of 	Motion be costs in the
proceedings.
<P>

<P>
