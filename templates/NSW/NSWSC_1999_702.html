<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>12 July 1999</b>
<P>

1   	There are some unusual aspects to the orders I have earlier
made and what follows are brief reasons for them. The company Martco
Engineering Pty Limited has had an unhappy history, having spent some
two-third's of its life under the financial equivalent by way
of
administration, of a life support system. It seeks further time to rehabilitate
itself under a new Deed of Company Arrangement
("DCA").
<P>

2   	The application presently before me is a Summons by the
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation that the company be now wound-up, with
special
leave sought as the company is still under administration. Such application is
essentially based upon a statutory demand
in turn reflecting substantial tax
owing from the period of administration.
<P>

3   	Initially that application was opposed. That opposition was
not pressed. That was not surprising in view of the fact that the
company has
been under administration since 1996 under a Deed of Company Arrangement which
was to pay 100 cents in the dollar to
creditors over fourteen months but now
will pay at best 50 cents. It now transpires that despite the opportunity so to
trade out
of its difficulties, the company's position has in fact worsened with
further debts to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation leading
it to conclude
that there should be no further administration but a beneficial winding-up.
<P>

4   	The Company through the Administrator, on the other hand,
sought originally that it should continue to trade under a new deed
of company
administration with the same administrator, notwithstanding the opposition of
the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. That
opposition in voting terms meant that
the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation alone would outweigh in the terms of value
of debts the
votes of all other creditors were they unanimously to vote for the
new DCA. In fact, it appears that two other significant creditors
at present
would also have voted against the DCA. On the other hand, a majority in number
of creditors would have voted for the DCA.
In all the circumstances, whilst
drawing my attention to the legal position that would result if such a vote
were to take place,
the Administrator has accepted that liquidation is the
appropriate course. Though against the reservations of the Deputy Commissioner
of Taxation in view of the past post-administration failures in relation to
taxation, I have concurred in the Administrator now become
liquidator. That is
on the strict basis that the former Administrator Mr Fiorentino will act
impartially as between creditors and
on the basis that his responsibility is
not to the former directors and his own interests in respect of any debt owed
from the administration
is not to enjoy any preference save that allowed by the
<i>Corporations Law</i> itself. That should produce some cost savings compared
to someone new taking over.
<P>

5   	The feature which leads me to set out reasons is the
potential voting position as it results from Regulations 5.6.21 under
the
<i>Corporations Law</i> which I first quote below so far as relevant:
<P>

<b>5.6.21(2)  [Required majority]</b>  A resolution is carried if:
<P>

(a)	a majority of the creditors voting (whether in person, by attorney or by
proxy) vote in favour of the resolution; and
<P>

(b)	the value of the debts owed by the corporation to those voting in favour of
the resolution is more than half the total debts
owed to all the creditors
voting (whether in person, by proxy or by attorney).
<P>

<b>5.6.21(3)  [Majority vote against resolution]</b>  A resolution is not
carried if:
<P>

(a)	a majority of creditors voting (whether in person, by proxy or by attorney)
vote against the resolution; and
<P>

(b)	the value of the debts owed by the corporation to those voting against the
resolution is more than half the total debts owed
to all creditors voting
(whether in person, by proxy or by attorney).
<P>

<b>5.6.21(4)  [Casting vote]</b>  If no result is reached under subregulation
(2) or (3), then:
<P>

(a)	the person presiding at the meeting may exercise a casting vote in favour
of the resolution, in which case the resolution is
carried; or
<P>

(b)	the person presiding at the meeting may exercise a casting vote against the
resolution, in which case the resolution is not
carried."
<P>

6   	I also quote below what is stated in the Explanatory
Statement to the <i>Corporations Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rule
</i>1993, No. 135, para 95:
<P>

"The term `casting vote' thus has a broader meaning in this context than is
usual and will allow the chairperson to effectively
decide between the
interests of the creditors with the preponderance in numbers and the interests
of the creditors with the preponderance
in value. It is envisaged that the
exercise of such a casting vote would be most appropriate in circumstances
where:
<P>

(a)	the creditors with a majority in value have such an overwhelming interest
that it is inappropriate to allow a majority in number,
who do not have the
same monetary interest, to carry the day, or vice versa; or
<P>

(b)	the inability to arrive at any decision, because of continuing deadlocks,
affects the welfare of the company concerned."
<P>

7   	What is apparent from a close reading of the Regulation in
relation to the casting vote, borne out by the Explanatory Statement,
is this.
If the effect of the poll is that only one of the two conditions for the
resolution being carried is fulfilled, this is
deemed to be a situation where
"no result is reached". That in turn gives rise to the administrator having the
discretion to exercise
a casting vote, though any creditor may apply to the
court for a review of such outcome and appropriate orders; see <i>Re Bartlett
Researched Securities Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACSR%20707" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACSR 707.</a>
<P>

8   	This means that instead of such a voting result
representing a vote against, as would ordinarily be expected, it is to be taken
as a situation akin to deadlock where casting votes are not infrequently
allowed. However, it does not follow that the Court would
automatically accept
the exercise of such a casting vote as appropriate. This will be depend on
factors such as whether the administrator
has properly exercised the casting
vote in the interests of creditors as a whole, such as in circumstances where
the vote or votes
which prevent one of the two conditions being fulfilled would
represent an outcome unfair to the remaining creditors if not reversed
by a
casting vote. I should add that the present circumstances appear far from that.
There is nothing in the apparent interests of
the Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation, which would lead to it having fundamentally divergent interests from
other creditors. That is
evidenced by the fact that two other significant trade
creditors evidently share the same view that the Company should be wound up.
