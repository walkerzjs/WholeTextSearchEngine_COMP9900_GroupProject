<b>1712/99	DAVID KEITH GORDON MILNE v PETER VIVIAN BENJAFIELD</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These proceedings concern the dissolution of a partnership which conducted a
solicitors' practice.  There were 2 partners in the
practice.  One is the
plaintiff and one is the defendant.  It is common ground that the partnership
was dissolved on 30 November
1998.  The reason why some time has passed before
the present application for the appointment of a receiver has been brought
before
the Court is that discussions have been taking place in an attempt to
resolve the matter without outside intervention, but ultimately
they have
failed.  However, the negotiations were successful in at least one regard, in
that the files have been divided between
the solicitors and each is continuing
to conduct a practice on his own account.  Furthermore, after discussions, an
order will be
made by consent for the appointment of a receiver.  After further
discussions suggested by me, orders will also be made by consent
as to the
disbursement of funds received by the plaintiff and the defendant after 30
November 1998, of which some part at least may
belong to the old partnership,
rather than to the new practices which have been set up.
<P>

2	The only matter which has been contested so as to require the decision of the
Court is the identity of the receiver.  The defendant
has put forward as
receiver David John Lombe, chartered accountant and partner at Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, chartered accountants.
 Mr Lombe is an "A" list liquidator.  It has
been stated and not disputed that he has considerable experience in the
receivership
of solicitors' practices.  Mr Lombe has deposed that he has no
professional knowledge of or relationship with the dissolved partnership
or its
partners.  Mr Harrowell, solicitor for the defendant, frankly states to the
Court that he is acquainted with Mr Lombe and
that Mr Lombe has in the past
done and probably is at present doing work for or in association with the
defendant's solicitors' firm.
 That firm, Hunt &amp; Hunt, is a well-known,
medium sized firm of solicitors in this town and has a considerable practice in
insolvency
matters, and Mr Harrowell is the partner in charge of that section
of the firm.  In that role he is acquainted with most of the "A"
list
liquidators.  The opposition to Mr Lombe's appointment arises from his
acquaintance with Mr Harrowell.  It is said that a receiver
must be impartial
and appear to be impartial, and that acquaintance with the solicitor of one of
the parties, either generally or
certainly, in this instance, destroys the
necessary appearance of impartiality.  In saying that, Mr Cowan, of counsel for
the plaintiff,
very properly eschews any suggestion other than that Mr
Harrowell and Mr Lombe are honourable professional men of good standing.
<P>

3	Certainly it has traditionally been said that "a receiver appointed in an
action should, as a general rule, be a person wholly
disinterested in the
subject matter":  see <i>Kerr on Receivers</i> (17th Ed, 1989) 104.  The
position of a court appointed receiver is that, by his appointment, he acts in
the role of an officer of
the court, much as does a court appointed liquidator.
There has been a deal of discussion of recent years of the requirements of
liquidators as to independence and impartiality.  In short, it has been said
that it is important that a liquidator should be independent
and should be seen
to be independent:  per Bowen CJ in Eq in <b>Re Stewden Nominees No 4 Pty
Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%201%20ACLR%20185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 1 ACLR 185</a> at 187.  There was further discussion of this
proposition by Olsson J in the Supreme Court of South Australia in <b>Re
Dunquil Pty Limited (in liq)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%209%20ACLR%20950" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 9 ACLR 950</a> and in this Court in
<b>Advance Housing Pty Limited (in liq) v Classic Developments Pty Limited
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2014%20ACSR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 14 ACSR 23</a> by Santow J, in whose judgment there is a useful
collection of the recent authorities.  Further reference to the matter has been
made by Young J in <b>Re Biposo Pty Ltd; Condon v Rodgers</b> (1995) 120 FLR
339 at 405-6 and by myself in <b>Ungar v Haddonstone Pty Limited</b>, 22
December 1998, unreported.
<P>

4	The rival for appointment suggested by the plaintiff is a Mr Lee.  He has
been selected by the plaintiff on the basis that he
is the only "A" list
liquidator whom Mr Harrowell asserts that he believes he is not acquainted
with, nor has his firm ever employed.
 He is unable, however, in view of the
extensive nature of the firm's insolvency practice to give categorical
assurance that he has
never had any dealing with Mr Lee.  Nobody knows of Mr
Lee's experience or particular expertise in any particular field.  It is not
known and is not put forward that he has any experience in the affairs of
solicitors' firms.  It is said by Mr Cowan for the plaintiff
that this is of no
matter, because, from an accounting point of view, the affairs of solicitors'
firms, particularly of a small firm
such as that under investigation, are so
uncomplicated that any competent accountant, as an "A" list liquidator must be,
can easily
deal with the accounting matters involved.  In my view the matter is
not as simple as that.  It is plain from the discussion that
has taken place in
Court that this is a matter in which what may be required is the dissection of
moneys coming in as between the
entitlement to them of the old partnership and
of the new practices.  In my view, considerable experience in dealing with
solicitors'
practices and the way in which they are conducted may be of great
assistance in dealing with questions such as these, so that the
receiver's work
may be more speedily, easily and cheaply carried out.
<P>

5	I fully accept the importance of the principle of independence and the
appearance of independence as discussed in the references
set out above.
However, I am unable to see that there is any real loss of the appearance of
independence simply through the acquaintance,
almost inevitable in a sense,
between a partner of a large accounting firm sought to be appointed to a
specialised receivership such
as the present and a partner of a city firm of
solicitors which has a large insolvency and receivership practice.  I cannot
see that
there is a valid objection to the appointment of Mr Lombe on that
ground.  The only other candidate is Mr Lee, and I think that the
appointment
of Mr Lombe is distinctly preferable upon the ground of his established
experience in the particular subject matter of
this receivership.
<P>

6	In those circumstances I appoint Mr Lombe to the receivership of the firm the
subject of the proceedings.  I stand the matter
over to 10 am tomorrow before
me.
