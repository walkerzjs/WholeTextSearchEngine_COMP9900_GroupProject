<b>1746/99	GEORGE THOMAS SHAW v OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

1	Mr Thomas Shaw, on behalf of the plaintiff, has applied for me to disqualify
myself as being apparently biased by reason of the
fact that I have earlier
ruled upon the validity of a different caveat but in similar terms which had
been lodged by his mother.
 The relevant judgments, as I apprehend it, were
delivered by me on 21 December 1998.  Those judgments did not turn on any
personal
considerations relative to any member of the Shaw family, nor was
there any contested evidence in those proceedings on which it was
necessary for
me to come to a determination, much less any question of fact which I had to
determine by reference to any issue of
credit.  They turned on the legal
question as to whether the caveat showed a caveatable interest.  In those
circumstances, it seems
to me that it could not appear to a properly informed
and objective bystander that there was any fear that I was biased in the sense
in which that term is understood in the law relating to judicial bias and I
decline to discharge myself from the proceedings.
<P>
