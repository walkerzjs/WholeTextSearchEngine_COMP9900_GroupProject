JUDGMENT: 
<P>

<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>TUESDAY 25 MAY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1206/99 - MINPROC LTD &amp; ANOR V KILLINGER &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>  This is an application to cross-vest proceedings which
are currently pending in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South
Wales
to this Court and then on to the Supreme Court of Western Australia.
<P>

2	The facts and parties in the various proceedings are more complicated than
these reasons would suggest, but essentially the dispute
is between Mr
Killinger and the first plaintiff.  Mr Killinger at one stage was a chief
executive officer of the first plaintiff
and the dispute arose out of his
activities with the first  plaintiff under and after a service agreement, which
was entered into
on 24 November 1993.
<P>

3	Chronologically, the first piece of litigation was proceedings Civil 2279/97
in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, in which
the present first plaintiff
was the plaintiff, Mr Killinger was the first defendant and three other persons
were also named as defendants.
 Later a fifth defendant was added.
<P>

4	The Western Australian proceedings were commenced by writ on 28 November
1997.  The plaintiff in due course filed a statement
of claim, the latest
version appearing to be on 27 March 1998. The plaintiff claimed damages against
the defendants, it would appear,
basically for breach of duty to exercise
reasonable care and skill in and about the tasks that they were supposed to do
under their
service agreement.
<P>

5	On 19 November 1998 Mr Killinger, together with a company controlled by him,
Killinger Consultants Pty Ltd, commenced proceedings
in the Industrial
Relations Commission of New South Wales in Court Session against the first
plaintiff and one Peter W Anderton for
orders declaring void in whole or in
part or varying the service agreement, and contracts after the service
agreement as being unfair
contracts.
<P>

6	The present first plaintiff challenged the jurisdiction of the Industrial
Relations Commission, but that application was dismissed
and in giving her
reasons on 12 May 1999 Kavanagh J held that Mr Killinger had performed work in
an industry in and of New South
Wales sufficient to ground jurisdiction of the
New South Wales Industrial Commission to hear the application.  She dismissed
the
first plaintiff's motion with costs and ordered that the claim be referred
for conciliation and, if that fails, for hearing.
<P>

7	The service agreement, which is exhibit PX10 before me, expressly provided
that it was subject to the laws prevailing in Western
Australia and that the
parties agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of that
State.  That matter was drawn
to Kavanagh J's attention.  She said of it two
things:  (a) (page 6 in the judgment) "this fact does not, standing alone,
extinguish
the jurisdiction of New South Wales Courts";  and (b) (judgment page
15):
<P>

 "The service given by Mr Killinger between 1985 and 1991 was not bound by the
1993 contract ... .   Most of Mr Killinger's service
was not bound by this
contract, that is, the service he gave before 1991 and after 1996."
<P>

8	The only question before Kavanagh J was whether the Industrial Relations
Commission had jurisdiction and she held that it did.
<P>

9	The question that I have to deal with in this application is whether it is in
the interests of justice that the application under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial
Relations Act 1996</a> stay with the Industrial Relations Commission in New South
Wales, to be heard as a separate matter, or whether it should be transferred
into this Court so that it can be in turn transferred to the Supreme Court of
Western Australia to be heard with the matters that
are already pending in that
Court.
<P>

10	An initial problem is that there is to be found in the Industrial Relations
legislation the flavour that the Commission is the
sole court that should
consider applications of this nature.
<P>

11	This problem has been considered by this Court on previous occasions.  There
are two tranches of cases, the first dealing with
whether this Court could
grant an injunction to protect people pending an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a>, the second as to whether such application could be
transferred into this Court, usually with a view to being transferred to the
Federal Court, which could exercise similar jurisdiction under provisions of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>.  After some hesitation, this Court decided that
there was jurisdiction to do that despite the general flavour of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial
Relations Act</a>;  see<b> Winron Pty Ltd v Shell Company of Australia Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2066%20IR%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 66 IR 64</a> and<b> Bruning v Kingmill (Australia) Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44
NSWLR 180</a>, 182.  The profession really should assume that the decision in<b>
Bruning</b> is this Division's last word on the matter until the Court of
Appeal determines otherwise.
<P>

12	Mr Dixon in his well reasoned submissions for the defendants said that I
should not follow that line of territory and referred
to an earlier decision of
McLelland CJ in Eq in<b> Wood v Boral Resources (NSW) Pty Ltd </b>- 28 October
1993.  I merely record that submission and follow<b> Bruning's</b>
<b>case</b>.
<P>

13	The next problem is whether it is in the interests of justice that the
matter remain where it is or be transferred to Western
Australia.
<P>

14	As in all cases of this sort there are factors that go both ways.  The
factors in favour of going to Western Australia are that
the court there can
deal with all issues at one and the same time and both the principal opponents
are involved in both sets of proceedings.
<P>

15	Secondly, if proceedings are to be dealt with separately in New South Wales
and Western Australia involving overlapping issues
there is a danger that there
will be inconsistent findings or the creation of estoppels, which will make the
Western Australian proceedings
even more complex than they presently are.
<P>

16	Thirdly, the proceedings were commenced first in Western Australia.  There
is a strong connection with Western  Australia because
the principal service
agreement elected to have Western Australian courts the exclusive forum, yet
the New South Wales proceedings
were instituted well after the Western
Australian proceedings.
<P>

17	On the other side the New South Wales jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> is a peculiar
jurisdiction to New South Wales.  The general flavour of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial
Relations Act</a> is apart from cross-vesting matters those applications are to be
dealt with in the Industrial Relations Commission.  The Commission
has
developed expertise in the matters and has knowledge of what is fair in the
various industries from its activities generally,
and so has a yardstick from
which to measure whether a contract is unfair within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s105.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 105</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a>.  Moreover, the parties to the two sets of
proceedings are different.
<P>

18	Another factor that was raised by Mr Dixon was that the power of the
Industrial Relations Commission is arbitral rather than
judicial and that the
decision-making process involved playing havoc with the classic principles of
contract (<b>Port Macquarie Golf Club Ltd v Stead</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2064%20IR%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 64 IR 53</a>, 59) in
not following the "traditional" contractual principles and making decisions
according to equity and good conscience <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s163.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 163(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations
Act 1996</a>).
<P>

19	There was considerable debate on this last submission. Mr Dixon referred to
the decision of the Court of Appeal in <b>Minister for Youth and Community
Services v Health and Research Employees' Association of Australia, NSW
Branch</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 543</a>, particularly the judgment of McHugh JA at
559-561.  His Honour at 559-60 pointed out that there were strong indications
that the
jurisdiction of the Commission was arbitral not judicial because the
relevant union could invoke the jurisdiction, thus a stranger
to the contract
could obtain an order that a contract was void, the Commission could vary a
contract, independently of the circumstances
which existed at the time of its
making, and could vary a contract with reference to a worker, notwithstanding
that the worker was
not the person who made the contract.
<P>

20	Mr Foster QC, who appeared with Mr J Murphy for the plaintiffs, put that the
case in which McHugh JA gave judgment was decided
before the 1996 Act made it
fairly clear that the Industrial Relations Commission had to deal with these
matters as judicial rather
than arbitral matters.  He pointed out that the Act
required that these matters be dealt with by the Commission in Court Session,
that meant that a judge had to exercise the powers of the Commission under s
151;  that the Commission in Court Session was a court
of record under s 152(1)
and that under s 163(2) the rules of evidence and other formal procedures of a
superior court of record
applied.
<P>

21	Mr Dixon said, first of all, that the factors mentioned by McHugh JA still
showed that the matter was arbitral and, secondly,
the proper construction of s
163 was that even in Court Session in this sort of matter the Industrial
Relations Commission had to
act according to equity, good conscience and the
substantial merits of the case without regard to technicality or legal form.
<P>

22	With respect, this last submission is not correct.  It is not uncommon to
require courts, particularly inferior courts, to be
both courts and act in
accordance with good conscience, but that has been held to mean that the court
must still be bound by the
laws of evidence and by the law of the land;  see
eg<b> Ex parte Herman;  Re Mathieson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2078%20WN%20%28NSW%29%206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 78 WN (NSW) 6.</a>
<P>

23	However, the first point still holds good.  It may be that the matter is one
where the Commission is exercising arbitral powers,
but has to do its
fact-finding in a judicial way.
<P>

24	There seem then to be three possible situations, all of which point toward
transferring this case to Western Australia.  First,
if the proceedings before
the Industrial Relations Commission are  judicial proceedings then they can
just as easily be heard in
Western Australia as in New South Wales.  Secondly,
if they are  arbitral proceedings there must be very great doubt as to how far
the decision of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission can affect
non parties or can affect the assets of the parties
outside New South Wales.

<P>

25	There is certainly jurisdiction in the New South Wales Industrial Relations
Commission, as Kavanagh J has found, but that is
quite a different thing to how
far the decision can be enforced and what is its effect outside New South
Wales.  One needs to analyse
very closely whether the proceedings are judicial
proceedings or not; see <b>EMG v Guardianship and Administration Board of
Victoria </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/501.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 501.</a>
<P>

26	The third possibility is that the proceedings are arbitral proceedings to be
dealt with in a judicial manner, in which case the
defendants get the worst of
both worlds.
<P>

27	Accordingly, it is unnecessary to determine this point finally, save to say
that whichever way it is dealt with it tends toward
proceedings in Western
Australia rather than New South Wales.
<P>

28	I must confess that I commenced the day thinking that it would be better to
have the proceedings heard separately because I was
particularly concerned that
the defendants would be involved in very complicated proceedings in Western
Australia on a whole number
of issues, which many issues could be avoided if
there was a determination in New South Wales.  I am also concerned that in
States
which do not have very many Supreme Court judges it is difficult to hear
cases in the long matters list without delay.
<P>

29	However, they are not the only matters to take into account.  The problem of
issue estoppels being created in New South Wales,
if the matter here is heard
first, is a very real one.  Even if the decision is that of an arbitral
tribunal, it could still have
issue estoppel ramifications.
<P>

30	The possible delays in Western Australia can be dealt with to a degree by
all parties keeping strictly to the timetable. The
major factors are, it seems
to me, the fact that the Western Australian matter was started first; the whole
of the proceedings can
be dealt with in Western Australia; they involve
overlapping issues and the problem of the consequences that might flow to non
parties
outside New South Wales of the New South Wales Industrial Relations
Commission dealing with part of this dispute, lead to the view
that it is in
the interests of justice that the orders sought by the plaintiffs should be
made.
<P>

31	Kavanagh J did order that these matters should go to  conciliation.  I think
that that is appropriate because it may be, though
I very much doubt, that the
matters can be resolved by conciliation.  I am told that that might take three
months.  Accordingly,
I will make the order in the summons, but order that it
not be entered until 25 August 1999, or other order of the court, so that
the
conciliation process can take place.  It may be, however, that when both
parties direct their minds to the delay they may wish
me to delete that.
<P>

32	Accordingly, I make orders 1, 2 and 3 in the summons.  I direct that these
orders not be taken out until 25 August 1999 or such
other date as the court
may order.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

                                         oOo
