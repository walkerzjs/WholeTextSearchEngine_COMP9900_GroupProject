<b>TUESDAY 30 MARCH 1999 </b>
<P>

<b>50213/97  	AUSTRALIS MEDIA HOLDINGS PTY LTD &amp; ANOR  v  TELSTRA
CORPORATION LIMITED &amp; ANOR </b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	By the amended summons, Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd (Receivers and
Managers Appointed) (Australis) and Galaxy Network International
Pty Ltd
(Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Galaxy), claimed damages for breach of
contract in writing, being Heads of Agreement
dated 9 March 1995 between
Australis, Galaxy, Telstra Corporation Ltd (Telstra), The News Corporation Ltd
(News) and a joint venture,
TNC, formed by Telstra and News (the heads of
agreement).  
<P>

2	Under the heads of agreement, Australis warranted to procure the grant by
Galaxy of exclusive cable rights of distribution of
Galaxy's programme channels
through the TNC network feeding home entertainment subscription television
broadcasting services by cable.
 Telstra warranted that it had commenced the
requisite cable roll-out for TNC at the time of entry into the heads of
agreement and
further warranted that it would retain ownership and control of
the cable, and would not permit third party rights to be created
which were
inconsistent with the heads of agreement.  
<P>

3	TNC covenanted that it would ensure that the cable had passed a designated
number of homes and premises and by a sequence of dates
as follows:
<P>

"6.3	TNC shall ensure that the TNC Network has passed the following number of
homes and other premises (as the expression "homes
passed" is commonly
understood in the Australian telecommunications industry) by the following
dates:
<P>

Date				Number (Cumulative)
<P>

1 July 1995				     50,000
<P>

31 December 1995			   500,000
<P>

31 December 1996			1,000,000
<P>

31 December 1997			1,500,000
<P>

31 December 1998			2,000,000
<P>

31 December 1999			2,250,000
<P>

31 December 2000			2,500,000
<P>

Thereafter				To be agreed between Galaxy and 					TNC, but not less than
2,500,000"
<P>

4	Further, Telstra and News undertook and guaranteed that TNC would have the
minimum number of subscribers to the TNC network designated
from year to year
as follows:  
<P>

"6.4	Each of Telstra and News undertakes and guarantees to Australis and Galaxy
that TNC will have the following minimum number
of average subscribers to the
TNC Network in each calendar month of the years commencing on the following
dates:
<P>

Date					Number (Cumulative)
<P>

1 July 1995 (6 months only)		 	 10,000
<P>

1 January 1996				  75,000
<P>

1 January 1997				175,000
<P>

1 January 1998				262,500
<P>

1 January 1999				425,000
<P>

1 January 2000				475,000
<P>

1 January 2001				550,000
<P>

Thereafter					To be agreed between 						Galaxy and TNC, but not 						less
than 550,000"
<P>

	
<P>

5	Payment for those services was calculated on a per subscriber basis.  Galaxy
also had a network which enabled it to distribute
subscription television
broadcasting services by satellite and MDS systems.  For their part, Telstra,
News and TNC covenanted to
procure that TNC would grant exclusive satellite and
MDS rights to Galaxy for distribution of the TNC channels through the Galaxy
network.  
<P>

6	There was also provision in the heads of agreement for mutual investment of
capital in the enterprises in which the parties had
commercial interests.  In
the case of News and Telstra, obligations were created for Telstra or, in
substitution for Telstra, News,
to subscribe for shares in the capital of
Australis Media Ltd (Australis Media), a related corporation to Australis and
to Galaxy.
 The terms of that equity participation are set out below as I think
they have some bearing on the construction question posed in
these
proceedings:
<P>

"7.	EQUITY PARTICIPATION
<P>

7.1	Within 7 days of the satisfaction of the conditions set out in Clauses 1
and 7.5, Telstra or a related body corporate (or, failing
them, News or a
related body corporate) shall subscribe for 25.5 million ordinary shares in the
capital of ALM at A$1.40 per ordinary
share.  Such shares shall rank pari passu
with and shall have rights identical to all existing ordinary shares.
<P>

7.2	Within 7 days of the satisfaction of the conditions set out in Clauses 1
and 7.5, News or a related body corporate shall subscribe
for 25.5 million
convertible notes in the capital of ALM at A$1.40 per convertible note.  Such
notes shall rank pari passu with and
shall have rights identical to all
existing convertible notes.
<P>

7.3	Within 7 days of the satisfaction of the conditions set out in Clauses 1
and 7.5, Australis shall procure that ALM shall grant
to Telstra or a nominee
related body corporate an option to subscribe for a further 25.5 million
ordinary shares in the capital of
ALM at A$1.40 per ordinary share.  Such
option shall be exercisable in whole and not in part at any time from the date
of grant until
the date 27 months after the date of grant.  Relevant shares
shall rank pari passu with and shall have rights identical to all existing
ordinary shares."
<P>

7	By way of contrast, the envisaged equity participation in TNC by Australis
was expressed in clause 7.6 of the heads of agreement
as follows:
<P>

"7.6	Within 7 days of the satisfaction of the conditions set out in Clause 1,
Telstra, News and TNC shall offer to Australis/TCI
the right for Australis/TCI
or its nominee to subscribe for up to 10% of the ordinary equity of TNC at cost
plus interest at TNC's
bank rate from the date on which Telstra and News
contribute their funds to TNC and shall also offer to Australis/TCI the option
for Australis/TCI or its nominee to subscribe for a further 10% of the ordinary
equity of TNC at cost plus a premium of 10% plus
interest at TNC's bank rate
from the date on which Telstra and News contribute their funds to TNC.  Such
option shall be exercisable
in whole and not in part at any time from the date
of grant until the date 27 months after the date of grant."  
<P>

8	It is the interest under this subclause which underpins the claimed
implication of terms in the heads of agreement relied upon
by Australis in
these proceedings.  I think it is sufficient to observe that, whereas in the
case of the equity participation by
Telstra or News, which was couched in terms
of obligation, the equity participation by Australis was expressed in terms of
an obligation
on the part of Telstra, News and TNC to offer to Australis the
right to "subscribe for up to 10% of the ordinary equity of TNC" and
also to
offer to Australis the option "to subscribe for a further 10% of the ordinary
equity of TNC..."  
<P>

9	In relation to a sports joint venture between Australis and another entity
known as Prime, it was contemplated that Telstra and
News would each acquire a
25% share in that joint venture with Australis and Prime for the price
calculated in accordance with clause
3 of the heads of agreement.
<P>

10	Clause 1 of the heads of agreement stipulated certain conditions precedent
in the following terms:
<P>

"1.	CONDITIONS PRECEDENT
<P>

1.1	Subject to Clause 1.2, this is a legally binding Agreement.
<P>

1.2	Clauses 3 to 9 are not to have any operation or legal effect unless and
until:
<P>

(a)	the parties receive an authorisation, approval or notification from the
Trade Practices Commission that it has no objection
to the Agreement; and
<P>

(b)	the compliance by News and Australis with their obligations under Clause
2.
<P>

The above conditions are for the benefit of Australis and may be waived by
Australis at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.
 Australis agrees
not to waive the condition contained in Clause 1.2(a) in the face of serious
objection from the Trade Practices
Commission.   If the conditions are not
satisfied or waived by Australis by 30 April 1995, this Agreement may be
terminated by Australis
in its sole and absolute discretion, without limitation
to any other remedies available to any party for prior breach of this
Agreement.
 The parties agree to use their best endeavours (including under
Clause 12.10) to satisfy the above conditions.
<P>

1.3	The parties shall embody the terms of this Agreement in appropriate long
form Agreements.  The parties shall negotiate in good
faith and use their best
endeavours to enter into such long form Agreements as soon as possible after
satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set out in Clause 1.2." 
<P>

11	No "long form" agreement has been entered into by the parties as at the
hearing of these proceedings.  The parameters of the
operation of the heads of
agreement were expressed in clauses 7.7 and 10.3.  Clause 7.7 was  in the
following terms:
<P>

"7.7	Australis acknowledges that Telstra and News intend to establish other
joint ventures that will utilise the TNC Network for
services other than those
described in Clause 10.3.  Australis further acknowledges that it will have no
rights in relation to those
joint ventures."
<P>

12	By clause 10.3, it was declared that the heads of agreement related to
"subscription broadcasting and/or narrowcasting services"
for home video and/or
audio entertainment regulated under the <i>Broadcasting Services Act 1990</i>
<i>(Cth)</i>.  
<P>

13	Clause 8 of the heads of agreement contemplated expansion into further
fields of pay television and other joint venture arrangements
to be negotiated
in good faith by TNC and Galaxy.  
<P>

14	By clause 9 the parties agreed to cooperate to develop "business
opportunities in New Zealand and other Pacific Rim territories"
and
contemplated expanded business relations between the parties.
<P>

15	Clause 11 dealt with confidentiality and of particular note is clause 11.4
which was in the following terms:  
<P>

"11.4	Following exchange of this Agreement, Telstra, News and TNC shall provide
to Australis full details of the TNC business plan
and a copy of the TNC Joint
Venture Agreement."
<P>

16	During the course of the hearing I referred to that clause as a blindfold
clause as I infer from it that, until such time as
Australis entered into the
heads of agreement, it was not to receive details of TNC's business plan or of
the TNC joint venture agreement.
 
<P>

17	In relation to the terms upon which Australis could acquire an equity
interest in TNC, it was further provided by clause 7.6
as follows:
<P>

"7.6	... Relevant equity shall rank pari passu with and shall have rights
identical to all existing ordinary equity, except that
Australis/TCI
acknowledges that to pass a board or member resolution requires the affirmative
vote of Telstra and News.  In conjunction
with Australis/TCI or its nominee
making the initial investment, Australis/TCI or its nominee shall become a
party to the TNC Joint
Venture Agreement, with Telstra, News and TNC.
Australis/TCI or its nominee shall have proportional representation on the
board of
TNC.   The TNC Joint Venture shall continue to be managed as agreed
between Telstra and News.  Without limitation, the following
matters relevant
to the TNC Joint Venture shall require the unanimous consent of all holders of
ordinary equity in the TNC Joint
Venture:
<P>

(a)	amending the TNC Joint Venture Agreement;
<P>

(b)	admitting other participants to the TNC Joint Venture or redeeming the
share of any existing participant in the TNC Joint Venture;

<P>

(c)	extending the business of the TNC Joint Venture beyond the services
described in Clause 10.3; 
<P>

(d)	terminating or dissolving the TNC Joint Venture other than in accordance
with its terms;
<P>

(e)	permitting or requiring additional capital or other contributions to be
made to the TNC Joint Venture which are not scheduled
under the approved
budgets or business plans;
<P>

(f)	incurring any indebtedness in the name or for the account of the respective
participants in the TNC Joint Venture;
<P>

(g)	issuing any equity, debt or other securities of the TNC Joint Venture,
other than as provided under the approved budgets and
business plans, provided
that Australis/TCI has the right to participate on the best terms offered from
time to time to any person;
<P>

(h)	approving distributions of property of the TNC Joint Venture, other than as
provided under the approved budgets and business
plans, provided Australis/TCI
has the right to participate in proportion to its holding;
<P>

(i)	commencing, settling or abandoning any litigation or dispute for an amount
in excess of A$10 million relevant to the TNC Joint
Venture (other than against
one of the participants); and
<P>

(j)	entering into any contractual obligation or commitment under which the TNC
Joint Venture will incur a liability (contingent
or otherwise) in excess of
A$2,500,000, other than as provided under the approved budgets and business
plans."
<P>

18	Except for the description of TNC in the heads of agreement as a "joint
venture formed between Telstra and News for the establishment
of a business for
the distribution of home entertainment subscription television services
throughout Australia", the heads of agreement
do not describe the nature of
that joint venture. 
<P>

19	Expressions such as "the right ... to subscribe for ... 10% of the ordinary
equity of TNC"; that the "equity shall rank pari
passu with ... existing
ordinary equity"; and the acknowledgment by Australis that the passing of "a
board or member resolution of
(TNC required) the affirmative vote of (Telstra
and News)", all imply that TNC was, or was intended to be, a corporate vehicle.

<P>

20	So, the heads of agreement tell the reader very little about that entity and
nothing at all about its business plan, nor of the
joint venture agreement,
except to name the parties to it and the general area in which it planned to
operate.  There is no suggestion
that any of the details of TNC's business plan
or of the joint venture agreement relating to TNC was communicated to Australis
prior
to the execution of the heads of agreement, or that the subject matter of
the business plan or of the TNC business agreement formed
some common
substratum in the formation of the heads of agreement which was known to each
of the parties.  On the contrary, clause
11.4 of the heads of agreement I read
as evincing the intention of News, Telstra and TNC that that information would
not be available
to Australis or Galaxy prior to the execution of the heads of
agreement. 
<P>

21	While the heads of agreement made detailed provision in clause 7.6 for the
manner in which Australis, as a minority shareholder,
could control the
operations of TNC, the heads of agreement was silent on any ability of
Australis to control the operations of TNC
in the period after execution of the
heads of agreement and prior to Australis taking up equity in TNC.  It is in
that contractual
context that Australis contended that there was an implied
term of the heads of agreement as follows:
<P>

"<u>C9.</u>	It is and was an implied term of the Heads of Agreement that until
a reasonable time has elapsed after the Defendants have offered
Australis the
right to subscribe for equity in the TNC Joint Venture in accordance with their
obligations under clause 7.6 of the
Heads of Agreement, the Defendants may not
amend or cause or permit to be amended the agreements creating and governing
the TNC Joint
Venture so as to materially reduce their respective obligations
pursuant to those agreements or to render nugatory or worthless or
to seriously
undermine the right of Australis under the Heads of Agreement to subscribe for
equity in the TNC Joint Venture."
<P>

22	Australis and Galaxy alleged a breach of that implied term by an agreement
between Telstra and News in mid 1997 "that the cable
roll-out by Telstra would
be permanently reduced to pass approximately only 2,000,000 to 2,500,000
homes".  Particulars of damage
said to flow from that breach were given as
follows:
<P>

<center>"<b>Particulars</b></center>
<P>


<P>

(a)	The number of potential subscribers to the TNC Network <u>was</u>
significantly reduced and Australis and Galaxy have lost the opportunity of
receiving additional payments pursuant to the express
terms of the Heads of
Agreement referred to at <u>C8</u> above.
<P>

<u>(b)</u>	The Plaintiffs presently estimate that the additional homes passed
would have resulted in a penetration rate for new subscribers
of at least 25%.
On that basis, the Plaintiffs presently estimate their damages referred to at
particular (a) above as follows:
<P>

<b>Period		Reduction in 	Lost payments		Total</b>
<P>

<b>			Homes Past	calculated using a	</b>
<P>

<b>					net gain to Australis</b>

<P>

								<u>		</u>
<P>

								US$3,282,950
<P>

								========== "
<P>

	
<P>

23	It is noted that those damages are not expressed as damages incurred as a
result of the right of Australis to acquire equity
in TNC being rendered
"nugatory or worthless".   
<P>

24	On their application and by consent of the parties, on 4 December 1998 Rolfe
J made the orders and noted the agreement of the
parties as follows:
<P>

"BY CONSENT, the Court makes the following orders:
<P>

1.	The following questions shall be heard separately and prior to the hearing
of all other questions:
<P>

(a)	whether the Heads of Agreement referred to in the Amended Summons contains
the implied term contended for in paragraph C9 (where
second appearing) of the
Amended Summons;
<P>

(b)	if yes to (a), whether on a proper construction of the Heads of Agreement
any entitlement which the First Plaintiff has or may
have under Clause 7.6 of
the Heads of Agreement to subscribe for equity in the TNC Joint Venture could
arise prior to entry by the
parties into long form agreements as contemplated
by Clause 1.3 of the Heads of Agreement.
<P>

(c)	If yes to (a) and no to (b), does the implied term described in 1(a) have
any legal effect prior to the entry by the parties
into long form agreements as
contemplated by clause 1.3 of the Heads of Agreement;
<P>

(d)	if yes to (a) and (b); or if yes to (a), no to (b) and yes to (c); whether,
in agreeing to, making and implementing the Agreement,
as defined in the
attached Statement of Assumed Facts, the Defendants:
<P>

(i)	materially reduced their respective obligations under the agreements
creating and governing the TNC Joint Venture; or
<P>

(ii)	rendered nugatory or worthless or seriously undermined the entitlement of
the First Plaintiff under Clause 7.6 of the Heads
of Agreement to subscribe for
equity in the TNC Joint Venture.
<P>

2.	The Court notes that the parties agree that:
<P>

(a)	The separate questions shall be determined on the basis of the attached
Statement of Assumed Facts.  The parties may not depart
from or dispute the
assumed facts for the purposes of any appeal from the determination of the
separate questions.
<P>

(b)	If the separate questions are answered as follows:
<P>

(i)	question (a) is answered no;
<P>

	or
<P>

(ii)	question (a) is answered yes, but question (b) and (c) are answered no;
<P>

	or
<P>

(iii)	question (d), if reached is answered no;
<P>

then the Defendants are entitled to have judgment entered in their favour.
<P>

(c)	If as a result of the determination of the separate questions, judgment is
not entered in favour of the Defendants, then the
parties are not bound by the
determination of the separate questions and/or the facts assumed for the
purposes of that determination.
<P>

(d)	The evidence required for the hearing of the separate questions is:
<P>

(i)	the documents exhibited to the affidavit or (sic) Andrea Martignoni
affirmed 22 October 1998;
<P>

(ii)	the Umbrella Agreement made between the Defendants on 9 March 1995."
<P>

25	The documents exhibited to the affidavit of Andrea Martignoni are the heads
of agreement and a deed of release dated 25 July
1997 (the deed of release).

<P>

26	The parties to that deed included News, Telstra and Australis Media.  The
"Statement of Assumed Facts" was as follows:
<P>

"(a)	On 25 July 1997 the Defendants amended the agreements creating and
governing the TNC Joint Venture by making an agreement ("the
Agreement") that
the cable roll-out by the First Defendant would be permanently reduced so that
it passed only approximately 2.5
million homes by 31 December 1997 in lieu of
an obligation to use best efforts to meet the following timetable:
<P>

<b>Date	Home Passed</b>
<P>

30 June 1995	0.400 million
<P>

30 September 1995	0.550 million
<P>

31 December 1995	0.750 million
<P>

30 June 1999	4.000 million
<P>

(b)	Since 25 July 1997 the Agreement has been implemented in that at all times
since 25 July 1997 the cable roll-out by the First
Defendant has passed only
approximately 2.5 million homes.
<P>

(c)	The terms of the Heads of Agreement have not been embodied in long form
agreements as contemplated by Clause 1.3 of the Heads
of Agreement."
<P>

	
<P>

27	I treat paragraph (a) of the statement of assumed facts as a statement of
the relevant effect of the deed of release.  I also
infer from paragraph (a),
that the reference to the "obligation to use best efforts to meet the ...
timetable" set out in that paragraph
is a reference to the obligations of the
parties to the Umbrella Agreement of 9 March 1995:  being the document referred
to in paragraph
2(d) of the agreement of the parties accompanying the orders of
Rolfe J.  
<P>

28	While the deed of release and the umbrella agreement are clearly relevant to
issues relating to breach and damages as alleged
by Australis, objection was
taken to the admission of those documents in aid of construction of the heads
of agreement.  Those documents
have been admitted only as relevant to the issue
of breach and, in my view, recourse to those documents is not permissible in
aid
of construction of the heads of agreement for the purpose of determining
whether the implication relied upon by Australis should
be made.  
<P>

29	It may be permissible to have recourse to that material in order to
identify, for example, the business plan or the joint venture
agreement
referred to in the blindfold clause 11.4 of the heads of agreement if it became
necessary as a matter of construction to
understand the meaning of those terms.
However, that is not the case and I am satisfied that the manner in which
Australis has sought
to have recourse to the umbrella agreement and its
attachments in aid of the construction of the heads of agreement upon which it
relies in these proceedings cannot be justified.  I doubt if authority is
required for that proposition.  
<P>

30	It is not suggested that the contents of the umbrella agreement were made
known to Australis or Galaxy prior to execution of
the heads of agreement.  On
the contrary, clause 11.4 of the heads of agreement would appear to have
deprived Australis of access
to the umbrella agreement prior to execution of
the heads of agreement.
<P>

31	It is common ground that to succeed in these proceedings, Australis must
satisfy the five criteria for the implication of a term
of a contract as
expressed in the joint opinion of the majority in <b>BP Refinery (Westernport)
Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings </b>(1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283 as follows:
<P>

"... (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give
business efficacy to the contract, so that no term
will be implied if the
contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that "it goes
without saying"; (4) it must be
capable of clear expression; (5) it must not
contradict any express term of the contract."
<P>

32	It is not intended as any disrespect of the law or of those who make it to
observe that I know of no other body of legal principles
which are as self
delusionary as the expression of the degree of certainty required for the
implication of terms in contracts.  While
expressed as implications of
necessity to give business efficacy to an agreement, as implications that are
so obvious that they go
without saying, the reality is that the long history of
case law seeking to give expression to those concepts is littered with reversed
and majority decisions of which <b>BP Refinery</b> is as good an example as any
and one in which Lord Wilberforce was a dissentient.  
<P>

33	In that case, the implication of the subject agreement by the Full Court of
the Supreme Court of Victoria was rejected by the
Privy Council as being
"wholly unreasonable and inequitable".  Their Lordships devised a substitute
implied term.  Of that term Lord
Wilberforce and Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest
were of the opinion that it could not "be justified under the normal
principles.  It
(was) not necessary in order to produce business efficacy, (and
was) inconsistent with the expressed terms of the ... agreement ..."
(at 294).

<P>

34	In this case I am in the felicitous position of being presented with no such
difficulties of construction.  In my view, there
is no warrant in
reasonableness, nor in necessity, to import the term sought to be relied upon.
Moreover, it is a term which, in
my view, falls far short of the requirement
that it must be capable of clear expression.  
<P>

35	The heads of agreement has been the subject of prior litigation in this
court leading to the decision of the Court of Appeal
reported in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43
NSWLR 104</a> (the Court of Appeal's decision).  That was an appeal from a decision
of McLelland CJ in Eq in which his Honour relied upon implied
terms of the
heads of agreement to support injunctions granted against Australis and Galaxy:
implications which were not supported
by the Court of Appeal.
<P>

36	Of the second of the implications found by McLelland CJ in Eq, the Court of
Appeal observed as follows: 
<P>

     "In his "alternative way of approaching the matter", the learned trial
judge referred to implied obligations:
<P>

	"... not voluntarily to do anything to cause or permit the enjoyment by the
plaintiffs of the benefits contemplated in the above
quoted parts of clause 3,
5.1, 5.4, 8.1, 8.2 and 9.6 of the agreement to be rendered nugatory or
worthless or seriously undermined."
 
<P>

     His Honour cited <i>Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd</i> and <i>Breen v
Williams</i>.  We are of the view that his Honour erred in taking this
alternative approach, first because it is not supported by the authorities
cited, and secondly because it lacks the "necessity" required before a term may
be implied.  Many terms now said to be implied by
law in various categories of
contract reflect the concern of the courts that, unless such a term be implied,
the enjoyment of the
rights conferred by the contract would or could be
rendered nugatory, worthless, or, perhaps, be seriously undermined.  <u>It
would be, however, fallacious to elide the purpose of implying such terms with
the terms themselves.  To do so would replace necessity
with desirability.  The
passages cited from </u><cite>Nullagine Investments Pty Lid (sic) v WA Club Inc
</cite><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 635</a> at 647-648, 659, </u><cite>Byrne
</cite><u>and</u><cite> Breen, </cite><u>show the High Court as drawing a clear
distinction between the term implied and its rationale</u>.  A contract may
"contemplate" many benefits for the respective parties, but each can only call
on the other to provide, or co-operate
in the providing of, benefits promised
by that party.  For example, in the absence of an express covenant, a landlord
is not bound
in contract to repair the demised premises."
<P>

(Emphasis added)
<P>

(at 124-125)
<P>

37	It is clear that the form of the implied term advanced on behalf of
Australis had been extracted from observations made by McHugh
and Gummow JJ in
<b>Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20185%20CLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 185 CLR 410</a> at 450, citing
<b>Nullagine Investments Pty Ltd v The Western</b> <b>Australian Club
Incorporated</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 635</a> at 647-448, 659.  McHugh and Gummow JJ said
of terms to be implied by law that such implications "in various categories of
case reflect
the concern of the courts that, unless such a term be implied, the
enjoyment of the rights conferred by the contract would or could
be rendered
nugatory, worthless, or, perhaps, be seriously undermined":  the passage
repeated in the Court of Appeal's decision.
 
<P>

38	Although this case is not concerned with implication by law, Australis has
picked up that expression of the rationale for the
implication of terms by law
in the terms of the implication formulated by it.  There is a real problem with
that approach which I
think has been noticed in the Court of Appeal's decision;
that is, the confusion of the terms to be implied with the rationale for
the
implication.  
<P>

39	In <b>Byrne</b>, their Honours were expressing the rationale for the
implication, namely equating it with the requirement of necessity in implying
a
term in a contract, in those cases, by implication of law.  I have emphasised
in the passage quoted above from the Court of Appeal's
decision the
observations of the Court of Appeal pointing out the confusion between the term
to be implied and the rationale for
the implication.  
<P>

40	By way of contrast, it might be said that the consent of Australis in the
operation of TNC, as laid down in clause 7.6(a)-(j),
is designed to avoid the
degrading of Australis' interest in TNC.  Each of them could be seen as acts
which, if taken without the
consent of Australis, could render the Australis
investment "nugatory or worthless".   
<P>

41	In this case there has been no attempt by Australis to formulate any
implication in terms in the nature of clause 7.6(a)-(j)
for the period prior to
investment by Australis in TNC.  Rather, Australis has proffered the rationale
for the implication of some
unidentified term.  I think it is this confusion
which robs the suggested implication of clarity and requires its rejection for
that
reason alone.  
<P>

42	However, in my view, Australis faces an impossible task in satisfying the
test of necessity in seeking to imply some right to
control the operation of
TNC, whatever that entity was, from the time of the execution of the heads of
agreement up to the acquisition
of an equity interest in TNC by Australis.  I
think the alleged breach by Telstra and News of the proffered implied term
illustrates
that difficulty.  The relevant assumed fact is the amending of the
umbrella agreement by the deed of release so as to "permanently
reduce" the
number of homes to be passed in the cable roll-out to the figure of 2,500,000
by 31 December 1997.  
<P>

43	Why is that a breach of any implied term to protect Australis' future
interest in TNC?  Australis and Galaxy had the benefit
of covenants by TNC that
it would ensure that the number of homes passed would reach 1,500,000 by 31
December 1997 and 2,500,000
by 31 December 2000.  Thereafter, the number was to
be determined by some unspecified mechanism, but so as never to drop below
2,500,000.
 Further, Australis had the benefit of the undertaking and guarantee
by Telstra and News that the minimum number of subscribers would
reach 550,000
by 1 January 2001 and, thereafter, not to drop below that number.  
<P>

44	So, in terms of homes to be passed and, inferentially, of subscribers to the
TNC network, the "permanent" reduction under the
deed of release represented an
advance on what was guaranteed to Australis under the heads of agreement. 
<P>

45	How is it said that the deed of release reduced the number of homes to be
passed, as contemplated under the umbrella agreement,
in a way which degraded
the putative interest of Australis in TNC?  There is no suggestion that the
reduction in roll-out was agreed
to otherwise than in the legitimate pursuit of
the commercial interests of Telstra and News, leaving aside Australis' claim
based
on the supposed implication of terms.  Who is to say that the deed of
release has not benefited Telstra, News and TNC and, in turn,
Australis by
agreeing to a reduction in the extent of required cable roll-out?  The costs
associated with the task of cable roll-out
may have proved financially
crippling to Telstra and News and, in turn, made the acquisition of an equity
interest in TNC by Australis
"at cost plus interest" or "at cost plus a premium
of 10% plus interest" prohibitively expensive. 
<P>

46	It simply does not follow that reduction in cable roll-out has any effect
financially on the state of TNC.  It could be beneficial,
it could be
detrimental, it could be neutral.  In other words, without more, it would not
be possible to say that entry into the
deed of release was precluded by any
entitlement of Australis to have the financial attractiveness of TNC preserved
in the period
after execution of the heads of agreement and prior to its
acquisition of an equity share in TNC.  This is compounded by the absence
from
the heads of agreement, or from admissible surrounding circumstances, of any
relevant description of TNC's financial or business
structure.
<P>

47	Moreover, if Australis was to be regarded as holder of a bare option or as
holder of the benefit of an obligation to be offered
the right to participate
in the equity of TNC, the cases strongly point to the exclusion of any
implication of terms in the form
of the proffered implied term.  See <b>Hirsch
&amp; Co v Burns </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281897%29%2077%20LT%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1897) 77 LT 377 (HL)</a> at 378-382 and <b>Forsayth Oil &amp;
Gas NL v Livia Pty Ltd (No 2) </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%209%20ACLR%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 9 ACLR 831</a> at 834.
<P>

48	In this case, as it happens, I do not regard the rights of Australis under
clause 7.6 as that of a holder of a bare option. 
I think the right under
clause 7.6 has to be read in the context of the mutual engagement of the
parties in their respective business
activities which involved mutual
investment in the other's business enterprise.  
<P>

49	However, the form of the right to take up an equity remains important.  For
example, in the case of News and Telstra, the heads
of agreement imposed
obligations upon one or other of them to make capital investments in Australis
Media.  Their position I would
see to be much stronger than the one occupied by
Australis in these proceedings were they contending for the implication of a
term
to control Australis Media's business activities in the interim between
the execution of the heads of agreement and acquisition of
equity participation
in Australis Media.  In Australis' case, it has no obligation to acquire an
interest in TNC.  It has the right
to effect such an acquisition through the
obligation of TNC to offer Australis equity participation and it has the option
conferred
by clause 7.6 to acquire further equity interest in TNC.  
<P>

50	In that context, one may ask, as at the time of execution of the heads of
agreement, what was the entity whose business operations
were to be placed
under constraint by implication of Australis' implied terms?  What was the
business plan of that enterprise and
what were the terms of the agreement under
which it operated?  None of these things were known to Australis outside the
terms of
the heads of agreement and that told Australis precious little.  In
the circumstances, I think it would be almost impossible to formulate
an
implied term that was so obvious and which was so necessary to give business
efficacy to the agreement between Australis, News
and Telstra.  
<P>

51	Certainly, in my view, a term along the lines of that relied upon by
Australis would be almost meaningless.  What acts would
it prohibit that would
not be caught by the express terms of the heads of agreement? 
<P>

52	This is not a case where the proffered implied term suffers from a
remediable criticism.  In such a case, notwithstanding the
rigidity of the
separate questions to be determined, I would pursue a course which permitted
amendment to the implied term to meet
particular criticisms.  No such
application has been made on behalf of Australis and I am of the view that none
would have been available
to cure what I believe to be the fatal deficiencies
in the implied term contended for by Australis.  
<P>

53	In my view, question 1(a) should be answered "no" and, accordingly, the
defendants are entitled to judgment in accordance with
the agreement noted by
Rolfe J in the order of 4 December 1998.  
<P>

54	Although it is unnecessary to go further, I would express the view that upon
the proper construction of clause 7.6, the obligation
to make the offer to
Australis arose within seven days of the satisfaction of the conditions set out
in clause 1 of the heads of
agreement, they being the conditions so referred to
in clause 1:  namely, the authorisation, approval or notification from the
Trade
Practices Commission that it had no objection to the heads of agreement
and the compliance by News and Australis with their obligations
under clause 2,
the terms of which are irrelevant to the issues arising on this hearing.  
<P>

55	Although clause 7.6 refers to the conditions set out in clause 1, so that it
is in terms wide enough to embrace the provisions
of clause 1.3, I do not
regard clause 7.6 as one requiring clause 1.3 to be satisfied for the purposes
of the operation of clause
7.6.  Indeed, when one looks at the whole of clause
1, it is significant, I think, that it expresses the understanding of the
parties
that the heads of agreement was a legally binding document, subject
only to clause 1.2, and when one goes to clause 1.2, it is clear
that clauses 3
to 9 have legal effect upon satisfaction of the conditions referred to in
clauses 1.2(a) and (b).  I think it follows
from that provision that clause 7.6
comes into operation once those conditions precedent in clause 1.2 have been
satisfied.  There
is no reason, in my view, to put a gloss upon clause 1.2 so
as to cause clause 7.6 to be dependent upon satisfaction of clause 1.3.
<P>

56	Had I been of the view that Australis was entitled to the benefit of the
proffered implied term, or one of a similar kind, I
would not have proceeded to
answer question 1(d)(ii) of the questions for separate determination, largely
for the reasons earlier
advanced.  There is no way, in my view, upon the
evidence presented which would enable me to make any finding in relation to
that
question other than that the effect of the deed of release may have been
neutral, prejudicial or beneficial to the value of Australis'
right to acquire
an equity interest in TNC.  
<P>

57	It is agreed that costs should follow the event.  Accordingly, the questions
for separate determination are answered as follows:
<P>

	
<P>

	1(a)		No.
<P>

	1(b)-(d)	These questions do not arise.
<P>

	
<P>

58	Accordingly, I give judgment for the defendants in the proceedings and order
the plaintiffs to pay the defendants' costs.
