<P>

<b><u>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT - Application by the Plaintiffs under s13 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act 1974</a></u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: It is necessary that I rule upon an
application by the plaintiffs that the defences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act</a></u>, 1974, in relation to both publications be taken away from the jury.
<P>

2  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13</a> is in the following terms:
<P>

"Unlikelihood of harm." It is a defence that the circumstances of the
publication of the matter complained of were such that the
person defamed was
not likely to suffer harm."
<P>

3  	There seem to be three leading authorities on the section.  It
was considered by the Court of Appeal in<b> </b><u>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers
Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2 NSWLR 749.</a> where the Court said  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 NSWLR 749</a> at 800.:
<P>

"If a plaintiff's reputation may be one of the `circumstances of the
publication' for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a>, we do not think that it was such a
circumstance in respect of any of the subject publications.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13</a> seems
to be intended to provide a defence to trivial actions for defamation.  It
would be particularly applicable to publications
of limited extent, as, for
example, where a slightly defamatory statement is made in jocular circumstances
to a few people in a private
home."
<P>

4  	After referring to the relevance or otherwise of the plaintiff's
reputation to the issue, the Court continued:
<P>

"The expression `circumstances of the publication' seems more apt to describe
matters such as the defamatory nature of the matter,
the manner in which it is
published, the persons to whom it is published and the place where it is
published.  We do not ever think
that the respondent's reputation had any
relevance to the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13</a> to the subject publications."
<P>

5  	It was then considered in<b> </b><u>Chappell v Mirror
Newspapers</u>, which, surprisingly is only reported in the Australian Torts
Reports.  The reference is<b> </b><u>Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Limited</u>,
(1984) Aust. Torts Reports [80-691].  
<P>

6  	At page 68,946, Moffitt P (with whom Samuels and Priestley JJA
agreed) referred to earlier versions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a>, firstly in the <u>Defamation
Act</u> 1912 and then in the <u>Defamation Act</u> 1958.  His Honour then
said:
<P>

"The present section is different in form to that of either early provision,
but each of the three is directed to the occasion or
circumstance of the
publication as the operative factor to render the defamation trivial.  In the
end the question is one of the
construction of section 13."
<P>

7  	His Honour referred to the decision in Morosi, without expressing
any contrary view to those expressed by the Court in that
case.  The President
continued at page 68,947:
<P>

"For the defence to be available `the circumstances of the publication' must be
`such that the person defamed was not likely to
suffer harm.'
<P>

The words `such that' are important.  The quality of the circumstances of the
publication must be the factor which renders it unlikely
that the person
defamed will suffer harm.  Whereas a defamatory imputation is actionable <i>per
se</i>, without damage (ss8 and 9), so that a defendant cannot defeat an action
even if he were able to prove that there was no actual damage,
the defence
under s13 is directed entirely to the circumstances of the publication.  It
does not change the general law so the defendant
can raise an issue on the
probabilities whether there is in fact harm caused to the person defamed.
<P>

The issue is directed to the quality of the publication in respect of its
proneness to cause harm.  The words of s13 are `was not
likely to suffer harm'
and not `did not suffer harm' (meaning `probably did not suffer harm').
<P>

The quality of the circumstances of the publication determines at the moment of
publication whether it is or is not actionable;
<i>Morosi</i> (supra at 799).
Actionability does not depend upon an inquiry as to what thereafter happens and
in particular whether or not harm
in fact probably resulted from the
publication.  The defence depends entirely on the causative potency of the
circumstances `of the
publication' to produce immunity from harm.  Hence it is
not sufficient to establish a s13 defence that a defendant merely proves
`in
all the circumstances' that it is unlikely the plaintiff will suffer harm and
even less that the plaintiff has not in fact suffered
harm.
<P>

To regard s13 as providing a defence in either of these events would in a
practical sense destroy the fundamental concept of the
law of defamation
earlier referred to.  There would be substituted in any action for defamation
no more than a rebuttable presumption
of fact that damage flows from a
defamatory imputation."
<P>

8  	I stress his Honour's phrase "the defence depends entirely on the
causative potency of the circumstances `of the publication'
to produce immunity
from harm".
<P>

9  	His Honour then continued, on the same page:
<P>

"The apparent purpose of s13 and its predecessors, despite some difference in
their terms and application was to give a defence
to and hence discourage
actions for trivial defamation.  This will arise in particular where there is a
limited publication.  This
will more often be the case where the defamation is
oral but will sometimes extend to written defamation.  Examples of written
defamatory
imputations of trivial impact published by letter or circular to a
limited or particular class of persons can be readily thought
of."
<P>

10  	His Honour then continued at page 68,948:
<P>

"What then is comprehended within the term `the circumstances of the
publication'?  Publication is the act of communication referred
to in s91(1) of
the matter carrying the defamatory imputation.  An act of communication is one
which involves at least two persons
being the person or persons on the one hand
who publish and the person or persons on the other hand who receive the
communication.
 The person defamed is not involved in the act of communication
itself.  The person who participates in the communication by receiving
it, so
harm is or is presumed to have been caused by his receipt of it, is proximate
to the communication so it is well arguable
that circumstances which relate to
his receipt of it and hence special characteristics of him as recipient are apt
to be caught up
in the circumstances of the publication. Thus a publication of
a defamatory statement between friends in a bar may fall within s13
while a
like statement published at large would not."
<P>

11  	There is a corruption in that report which I tried to clear up
by obtaining from the Law Courts Library the original transcript,
but
unfortunately the corruption is in the original transcript as well. So that is
how it must remain, although I must say, with
respect, that the thrust of what
his Honour was saying in that last passage is clear enough.
<P>

12  	In<b> </b><u>King &amp; Mergen Holdings Pty Limited v
McKenzie</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%2024%20NSWLR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 24 NSWLR 305.</a> the Court of Appeal (Mahoney, Clarke and
Meagher JJA), was pressed (without success) to have <u>Chappell's</u> case
reargued, on the basis that it was wrongly decided.  At page 311, Mahoney JA,
with the concurrence of the other judges, said:
<P>

"Chappell's case decided that the s13 defence exists only where the fact that
the plaintiff `was not likely to suffer harm' arose
because of "the
circumstances of the publication".  And, in addition it held that the
pre-existing bad reputation of the plaintiff
was not one `of the circumstances
of the publication ...'
<P>

In my opinion, Chappell's case was correctly decided in respect of each of
these matters.  As a matter of statutory construction,
it is I think clear that
it is to be by reason of the circumstances of the publication that the
plaintiff was not likely to suffer
harm, for the purposes of the defence.
There is no reason requiring departure from the ordinary meaning of the
section."
<P>

13  	His Honour then went on to express the view that the bad (or
good) reputation of the plaintiff, absent a compelling reason
to the contrary,
was not one of the "circumstances of the publication".  However, that is not of
particular relevance for present
purposes.
<P>

14  	Earlier, his Honour had said at page 309:
<P>

"The s13 defence involves that the defendant show that, for the reasons stated,
the plaintiff at the time of publication, was not
likely to suffer harm. This
places a significant burden upon the defendant: he must negative not merely
that there would be great
or substantial harm but that there be `harm' at all.
The significance of what is required in this regard may be require
consideration
in subsequent cases."
<P>

15  	Earlier, at page 308, his Honour had said, when referring to the
reference by Moffitt P to the defence being intended to discourage
actions for
trivial defamation:
<P>

"Nor, in my opinion, did the President intend to indicate, by his reference to
`trivial defamation' or to the kinds of cases to
which the section would in his
opinion apply, that the defence could not extend to cases in which the term
`trivial' would be inapplicable.
 His Honour, in my opinion, left those matters
for later consideration."
<P>

16  	It is necessary for me to refer to certain aspects of the
evidence in this present case.  However, I do so deeply conscious
of the fact
that the ultimate resolution, or indeed the resolution at all times, of the
issues of fact is solely for the jury.  
<P>

17  	The letter in its complete form, which is the subject of this
action, was written on the letterhead of Foreign Language Publication
Pty Ltd,
the second defendant, and signed by T Skalkos, the first defendant.  It is
dated 21 July 1993 and addressed to The Honourable
Mr Paul Keating, Prime
Minister of Australia, Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600.
<P>

18  	I will quote the first paragraph:
<P>

"Dear sir, 
<P>

I write this letter to you as the publisher of the largest group of Ethnic
Newspapers in Australia.  This letter is not specifically
addressed only to
yourself Mr Prime Minister but to all your Federal Government Ministers,
colleagues and heads of Government Departments
and semi-governmental
authorities".
<P>

19  	The letter then goes on to say:
<P>

"This letter is directed towards the dealings that your Government has with the
Ethnic Communities of Australia through the Ethnic
Print Media."
<P>

20  	The letter then contains very stringent criticisms of alleged
"middle men", of whom the second plaintiff is one, carrying out
work interposed
between government and semi-government authorities which are desirous of having
advertising and other material placed
or included in the various ethnic
newspapers which exist in this country.
<P>

21  	As Mr Littlemore for the defendants stressed in argument, it is
necessary to focus upon the actual publications, and I deal
here firstly with
the asserted publication to the Prime Minister.
<P>

22  	An interrogatory was administered to the first defendant in the
following terms:
<P>

"Look at the letter dated 21 July 1993 addressed to the Prime Minister, Mr Paul
Keating, (Annexure "A").
<P>

(b)	Did you send this letter or cause it to be sent or given to the Prime
Minister and if so when?"
<P>

23  	The answer to (b) was: "Yes, on or about the date it bears".
<P>

24  	It was argued by Mr Littlemore that this is not evidence of
publication to the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister's office.
 Mr Hughes
for the plaintiffs contended, however, that it was some evidence of
publication.  
<P>

25  	I note that in the 8th edition of Gatley on Libel and Slander at
para 227, the learned authors state:
<P>

"It is not necessary for the plaintiff in every case to prove directly that the
words complained of were brought to the actual knowledge
of some third person.
If he proves facts from which it can reasonably be inferred that the words were
brought to the knowledge of
some third person, he will establish a prima facie
case."
<P>

26  	Then para 228 which refers to various examples, contains the
proposition:
<P>

"Thus proof that a letter was posted is sufficient prima facie evidence of
publication to the person to whom it was addressed. 34"
<P>

27  	Cases cited in footnote 34 are:  <u>Warren v Warren</u> [1834] I
C.M. &amp; R 250; <u>Shipley v Todhunter</u> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1836/880.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1836] EngR 880</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1836%5d%207%20C%20%26%20P%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1836] 7 C &amp; P 680</a> at 686.
That statement is also contained in the 9th edition of Gatley.
<P>

28  	I note, with interest, that in Australian Defamation Law and
Practice, at para 5050, Messrs Tobin and Sexton state:
<P>

"Proof that a letter was posted is prima facie evidence of publication to the
addressee.  Publication to anyone other than the addressee
will not be
assumed".
<P>

29  	It is true that the interrogatory does not refer to the posting
of the letter, it refers to causing it to be sent or given
to the Prime
Minister.  Presumably that could include  posting. In any event, interestingly
the letter in an unsigned draft form
did reach the Prime Minister's office in
the following circumstances.  I do not wish to deal at length with the evidence
here, but
it is necessary in some respects to do that.
<P>

30  	At transcript page 330, Ms Anne de Salis, who presently lives in
Sydney, gave evidence that she previously worked for the Australian
Government
in Canberra, and between 1979 and 1992 she was employed continuously by the
Department of Treasury.  In 1992 she was transferred
to the Office of the Prime
Minister as a senior advisor.  She was the senior advisor for government
business which meant that she
saw "all the correspondence and advised the Prime
Minister on the correspondence" but also had an advisory role in Multicultural
Affairs.  At this time she had known the first plaintiff and his wife for 20
years; she was aware of the company and the first plaintiff's
control of it.
She stated (at T331):
<P>

"I knew Ethnic Communications did quite a lot of work for the government for a
number of different departments,  the Electoral Commission,
the Australian Tax
Office, and I think Health Commission, Ethnic Communications had done work
for."
<P>

31  	She was shown exhibit A, which she identified as the text of the
letter that she received in an unsigned state.  After reading
the text of the
letter, she spoke to Mr Assaf.  She then spoke to the person who runs the
office of Multicultural Affairs, which
is the unit in the Prime Minister's
Office, which manages correspondence dealing with subject matter of the sort
that was in that
letter.  Ms de Salis said:
<P>

"So I rang the head of that unit who would normally get a signed letter to the
Prime Minister concerning immigration or ethnic affairs
and asked him to make
sure he sent me a copy if it arrived. I also spoke to the Minister of
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  ... the
Honourable Nick Bolkus, because as I
recollect it was one of his staff members that brought me the draft copy of the
letter."
<P>

32  	Ms de Salis referred to a discussion with Mr Neil Edwards
regarding the letter.  He was the head of the Office of Multicultural
Affairs,
which was the unit within the Prime Minister's department that advised the
Prime Minister on that area of policy.
<P>

33  	Ms de Salis did not accept the validity of what was in the
letter and she destroyed it. She gave evidence to the effect that
Mr Assaf, the
first plaintiff, was known in government circles in which she moved.
<P>

34  	She said that Mr Assaf's standing was not damaged, in her eyes,
by the draft letter.  
<P>

35  	There is one matter which I must, with some hesitation because
of my restricted role, refer to in the letter, and that is the
section which I
mentioned to earlier.
<P>

"This letter is not specifically addressed only to yourself, Mr Prime Minister
but to all your Federal Government Ministers, colleagues,
and heads of
Government Departments and semi-governmental Authorities."
<P>

36  	Mr Littlemore contends that on its true construction, that
sentence means that Mr Skalkos was intending to write in similar
terms to other
prominent persons, as identified in that letter.
<P>

37  	Mr Hughes, on the other hand, contends that it is in effect an
invitation to the Prime Minister, or whoever was handling the
matter within his
Office, to republish the letter, if thought fit, to those other persons in
authority as identified there. Whether
that is so or not must ultimately be
resolved by the jury, but I must say that I have great difficulty, with
respect, accepting the
construction which Mr Littlemore puts on it.
<P>

38  	If it is taken, as I am inclined to think it is, as an
invitation to republish, then of course that becomes a critical aspect
of this
letter.  In a sense, although I don't mean this in a technical sense, it
becomes a publication somewhat at large, because
one would never know the
extent to which copies of the letter may be passed on to others.
<P>

39  	In any event, the evidence to which I have made reference in Ms
de Salis's evidence is the total evidence that has been led
in this Court as to
what occurred in the Prime Minister's office. I must say, bearing in mind that
Ms de Salis said that she worked
continuously in Canberra whilst working for
the Federal government, I do not think the jury would have much difficulty in
inferring
that she was in Canberra at the time the copy of the letter came into
her possession.
<P>

40  	There is evidence that a signed copy of the letter (exhibit W),
came into the possession of an officer at the Melbourne office
of Telecom,
which was, of course, in 1993, a wholly government-owned instrumentality. 
<P>

41  	Ms Tessa Hall gave evidence that for some years up to 1994 she
worked for Telecom in Melbourne.  In 1993 her position was Manager
Liaison,
Multicultural Marketing.  She had held that office for just under 12 months.
She was shown the letter, Ex W, which is a
copy, as I have already indicated,
of the full text signed by Mr Skalkos.  She said she first saw it probably in
late July 1993,
when she located it in the in-tray on her desk.  She read it a
couple of times and she expressed a degree of concern.  She had known
Mr Assaf
for some 8 or 9 weeks.
<P>

42  	It was of keen interest to her to read the letter because she
was responsible for a Telecom launch to the multicultural community
in a
pre-ballot situation (the Telecom/Optus ballot) and the second plaintiff was
the agency that had been chosen for her to work
with, and the allegations in
the letter related to that agency.  So, naturally, she said, she felt a degree
of concern as to the
validity of what was written there.
<P>

43  	She reported the letter to her senior officer, Colin Harvey and
discussed the matter with him.  She also discussed it with
Therese Fedor, who
was the Marketing Manager for the multicultural market, dealing with different
types of publications and documents.
<P>

44  	After she had read the letter, Mr Skalkos rang Ms Hall simply
saying he wanted to do business with Telstra.  She said that
she couldn't do
anything about that.
<P>

45  	Evidence was given also by Mr Harvey.  He read the letter and
had discussions with Margaret Fairman, another officer in Telecom
who was
interested in the matter raised in the letter.
<P>

46  	The issue will arise in the proceedings when the matter is
finally put before the jury as to whether, in fact, there was a
publication by
the defendants to Telecom.
<P>

47  	The plaintiffs will rely in part, it has been indicated so far
as this letter is concerned, on Ex W, the copy of the letter
identified by Ms
Hall, which has a transmission note dated 23 July 1993 from " C and G Sales T
Skalkos".  However, interestingly,
there is no evidence as to the
identification of the addressee by reference to the fax number of the addressee
on the document.
<P>

48  	In his submissions, Mr Littlemore referred me to the judgment of
Badgery-Parker J in the matter of<b> </b><u>New South Wales Aboriginal Land
Council v Perkins</u>. Unreported, CLD11262 of 1991, 15 August 1997.  His
Honour allowed a letter published to the Premier of New South Wales and the
alleged
defamation flowing from that letter to be the subject of a s.13
defence.
<P>

49  	I have read the judgment of Badgery-Parker J in relation to that
aspect, and given it such weight, if I may respectfully say
so, as I feel in
the circumstances of this particular case it bears.
<P>

50  	In his submissions Mr Littlemore stressed the limited
publication of the letter within the Prime Minister's Office and, to
the extent
that it was published to Ms de Salis, she gave no credence to it, and destroyed
it.
<P>

51  	He submitted that it was not "a grapevine case" and that in
considering publication within the meaning of s13, the Court is
necessarily
limited to what the plaintiffs have proved in that regard.
<P>

52  	Then, on the assumption that the issue of the publication to
Telecom will be established in favour of the plaintiffs, he again
focused upon
what he contends was the restricted publication of a different document to
three people in a section of Telecom.  He
submitted that the only publication
at Telecom was to Mr Harvey and Ms Hall and Ms Mitchell.
<P>

53  	Mr Littlemore submitted that it was only necessary for the
defendants to make out the s13 defence as being legally tenable,
and that was
relatively easy in the circumstances where the publication was to a small
number of persons, as it was to Telecom and
the Prime Minister's office, all of
such persons being acquainted with the plaintiffs and well able to make their
own judgments as
to the validity of the material in the letter.
<P>

54  	He stressed that this is a defence to the publication, not
strictly a defence to the imputations.  He referred to the necessity
to take
into consideration the nature of the published material, the manner in which it
was published, to whom it was published,
and the place of publication.
<P>

55  	The "circumstances of the publication", he contended must be a
reference to the actual publication not the intended publication.
<P>

56  	The matter one could not take in consideration, he submitted, in
the light of the authorities, is any evidence of harm, in
fact, suffered by the
plaintiffs as a result of the publications.
<P>

57  	He submitted that s140 and s142 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u>,
1995, established a Brigenshaw type standard.  I do not have any difficulties,
if I may so, with respect to that submission.
<P>

58  	I do not propose to set out the entirety of the legal arguments
that were put to me by Mr Littlemore, all of which have been
considered, and
are set out in the transcript.
<P>

59  	The question is: what is the test posed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13?</a>
<P>

60  	I have referred to the test, if I could use that expression,
identified by Mahoney JA in<b> </b><u>King and Mergen Holdings</u>, namely, the
defendants must negative not merely that there would be great or substantial
harm but that there be "harm" at all. 
Although, as his Honour stated, the
significance of what is required in this regard may require consideration in
subsequent cases.
<P>

61  	Another way of putting it, as I read the cases, is whether the
circumstances of the publication were such as to activate or
be capable of
activating <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13.</a>  Of course, in considering that question, one must look at the
entirety of the evidence as it exists and the specific matters relied
upon by
the defendants.
<P>

62  	Reluctant as one must necessarily be to express views on the
evidence, the evidence as it stands, and the authorities as I
read them, lead
inexorably, in my view, to the conclusion that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> is not available to the
defendants in this case, and in expressing that view, I take into account the
extent of the actual publication.
<P>

63  	The publication, firstly to the Prime Minister's office, the
highest political office within the country and concerned with
ethnic matters
and the ethnic media, could only be considered, in my view, as a matter of much
significance and propensity to cause
harm to the plaintiffs.
<P>

64  	In no sense at all, in my view, could that publication fall
within the concept of triviality, or the triviality defence as
it is sometimes
called, as explained in the cases.
<P>

65  	Thus, in my view, in relation to the first publication, I have
no alternative but to take away the defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> in relation to all
imputations.  There is no satisfactory way in which a different conclusion
could be reached in relation to any
of them.  I turn then to the Novosti
publication.
<P>

66  	The first plaintiff is not named in the Novosti publication,
only the second defendant.  The same, of course, applies to the
letter to the
Prime Minister.  The evidence would seem to indicate that there was a potential
readership of conservatively 14,000
members of the Australian/Serbian community
of Novosti.
<P>

67  	There is evidence from one, George Jaksic, (at page 465 and
following), who has been known to the first plaintiff for some
20 years.  Their
relationship flowed from various publishing roles, Mr Jaksic being by
occupation a publisher.
<P>

68  	He was born in Australia but speaks the Serbian language
fluently.
<P>

69  	He gave evidence, (page 467), that on the Sunday afternoon of 1
August 1993 his late father walked downstairs in his house
in Annandale, and
said:
<P>

"'George, I have got something interesting to show you.  You are dealing with
criminals again'.  I said `What the hell are you talking
about, Dad' and he
showed me the paper which is an edition of Novosti and turned to page 13 where
I was made aware of the open letter
to Paul Keating and I stopped and read
that".
<P>

70  	He read it, of course, in the Serbian language text.  He then
said:
<P>

"Then there was a level of discussion with my father. He said, `That is
Joseph'.  I said, `That's right'.  We say in Serbian `Yosip',
because he knows
I had a very strong relationship with Joseph Assaf".  
<P>

71  	Then there was some discussion about the publication.
<P>

72  	A question is obviously going to arise for resolution by the
jury as to that phrase, "That is Joseph".  It is clear from submissions,
that
Mr Littlemore will be putting to the jury that that phrase was expressed by Mr
Jaksic in an interrogative tone and, accordingly,
there should have been, to
give effect to that, a question mark after "Joseph" in the transcript.  That is
not to be a criticism
of the Court Reporting Branch, but Mr Littlemore's
contention of what the tone of the remark was.
<P>

73  	Of course, this is an important passage because it identifies
two persons, Mr Jaksic, the witness, and his late father, Mr
Jaksic Snr,
nominating Mr Assaf as being identifiable in the publication.
<P>

74  	There is no other evidence directly, or indirectly, to the
effect that a reader identified the first plaintiff as being related
to or the
person controlling ETCOM.  There is, however, evidence that in certain circles
the publication was discussed.
<P>

75  	Mr Littlemore has fairly conceded, if I may say so, that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a>
defence would not be available against the second plaintiff, no doubt in
reliance upon the authorities to the effect that a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> defence would only, in
exceptional circumstances, be available where there is publication in the mass
media.  I think that Novosti
could be included within that category.
<P>

76  	Of course, if the jury conclude in answer to the relevant
question, that the first plaintiff is not identifiable in the Novosti
article,
then the first plaintiff's claim, with regard to that publication, falls to the
ground and it will not be necessary in that
event for the jury to consider a
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> defence.
<P>

77  	However, be that as it may, I must deal with this application.
There is much evidence that, even up to the date of the publication
of the
Novosti article, Mr Assaf was, through the interposition of his company as well
as personally, actively involved as a community
leader in the ethnic community,
if I could use that expression.  He would have been well known in the ethnic
media.
<P>

78  	Readers of Novosti would be interested, one would think, with
the assertion made by the defendants to the Prime Minister that
the cost of
ethnic newspapers is being unreasonably increased by reason of the,
unnecessary, if I may use that somewhat neutral term,
activity of middlemen,
such as Ethnic Communications Pty Ltd.
<P>

79  	The publication must, one would think, be regarded for this
reason as a serious matter.
<P>

80  	Obviously, Mr Jaksic Snr took the view that it was a serious
matter.  Readers would be interested to know more about it.  Some
of them
would, one could reasonably infer, have some knowledge of Mr Assaf and his
connection with Ethnic Communications and the
ethnic media.
<P>

81  	If the jury is of the view that there was an identification of
Mr Assaf in the Novosti article then, in my view, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> would not run,
because of the width of the publication, its seriousness and the like.
<P>

82  	Thus, in my view, the defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> is not available in
relation to the second publication with regard to both plaintiffs in relation
to all imputations.  The defence
will be taken away from the jury with regard
to the second publication.  I so rule.
<P>
