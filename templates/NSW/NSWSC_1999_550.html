<b>50217/1997 - BAAN AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED v GEORGE WESTON FOODS LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	These proceedings were commenced by a Summons filed as long
ago as 1 December 1997, whereby the plaintiff, for which Mr A.J.L.
Bannon of
Senior Counsel and Mr A.J. Payne of Counsel apeared, sought declarations that
the defendant, for which Mr S.G. Finch of
Senior Counsel and Mr F. Kunc of
Counsel appeared, had wrongly repudiated the Software Licence and Support
Agreement and the Professional
Services Agreement entered into between the
parties and dated 31 December 1996; damages and ancillary relief.  The
plaintiff has
claimed substantial damages in consequence of the alleged
wrongful termination of these agreements.
<P>

2   	The defendant's Defence makes a number of admissions,
including admissions that amounts otherwise prima facie payable to the
plaintiff have not been paid; denies that it wrongfully repudiated the
agreements; and relies on the matters set forth in its Cross-Claim,
which was
filed on 13 March 1998 and to which a Defence was filed on 7 May 1998.
<P>

3   	The Cross-Claim sought declarations that the plaintiff had
breached the agreements upon which the plaintiff relies, and that
the defendant
was entitled to and did effectively terminate them on or about 12 November
1997, and that in consequence of that termination
the defendant is relieved
from any obligations or liabilities to the plaintiff under those agreements.
<P>

4   	In paragraph 5 a declaration was sought that the plaintiff
and its holding company, the second cross-defendant, engaged in
misleading or
deceptive conduct in breach of s.52 of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> 1974 and,
in paragraph 6, that it made false representations in breach of s.53 of that
Act.  Orders were sought under s.87 of that
Act, and for damages and ancillary
relief.
<P>

5   	The Cross-Claim alleged breaches of a number of terms of
the agreement, and repudiatory conduct and, commencing at paragraph
69, relied
upon a number of representations allegedly made by the plaintiff, which it is
asserted were false and/or misleading or
deceptive, or likely to mislead or
deceive in various ways.  Further representations were pleaded.
<P>

<b>Determination of Separate Issues</b>
<P>

6   	On 15 May 1998 the matter came before Giles CJCommD.  His
Honour ordered, inter alia, that questions set out in a schedule
attached to
draft Short Minutes of Orders, which the parties brought in, be determined as
preliminary questions.  In doing so he
noted that the parties were giving
further consideration to the questions and an amended schedule and that, if
there were to be any
amendments, they should be prepared and agreed within
twenty one days.  The schedule set forth a number of questions relating to
whether the representations pleaded in various paragraphs of the Cross-Claim
were made and, if so, when; whether other representations
were made; and
whether certain terms were terms of the agreement.  Thereafter further
questions were asked as to whether representations
were made by the plaintiff
in trade or commerce.
<P>

7   	There can be no doubt that careful consideration was given
to this approach not only by the parties, but also by his Honour.
 The reason
for having the separate questions was so that the defendant would be in a
position to know, inter alia, the extent to
which it had to consider testing
procedures carried out by it on various pieces of equipment which, in turn, is
dependent upon whether
the representations and contractual terms for which it
contends were made and were part of the contract.
<P>

8   	There can be little doubt, in my mind, that the asking of
separate questions in relation to whether a representation was made,
without
further questions and in circumstances where witnesses to the representations
may also be witnesses in relation to other
portions of the proceedings, can
lead to great inconvenience in the conduct of the proceedings.  These matters
were well known to
Giles CJCommD and, I have no doubt, the parties.
None-the-less, the orders were sought and made.
<P>

9   	On 16 September 1998 an Amended Cross-Claim was filed and,
generally speaking, by that document the defendant sought to rely
upon certain
representations admittedly made by the plaintiff, in addition to the
representations it had previously pleaded.  This
led to an issue under s.51A of
the Act arising in the sense that the further issue was raised as to whether
the defendant had reasonable
grounds for making the representations.
<P>

10   	When the matter came before me on 18 September 1998 I gave
certain directions, and I noted that the parties would attempt
to agree on a
revised list of questions for preliminary determination to replace those
ordered by Giles CJCommD on 15 May 1998.
<P>

11   	This procedure was also being accompanied by discovery and
inspection of documents, it being perceived that that was a necessary
process
in relation to the formulation and, more importantly, the answering of the
questions to be raised.
<P>

12   	On 23 October 1998 I made orders in accordance with Short
Minutes of Order, and I added:-
<P>

<b>"The only further observation I would make is that where matters are to be
heard as separate questions it will ultimately be a matter
for the Court's
determination when it has seen the questions."</b>
<P>

13   	On 20 November 1998 the matter came back before me and, by
consent, I vacated the orders made by Giles CJCommD on 15 May 1998,
and ordered
that the questions set out in several lists be determined as preliminary
questions.  I made further directions including
that discovery be by tranches,
that the defendant file and serve any affidavits in support of the preliminary
questions on or before
29 January 1999, and that the cross-defendants, being
the plaintiff and its holding company, file and serve any affidavits in support
of the preliminary questions on or before 5 March 1999.
<P>

<b>What Happened Thereafter</b>
<P>

14   	On 11 December 1998 I extended the time for the furnishing
of evidence and, on 26 March 1999, I again extended that time.
<P>

15   	When the matter came before me on 28 May 1999 the
defendant made application for further and better discovery.  I then raised
with the parties my disquiet about the separate questions and the time being
taken to have them determined.  The Notice of Motion
for further discovery was
made returnable on 4 June 1999 on which dated Mr Bannon submitted that the time
had now come to re-visit
the matter as to whether separate questions should be
determined, or whether the proceedings should not go forward in the ordinary
way, viz on all grounds.  Mr Finch resisted a change in the procedural regime
which had been put in place.
<P>

16   	Mr Bannon's submissions were that at the time there was
agreement to the separate questions it was envisaged that they would
be heard
reasonably promptly, and that the situation had been further complicated by the
defendant's reliance upon the representations
admittedly made by the plaintiff,
which resulted in the issue under s.51A, inter alia, being raised.  He
submitted that it was quite
inappropriate, at this time, to allow the matter to
proceed on separate questions and, as I understood his submissions, that that
had always been the case, it being the defendant who "championed" that
particular approach.  He further submitted that the only party
to benefit from
the separate questions was the defendant because by having them answered it
restricted the work it was required to
do in relation to testing equipment,
amongst other things, to determine how the balance of the case should be
fought.
<P>

17   	On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that the
course of separate questions had been charted since 15 May 1998 and confirmed
by me in November 1998 and that, in these circumstances, the defendant had
proceeded on that basis and incurred considerable expense
in preparing the case
for the hearing of those questions.  It was submitted that whilst there may be
some overlap in witnesses on
other issues, the defendant had been entitled,
since 15 May 1998, to proceed as it had, and that in reality the only
articulated
reason for any change in the plaintiff's approach had been brought
about in consequence of the observations I had made on 28 May
1999.  To this I
should add that perhaps other reasons were the delay in preparing the separate
questions for hearing, with which
the question of discovery and inspection
seemed to be linked.
<P>

<b>The Present Position</b>
<P>

18   	I have considerable sympathy for the plaintiff in the
circumstance in which it finds itself.  It obviously never contemplated
that
its consent, in so far as it did consent, to separate questions would put it in
its present position.  It contemplated that
it would have its case on and heard
long before this.  None-the-less, that sympathy is lessened to some extent by
the fact that if
it did not actively consent, there was acquiescence by the
plaintiff in the course proposed by the defendant.
<P>

19   	I have, on a number of occasions, set forth my
disinclination to make orders for the hearing of separate questions.  The
reasons
are essentially that in the majority of cases, particularly where the
separate questions relate to factual issues, there is little
likelihood of
their answers bringing about any final resolution at first instance to the
issues involved, and there is the real risk
that the overlapping of witnesses
will mean that at least two Judges have to hear the proceedings because of the
difficulties brought
about by adverse findings of fact against one or other of
the parties, especially where there are decisions based on credit:
<b>Australian National Industries Limited v Spedley Securities Limited (in
liq)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 411.</a>  Further, many answers to separate questions
merely stimulate an application for leave to appeal and the parties become
engaged in
far more litigation than otherwise would be the case.  These are
only some of the reasons, which I have mentioned in greater detail
in other
judgments and with which I do not propose to encumber these reasons.  Suffice
to say that the experience with this matter
will merely harden my prima facie
view that in most cases it is inappropriate to order separate questions.
Generally the advantages
said to arise are illusory and provide, in the end, no
real benefit to the parties or the overall administration of justice.
Particularly
must that be so where not only are questions as to the making of
representations involved, but so also are questions of reliance
and falsity.
In the present case this is compounded by the onus which falls upon the
plaintiff pursuant to s.51A.
<P>

20   	That all having been said, however, I think that in the
present case I am bound by the position, because the Court has acquiesced
in
the course the parties, and more particularly the defendant, put forward.  This
occurred on two occasions and the stage has now
been reached where the
defendant will have its evidence on by 25 June 1999.  I think, in all those
circumstances, that the time has
passed when the Court can reverse the process,
which it has allowed to continue.  In saying this I must bear in mind that in
November
1998 I reserved to myself the right to disallow the further questions,
but I did not take that course.
<P>

21   	I must also have regard to the fact that if the course of
proceedings is to be changed Mr Finch wishes to put on evidence
to show the
expense and cost to which the defendant has been put by following the
procedures to which the Court has been prepared
to accede and, from that, I am
prepared to infer that such costs have been quite considerable.
<P>

22   	For these reasons, which have been contributed to by the
lack of more resolute opposition at an earlier time from the defendant
to the
separate questions, I do not consider that it is appropriate to change the
course of the proceedings.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

23   	I direct that the defendants file and serve all affidavits
upon which they seek to rely in relation to the separate questions
by 4 pm on
Friday, 25 June 1999.  I stand the proceedings over for further mention to
Friday, 2 July 1999.
