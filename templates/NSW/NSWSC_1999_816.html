<b><u>4789/97 NICHOLAS PAUL DRIVER Liquidator of TILSE BUILDING PTY LIMITED (IN
LIQUIDATION) v COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Outline</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff as liquidator of Tilse Building Pty Ltd seeks
a declaration that the payments of two sums of money, the first
of $10 000 and
the second two payments totalling $84 425.40 to the Commissioner of Taxation
are void as against the liquidator on
the ground that they are insolvent
transactions within s588FE of the Corporations Law.  The plaintiff further
seeks orders pursuant
to s.588FF of the Corporations Law directing the
defendant to pay those sums of money to the liquidator.
<P>

<b>Background Facts</b>
<P>

2   	Tilse Building Pty Ltd was a company engaged primarily in
the business of home building.  By 1993 the company was experiencing
a downturn
in the level of work done which resulted in a significant impact on the
company's cash flow and its ability to service
its creditors.  The company had
problems with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) which included failing to
lodge group and Prescribed
Payments Scheme(PPS) tax returns on time and failure
to pay group, Prescribed Payments tax and income tax liabilities by the due
date.  In July 1994 the ATO served a Creditor's statutory demand on the
company.
<P>

3   	In August 1994 the company lodged a request for an amended
assessment in respect of its 1991 income tax return as the company's
records
had overstated the work in progress value and so the disclosed income was
overstated.  On 16 December 1994 an amended assessment
was issued by the
Commissioner for a credit of $62 517.40.  This sum was then applied pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/s172.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.172</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</a> (Cth) by the Commissioner to the
company's unpaid PPS liability:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/s172.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 172</a> is as follows: 
<P>

172. (1) 	Where, by reason of an amendment of an assessment, a person's
liability to tax is reduced:
<P>

(a) 	the amount by which the tax is so reduced shall be taken, for the purposes
of sections 170AA, 207 and 207A, never to have been
payable; and
<P>

(b) 	the Commissioner shall:
<P>

(i) 	refund the amount of any tax overpaid; or
<P>

(ii) 	apply the amount of any tax overpaid against any liability of the person
to the Cth, being a liability arising under, or by
virtue of, an Act of which
the Commissioner has the general administration, and refund any part of the
amount not so applied.
<P>

4   	In February 1995 the company lodged a request for an
amended assessment in respect of its 1993 income tax return, and an amended
assessment issued gave the company a PPS tax credit of $21 908.  This sum was
then applied by the Commissioner to tax liabilities
owed by the company
pursuant to s221YHG(2) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> which is as follows:
<P>

221YHG
<P>

(2) 	Where, in a case to which none of subsections (3), (4) and (4A) applies, a
person is entitled to a credit under section 221YHF,
the Commissioner shall:
<P>

(a)	if the amount of the credit does not exceed the tax payable by the person
under an assessment in relation to the year of income
in which the deductions
to which the credit relates were made - apply the amount of the credit in
payment or part payment of that
tax; and
<P>

(b)	if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax payable - apply:
<P>

(i)	so much of the amount of credit as does not exceed the tax in payment of
the tax; and
<P>

(ii)	so much of the excess as does not exceed the amount of any other tax
payable by the person in payment or part payment of that
other tax.
<P>

5   	These two sums make a total of $84,425.40 which the
Commissioner has applied to the outstanding tax liability of the company.
 The
other payment which the liquidator seeks to have declared void is the payment
by the company to the Commissioner in November
1994 of $10 000 by cheque drawn
on the account of the company.
<P>

6   	In April 1995 Mr Driver was appointed voluntary
administrator, and in May liquidator of the company.  There is evidence that
the company was insolvent from at least 24 October 1994.  A number of creditors
had commenced legal action, 65% of creditors had
been outstanding for a period
in excess of 60 days trading terms and a large number of cheques had been
dishonoured by the company's
bank.
<P>

<b>The sum of $84,425.40</b>
<P>

7   	This amount represents the two sums of money outlined
above.  The plaintiff seeks orders pursuant to s588FF of the Corporations
Law
that these payments are void against him.  The relevant sections of the
Corporations Law are set out hereunder   They are set
out in logical order for
consideration of the questions which arise in this action: 
<P>

s.588FE (2) 	The transaction is voidable if:
<P>

(a) 	it is an insolvent transaction of the company; and
<P>

(b) 	it was entered into, or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect
to it:
<P>

(i) 	during the 6 months ending on the relation back day; or
<P>

(ii) 	after that day but on or before the day when the winding up began
<P>

s.588FC	A transaction is an insolvent transaction of the company if, and only
if, it is an unfair preference given by the company,
or an uncommercial
transaction of the company, and:
<P>

(a) 	any of the following happens at a time when the company is insolvent:
<P>

			(i) 	the transaction is entered into;
<P>

(ii) 	an act is done, or an omission is made, for the purpose of giving effect
to the transaction;
<P>

s. 588FA(1) 	A transaction is an unfair preference given by a company to a
creditor of the company if, and only if:
<P>

(a)	the company and the creditor are parties to the transaction; and
<P>

(b) 	the transaction results in the creditor receiving from the company, in
respect of an unsecured debt that the company owes to
the creditor, more than
the creditor would receive from the company in respect of the debt if the
transaction were set aside and
the creditor were to prove for the debt in a
winding up of the company; 
<P>

even if the transaction is entered into, is given effect to, or is required to
be given effect to, because of an order of an Australian
court or a direction
by an agency.
<P>

8   	The first question to be determined is whether the
application of each of the sums of money by the Commissioner constitutes
a
transaction to which both the company and the Commissioner are parties. Section
9 of the Corporations Law defines "transaction"
as follows:
<P>

"transaction", in Pt5.7B, in relation to a body corporate or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/index.html#p5.7" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7</a> body,
means a transaction to which the body is a party; for example (but without
limitation):
<P>

(a)	a conveyance, transfer or other disposition by the body of property of the
body, and
<P>

(b)	a charge created by the body on property of the body; and
<P>

(c)	a guarantee given by the body; and
<P>

(d)	a payment made by the body; and
<P>

(e)	an obligation incurred by the body; and
<P>

(f)	a release or waiver by the body; and
<P>

(g)	a loan to the body;
<P>

and includes such a transaction that has been completed or given effect to, or
that has terminated;
<P>

9   	It will be noted that the requirement for the company to be
a party appears both in the definition section and in s588FA(1)(a).
 It was
indicated by Counsel that there was no case on this point and I have not found
any.  There is I think little doubt that the
payments would have been "undue
preferences" under  s451(1) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code which is as
follows:
<P>

A settlement, a conveyance or transfer of property, a charge on property, a
payment made, or an obligation incurred, by a company
that, if it had been made
or incurred by a natural person, would, in the event of his becoming a
bankrupt, be void as against the
trustee in the bankruptcy, is, in the event of
the company being wound up, void as against the liquidator.
<P>

The application would be characterised as a 'payment' pursuant to s.451.  In
<b><cite>Re Hardman</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%204%20ABC%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 4 ABC 207</a> at 210 it was held that
'payment' may include a mere transfer of figures in an account without any
money passing.
<P>

10   	The question then is whether the requirement that the
company be a party to the transaction changes this.  The plaintiff submitted
it
was a transaction, relying on the reasoning in <b><cite>Re Peter Austin
Ltd</cite> </b>[1990] 2 NZLR 245<b>.  </b>That case involved a company which
had acted as agent of and advisor to an insolvent company and held certain
funds on its behalf.
 Some of these funds were transferred by the company
holding them to itself in order to satisfy fees due to it without the specific
authorisation of the insolvent company.  Tipping J said at 248
<P>

that the transfer of funds out of McIlroy-Kelly's trust account into its
general account constituted a relevant disposition, being
a payment from funds
belonging beneficially to the company to McIlroy-Kelly beneficially.  It is not
necessary for present purposes
to examine whether the payment was authorised
directly by the company or was justified by dint of the fact that McIlroy Kelly
had
a lien on the funds or in some other way.  The simple fact is that by means
of the appropriate book entries payment was made from
the company to
McIlroy-Kelly; indeed the transaction could also be described appropriately as
a transfer of property.
<P>

He then went on to say at 249 that:
<P>

 in the present case the company suffered a payment or a transfer of its
property at the hands of McIlroy-Kelly.  Thus the liquidators
have established
the first necessary point, namely that the transaction was of a qualifying
kind.
<P>

11   	Although the facts seem similar to the present case
<b><cite>Re Peter Austin Ltd</cite> </b>dealt with the New Zealand <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1955107/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies
Act 1955</a>.  The relevant section of that Act dealing with unfair preferences is
as follows:
<P>

s.309 (1A) In the case of a voluntary winding up, every conveyance or transfer
of property, every security or charge given over
any property, every obligation
incurred, every payment made (including any payment made in pursuance of a
judgment or order of a
Court), by any company unable to pay its debts as they
become due from its own money, shall be voidable as against the liquidator,
if
- 
<P>

(a) 	it is in favour of any creditor or any person in trust for any creditor;
and
<P>

(b) 	The making, suffering, paying, or incurring of the same occurs within one
month before the commencement of the winding up of
the company:
<P>

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall apply to any such transaction or
any such payment in respect of any liability incurred
or accruing due, during
or after the said period.
<P>

12   	This section like s.451(1) of the Companies (New South
Wales) Code in contrast to s.9 of the Corporations Law does not require
the
company to be a party to the transaction for a transaction to exist.  Therefore
the court in <b><cite>Re Peter Austin</cite></b> did not address the issue of
whether the company was a party to the transaction when concluding that a
transaction existed for the
purposes of the Act.  The case did hold the
transfer to be a "transaction" but went no further than that.
<P>

13   	The Commissioner submits that where pursuant to a
statutory authority or requirement he applies a tax credit of a company
to
other liabilities of the company to him there is no transaction to which the
company is a party since each application is an activity
in which only the
Commissioner is engaged.  He relied on the reasoning of Emmett J in
<b><cite>Commissioner of Taxation v Macquarie Health Corp</cite> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2017%20ACLC%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 17
ACLC 171</a><b>.</b>  That case involved the giving of notice by the Commissioner
under section 218 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> to creditors of a company
requiring them to pay to the Commissioner money which they owed to the company.
Emmett J held at 196 that
this was not a transaction to which the company was a
party, although it may have been a transaction of the Commissioner concerning
the company.  He also said:
<P>

The term `transaction' entails a juridical act to which the relevant company is
"a party".  The definition of transaction in relation
to a body corporate
refers to a conveyance, transfer or other disposition by the body or a charge
created by the body.  Indeed every
example given in the definition of
transaction refers to a juridical act by the body other than paragraph (g)
which refers to a loan
to the body.
<P>

14   	In the instant case while the company by furnishing
amended assessments set in progress the issue of credits and the application
under attack of those credits towards its outstanding liabilities that does not
make it a party to the transaction.  I have come
to the conclusion that a
company cannot be a party to a transaction unless it takes some part in it.
Being an unknowing recipient
of a credit with the Commissioner of Taxation does
not amount to taking a part.  The application of the credit is in fact a
unilateral
act.  I agree with the judgment of Emmett J
<P>

15   	The liquidator sought also to rely on section 221YHF (5)
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> which provides that where the Commissioner has
applied an amount of credit in payment of an amount of tax payable by a person,
the
person shall be deemed to have paid the amount so applied.  Thus the
company is deemed to have paid that amount.  The Commissioner
argued that this
subsection does not manifest a legislative intention that such an application
is deemed to be a payment made by
the company for the general purposes of the
law, , but rather it is limited to its income tax law context, that is for the
purposes
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a>.  This issue was considered by Fisher
J in <b><cite>Commissioner of Taxation v Comber</cite> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20FCR%2088" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 FCR 88</a><b>
</b>, a case which dealt with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</a> , a deeming
provision about  payments of dividends.  He concluded at 94 that deeming
provisions are required by their nature to be
construed strictly and the court
should not extend by implication the express application of a statutory fiction
which is only applicable
in its particular context.  This was followed by Hill
J in  <b><cite>East Finchley Pty Ltd</cite> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2090%20ALR%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 90 ALR 457</a> at 478 who
held that the effect of a deeming clause will operate only for the purposes of
the particular statute.  Further in <b><cite>Commissioner of Taxation v
Macquarie Health Corp</cite> </b> at 196, Emmett J said:
<P>

A notice under section 218 is given without reference to the relevant taxpayer
and will normally be given without the knowledge
of the relevant taxpayer.
Further, it will often, although not necessarily, be given against the will or
wishes of the relevant taxpayer.
 In those circumstances, it could not be said
that a taxpayer is a participant in any sense in the giving of a notice or in
the consequences
which follow from the giving of the notice, whatever those
consequences in law may be.  Accordingly, a taxpayer is not in any sense
a
party to a section 218 notice or the giving of a section 218 notice". 
<P>

Under section 218 (4) of the Assessment Act, any person making any payment in
pursuance of section 218:
<P>

shall be deemed to have been acting under the authority of the taxpayer and all
other persons concerned and is hereby indemnified
in respect of such
payment"
<P>

It is clear that in most circumstances there will be no actual direction or
authority given by the relevant taxpayer to the debtor
of that taxpayer.
Absent such a direction or authority and absent a provision such as section
218(4), a recipient of a notice who
made a payment in accordance with its terms
may well not obtain a discharge of the indebtedness to the relevant taxpayer.
The effect
of s.218(4), however, is that when the recipient of a notice makes a
payment in accordance with its terms, the recipient will be
able to obtain a
good receipt from the Commissioner in respect of the payment.
<P>

The effect of section 218(4) is to deem to have occurred something which did
not occur.  It has effect on the assumption that the
relevant taxpayer has not
participated in the arrangement whereby the relevant taxpayer's debt makes a
payment to the Commissioner.
 Thus, section 218(4) could not have the effect of
involving the relevant taxpayer as a participant in the transaction whereby the
consequences of giving a notice, whatever those consequences in law may be,
arise.
<P>

I do not consider that a relevant taxpayer can be said to be a party to the
giving of a notice under section 218, notwithstanding
that, upon the giving of
the notice, the authority of the taxpayer is deemed to be given for a payment
to be made by the recipient
in accordance with the terms of the notice.
Accordingly, since the effect of the giving of a notice under section 218 is to
create
a charge or other analogous rights in respect of indebtedness of the
recipient to the relevant taxpayer, there would not be a transaction
of the
taxpayer within the meaning section 588FE of the Law."
<P>

16   	In light of these cases I conclude that the deeming
provision of s.221YHF(5) does not make the company a party to the application
of the money.  
<P>

17   	It follows the application of the sum of $84 425.40 was
not a transaction as defined by s9 and s588FA(1)(a) of the Corporations
Law.  I
should add that it seems to me this is a result which gives the Commissioner an
advantage which he ought not to have, so
that if I am correct the unfair result
should be remedied by appropriate legislation.
<P>

<b>The sum of $10 100</b>
<P>

18   	This amount was a sum of money paid by Tilse Pty Ltd to
the Commissioner in respect of outstanding tax liabilities.  The cheque
was
drawn by the company on 22 November 1994 and received by the defendant on 24
November 1994.   This is clearly a transaction to
which the Commissioner and
the company were both parties.  Once the payment was established it was not
contended that the transaction
was not an unfair preference.
<P>

19   	I will hear any submissions on interest and costs and will
otherwise make orders to give effect to these reasons.
