<b><u>20875/94   -   ULAN COAL MINES PTY LIMITED  v  HUNTER AREA HEALTH SERVICE
and KIM ALEXANDER ANTHONY OSTINGA</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b>The plaintiff (Ulan) was the employer
of John Mini (Mini) who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on 15 November
1988 in circumstances
giving rise to payments to him and of expenses on his
behalf pursuant to the Worker' Compensation Act 1987.  The first defendant
owned and managed Royal Newcastle Hospital and the second defendant was a
visiting medical officer practising, inter alia, at that
hospital.  Mini was
treated by hospital staff and the second defendant in respect of injuries
sustained in the accident.  It is alleged
that such treatment was negligently
performed thus increasing the extent of Mini's incapacity beyond what it would
have been if reasonable
care had been taken in treating the original injuries.
Ulan alleges that the payments it was required to make pursuant to the Act
to
and for Mini would have been significantly reduced if his incapacity had not
been extended by the negligence of the defendants.
 Mini sued the defendants in
this Court and recovered monetary compensation from them as a result of
settlement of that action. 
Neither Mini nor the defendants reimbursed Ulan for
any payments of compensation, particularly in respect of payments referrable
to
the extended incapacity of Mini alleged to have been caused by the negligence
of the defendants.
<P>

2   	The foregoing is a synopsis of an agreed statement of facts
for the purpose of determination of a separate question ordered
pursuant to
Part 31 rule 2 namely "whether on the facts as agreed or proved, did the
defendants or either of them owe a duty of care
to the plaintiff."
<P>

3   	The additional evidence consisted of documentary material
which I find demonstrated that both the defendants were aware that
Mini was
being treated by them for injuries in respect of which he had an entitlement to
worker's compensation benefit and it was
foreseeable that an employer would
incur expense in meeting its obligation to provide such benefit and further,
that if the period
of Mini's incapacity were extended by negligent conduct on
their part, that employer would incur inflated expense referrable to the
longer
period.  That foresight is an essential ingredient in the foundation of a cause
of action but does not alone found one.
<P>

4   	Mr Harrison SC for the defendants pointed out that the
terms of the plaintiff's pleading (Amended Statement of Claim filed
19 August
1996) asserted that "each of the defendants owed to the employee (Mini), and
therefore to the plaintiff (Ulan), a duty
of care ....... "(paragraph 18) and
the assignments of negligence (paragraphs 21 and 22) were in similar terms.  I
agree with his
contention that tort liability is not derivative or subrogative
and a plaintiff can obtain damages for breach of duty owing to himself
and not
for breach of duty to another.  It is not presently necessary to qualify my
general agreement by reference to apparently
anomalous actions such as damages
for nervous shock and <i>per quod servitium amisit</i>.  However the separate
question, despite the pleadings, was argued in its terms of whether the
defendants or either of them owed
a duty of care to Ulan which, if exists, in
my view must be owed directly by them to the plaintiff.  It should also be
mentioned
that Ulan's pleading does not claim a cause of action <i>per quod
servitium amisit</i> nor does it claim recovery pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151z.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151Z</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act 1987</a>.  Mr Levy SC who appeared with Mr Renwick for
Ulan expressly submitted that the plaintiff's claim was not addressed by the
lastmentioned
provision but that "statutory silence" did not abolish right to
common law action otherwise available.  I agree with that generality
but the
essential question is whether such action is available in this case.  
<P>

5   	It is convenient to sketch in outline the argument by
Ulan.
<P>

6   	The elements of a cause of action in negligence were stated
by Deane J in <b>Jaensch v Coffey</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155 CLR 549</a> @ 586 to be in a form
appropriate to that case (which was a claim for damages for nervous shock at
common law):
<P>

"...(i) a relevant duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff to take
reasonable care resulting from the combination of (a) reasonable
foreseeability
of a real risk that injury of the kind sustained by the plaintiff would be
sustained either by the plaintiff, as an
identified individual, or by a member
of a class which included the plaintiff,  (b) existence of the requisite
element of proximity
in the relationship between the parties with respect to
the relevant act or omission and the injury sustained, and   (c) absence
of any
statutory provision or other common law rule (e.g., that relating to hazards
inherent in a joint illegal enterprise) which
operates to preclude the
implication of such a duty of care to the plaintiff in the circumstances of the
case; (ii) a breach of that
duty of care in that the doing of the relevant act
or the doing of it in the manner in which it was done was, in the light of all
relevant factors, inconsistent with what a reasonable man would do by way of
response to the foreseeable risk (see <b>Wyong Shire Council v Shire</b> (1980)
146 CLR at pp 47-48; <b>The Wagon Mound (No 2)</b> [1967] 1 AC at pp 641-643
and <b>Schiller v Mulgrave Shire Council</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1972/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%20129%20CLR%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 129 CLR 116</a> at pp 131-132;
and (iii) injury (of a kind which the law recognizes as sounding in damages)
which was caused by the defendant's carelessness
and which was within the
limits of reasonable foreseeability."
<P>

7   	It is recognized that the damage now sought to be claimed
is for pure economic loss.  It might be interpolated that Deane J
in the
foregoing definition "left to another day" the question whether all actions in
negligence, including actions involving pure
economic injury, can properly be
accommodated within that framework structured as it is upon reasonable
foreseeability.  However
pure economic loss does give rise to action if a
defendant has knowledge or means of knowledge that a particular person, not
merely
a member of an unascertained class, will be likely to be injured
provided there is "appropriate proximity":  <b>Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty
Limited v The Dredge Willemstad</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1976%20136%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1976 136 CLR 529.</a>  
<P>

8   	The fulfilment of that proviso is of course the essential
focus of the present dispute.  Reference was made to the adjectival
trio of
proximities described by Deane J in <b>Jaensch</b> physical, circumstantial and
causal although counsel did not elect to seek to limit the current claim within
any particular one of
those classifying words.  
<P>

9   	In summary it was submitted that necessary proximity had
been made out because there was no prospect of an indeterminate liability
in
the circumstances of the plaintiff's claim; the class of persons to whom the
claimed duty was owed was readily ascertainable;
the duty did not supplant or
impermissibly supplement other extant legal remedies, and there would be no
double recovery by the plaintiff
in the circumstances.
<P>

10   	Therefore, although it was acknowledged that no precedent
could be found for allowing a claim in such circumstances, mere
novelty was no
bar and the necessary criteria for actionability had been established.  A final
obstacle however was perceived in
the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal
(Winneke P, Brooking and Hayne JJA) in <b>Scott v Bowyer</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%201%20VR%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1998 1 VR 207.</a>
<P>

11   	Some detailed attention to that case is appropriate.  A
young boy (Wolstenholme) was employed by newsagents (Bowyer) to deliver
newspapers.  He rode a bicycle upon his rounds in the course of which he came
into collision with a motor car driven by one Scott.
 The boy was rendered
quadriplegic.  Bowyer became liable to pay worker's compensation benefits to
and on behalf of Wolstenholme.
 The expenses accumulated to more than $1.5m.
Bowyer sued Scott.  The initiating pleading was described by the Court of
Appeal as
"at best, exiguous" but it was treated as claiming an indemnity
pursuant to the terms of Victorian worker's compensation legislation
and,
alternatively, pursuing a claim in negligence.  Their Honours made these
observations about those claims:
<P>

"It (the claim in negligence) is, of course, a wider claim because it
contemplates an assessment of damages not only for compensation
payments
already made but for such payments as are likely to be made in the future
pursuant to the relevant workers compensation
scheme.  The scheme, on the other
hand, contemplates only an indemnity in respect of payments made, which
indemnity is reducible
depending upon whether the worker has been found
responsible wholly or in part for his own injuries and/or whether the employer
has
been found to be legally liable for such injuries.  Thus the employer's
statutory right of recovery is  circumscribed by provisions
which have as their
evident purpose an adjustment of the cost burden of the compensation scheme and
which do not necessarily follow
strict common law principles."
<P>

12   	The trial judge found both Wolstenholme and Scott
negligent in their roles as cyclist and motorist and apportioned responsibility
70 percent and 30 percent respectively.  This apportionment was not disturbed
on appeal.
<P>

13   	The trial judge was said to have appeared to have
determined that Scott owed Bowyer a duty of care in respect of the damage
constituted by the liability to pay medical and like expenses and weekly
payments to Wolstenholme.  Although in the present case
Ulan had a liability to
Mini in respect of what might be called the consequences of original injury in
the motor vehicle accident,
in respect of the extended liability as a
consequence of the alleged negligence of the defendants the situation is in
principle indistinguishable
from the Victorian case.
<P>

14   	The authorities relied upon by the judge of first instance
were collated by the Court of Appeal:

<b>Sydney City Council v Bosnich</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%203%20NSWR%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 3 N.S.W.R. 725</a>, where an employee
was injured in a motor accident and his employer sought to recover three
different kinds of payment that had been
made.  The first was weekly payments
of workers compensation ($353.78).  The second was medical and hospital
expenses paid pursuant
to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act</a> ($76.25).  The third
was accident pay ($85.52), provided for by an industrial award.  The plaintiff
sought to recover all three amounts
in a per quod action and alleged in
addition that the weekly payments of compensation and the medical and like
expenses were recoverable
by reason of the express right of indemnity created
by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act</a>.  The Court of Appeal held that all three
amounts were recoverable and the only difference between its members concerned
the scope
of the per quod claim.  Asprey J.A. considered that the payments of
all three kinds could be recovered in the per quod action, while
Sugarman A.P.
considered that only the accident pay could be recovered in the per quod claim:
the workers compensation payments were
in his Honour's view recoverable only
under the statute, since those payments were `the subject of a special
statutory remedy under
s 64(1)(b) of the Act which in my opinion excludes the
common law remedy in cases to which it is applicable.'  The third member of
the
court, Hardie A.J.A., found it unnecessary to express any opinion on this
point."
<P>

15   	Their Honours also recorded supplementary authority
referred to in the appeal namely:
<P>

"........<b>Pratt &amp; Goldsmith v Pratt</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1975/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] VicRp 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20VR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] V.R. 378</a> and <b>Kirkham v
Boughey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1958%5d%202%20QB%20338" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1958] 2 Q.B. 338.</a>  In the first of these cases Adam and Crockett
JJ., at 387, referred to the Perpetual Trustee case and Scott's case and spoke
of
the recoverability of a loss which `has arisen as an expense which the third
party was under a legal duty to discharge'.  In the
second case, Diplock J., at
342, explained the right of a husband to recover the cost of his wife's medical
treatment, and the parent's
right to recover the cost of treating an injured
infant, as lying in the legal duty to provide the treatment."
<P>

16   	The Court observed that senior counsel submitted that as
between Scott and Bowyer there was causal proximity and did not argue
that the
case could be viewed as one of physical or circumstantial proximity.  It was
commented that it was by no means apparent
that the case should be regarded as
one of causal proximity.  
<P>

17   	The Court concluded that no relationship of proximity
should be held to exist in relation to the driving of Scott and the
kind of
loss sustained by Bowyer.  The Court also dealt with a separate issue
concerning the measurement of the scope of liability
under the statutory claim
for indemnity which it is unnecessary to examine in this case.  
<P>

18   	In written submission Ulan (at least tacitly) recognized
the identity of principle to be determined in answer to the present
separate
question and the claim in negligence in <b>Scott</b> and contended that the
judgment was "unconvincing and should not be followed".  It was stated that the
"....reasons for failing to
find proximity boiled down to novelty, some
equivocal contrary dicta, and unjustified `floodgates' fear and an
inappropriate view
that the worker's compensation legislation indemnity
provisions ought to be regarded as fair and sufficient". 
<P>

19   	It is true that in <b>Scott</b> the Court said that
"having regard to the statutory right to an indemnity which existed at the
relevant time in the present case,
it seems to us not to be fair and reasonable
to hold that a relationship of proximity existed so as to give rise to the duty
of care
alleged" (@ p217) and that it is arguable that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Worker's
Compensation Act 1987</a> may have left a gap in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151z.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151Z</a> where the worker has
obtained damages against a tortfeasor not responsible for the injury for which
compensation was payable under
the Act but for extending the period during
which such payments had to be made, nevertheless that was but one of the
reasons expressed
for holding that no duty of care was owed at common law by
Scott towards Bowyer.  In addition my attention was drawn to the judgment
of
Stein JA (with whom Mason P and Handley JA agreed) in <b>G.I.O. Australia
Limited v Robson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1997%2042%20NSWLR%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1997 42 NSWLR 439</a> @ 448 where his Honour said:
<P>

"In my view, s 151Z(1)(d) does not exclude any common law right to recover
damages for loss of services of an employee."
<P>

20   	That case was decided after <b>Scott v Bowyer</b>.  There
is reference in the judgment of Mason P.  The issue was whether the action
<i>per quod servitium amisit</i> had been impliedly abolished by the statute
and the answer to that was in the negative.  That conclusion was not
inconsistent with
<b>Scott</b> and nothing was said to indicate any reservation
of the members of the Court about that decision otherwise.  
<P>

21   	I am not bound to follow a decision of the Victorian Court
of Appeal but in the Australian context, particularly on an issue
of common
law, I consider that I should follow its decision unless I am convinced that it
was wrong.  I am not so convinced.  
<P>

22   	Senior counsel for the plaintiff forcefully referred to
the perception that the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of negligent
conduct of the defendants and submitted that the common law was not so sterile
as to be incapable of bringing forth a remedy.  I
could only respond to that
submission in the plaintiff's favour by declining to follow <b>Scott v
Bowyer</b> which I have indicated is a course as a judge of first instance I am
not prepared to adopt. 
<P>

23   	I answer the separate question whether on the facts agreed
and proved the defendants or either of them owed a duty of care
to the
plaintiff in the negative.  
<P>

24   	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the
trial of the separate issue.
<P>
