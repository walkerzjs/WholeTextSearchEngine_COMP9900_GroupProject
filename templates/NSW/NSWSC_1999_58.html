15 FEBRUARY 1999
<P>

<b>1716 of 1998</b>		<b>SIMON DING &amp; ORS  V  SYLVANIA WATERWAYS LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	This case raises a narrow but important point of company law, surprisingly
not directly resolved in Australia during the century
and a half since limited
liability was first made generally available to the shareholders of joint stock
companies.  The question
is whether the constitution of a company may be
amended to impose on its shareholders a liability to contribute to the
recurring
or administrative expenses of the company.  
<P>

2	By their statement of claim the 20 plaintiffs who are members of the
defendant company seek declarations as to the meaning or
effect of two articles
in the defendant's constitution.
<P>

3	Article 103(1) provides:
<P>

<i>	</i>`103(1)  An annual levy payable by members of the company to be used to
maintain the navigability of the waterways and to maintain
clean waterways
owned by the company and to fund the ongoing operating expenses of the company
shall be such as the company by ordinary
resolution in general meeting shall
from time to time prescribe.'
<P>

	The plaintiffs seek a declaration that none of them is bound to pay to the
defendant money levied under Article 103(1), having
regard to s140(2)(b) of the
Corporations Law (which replaced s180(3)(b) as from 1 July 1998).
<P>

	Article 102(8) states:
<P>

<i>	</i>`102(8)  A person becoming a member after the date upon which the
company acquired the company's land shall pay a fee of $350 or such
other fee
as the Board may determine for the rights referred to in Article 102(1).'
<P>

	Article 102(1) says that subject to Article 102(8), each member shall have
certain rights to moor a vessel, to erect and maintain
a mooring boom, and to
erect and maintain a pontoon, in each case over the waterway adjacent to the
member's property.  The plaintiffs
seek a declaration that on its true
construction, Article 102(8) does not permit the defendant to impose a charge
on the plaintiffs
for enjoyment of the Article 102(1) rights beyond a once-only
payment of $350 or such other single fee as has been determined.  They
also
seek a declaration that they are not liable to pay the defendant any further
moneys pursuant to Article 102(8) for the rights
under Article 102(1). 
<P>

	<b>Essential facts</b>
<P>

4	Certain limited facts must be determined to enable me to decide the questions
of law and construction which arise with respect
to Articles 103(1) and 102(8).
The essential facts are:
<P>

1. 	The defendant was duly incorporated with limited liability, and is a
company for the purposes of the Corporations Law.
<P>

2. 	The plaintiffs are each shareholders in, and therefore members of, the
defendant.
<P>

3. 	Each of the plaintiffs paid the defendant a fee at the time of becoming or
soon after becoming a member.
<P>

4. 	The plaintiffs became members of the defendant before 7 June 1995.
<P>

5. 	Article 102(8) has been in place at all relevant times.
<P>

6. 	Article 103(1) was adopted by amendments to the defendant's constitution
made at a meeting of members on 7 June 1995.
<P>

7. 	The defendant owns the land forming the seabed of the waterways at Sylvania
Waters.
<P>

8. 	Each member of the defendant is a registered proprietor of land adjoining
the waterways.
<P>

9. 	An annual levy has been fixed by ordinary resolution of the members in
general meeting for the purpose of maintaining the navigability
of the
waterways and to maintain clean waterways.
<P>

10. 	The defendant has made a demand on each of the plaintiffs for the payment
of the levy under Article 103(1), and has made a
demand on some of the
plaintiffs for the payment of the levy under Article 102(8).
<P>

11. 	The plaintiffs have not paid all of the amounts demanded by the
defendant.
<P>

5	Another relevant fact relates to whether any of the plaintiffs has agreed in
writing to be bound by Article 103(1).  In their
statement of claim and amended
statement of claim, the plaintiffs asserted that none of them had made any such
agreement.  The defendant
agreed to that assertion by the plaintiffs both in
its defence to the amended statement of claim and in the contentions of fact
which
were exchanged by the parties before the hearing.  However, at the
hearing the defendant sought leave to amend its defence so as
to withdraw the
admission as regards some of the plaintiffs.  The application for leave to
amend was opposed by the plaintiffs' counsel.
 I reserved my judgment on that
issue as well as on the points of law and construction which were argued at the
hearing.  I shall
deal with the application for leave to amend later in these
reasons.
<P>

	<b>Further background facts</b>
<P>

6	Substantial additional factual materials, principally comprising minutes and
papers for meetings of members of the defendant,
were tendered by the
defendant.  Although the tender of this additional material was objected to on
the ground of relevance, I decided
to admit it into evidence.  The additional
material shows the factual context in which the questions of law and
construction have
arisen.  I accepted the defendant's submission that the
factual context is relevant to the problems of law and construction with
which
the Court has to deal, and to the exercise of the Court's discretion with
respect to the granting of appropriate relief. 
<P>

7	The additional material shows that in the housing estate known as "Sylvania
Waters" there are over 300 properties which directly
adjoin the waterways,
which are partly canals and partly a bay which opens into the Georges River and
Botany Bay.
<P>

8	In about 1984 the company which then owned the waterways went into
liquidation.  The defendant company was formed to avoid the
risk that the
waterways might be acquired by a commercial concern which might impose high
fees on the landowners for moorings and
pontoons.  Most of the landowners of
waterfront properties acquired shares, which were held in parcels of 350 for
each landowner.
 Not all the eligible landowners are members in the company,
though the company has endeavoured in various ways to persuade eligible
landowners to become members.  Over 80% of the eligible landowners are now
members.
<P>

9	By Article 99(1) membership of the company is confined to the owners for the
time being of the properties described in a schedule
to the company's
constitution, which identifies the waterfront properties at Sylvania Waters.
Article 99(3) authorises the board
of directors to decline to register any
transfer of shares unless and until the transferee pays to the board an
administrative fee
of $350 or such other fee as the board might determine.  As
previously noted, Article 102(1), which appears under a heading `Rights
Attaching to Membership', confers on each member certain rights to moor a
vessel, erect and maintain a mooring boom and erect and
maintain a pontoon on
that part of the company's land adjacent to the member's property;  and Article
102(8) obliges a person becoming
a member to pay a fee of $350 or such other
fee as the board may determine for the rights referred to in Article 102(1).
<P>

10	The defendant has not at any stage engaged in a commercial business or any
profitmaking activity in the normal sense.  Its directors
and secretary have
been members and therefore property owners at Sylvania Waters.  The defendant's
main activities have been to maintain
and oversee the use of the waterways, and
to consider various applications for consent by shareholders under the
company's constitution.
 Its modest revenue has arisen from the fees payable
under the constitution when a purchaser of a waterfront property becomes a
member,
and fees charged from time to time for applications by members for
approvals for repairs to the seawall, the erection of mooring
poles and similar
matters.
<P>

11	Sylvania Waters is a natural drainage point for surrounding areas.  In the
absence of devices to filter the water and prevent
silt being carried into the
waterways by runoff from creeks and drainage, silt and rubbish runs into the
waterways.  Additionally,
there is a natural buildup of silt in the canal zone
over time.  By 1995 the buildup of silt had affected the navigability of parts
of the waterways, especially in Gwawley Creek and Richmond Canal.  Concern
about the buildup of silt and also about the task of keeping
the waterways
clean, led to a series of meetings of members during the period 1995-98.
During that time there were eight general
meetings, some of them annual general
meetings and some of them special general meetings.  At the meeting of 7 June
1998 which amended
the defendant's constitution to adopt (inter alia) Article
103(1), the members also set an annual levy of $500 under the new Article;
 and
there was a great deal of discussion about the siltation problem and the need
for maintenance, and the prospect of obtaining
assistance from Sutherland
Council.  Some shareholders opposed the introduction of the levies, and
arrangements were adopted for
deferred payment in cases of hardship.
<P>

12	The minutes of the ensuing meetings show that various schemes for dealing
with the siltation problem were investigated.  One
idea was to move the silt
into "deep holes" in the waterways, and another was to construct an artificial
island on which the silt
would be placed.  Eventually it emerged that the
preferred alternative was to remove the silt from the waterways and dump it in
the
ocean.  However, this was a more costly solution than some of the others
which had been explored, and so, on the recommendation of
the directors, the
members resolved at a meeting on 26 February 1998 to increase the annual levies
for the ensuing three years to
$1,275 per year.  Shortly after that decision,
the present proceedings were commenced.
<P>

13	The material tendered by the defendant shows how difficult it has been for
the company and its directors to develop and implement
proposals for dredging
and cleaning the waterways, and for financing that work.  It appears that at
all relevant times a small group
of landowner/members has opposed and resisted
the wishes of the vast majority.  The additional material contains references
to anonymous
circulars, attacks on the character and motives of directors, and
allegations of defamation.  One concludes from a perusal of the
minutes of the
meetings that they were at times very heated and that some of the debate was
conducted at a personal level.  I note
that at a meeting on 26 June 1998 the
members resolved that the identity of those who had instituted the present
proceedings be revealed,
and after that resolution was passed the chairman read
out the names and addresses of the plaintiffs.  Though there is no further
evidence on the point, one assumes that this action has made life very
difficult for the plaintiffs in their home environment.  The
present situation
is a very unhappy one.
<P>

	<b>Article 103(1)</b>
<P>

14	The defendant company, having been formed under the Companies (NSW) Code in
1984, is now subject to s.140(2) of the Corporations
Law.  That section
commenced on 1 July 1998.  It applies to existing companies from that date
having regard to ss.1413 and 1415,
as a result of which references in s.140 to
a "company" include a reference to a company taken to be registered under the
pre-existing
law and references to the company's "constitution" are taken to be
references to the memorandum and articles of such a company.
<P>

15	Subsection 140(1) states that a company's constitution has effect as a
contract between (inter alia) the company and each member.
 Subsection 140(2)
is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>	</i>`140(2)  Unless a member of a company agrees in writing to be bound,
they are not bound by a modification of the constitution made
after the date on
which they became a member so far as the modification:
<P>

(a) 	requires the member to take up additional shares;
<P>

	(b) increases the member's liability to contribute to the share capital of, or
otherwise to pay money to, the company;
<P>

	(c)	imposes or increases restrictions on the right to transfer the shares
already held by the member, unless the modification is
made:
<P>

	(i)	in connection with the company's change from a public company to a
proprietary company under Part 2B.7;  or
<P>

	(ii)	to insert takeover approval provisions of a kind referred to in
s.671.'
<P>

16	The plaintiffs submit that, having become members of the defendant company
before 7 June 1995, they are not bound by the modification
to the defendant's
constitution made on 7 June 1995 by which Article 103(1) was adopted, so far as
that modification increases the
members' liability `otherwise to pay money to'
the defendant, having regard to s.140(2)(b).  The defendant submits that
s.140(2)(b)
does not apply to the liability of a member to pay a levy fixed
under Article 103(1).  
<P>

17	At first reading, the meaning of s.140(2)(b) seems plain enough, in its
context.  It is established elsewhere in the Corporations
Law (notably in
ss.254M and 515) that a member is liable to contribute to the share capital of
the company.  In the case of a company
limited by shares, the liability is to
pay the unpaid part (if any) of the issue price of the shares, but nothing more
(s.516). 
That is the basic principle of limited liability.  When s.140(2)(b)
speaks of an amendment which `increases' the member's liability
to contribute
to the share capital, it refers (in the case of a company limited by shares) to
an increase in the liability to meet
the unpaid issue price.  Therefore the
word `increases' is applicable even to an amendment which introduces a new
category of liability
to contribute to the share capital, such as an amendment
which purports to impose a liability to pay an additional premium upon shares
which have already been issued.  
<P>

18	The remainder of s.140(2)(b), if stated in full form, would say that unless
members of a company agree in writing to be bound,
they are not bound by a
modification of the constitution made after the date on which they became
members so far as the modification
increases the member's liability otherwise
to pay money to the company.  Once again, in the case of a company limited by
shares,
the word `increases' acknowledges the member's liability to pay any
unpaid issue price and prohibits an increase of that liability.
<P>

19	It is true that the initial liability of the member to pay any unpaid issue
price, and the forms of liability contemplated by
ss.140(2)(a) (to take up
additional shares) and the first part of 140(2)(b) (to contribute to the share
capital) all relate to payments
which the company must account for as share
capital (members' funds).  Money received on revenue account to meet the
recurring administrative
and maintenance expenses of the company is in a
different category.  But the remaining words of s.140(2)(b) are literally wide
enough
to cover an amendment which purports to oblige members to make payments
of that kind.  The words `otherwise to pay money' are words
of wide
application.  
<P>

20	The defendant submits that those words are to be read as if they were
qualified by some such words as `in the nature of share
capital', and contends
that payments for the provision of services of a recurring kind fall outside
the scope of the words when they
are properly construed.  In my opinion,
however, nothing in the words of the sub-section or its statutory context would
authorise
me to read down the words in the manner proposed.  In particular, the
word `otherwise' appears to me to be intended to rebut any
possible
construction <i>ejusdem generis</i> with the preceding words of sub-paragraph
(b) and sub-paragraph (a).  
<P>

21	However, the defendant submits that the legislative history of s.140(2)(b)
supports the construction for which it contends. 
According to the defendant,
before the enactment of the provision, the articles of association of a company
could validly impose
on members an obligation to pay a fee or levy for
corporate administration or the maintenance of the company's property (such as
an annual membership fee, in the case of an incorporated club) and the articles
could validly be amended to introduce such a fee
in a manner binding all
members.  That being so, says the defendant, the legislative provision which
became s.140(2)(b) was not intended
to alter the law in this respect, but
merely to make it clear, in light of a case which suggested that clarity was
needed, that an
amendment to the articles to increase the liability of members
to make payments in the nature of share capital would not be binding
on
dissentients.  In order to assess this submission, it is necessary to consider
the state of the law prior to the enactment of
the legislative provision, and
to investigate whether anything can be said about the probable legislative
intention underlying the
provision.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Section 140(2) - legislative history</b>
<P>

22	The immediate ancestor of s.140(2) was s.180(3) of the Corporations Law.
Some of the changes to s.180(3) made by s.140(2) fall
within the general
category of simplified drafting - for example, s.180(3) referred to an
alteration which increases the members'
liability `as at the date of the
alteration' and those words do not appear in s.140(2), no doubt because they
are unnecessary.  A
difference which could have significance is that
s.180(3)(b) referred to an alteration which `in any way' increases the members'
liability to pay, those words being omitted from s.140(2)(b).  But it is
probable that even that change of wording does not affect
the meaning of the
provision.  Paragraph 8.19 of the explanatory memorandum to the Company Law
Review Bill which replaced s.180 with
s.140, seems to imply that no change of
the meaning was intended.
<P>

23	Section 180(3) was, in turn, identical with s.78(3) of the Companies Code,
after amendments to the latter provision in 1985 added
what is now subparagraph
140(2)(c).  The provision in the form it took in the Companies Code before the
1985 amendment may be traced
back, without any material changes in wording,
through s.33(3) of the Uniform <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1961107/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Act 1961</a> to s.24 of the Companies Act
1936 (NSW) and equivalent provisions in other States.  In turn, the Australian
State legislation obviously
derives from the almost identically worded UK
provision, s.22 of the 1929 Act.
<P>

24	The defendant's counsel submits that the present s.140(2)(b) is relevantly
to the same effect as the equivalent words in s.22
of the UK Act of 1929.  I
agree that while the wording of the provision has changed during the period
from 1929 to date, there is
nothing to suggest that the relevant Parliaments
intended to achieve any change of substance, and on the contrary the changes of
wording can all be explained as drafting improvements to simplify and clarify
the provision.
<P>

	<b>The pattern of UK companies legislation prior to 1929</b>
<P>

25	The cases upon which the defendant relies were, for the most part, English
cases decided under the Joint Stock Companies Act
1856 and the Companies Act
1862, though some of them arose under the Industrial and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/psa1893230/" class="autolink_findacts">Provident Societies
Act 1893</a>.  As far as concerns the present case, the main features of the United
Kingdom companies legislation were:
<P>

(a) 	the liability of the members of a company could, by the memorandum of
association, be limited to the amount if any unpaid on
the shares respectively
held by them (Companies Act 1862, s.7);
<P>

(b) 	the memorandum of a limited company was required to contain a declaration
that the liability of the members was limited (s.8(4));
 
<P>

(c) 	the company was permitted to adopt articles of association and when
registered, the articles would bind the company and the
members to the same
extent as if each member had subscribed his name and affixed his seal thereto,
and as if the articles contained
a covenant by the member to conform to the
regulations contained in the articles (s.16);
<P>

(d) 	the articles of association could be altered by special resolution of the
members in general meeting (s.50);
<P>

(e) 	in the event of winding up, members were liable to contribute to the
assets of the company to an amount sufficient for the
payment of the debts of
the company and the expenses of winding up, and the payment of amounts required
for the adjustment of the
rights of contributories among themselves, but in the
case of a company limited by shares, no contribution could be required from
any
member exceeding the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares in respect of which
he was liable as a member (s.38(4)).  
<P>

	Taken together, these provisions of the 1862 Act contain the principle of
limited liability.  The 1856 Act was similar, though
it dealt separately with
the adjustment of the liability of contributories.  The pattern of legislation
established by the 1862 Act
has been substantially followed in all subsequent
United Kingdom and Australian companies legislation.  In particular, s.38(4) of
the 1862 Act substantially corresponds with ss.515 and 516 of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

26	There is a potential inconsistency between the provision which limits the
liability of members to contribute on winding up, and
the provision which binds
the members to the articles of association as amended from time to time.  There
are two problems.  The
first is whether the provisions which limit the
liability of members also prevent the articles from imposing a pecuniary
liability
on members other than their liability to pay the amount unpaid on
their shares.  The second is whether, even if a pecuniary liability
can be
imposed in the articles, such a liability can, by amendment to the articles, be
imposed upon shareholders who dissent from
the amending resolution.  
<P>

27	In <i>Ooregum Gold Mining Company of India Ltd v Roper </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%20AC%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892] AC 125</a> the
House of Lords held that the scheme of the legislation entailed that a company
which issues shares cannot bind itself to a discount
below their par value.
The statute limited the liability of members to the amount of the par value
which had not been paid.  In their
Lordships' opinion this implied that in the
winding up of the company, members would be liable to pay that amount, and
their liability
could not be further limited by the articles or the terms of
issue of the shares or any other agreement.  It may be permissible for
the
company, by the terms of issue of shares, to bind itself not to call up the
unpaid portion of the par value except in the winding
up of the company (see
Lord Herschell at 143-144), but it could not eliminate the member's liability
to contribute the unpaid amount
on winding up.  
<P>

28	In <i>Welton v Saffery</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%20AC%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] AC 299</a> the House of Lords held that,
although the issue of shares at a discount was authorised by the company's
articles, the holders of
those shares were liable to contribute the unpaid
amount in the winding up of the company for the purposes of adjustment of the
rights
of the contributories inter se, even though the company's external debts
and the expenses of winding up were paid.  
<P>

29	These cases underline the importance of the principle of limited liability,
but they do not shed any direct light on the question
whether the articles may
add to the members' liability to contribute the amount unpaid on their shares,
as opposed to reducing it.
<P>

	<b>The application of the principle of limited liability to articles which
impose additional pecuniary obligations on members</b>
<P>

30	There is a group of cases which appear to say that the articles of
association of a company formed under the 1856 or 1862 Act
may impose a
pecuniary liability on members beyond the liability to contribute the amount
unpaid on their shares.  The reasoning
in the cases is not entirely
satisfactory, and they have been the subject of subsequent debate.  They all
appear to be cases where
the articles which imposed the obligation were in
place at all relevant times, and there was no issue as to whether the
obligation
could be imposed on existing members by amendment.
<P>

31	The first case is <i>Peninsular Company (Ltd) v Fleming </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%2027%20LT%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) 27 LT(NS)
93.</a>  There the articles of a company registered under the 1862 Act permitted it
to call upon its shareholders to provide loan capital
not exceeding 200 per
share, the loan bearing interest to be paid prior to the division of profits.
The defendant refused to contribute
money under this article but the Court of
Common Pleas gave judgment against him in proceedings brought by the company.
It was apparently
not argued that the article was contrary to the principle of
limited liability, reflected in s.38 of the 1862 Act.  Instead, the
argument
turned on whether the article was contrary to the requirement of the Act that
the memorandum must state the amount of capital
with which the company proposes
to registered.  The Court held that the article related to a loan which was not
`capital' for the
purposes of the Act.
<P>

32	Then came two cases relating to the articles of association of The Maria
Anna &amp; Steinbank Coal and Coke Company Ltd.  Six
of the shareholders, who
were also the directors of the company, incurred debts on its behalf in order
to provide part of the purchase
money for the company's collieries.  The
articles stated that the company would pay those debts, but if there were
insufficient funds
to do so, then `each and every shareholder in the company
for the time being shall contribute and pay to the company, as a debt due
to
the company, a proportionate amount of the sum or sums which the company shall
be so called upon to pay according to the number
of shares held by each
shareholder.'  In <i>Re Maria Anna &amp; Steinbank Coal and Coke Company Ltd,
Maxwell's Case,</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%2020%20Eq%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 20 Eq 585</a> Malins V.-C. held that there was nothing
in the Acts of 1856 and 1862 to prevent the liquidator of the company from
including shareholders
in the list of contributories in respect of this
liability, even though their shares were fully paid up.  In <i>Re Maria Anna
&amp; Steinbank Coal and Coke Company Ltd, McKewan's Case </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%206%20Ch%20D%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) 6 Ch D 447</a>
the Court of Appeal agreed, rejecting a submission that an article which
imposes a liability on shareholders of a limited company
in excess of the
amount unpaid on their shares is necessarily void.  The reasoning in the two
cases is similar, though Malins V.-C.
applied the 1862 Act to the winding up of
the company, and Jessel MR applied the somewhat different words of the 1856 Act
under which
the company had been formed.  
<P>

33	Jessel MR (at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=6%20Ch%20D%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">6 Ch D 460)</a> distinguished between `debts of the company
properly so called', which were governed by the limited liability provisions on
winding
up, and `an arrangement <i>inter se </i>by the shareholders for
indemnifying six of themselves against certain liabilities which they have
assumed for the benefit of the
company', to which those provisions have no
application.  The implications of the modern notion that the company is an
entity separate
from its shareholders were perhaps not fully recognised in 1877
(see, in a different context, <i>Isle of Wight Railway Company v Tahourdin</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2025%20Ch%20D%20320" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 25 Ch D 320).</a>  The article in question plainly required the shareholders
to pay their proportionate amounts to the company `as a debt due to the
company', rather than directly to the six director/shareholders.  The company's
own obligation, which arose out of its adoption of
the debts incurred by the
six director-shareholders, was assumed to be binding on it.  A modern lawyer
would conclude, I believe,
that the company had incurred a debt `properly so
called' and would reject the notion that the article merely recorded an
arrangement
between the shareholders <i>inter se</i>.
<P>

34	However, a principle wide enough to explain <i>Maxwell's</i> case and
<i>McKewan's </i>case was articulated by the Court of Appeal in <i>The Lion
Mutual Marine Insurance Association Ltd v Tucker </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2012%20QBD%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 12 QBD 176.</a>  The
case involved the memorandum and articles of association of a mutual marine
insurance company, which after some years of operation
had been incorporated as
a company limited by guarantee.  Ship owners<b> </b>became members by insuring
their ships or freight with the company and ceased to be members when they no
longer had a ship or freight
under insurance with the company.  Each member
guaranteed to contribute 5 to the assets of the company on winding up.
Additionally,
members were required by the articles to contribute funds to meet
policy claims in the relevant insurance class.  Thus, as Brett
MR pointed out
(at 188), a member of the company was also an insurer and an assured.  
<P>

35	The Court of Appeal held that s.38 of the 1862 Act imposed a limit on the
contributions which could be required of members as
such, but did not limit the
contributions which may be payable by a member in the capacity of mutual
insurer under the company's
articles.  The statute applied only to liabilities
incurred by the members in that capacity, not to collateral liabilities
incurred
by them in some other capacity such as insurer or assured.  
<P>

36	Wright J applied that reasoning in <i>Re Bangor and North Wales Mutual
Marine Protection Association, Baird's Case</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%202%20Ch%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] 2 Ch 593.</a>  He
distinguished between the liability of a contributory, to which s.38 of the
1862 Act applied, and liabilities incurred by a member
in some other capacity,
for which the member could be sued though not placed on the list of
contributories.  He criticised <i>Maxwell's </i>case and <i>McKewan's</i> case,
not because those cases held that the members had undertaken a liability which
was enforceable notwithstanding s.38, but because
the courts allowed the
members to be placed on the list of contributories in the winding up of the
company in respect of those liabilities,
rather than requiring that the
liabilities be enforced by action.  
<P>

37	The <i>Lion Mutual </i>and <i>Baird</i> cases hold that if a member incurs a
liability under a contract entered into in some capacity other than as member,
the terms of
which are recorded in the company's constitution, the company may
enforce the liability against the member regardless of the statutory
limitation
of liability which the member enjoys.  That proposition is not easy to
reconcile with the observations by Salmond J in
<i>Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley
Co-operative Dairy Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%20NZLR%20561" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] NZLR 561.</a>  He said (at 577):
<P>

<i>	</i>`A company cannot by its articles, whether original or amended, impose
upon its members any pecuniary obligation over and above their
statutory
obligation to pay up the amount of their shares.  Any attempt of a company to
attach to its shares any accessory or collateral
pecuniary liability is
<i>ultra vires </i>and void as being contrary to that fundamental principle of
limited liability which lies at the root of company law.'
<P>

<i>	</i>Consequently in his opinion an article which obliged members of a
co-operative dairy company to supply the whole of their milk and
cream to the
company, being an obligation to provide the company with money's worth and
therefore indistinguishable from a pecuniary
obligation, was void, quite apart
from the question of restraint of trade.
<P>

38	The defendant has also referred to a line of cases dealing with schemes of
reconstruction of companies.  Section 161 of the 1862
Act introduced a
statutory regime for schemes of reconstruction of companies in voluntary
liquidation, by which the liquidator would
transfer the assets of the company
to another company (typically newly incorporated) in exchange for shares in the
new company, which
would be distributed to the shareholders of the old company,
subject to the approval of the shareholders by special resolution. 
The old
company would then be wound up.  A shareholder who dissented from the
resolution could require the liquidator either to refrain
from implementing the
scheme or to purchase the shareholder's interest at a price to be determined by
agreement or arbitration. 
The substance of s.161 has been retained, in
virtually identical form, in s.507 of the Corporations Law.  
<P>

39	In several cases schemes were adopted to raise further capital for the
enterprise by issuing partly paid shares in the new company
for distribution to
the shareholders of the old company, notwithstanding that the shares in the old
company were fully paid.  But
instead of proceeding under s.161, the schemes
relied on shareholders' resolutions allegedly authorised by the old company's
memorandum
and articles.  The evident purpose was to side-step s.161 and
thereby to deprive dissenting shareholders of their statutory right
to sell
their shares (see R R Pennington, <i>Company Law</i> (5th ed., 1985),
p.975).
<P>

40	In <i>Manners v St Davids Gold and Copper Mines Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%202%20Ch%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] 2 Ch 593</a> the
shareholders in the old company had the option of taking new partly paid shares
in the new company, but if they did not take
up their shares, then the
liquidator of the old company was to realise the shares and apply the proceeds
in reduction of the obligations
of the new company under the scheme.  In other
words, dissenting shareholders were faced with the choice of either exchanging
their
old shares for new shares with a liability, or losing their old shares
and ending with nothing.  The company contended that the transaction
was
authorised by a clause in its memorandum which permitted it to dispose of the
property of the company and to accept in payment
money or shares.  The Court of
Appeal held that the memorandum did not authorise the sale of the company's
property for a consideration
(the new shares) which was to be distributed
immediately to its members, and consequently the scheme was invalid.
<P>

41	In <i>Bisgood v Henderson's Transvaal Estate Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%201%20Ch%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] 1 Ch 743</a> the
scheme was similar, except that the proceeds of sale of the shares in the new
company which had not been taken up were to be
distributed to the non-accepting
shareholders.  The old company's memorandum and articles authorised it to
dispose of its property
and authorised its liquidator to divide the assets of
the company in specie amongst its shareholders, with the sanction of an
extraordinary
resolution.  The Court of Appeal held that the scheme was
<i>ultra vires</i> on several grounds, one of which related to the principle of
limited liability.  Responding to an argument that the scheme purported
to
impose a liability on shareholders contrary to the limitation of liability
found in s.38 of the 1862 Act, Buckley LJ said (at
759):
<P>

	`In the matter of liability upon his shares the statute provides in plain
terms by s.38, sub-s.4, that in the case of a company
limited by shares no
contribution shall be required from any member exceeding the amount unpaid on
his shares.  In my opinion, any
attempt so to define the constitution of the
company as that the member shall in any event be liable for a larger sum is in
breach
of the statute and is ultra vires.  Any clauses which can be used to
maintain a scheme which imposes upon the member the alternative
of accepting
liability for a larger sum or of being dispossessed of his status as a
shareholder upon terms which he is not bound
to accept are, I think, ultra
vires.'  
<P>

42	Strictly speaking the scheme did not purport to impose any new liability on
the shareholders of the old company, who could decline
to take up the new
partly paid shares and consequently receive the proceeds of sale of their old
shares in the liquidation of the
old company.  But in his Lordship's view the
scheme was tantamount to the imposition of an additional liability.
<P>

43	There is a tension between these two groups of cases.  The <i>Peninsula
Company, Maxwell, McKewan, Lion Insurance </i>and <i>Baird </i>cases (which I
shall call `the <i>Lion Insurance </i>group') give effect to additional or
collateral obligations set out in or arising under the company's constitution.
The <i>Shalfoon, Manners </i>and <i>Bisgood </i>cases decline to do so because
of the principle of limited liability, reflected in s.38 of the 1862 Act.  In
my opinion<i> </i>the true explanation for the decisions in the <i>Lion
Insurance </i>group of cases<i> </i>is that the obligations held to be
enforceable<b> </b>against the members, notwithstanding s.38 of the 1862 Act,
were found to have been undertaken on the facts as simple contractual
obligations.
 True it is that the obligations arose by virtue of the members
becoming members of the company, and their content was defined in
the
constitution of the company.  Nevertheless, the obligations in each of those
cases acquired their binding force by virtue of
an act of assent which was both
assent to membership of the company and assent to the additional contractual
obligations known to
the assenting members and recorded in the constitution.

<P>

44	In each of the cases in the <i>Lion Insurance</i> group the court proceeded
on the basis that, as a matter of fact, the new member had accepted special
contractual obligations in
addition to the ordinary incidents of membership -
obligations to lend money to the company, or to pay debts which the company had
adopted if it could not do so, or to insure co-members.  The additional
contractual liability was not governed by the principle of
limited liability.
It is not clear whether the other members at the time of admission of the new
member were contracting parties,
or whether the only counterparty was the
company, though in my opinion the latter is the better interpretation of the
cases.  In
the <i>Manners</i> and <i>Bisgood</i> cases the attempt to impose an
additional pecuniary liability failed because on the facts, it could not be
said that the dissenting
members had relevantly consented to anything other
than mere membership of the company.  The principle of limited liability
accordingly
applied to limit the pecuniary liability of the members to the
amount unpaid on the shares which they had taken up.
<P>

45	The reasoning of the <i>Lion Insurance</i> group of cases might seem
applicable to <i>Shalfoon's</i> case, where the members of the co-operative
company were obliged by its constitution to sell their milk to the company, an
obligation
which seems to go beyond normal membership obligations.  But Salmond
J's observations are expressly based on the premise that the
only relationship
between the member and the company was the relationship constituted by
membership and the company's constitution,
and he contrasted the case before
him with a case where there is an extraneous contractual relationship between
the member and the
company ([1924] NZLR at 574).  
<P>

46	In my opinion the law which emerges from these two groups of cases remains
the law today, though there is room to doubt Salmond
J's factual finding in
<i>Shalfoon</i>.  A person who joins a limited company is not liable, solely by
virtue of the act of assenting to membership, to make a pecuniary
contribution
to its assets beyond the amount unpaid on the shares taken up or the amount of
the member guarantee, as the case may
be.  The principle of limited liability
remains enshrined in the Corporations Law, ss.515-517, corresponding
approximately to s.38
of the United Kingdom Act of 1862.  However, the
circumstances surrounding entry into membership may imply that the new member
has
entered into an additional contractual relationship with the company (and
possibly other members) under which additional pecuniary
obligations are
incurred.  The member's liability to perform those obligations is the liability
of a contractor rather than a contributory,
and therefore the limitation of
liability in ss.516 or 517 of the Corporations Law (as the case may be) does
not prevent the company
from suing for recovery under the special contract.
However, the member cannot be placed on the list of contributories in respect
of that liability (see McPherson's <i>Law of Company Liquidation</i> (3rd ed,
1987, by J O'Donovan), p.292-3, where the author criticises <i>McKewan's
</i>case for holding that a member may be included in the list of
contributories in respect of a special contractual obligation).  
<P>

47	If, therefore, the constitution of a company contains provisions which
impose special pecuniary obligations on members, and those
provisions are known
to the applicant for membership when the application for membership is made,
and the surrounding circumstances
point to an intention to make a special
contract, the court may well conclude that the pecuniary obligation is
enforceable by the
company or its liquidator against the assenting member
notwithstanding ss.516 and 517.  In this way the law recognises the
constitutional
provisions of mutual and co-operative companies and clubs.  For
example, the obligation of members of an incorporated club to pay
an annual
membership fee set by its constitution is probably based on this reasoning,
though it would assist the court to conclude
that there was a special contract
if the member's application for membership included a clause specifically
agreeing to the membership
fee (see J McI Young, <i>Third Cumulative Supplement
to Wallace &amp; Young's Australian Company Law and Practice</i> (1971), note
to p.131, which cites a letter to the Editor in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%2041%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20523" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 41 ALJ 523).</a>  
<P>

48	It follows that if the defendant's constitution had contained from the
outset a provision setting an annual administration and
maintenance levy, and
evidence of the surrounding circumstances showed that the members at all
relevant times had, expressly or by
implication, agreed to that particular
provision, a special contract would have arisen which would be enforceable
against them. 
But of course, the facts do not fit this hypothesis, since
Article 103 was introduced only by subsequent amendment to the constitution.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The imposition of additional pecuniary liabilities by amendment to
the corporate constitution</b>
<P>

49	This leads to the second question for consideration in the present case.  As
Salmond J explained in <i>Shalfoon's</i> case, one of the important differences
between the obligation of a member arising under the corporate constitution and
an obligation
which the member owes to the company under a special contract is
that in the first case, the constitution may be amended or repealed
by the
company, and the rights and obligations created by it may thus be modified or
destroyed ([1924] NZLR at 575) - though, one
would now add, this is subject to
the law of oppression and fraud on the minority.  In the case of a special
contract, an express
or implied term authorising one of the parties to vary or
abrogate the rights and obligations of the other may be void for uncertainty,
though a close analysis of the terms of the power of variation and the limits
upon it would be needed.  And if there is no special
contract between an
individual member and the company initially, obviously one cannot be created by
amendment of the constitution
without the individual member's consent.  
<P>

50	These issues were explored in a group of cases in which societies registered
under the Industrial and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/psa1893230/" class="autolink_findacts">Provident Societies Act 1893</a> (UK) purported to amend
their rules to require their members to take up additional shares.  The
societies were mutual trading organisations
for the sale of farm produce.  In
each case the members of the society were originally obliged to take up a
number of shares calculated
by a formula related to acreage or quantity of
produce or number of cattle or (in the case of another society) number of
members.
 The societies purported to amend their rules to change the formula
for calculating the number of shares to be held by members in
a manner which
purported to require existing members to take up additional shares.
<P>

51	There is an issue as to whether these cases are applicable or even relevant
to a company formed under general companies legislation.
 On several occasions
courts have drawn attention to the differences in the respective legislative
schemes (see, in particular, Lord
Tomlin's remarks in <i>Hole v Garnsey
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%20AC%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] AC 472</a>, 498-9 and the remarks of Pollock MR in <i>Agricultural
Wholesale Society Ltd v Biddulph and District Agricultural Society Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1925%5d%201%20Ch%20769" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1925] 1 Ch 769</a>, 779-80).  Nevertheless the industrial and provident societies
legislation contained provisions similar to the 1862 Act with respect
to
limitation of liability and the statutory contract constituted by the society's
rules.  To that extent, the reasoning in the cases
has a potential relevance
and I shall assume, for the purposes of considering the defendant's
submissions, that the cases are applicable
to companies as well as industrial
and provident societies.
<P>

52	In <i>Dibble v Wilts &amp; Somerset Farmers Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1923%5d%201%20Ch%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1923] 1 Ch 343</a> Lawrence
J relied on the <i>Ooregum Gold Mining </i>case, <i>Welton v Saffery </i> and
the <i>Bisgood</i> case to conclude that an amendment to a society's
constitution to increase the number of shares required to be taken up, made
after
the plaintiff became a member and not assented to by him, was contrary to
the statutory limitation of liability and was invalid.
 Citing <i>Manners</i>'
case, he said there was no difference between an amendment increasing the
nominal amount of shares already held, and an amendment
to compel the
shareholder to acquire additional shares .  
<P>

53	In <i>Agricultural Wholesale Society Ltd v Biddulph &amp; District
Agricultural Society Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1925%5d%201%20Ch%20769" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1925] 1 Ch 769</a> the Court of Appeal disagreed with
<i>Dibble</i> and purported to overrule it.  <i>Biddulph</i> was not a simple
case of a dissenting member resisting an obligation to take up additional
shares, imposed by amendment to the articles.
 In fact the member had already
taken up some shares under the amended rules, and the question was whether it
could be compelled
to take up further shares under the same rules.  
<P>

54	The Court of Appeal held that the member was bound to take up additional
shares under the amended rules of the society. The central
proposition in
Warrington LJ's judgment was that the statute prohibited the company from
enforcing an obligation on members to pay
more than the statutory limit in
respect of their shares, but it did not apply to the enforcement of an
obligation of members to
take up additional shares (at 786, 787).  Pollock MR
and Sargant LJ appear to have emphasised the special characteristics of
industrial
and provident societies, holding in effect that by originally
becoming a member of the society, the respondent made a special bargain
under
which it accepted a liability to take up additional shares, increasing
according to its own prosperity (see esp. at 783, 792).
 
<P>

55	The reasoning of Pollock MR and Sargant LJ may not have any general
application to companies, but Warrington LJ's reasoning could
be directly
applied to the 1862 Act.  It suggests that the principle of limited liability
in the 1862 Act would not prevent the company
from enforcing against members an
obligation in the articles to take up additional shares, and raises the
possibility that such an
obligation might be introduced by amendment to the
articles.  
<P>

56	According to some authoritative commentaries, s.22 of the 1929 United
Kingdom Act was enacted in consequence of the Court of
Appeal's decision in
<i>Biddulph</i> (<i>Buckley on the Companies Acts</i> (14th ed., 1981, by G V
Parker and M Buckley), p.68;  <i>Palmer's Company Precedents </i>(17th ed.,
1956, by K W Mackinnon and R Buchanan-Dunlop), p.285;  see also <i>The Complete
Statutes of England, </i>Volume II, 1929, p.787).  One can understand that the
reasoning of Warrington LJ may have provoked a legislative response, because
it
leads to the proposition that a company may amend its articles to impose an
obligation on members to take up additional shares,
thereby exposing company
shareholders to the risk of uncertain future obligations.  Since the issues in
<i>Biddulph's</i> case included whether a member could be forced to take up new
shares, and whether there was any difference between an obligation
to take up
new shares and an obligation to pay more than the issue price of the shares, it
is not surprising that s.22 expressly
deals with those two subjects.  But I do
not find in the Court of Appeal's judgment in <i>Biddulph's</i> case any
justification for confining the words `otherwise to pay money' in s.22 to
payments of a capital kind.  The <i>Lion Insurance, Baird, </i>and <i>Peninsula
Company</i> cases were relied upon by counsel and in the judgments.  They are
cases where the corporate constitutions of companies imposed pecuniary
obligations other than to subscribe for additional shares or contribute to the
share capital of the company.  In my opinion, if s.22
was a response to the
Court of Appeal's judgment in <i>Biddulph</i>, it is plausible to infer that
the legislature intended to deal with constitutional amendments which would
impose obligations of
the kinds which arose in those cases, and not merely
amendments relating to contributions in the nature of capital.  On that basis,
the words `otherwise to pay money' would cover, at least, amendments which
oblige the member to lend money to the company, or to
contribute to payment of
a particular debt of the company, or to pay insurance premiums or contributions
to reimburse an insured
co-member.  If that is so, those words would also cover
an amendment to oblige the members to pay an annual administrative or
maintenance
levy.
<P>

57	The House of Lords in <i>Biddulph</i> affirmed the decision of the Court of
Appeal, but in my opinion the majority of their Lordships did not support
Warrington LJ's reasoning.
 Viscount Cave, LC, Lord Sumner and Lord Blanesburgh
found that by taking up one parcel of new shares under the amended rules, the
appellant had assented to the amendment as a matter of contract, and
consequently was bound to take up further shares by the application
of the same
rule.  Because of the existence of such a contract, it was unnecessary for
their Lordships to decide whether an alteration
to the rules requiring members
to subscribe for additional shares would be binding on a dissenting member
([1927] AC at 84, 88, 93-94).
 Lords Shaw and Parmoor agreed with the Court of
Appeal, and should be taken to have accepted Warrington LJ's reasons (at 86-87,
91).  Consequently, as Viscount Dunedin pointed out in <i>Hole v Garnsey</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%20AC%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] AC 472</a>, 487, the majority reasoning in the House of Lords in
<i>Biddulph's </i>case does not resolve the question whether a constitutional
amendment can bind dissenting members to take up new shares.  <i>Dibble's</i>
case was overruled only so far as it was inconsistent with their Lordships'
judgment.
<P>

58	In <i>Hole v Garnsey </i>[1913] AC 472 the House of Lords addressed that
issue more directly.  Their Lordships held, Lord Buckmaster dissenting, that an
amendment
to the rules of an industrial and provident society requiring its
members to take up additional shares did not bind members who neither
voted for
nor otherwise assented to it.  According to Viscount Dunedin, a rule which
required members to take up additional shares
by reference to a formula which
might expand the member's liability over time would not be struck down by the
statutory provisions
dealing with limitation of liability, and would therefore
be valid if part of the original rules or assented to as a new rule.  This
proposition is consistent with the <i>Lion Insurance </i>group of cases.  The
rule is binding on the members as a special contractual obligation which they
have agreed to accept.  However,
in Viscount Dunedin's view the rule will not
be binding on dissenting members if it is introduced by amendment under a
general power
of amendment.  The reason, according to his Lordship, is that a
contract in these terms would be too vague to be enforced (at 487).
 I take
this to mean that a special contract under which a member agrees to be bound to
whatever additional liability the society
chooses to impose by amendment to its
rules is void for uncertainty.  The statutory power to amend (as opposed to an
agreed contractual
power to amend) would not render the amended rule binding
because a provision which takes its force solely as a constitutional provision
binding on the members as such is subject to the statutory limitation of
liability.
<P>

59	Lord Tomlin took the view that the power to amend the rules contained an
implied limitation, according to which amendments could
be made only if they
could reasonably be considered to have been with the contemplation of the
parties when the original contract
(arising upon membership) was made (at 500).
In his Lordship's view the amendment in the present case was not within the
reasonable
contemplation of the parties.  Viscount Sumner's reasoning was
similar, for (at 493) he regarded the amended rules as unreasonable
(though,
interestingly, not uncertain).  
<P>

60	Lord Atkin took the view that members were not bound outside the scope of
the venture to which they had committed themselves.
 He held that the amended
rules sought to impose an obligation outside the scope of the venture as
originally framed, and were not
binding for that reason.  He contemplated,
however, that `such matters as the annual subscription to a social or other
club which
may be fairly be regarded as a matter of internal administration'
may fall within the scope of the administration of the venture
as originally
framed, and therefore be binding (at 496).  
<P>

61	The defendant in the present case relied strongly on this observation by
Lord Atkin.  In my opinion, Lord Atkin should be taken
to be referring to the
special contract which arises, in addition to mere membership, when a person
applies to join an incorporated
club.  The obligation to pay the annual
subscription arises out of the special contract, rather than out of membership
as such, and
therefore it is not affected by the principle of limited
liability.  Lord Atkin says, in effect, that the special contract is likely
to
contain an implied term by which the member authorises the club to make
alterations to rules such as the rule governing the annual
subscription for
purposes which may fairly be regarded as matters of internal administration.
Thus, if it appears from the facts
that the purpose of the annual subscription
is to cover (say) rent on the lease of the club's premises, and the rent is
increased,
it would be open for the club to amend its annual subscription rule
to increase the subscription to cover the increased rent.  
<P>

62	On Lord Atkin's reasoning, the amended rule would be binding on existing
members, even those who oppose it.  This is because
they have already agreed to
an implied term in the special contract which they entered into when they
became members of the club
and not merely members of a company, according to
which they would be bound by amendments of this limited kind.  Because of the
constrained
nature of the power to amend, the implied term authorising
amendments would not be void for uncertainty and the amendment would be
within
the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of the original
contract.  Consequently the amended rule would be
enforceable on the reasoning
of Viscount Dunedin, Lord Tomlin and Viscount Sumner, as well as on the
reasoning of Lord Atkin.  The
statutory provisions dealing with limitation of
liability would not apply to prevent the amended rule from being enforced as
part
of the special contract, just as they would not apply to the original
special contract when it was entered into. 
<P>

	<b>The application of <i>Hole v Garnsey</i> to the present case</b>
<P>

63	In my opinion Lord Atkin's observation would not assist the defendant in the
present case, even apart from the effect of s.22
and its successors.  The
defendant is a company limited by shares, the constitution of which is for the
most part indistinguishable
from the constitutions of commercial companies.
What makes the company unusual is that ownership of one of the specified
waterfront
properties is a qualification for membership and the member obtains
special rights to moor a vessel, and to erect and maintain a
mooring boom and
pontoon.  The company is empowered to grant licences to members for the use of
its land, and is entitled to fees
under Articles 99.3 and 102.8 when shares are
transferred and when a person becomes a member.  The fee is in each case $350
or such
other amount as the board may determine.
<P>

64	Clearly, in my opinion, these articles when read together constitute a
special contract of the kind referred to in the case law.
 The member's
liability to pay the fees which the constitution provided for when that person
became a member is enforceable against
the member notwithstanding s.516 of the
Corporations Law, and that is so whether the company claims the specified
amount of $350
or some other amount fixed by the board of directors in the
proper exercise of their powers under Article 99.3 or 102.8.  
<P>

65	However, in my opinion the special contract which the landowner accepts upon
becoming a member of the company does not expressly
or impliedly authorise the
company to amend its constitution to introduce a new pecuniary liability of the
kind contained in article
103.  The evidence before me provides no basis for
implying a term into the special contract which is made when a person becomes
a
member of the defendant, by which the member authorises the company to alter
its constitution to impose a new pecuniary liability
to pay annual levies.  I
reject the defendant's submission that a power to introduce a levy must have
been within contemplation from
the outset, because of the need to provide funds
to maintain the company's services and hence permit members to enjoy the rights
conferred by Article 102(1).  On the contrary, it appears from the evidence
that the company has functioned from 1984 until the mid-1990s
with the income
which is received under the constitution in its unamended form, and in my
opinion no applicant for membership would
have had any reason to believe that
the company may need to raise substantial additional funds and to look to its
existing members
for contribution of those funds.  
<P>

	<b>The effect of section 22</b>
<P>

66	Some commentators have suggested that the enactment of s.22 of the United
Kingdom Act of 1929 was unnecessary, and did not change
the law, having regard
to the decision in <i>Hole v Garnsey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%20AC%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] AC 472</a> (see, for example,
<i>Buckley on the Companies Act</i> (14th ed., 1981, by G B Parker and M
Buckley), p.68;  note also <i>Johnson v Eltham Co-operative Dairy Factory Co
Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1931%5d%20NZLR%20216" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1931] NZLR 216</a>, 242).  If the analysis of the law presented above is
correct, it had been established well before <i>Hole v Garnsey</i> that if the
only relationship between the shareholder and the company is the relationship
of membership under the company's constitution,
the statutory limitation on
liability would prevent the constitution from containing any provision which
imposes pecuniary liability
in excess of the amount unpaid on the shares.  That
is so whether the provision for increased liability is part of the constitution
when the shareholder becomes a member, or is introduced by subsequent amendment
to the constitution.  It was also established that
a special contract in
addition to membership could impose additional liabilities, which could be
recorded in the company's constitution,
if the member assented to those
additional liabilities.  <i>Hole v Garnsey</i> then establishes that if the
special contract contains an implied term permitting amendments which add to
the members' liabilities,
the implied term is valid only if it is confined to
amendments within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of
the contract (Lord Tomlin, Lord Atkin and Viscount Sumner) and not too vague to
offend the contractual standard of certainty (Viscount
Dunedin).  Section 22
and its successors will have changed the law so stated if they apply to
amendments authorised by an express
or implied term in a special contract
between the member and the company, as well as to amendments which are not
grounded in special
contractual provisions.
<P>

67	In my opinion, the better view is that s.22 and its successors apply to
cases where there is a special contract which contains
an implied term
authorising the amendment which has been made.  The effect of its application
is to override the implied term and
to declare that non-assenting members are
not bound by the amendment even though they have previously entered into a
special contract
containing an implied term to contrary effect.  
<P>

68	I reach this conclusion because of the wording of s.22, which seems to me to
be unambiguous.  The section expressly provided
that it was not to apply in a
case where the member agrees in writing, either before or after the alteration
is made, to be bound
thereby.  Those words envisage the existence of a special
contract under which the member expressly undertakes in writing to be bound
by
the amended article.  Implied terms permitting amendments to increase the
member's liability are therefore ineffective.  I agree
with counsel for the
defendant that in consequence of this construction of s.22 and its successors,
members who vote in favour of
the amendment by a show of hands are not thereby
bound to comply with the amended article.  But I disagree with him that this
conclusion
is ridiculous or unlikely to have been intended.
<P>

69	Presumably the legislative intention was to remove the scope for uncertainty
and argument about the effect of amendments, in
light of the confusing and
difficult case law.  The consequence is, as the authors of <i>Buckley on the
Companies Act</i> point out (at 69), that `this section is not limited to
alterations requiring members to subscribe for additional shares, but appears
to extend to all forms of increased payments, eg increases in contributions for
mutual insurance' - and, one would add, alterations
which impose or increase
obligations to pay annual subscriptions or administrative or maintenance
levies.  
<P>

70	In these cases the only practical solutions would appear to be either to
draft the original article in such a way as to include
within its terms a
mechanism for increasing the charge (for example, by authorising the board of
directors to determine the charge
from time to time), or to ensure that
applicants for membership sign a written application form or similar document
in which they
expressly agree in writing to be bound by subsequent amendments
which increase the charge. 
<P>

	<b>Case law after the 1929 Act</b>
<P>

71	Subsequent cases are consistent with the analysis presented above, and tend
to confirm it, though none of them is directly in
point.  
<P>

72	In <i>Edmonton Country Club Ltd v Case </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%2044%20DLR%20%283d%29%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 44 DLR (3d) 554</a> the
Supreme Court of Canada held that an incorporated golf club formed under the
Companies Act of Alberta could not validly alter
its constitution to impose an
annual assessment on its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining operating
revenue.  That conclusion
was reached without the benefit of a provision
equivalent to s.22 of the United Kingdom Act of 1929.  Dickson J, with whom
other
members of the Court agreed on this point, based his conclusion on the
`basic jural principle... that a shareholder who has paid
for his shares is
thereafter free of pecuniary obligation in respect of those shares' (at 562).
In terms of the analysis presented
above, his Honour thereby confirmed that in
the absence of a special contract, the statutory limitation of liability
prevented the
adoption of an article which imposed a pecuniary liability on
holders of fully paid shares.  He referred to Lord Atkin's remarks
in <i>Hole v
Garnsey</i> and explained them by reference to the `wider range of obligations
<i>in invitum</i> which may be validly created' under the legislation dealing
with industrial and provident societies.  I take this to mean that while
a
special contract extending to the payment of an annual subscription may be
implied in the case of an industrial and provident society,
there was no
factual basis for doing so in the case of the golf club with which the Supreme
Court was dealing.  In terms of policy,
Dickson J said (at 565):
<P>

	`It would be a strange thing and contrary to all jurisprudence, if the
purchaser of shares in a public company could be required
of a sudden and
against his will, at the instance of the company or a majority of its
shareholders, to contribute to the operating
expenses or capital needs of the
company.'
<P>

73	In <i>Johnson v Eltham Co-operative Dairy Factory Co Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1931%5d%20NZLR%20216" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1931] NZLR 216</a>
a similar principle was applied by the New Zealand Court of Appeal to an
amendment to the articles of association of a co-operative
dairy company, which
deprived the plaintiff of part of the purchase price for dairy products which
he sold to the company.  At the
time of the decision the New Zealand Companies
Act did not contain any equivalent to s.22 of the United Kingdom Act of 1929.
Again,
in terms of the analysis presented above, the amendment would not have
bound the plaintiff as an existing member in the absence of
evidence of an
express or implied term in the special contract between dairy producer and
company authorising amendments of that
kind.  
<P>

74	In <i>Finlayson v Carr </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 657</a> Waddell J rejected an argument
that one of the rules of an unincorporated voluntary association was
fundamental and could not be
amended without the assent of all members.  He
cited <i>Hole v Garnsey</i> but observed that the decision was limited to the
imposition of additional financial obligations by means of a general power of
amendment
(at 668).
<P>

75	In <i>Gra-Ham Australia Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%201%20WAR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 1 WAR
65</a> it was held that a power of amendment contained in the trust deed for a unit
trust could be used to reduce the vested or accrued
entitlements of unitholders
who exercised their right under the deed to require the manager of the fund to
repurchase their units.
 The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western
Australia considered whether the power of amendment, expressed in unqualified
terms,
was subject to an implied limitation of the kind referred to by Lords
Atkin, Tomlin, Sumner and Dunedin, but held that the amendment
to the trust
deed would be valid even if the power of amendment was subject to an implied
limitation of that kind.
<P>

	<b>Conclusion as to Article 103(1)</b>
<P>

76	In my opinion, therefore:
<P>

(a) 	an article imposing pecuniary liability to pay an annual fee or levy, such
as Article 103(1), is enforceable against members
whose membership arises after
the article is adopted, or who otherwise assent to it;
<P>

(b) 	the statutory limitation on liability now contained in s.516 of the
Corporations Law does not render such an article invalid,
because the members
expressly or impliedly assent to the obligation when they become members and
thereby enter into special contract
in addition to their normal contract of
membership;
<P>

(c) 	however, if such an article is adopted by amendment it cannot bind
existing members, having regard to s.140(2), unless those
members have
individually agreed in writing to be bound, because s.140(2) applies to a
modification of the constitution which increases
the member's pecuniary
liability to the company in any way.
<P>

	<b>Article 102(8)</b>
<P>

77	Under Article 102(8) a person becoming a member after the date upon which
the company acquired the company's land must pay a
fee of $350 or such other
fee as the board may determine for the rights referred to in Article 102(1)
(that is, the rights to moor
a vessel, to erect and maintain a mooring boom and
to erect and maintain a pontoon).  The defendant contends that Article 102(8)
must have been intended to permit the board to impose a fee on all members from
time to time, to provide funds to maintain the company's
services and hence
permit the members to enjoy the rights conferred by Article 102(1).  I disagree
with this submission.  In my opinion
as a matter of construction, Article
102(8) contemplates only a single fee payable by the person becoming a member
at about the time
admission to membership occurs.  The article refers to an
event, namely `a person becoming a member' and the payment of `a fee' for
rights which the member obtains under Article 102(1) when membership arises.
The whole tenor is that the article is directed towards
a single set of events,
namely the admission to membership, the obtaining of the rights under Article
102(1), and the consequent
obligation to pay a single fee.  The article does
not authorise the board to impose a recurring fee upon members after they have
become members.
<P>

	<b>Amendment of Pleadings</b>
<P>

78	Paragraph 5 of the plaintiffs' amended statement of claim states:
<P>

<i>	</i>`The plaintiffs have not, nor have any of them, whether collectively,
individually or otherwise, agreed in writing to be bound by
the alteration.'
[That is, the alteration to the defendant's constitution which introduced
Article 103(1).]
<P>

	By paragraph 5 of the defence to the amended statement of claim, the defendant
admitted the plaintiff's assertion.
<P>

79	On Friday 18 September 1998 the defendant applied by notice of motion to
Hamilton J for expedition of the hearing.  The following
exchange occurred:
<P>

<i>	</i>`HH:	Is this purely a construction point?  What's the point?
<P>

	Jenkins [Counsel for defendant]:  There is a construction point in relation to
s180, subs.3.
<P>

	HH:  Is it purely a construction point?
<P>

	Jenkins:  Yes.
<P>

	HH:  How long will it take?
<P>

	Jenkins:  Probably a day.
<P>

	Young [Counsel for plaintiffs]:  If it is only to be a construction point and
each of the plaintiffs allege that they haven't consented
to the amendment, if
that's not going to be in issue then I would have thought it could have been
finished in less than a day.
<P>

	Jenkins:  Even if there was a factual issue about that it wouldn't take very
long to resolve because s180 requires the consent
to be in writing.'
<P>

	His Honour ordered that the proceedings be expedited and directed, inter alia,
that the parties deliver to one another a written
outline of the propositions
of fact and law to be contended for at the hearing.
<P>

80	The plaintiffs' contentions of fact, submitted to the Court on 19 October
1998, asserted that none of the plaintiffs had agreed
in writing to be bound by
the alteration of the defendant's constitution to include Article 103(1).  The
defendant's contentions
of fact, which were dated 19 October 1998, stated:
<P>

<i>	</i>`7.  It is asserted on the part of the plaintiffs and it is agreed by
the defendant that:
<P>

	(a)	the plaintiffs became members of the defendant before 7 June 1995;  and
<P>

	(b)	none of the plaintiffs has agreed in writing to be bound by the
modification in respect of Article 103(1) of the defendant's
Articles of
Association.'
<P>

	Thus, as late as two days before the hearing of the matter on 21 October 1998,
the defendant admitted that none of the plaintiffs
had agreed in writing to be
bound by Article 103(1).
<P>

81	According to evidence tendered by the defendant at the hearing, the board of
directors of the defendant sent a report to the
defendant's members prior to a
special general meeting of members held on 25 June 1998.  The report informed
members that according
to senior counsel's advice, a determination of the
matter should not be overly expensive nor lengthy, if the matter could be
expedited.
 The report said "It is anticipated the actual court proceedings
could take somewhere between half to one day".  The minutes of the
meeting of
25 June 1998 indicate that some concern was expressed at the meeting about the
cost of the proceedings to the defendant.
 The secretary of the company
informed the meeting that in senior counsel's opinion the matter was projected
to be a half to one
day hearing, and made a personal estimate of costs on that
basis.
<P>

82	After discussion, the meeting passed a resolution noting the litigation,
resolving to defend it, instructing the directors to
proceed accordingly, and
to make every effort to expedite the matter and seek an early hearing and
determination.
<P>

83	All of this implies that in all probability, the plaintiffs prepared for the
hearing on 21 October 1998 on the basis that the
defendant's admission would
stand and it would not be necessary to lead to evidence as to whether any of
them had agreed in writing
to be bound by Article 103(1);  and further, the
members of the defendant who voted for the resolution of 25 June 1998 did so in
reliance on a representation that the likely length of the hearing would be a
half to one day and that costs would be determined
on that basis.
<P>

84	Counsel for the defendant indicated, at the commencement of the hearing on
21 October 1998, that the defendant wished to apply
to amend the defence by
withdrawing its admission that none of the plaintiffs had agreed in writing to
Article 103(1).  He said the
defendant now claimed that some of the plaintiffs
(eventually specified as the third to the twelfth, the fifteenth and the
twentieth
plaintiffs) had in fact agreed in writing.  His explanation for
seeking a last minute amendment to the pleadings on a matter of central
importance was that until very recently, the view had been taken that the words
in s140(2), "agrees in writing to be bound", envisaged
a single written consent
and would not extend to an exchange of letters and cheques.  The defendants'
legal advisers have recently
revised this opinion.  No explanation was offered
as to why the change of opinion occurred as late as it evidently did.
<P>

85	Since the application to amend would not need to be dealt with if the
defendant were to be successful in its contentions on the
law and the
construction of the articles, and given that counsel for the plaintiffs
submitted to me that if leave to amend were granted,
the case would be a much
longer one, I suggested to counsel for the defendant, and he agreed, that the
application to amend be merely
foreshadowed at that stage.  I indicated to
counsel for the plaintiffs that I would grant the plaintiffs leave to adduce
further
evidence on the question of consent if I were to grant the application
for leave to amend after completion of the main body of the
case.  On this
basis, I proceeded to hear the case and then to hear submissions on the
application for leave to amend, and I reserved
my judgment on both matters.
<P>

86	The defendant tendered evidence for the limited purpose of the application
to amend.  The evidence shows that some of the plaintiffs
have made no payments
by way of levy, while others have made one or more payments.  The evidence also
shows that the fifteenth plaintiff,
Mr Massey, and the twentieth plaintiff, Mrs
Coops, exchanged correspondence with the defendant.  Though the positions which
they
expressed in their correspondence were not identical, broadly speaking
they objected to payment on various grounds although they
did pay some money
under pressure from the defendant, who threatened legal proceedings against
each of them.  Counsel for the defendant
indicated that if granted leave, the
defendant would submit that the correspondence amounted to an agreement in
writing to be bound
by Article 103(1).
<P>

87	It is not appropriate for me to form a final view on that submission, since
the matter has not been fully argued and there will
almost certainly be other
evidence if leave is granted.  However, simply on the basis of a review the
material tendered in evidence,
I am inclined to regard as implausible the claim
that, taken as a whole, the correspondence involving those two plaintiffs
demonstrates
an agreement in writing by each of them to be bound by Article
103(1).  More significantly for present purposes, perusal of this
evidence
indicates that the circumstances of each of the 20 plaintiffs will be different
from the circumstances of every other. 
Even confining the issue to twelve of
the twenty plaintiffs, as the defendant proposes to do, it will be necessary to
investigate
all twelve separate sets of circumstances and reach a conclusion on
each of twelve sets of facts.  Counsel for the plaintiffs submits
that if the
question of consent is put in issue, he will need to lead a substantial
additional amount of evidence and he estimates
that the hearing of the issues
could last for two or three days.
<P>

88	One must approach an application for leave to amend pleadings, even at a
late stage, in light of the liberal approach set out
by the High Court of
Australia in<i> State of Queensland  v  J L Holdings Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20141%20ALR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 141 ALR
353.</a>  However, the cases indicate that a somewhat stricter approach is required
where the amendment will withdraw an admission:<i>  Coopers Brewery Ltd  v
Panfida Foods Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20738" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 738.</a>  In the end, while the Court must
not allow considerations of efficient case management to prevail over
considerations of justice
and fairness, the Court has a wide discretion to
consider all circumstances relevant to the achievement of justice in the
instant
case.  In the present case, it is difficult to have sympathy with the
defendant's application for leave to amend.  The very pleading
now sought to be
amended was confirmed less than 48 hours before the hearing, and there is no
explanation for the defendant's last
minute change of heart, other than a
change of legal opinion which might and arguably should have occurred, if at
all, at an earlier
time.  Expedition of the case was granted in reliance on the
defendant's assertion that the case would be no more than a one day
case.  If
leave to amend is granted it is likely that the hearing will be a significantly
longer one, and while no doubt the directors
of the defendant have authority to
commit the company to such a course, the evidence indicates (as mentioned
above) that the members
voted to support the proposal for the company to defend
the action on the basis that the case would be no more than a one day case.
<P>

89	However, giving full weight to all those circumstances, it still seems to me
that it would be inappropriate to bind the defendant
to declaratory orders
which resolve the question of consent against the defendant solely in reliance
on a pleading which the defendant
now wishes to withdraw.  I can meet the
plaintiffs' legitimate complaints about amendment by refusing the application
for leave to
amend, while at the same time meeting the defendant's desire not
to be hoisted on the petard of a pleading from which it now resiles,
by
limiting the declaratory orders so that the consent issue is not resolved.
This would be achieved by declaring, in final resolution
of the present
proceedings, that the plaintiffs are not bound to pay a levy fixed under
Article 103(1)<i> except in the case of a plaintiff who has agreed in writing
to be bound by the alteration which adopted Article 103(1)</i>.  In other
words, the declaratory relief would resolve the question of law as to the
meaning of s140(2)(b), while expressly not resolving
the questions of fact and
law as to whether any agreement in writing has been given.
<P>

90	An obvious disadvantage of my doing so is that the obligation of each
individual plaintiff to pay the levy is, to a degree, left
unresolved.  On the
other hand, the plaintiffs as a group will have obtained a judgment on the
questions of law and construction
which they wished to resolve by these
proceedings.  The question of consent must be determined on an individual
basis, and in my
opinion that issue is best determined in differently
constituted proceedings.  There is evidence to indicate that the defendant has
already taken proceedings in the Local Court for recovery of levies alleged to
be due.  If the defendant wishes to assert against
an individual plaintiff that
a levy is due because the defendant has agreed in writing to be bound by
Article 103(1), that issue
could be resolved in Local Court proceedings against
the individual concerned for the recovery of the alleged debt.  Consequently,
if I refuse leave to amend but make declaratory orders which leave the question
of consent at large, I will not exclude the defendant
from the opportunity to
assert in more appropriate proceedings that consent has been given.
<P>

	<b>Orders</b>
<P>

91	I therefore propose to make declaratory orders with respect to Article
102(8) in terms of orders 2 and 3 of the plaintiffs' amended
statement of
claim, and make a declaratory order with respect to Article 103(1) along the
lines of order 1 in the amended statement
of claim, while adding some such
words as "unless in the case of any plaintiff, that plaintiff has agreed in
writing to be bound
by the modification of the defendant's constitution whereby
Article 103(1) was adopted".
<P>

92	I shall ask counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant to prepare draft
short minutes of orders to reflect these intentions,
to give them a chance to
influence the drafting of the orders.
<P>

93	Since the plaintiffs have been successful in the proceedings as pleaded, and
they have also been successful in opposing the defendant's
application for
leave to amend the defence, I am strongly disposed to make an order for costs
in their favour.  However, I shall
hear counsel's submissions, if any, on the
question of costs.
