<b>WEDNESDAY 17 FEBRUARY 1999</b>

<center><b>NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v BARRY FRANCIS CROTTY &amp;
ANOR</b></center>
<P>


<P>

Proceedings under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990</a></i></b> were
brought by the New South Wales Crime Commission ("the Commission") against the
defendant, in connection with his conviction
of the offence of supply a
prohibited drug under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25(1)</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/" class="autolink_findacts">Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act
1985</a></i></b>. The Commission sought a proceeds assessment order against the
defendant, and an assets forfeiture order in respect of residential
premises
jointly owned by him and his wife.
<P>

<b>HELD</b> (finding for the Commission):
<P>

(1) 	On the face of the defendant's conviction, and of recorded conversations
made by an undercover police operative pursuant to
warrants, the Commission has
established an overwhelming case for the orders sought, according to the
standard of proof required
by the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act
1990</a></i></b>. The conviction is a matter of record; and the conversations
contain clear and unambiguous admissions by the defendant as to his
importation
and subsequent sale of heroin during the period specified by the
<b><i>Act</i></b>. The defendant has made no attempt to explain this material,
and the conversations are corroborated by other evidence relating to
his travel
records.  
<P>

	
<P>

(2) 	It follows that an assets forfeiture order must be made in relation to the
residential property.
<P>

	
<P>

(3) 	However leave should be granted to the defendant, under the circumstances,
to apply for an exclusion order on grounds of hardship
to dependants or spouses
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25(4)</a> of the <b><i>Act</i></b>. 
<P>

	 
<P>

(4) 	In order to make a proceeds assessment order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27</a> of the
<b><i>Act</i></b>:
<P>

(i) 	regard must be had to matters specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(1)</a> of the
<b><i>Act</i></b>, including "moneys acquired" and the market value of the
drugs.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 28(4)</a> precludes the taking into account of any expenses or
outgoings incurred in relation to the illegal activities. Money "derived" or
"acquired" is the amount which passes through the hands of the offender;
<P>

(ii) 	a "broad brush" approach needs to be taken to the assessment, as there
will rarely be records from which a precise calculation
of the proceeds of
crime can be made.
<P>

	<b><i>Fagher</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 67</a>; <b><i>Pepin</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2086%20A%20Crim%20R%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 86 A Crim
R 327</a>, considered; <b><i>New South Wales Crime Commission v Yenice</i></b>
(Supreme Court of NSW, 5 November 1997, unreported), followed.
<P>

	
<P>

(5) There is no reason to make any reduction on account of the possibility that
the defendant had a partner, as the role of that
person was not detailed in the
conversations, and there is ample evidence to show that the defendant played
the pivotal role in the
importation and sale of the drugs.
<P>

<P>

(1) 	Assets forfeiture order made in relation to the residential property,
subject to defendant's application for leave to exclude

WOOD CJ AT CL
<P>

WEDNESDAY 17 FEBRUARY 1999
<P>

<center><b>NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v BARRY FRANCIS CROTTY &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The New South Wales Crime Commission brings these proceedings
under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></b> 1990 for a proceeds assessment
order against Barry Francis Crotty and for an assets forfeiture order in
respect of premises situated
at 5 Makim Street, North Curl Curl, being lot 18
in Deposited Plan 12515 and being the whole of the land in Certificate of Title
Folio Identifier 18/12515 of which Mr Crotty and his wife, Jennifer Margaret
Crotty, are joint registered proprietors.  
<P>

2	The orders are sought pursuant to a summons filed in this Court on 15
December 1994, which was served on 4 January 1995 upon Mr
and Mrs Crotty,
together with a copy of an affidavit of Robyn Gray and a sealed copy of a
minute of orders made by Spender AJ on
the same day as that which the summons
bears.
<P>

3	The six year limitation period for the claims which are brought under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 22</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">27</a> of the <b>Act</b> dates back accordingly to 15 December
1988.
<P>

4	When the application came on for hearing yesterday, Mr Crotty renewed the
request for an adjournment that had been made before
Barr J and refused on the
preceding day.  After that renewed application was refused by me, he and his
wife, who was present in the
Court, declined to participate any further in the
proceedings and then withdrew.  The matter proceeded ex parte.
<P>

5	The evidence tendered before me shows that Mr Crotty became the subject of an
operation by the Drug Enforcement Agency, in the
course of which an undercover
buy was made from him, on 14 June 1994, of a quantity of cocaine.  He was
arrested and charged in relation
to that transaction with the offence of supply
a prohibited drug under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/" class="autolink_findacts">Drug Misuse and Trafficking
Act</a></b> 1985.  He was convicted of that offence on 16 December 1998 following
entry of a plea of guilty on 17 March 1998.  
<P>

6	The quantity of heroin sold exceeded the indictable quantity of five grams,
and as a consequence Mr Crotty has been shown to have
been involved in a
serious crime-related activity, involving an indictable offence, within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(2)(b)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">3</a>(c) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></b>,
so as to attract the jurisdiction of this Court to make the orders sought.
<P>

7	The restraining order made by Spender AJ on 15 December 1994 remains in
force, as appears from the affidavit of Robert John Davis
sworn 9 February 1995
and read in these proceedings.
<P>

8	So far as the supply of cocaine is concerned, the evidence reveals that, on 2
May 1994, Mr Crotty met an undercover police operative
at Wentworth Park,
Glebe, and supplied him with a sample of 0.59 grams of cocaine and 1.5 grams of
cannabis leaf.  
<P>

9	At subsequent meetings, Mr Crotty discussed arrangements for the supply of
further quantities of cocaine, as well as the supply
of heroin, and made
mention of prior importations by himself of heroin that he had purchased in
Thailand.  Some of those conversations
were recorded pursuant to warrants.
<P>

10	On 13 May, Mr Crotty said: 
<P>

	"Too bad you weren't around a couple of months ago.  I had three kilograms
brought in myself.  I can tell you now because I can't
be busted for it now.  I
got rid of it through a guy at 85 an ounce."
<P>

11	The reference to "85 an ounce" may be taken to be $8,500 per ounce.  The
current price, he went on to say in this conversation,
was 75 ($7,500) an
ounce, although three years ago he said he was getting 10 ($10,000) an
ounce.
<P>

12	During the conversations on 19 May, 8 June and 10 June that were recorded,
Mr Crotty explained to the undercover operative his
modus operandi for bringing
heroin into the country.  He said that he had used a specially-designed harness
worn around the groin
area to carry the drugs.  Additionally, he said that in
order to avoid attracting attention he carried a briefcase;  described himself
in the PAX cards as a company director;  avoided carrying or wearing silver or
coins;  used Tiger Balm to deter drug-sniffer dogs;
 and adopted the strategy
of flying to Bangkok, where he stayed overnight and purchased the heroin,
before flying on to the United
Kingdom, where he spent a few days before
returning to Sydney by a flight which permitted him to pass through Bangkok or
Singapore
in transit without leaving the aircraft, thereby escaping the need
for any further entry being made in his passport which might show
that his last
destination had been in a country where drugs might have been acquired.
<P>

13	During the course of these conversations, Mr Crotty encouraged the
undercover operative to join him in one such trip.  In this
regard, he
described the precautions that they might take, including booking through
separate travel agencies, being seated separately
on the aircraft, staying at
different hotels, and avoiding waiting around the luggage carousel.
Additionally, he encouraged the undercover
operative to have a haircut and to
remove his moustache.  
<P>

14	He stated that he had usually acquired three quarters of a kilogram or one
kilogram, on his earlier trips, and made mention of
having sold them for prices
between $8,000 and $10,000 per ounce, with a net return of roughly $200,000.
At one point he said that
the planned trip with the undercover operative would
be his fifth and last trip.
<P>

	Enquiries of Immigration confirmed that Mr Crotty had in fact made four trips
of the kind which he described, as follows:
<P>

	<b>Depart Sydney</b>	<b>Flight  Arrival at Sydney	Flight</b>
<P>

	17/11/91		QF1		23/11/91		QF10
<P>

	24/06/92		QF1		02/07/92		QF2
<P>

	06/04/93		QF5		13/04/93		QF2
<P>

	10/08/93		QF1		19/08/93		QF10
<P>

15	The evidence revealed additionally that in the PAX Cards for these flights,
Mr Crotty described himself either as a "P/Officer"
or as a company director.
He was neither.
<P>

16	On 10 June 1994, Mr Crotty met the undercover operative and was given
$AUD3,000 to purchase an airline ticket for a further flight.
 Armed with this
sum he attended a travel agent and purchased a return airline ticket in his
name that was routed Sydney/Bangkok/London/Sydney
leaving Sydney on 29 June
1994.
<P>

17	On 14 June 1994 the buy of the cocaine was made in two instalments, the
first in an amount of 29.1 grams, for which $4,300 was
paid, and the second in
an amount of 56.9 grams for which $9,000 was paid.
<P>

18	Another person, Gary Raymond Hanley, was suspected by surveillance police to
be assisting Mr Crotty in this deal, in the sense
that it was to his premises
that Mr Crotty was seen to return on more than one occasion while the
transaction was going down.  Each
man was apprehended and of the marked buy
money, $1,000 was recovered from Mr Crotty, and $8,600 was recovered from Mr
Hanley, who
also was found to be in possession of 10 grams of cocaine.
<P>

19	The evidence otherwise shows that between 1989 and 1992, Mr Crotty had
lodged income tax returns in which he variously described
himself as a "credit
officer" and "building consultant" and in which he disclosed gross annual
income from employment, and social
security benefits, not exceeding $25,000.

<P>

20	The evidence further showed that his wife was an unemployed housewife and
that, in December 1994, they had four children, two
of whom were aged under
eighteen years, and the elder two of whom were then aged eighteen and
twenty-one years.
<P>

21	Further, it appeared that the home in North Curl Curl, the subject of the
restraining orders, was purchased on 20 December 1991
for $210,000, that
purchase being financed in part through a loan of $124,000 from the St George
Bank Ltd.
<P>

22	Finally, there was evidence from Detective Inspector Drury to the effect
that, during the period November 1991 to August 1993,
a conservative wholesale
price for three kilograms of cocaine, that is roughly four importations of 750
grams each, was in the order
of $630,000, calculated at $6,000 per ounce.  That
this is a conservative estimate is confirmed by the references, by Mr Crotty,
in the recorded conversations, to the fact that he had sold the heroin he had
imported at prices varying between $8,000 and $10,000
an ounce.
<P>

23	In my view, the Crime Commission has established, on the face of the
conviction of Mr Crotty, and the recorded conversations,
an overwhelming case
for the orders sought.  The fact of his plea and subsequent conviction, during
the relevant period, for an offence
of supply involving an indictable quantity
of cocaine, is a matter of record.  Within the recorded conversations there are
clear
and unambiguous admissions by Mr Crotty, as to his importation and
subsequent sale of heroin, on at least four occasions, also occurring
during
the period specified by the <b>Act</b>.  
<P>

24	Mr Crotty has made no attempt to answer or explain any of this material - I
can see no reason why the conversations recorded
should not be taken at face
value, particularly having regard to the considerable detail supplied.
Moreover the account he gave in
those conversations was corroborated by the PAX
Cards completed in his hand, by the travel records over the relevant period, by
the
purchase of an air ticket routed in the very same way he had described, and
by the fact that no apparent reason exists, by reference
to any legitimate
business activity or employment disclosed in his income tax returns, for him
undertaking the several overseas trips
involved.  Further, the limited duration
of those trips is consistent with the admissions made in those conversations.

<P>

25	I am accordingly satisfied that the relevant ingredients which would entitle
the Crime Commission to the orders sought have been
established, according to
the standard of proof required by the <b>Act</b>.
<P>

26	So far as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22(2)</a> of the <b>Act</b> is concerned, I find that the
person (Mr Crotty) whose suspected serious crime-related activity formed the
basis of the restraining
order was, during the relevant period, engaged in a
serious crime-related activity of the prescribed kind.  
<P>

27	It follows that an assets forfeiture order must be made in relation to the
residential property at North Curl Curl, the subject
of that restraining order.
I so order.
<P>

28	In view of the course that the proceedings have taken, however, I consider
it appropriate, should Mr and Mrs Crotty so request
it, that leave be granted
to them to apply for an exclusion order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25(4)</a> of the
<b>Act</b>.  
<P>

29	For similar reasons, I am satisfied that the case is one where I am required
to make a proceeds assessment order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(2)</a> of the <b>Act</b>.  For
the purpose of making the assessment, I am required to have regard to the
matters specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28(1)</a> of the <b>Act</b>, including "the moneys
acquired" by Mr Crotty because of his illegal activities, as well as the market
value of the drugs involved
in his illegal activities, which encompass both the
cocaine supply and also the importation and supply within this country of
heroin.
 I am not to take into account any expenses or outgoings incurred in
relation to those activities <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 28(4)).</a>
<P>

30	The present case is not one based upon asset betterment principles.  Rather,
the claim is pursued upon the basis of the wholesale
price received for the
heroin, and the difference between the buy moneys of $13,300 for the cocaine
and the sum of $9,600 recovered,
namely $3,700.
<P>

31	Reference has been made, in decisions concerning proceedings brought under
similar legislation, to the inevitable broad brush
approach that needs to be
brought to the assessment of the value of the benefits or moneys received from
illegal activities:  See
<b>Fagher</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 67</a> and <b>Pepin</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2086%20A%20Crim%20R%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 86 A Crim R 327.</a>  This is in recognition of the circumstance that those
involved in such criminal activities rarely, if ever, keep books of account
or
other documents from which any precise calculation of the proceeds of crime can
be made.  
<P>

32	The need for a broad brush approach to the present <b>Act</b> was confirmed
by Callaway AJ in <b>New South Wales Crime Commission v. Yenice</b>, Supreme
Court New South Wales, 5 November 1997, unreported.  I see no reason to depart
from that approach.
<P>

33	As I have recounted earlier, Mr Crotty has, in recorded conversations, fixed
the price he received for the heroin at prices ranging
between $7,500 and
$10,000 per ounce.  Detective Inspector Drury placed a more conservative figure
upon the commodity of $6,000 per
ounce.  In my view, a figure of $7,000 per
ounce may properly be adopted, in this case, as a conservative estimate,
allowing for
some possible exaggeration by Mr Crotty in order to attract the
interest of the undercover operative in joining in or financing a
further
importation.  
<P>

34	Taking a similarly conservative approach in assuming that the four
importations admitted were each of three quarters of a kilogram,
approximating
a quantity of three kilograms which Mr Crotty referred to in the recorded
conversations as being an amount that he
had brought in by himself, the
proceeds or benefit acquired would be calculated as follows:
<P>

	4 x 26 ounces x $7,000 = $728,000.
<P>

35	Some reference was made, in the recorded conversation, on 19 May 1994 to Mr
Crotty having had a partner at some stage in the
importation and sale of
heroin.  The role of that person, if such a person existed, is not detailed in
the conversations, nor is
it made clear when it was that such person made the
last of the trips mentioned.  
<P>

36	What is clear, however, is that Mr Crotty was the driving force in effecting
the purchase of the heroin, in carrying the drugs,
in clearing them through
Customs, and in arranging for their resale.  There is nothing in the
conversations to suggest that the co-offender
Hanley, in relation to the
cocaine supply offence, had anything to do with the heroin dealings, or that he
was the partner referred
to.
<P>

37	Moreover, there is the admission earlier mentioned that Mr Crotty brought in
three kilograms of heroin by himself.
<P>

38	So far as he made reference to borrowing moneys or securing funding and
expenses from elsewhere, those costs are required to
be excluded.  Moreover,
the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27(1)</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28(1)</a> and (4), state that it is
the amount of money that is "derived" or "acquired", ie the amount which passes
through the hands of the
offender, - that is to be assessed as the proceeds in
respect of which an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 27</a> is to be made.
<P>

39	Accordingly, I see no reason to make any reduction on account of the
possibility that Mr Crotty had a partner, or that he derived
any portion of the
proceeds of his illegitimate activities, as an agent for, or otherwise on
behalf of some other person.  To the
sum of $720,000 assessed in the manner
previously explained, I add the sum of $3,700, being the difference between the
sum received
by Mr Crotty for the controlled buy of the cocaine and the sum
later recovered.
<P>

40	While, theoretically, a claim could have been made for the full amount of
the buy, the Crime Commission has fairly confined its
claim, in this regard, to
that portion of the buy moneys which were received by Mr Crotty but not
recovered.  Accordingly, I will
make a proceeds assessment order in the sum of
$731,700.
<P>

41	I note that Mr Crotty does seek leave in relation to exclusion of the
premises from the forfeiture order.  In order to give effect
to that
application and otherwise to give effect to these reasons, I will make orders
in accordance with the short minutes prepared
by counsel for the Crime
Commission, which I have signed and will date today.
<P>

42	I formally make an order that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of
the proceedings.
<P>

43	That order is to include any reserved costs.
