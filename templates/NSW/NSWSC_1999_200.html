<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: The Second Defendant Pope Packaging Pty Ltd (hereinafter
referred to as "Pope"), a company incorporated and carrying on business
in New
Zealand and having no presence in New South Wales, by Notice of Motion filed on
8 December 1997 seeks the following orders:-
<P>

	1.  That the Court declines to grant the Plaintiff leave to proceed against
the Second Defendant.
<P>

	2.  That the originating process be set aside.
<P>

	3.  In the alternative, that the Court, in the exercise of its discretion,
declines to exercise jurisdiction over the Second Defendant.
<P>

	4.  In the further alternative, that the Plaintiff's proceedings brought
against the Applicant be permanently stayed.
<P>

	5.  Such further or other order as the Court considers appropriate.
<P>

	6.  That the Plaintiff pay the Applicant's costs of this motion.
<P>

2	The application is made pursuant to Part 10 of the Supreme Court Rules.  So
far as is relevant, this provides:-
<P>

	"1A(1)Subject to Rule 2 and Rule 2A, originating process may be served outside
Australia in the following cases - 
<P>

	(a)	Where the proceedings are founded on a cause of action arising in the
State.
<P>

	(b)	...
<P>

	(i)	Where the proceedings are properly brought against a person served or to
be served in the State and the person to be served
outside the State is
properly joined as a party to the proceedings.
<P>

	2(1)	Where an originating process is served on the defendant outside Australia
and the defendant does not enter an appearance within
the time limited for
appearance the Plaintiff shall not proceed against that defendant except with
the leave of the Court.
<P>

	(2)	A motion for leave under sub-rule (1) may be made without serving notice
of the motion on the defendant.
<P>

	6A(1) The court may make an order of the kind referred to in Part 11 Rule 8...
on application by a person on whom an originating
process is served outside
Australia.
<P>

	(2)	Without limiting sub-rule (1), the Court may make an order under this Rule
under the ground - 
<P>

	(a)	That the service of the originating process is not authorised by these
Rules, or
<P>

	(b)	That this Court is an inappropriate forum for the trial of the
proceedings."
<P>

3	Part 11 Rule 8 provides, inter alia:-
<P>

	"8(1)  The Court may, on application made by a defendant to any originating
process on Notice of Motion filed within the time fixed
by sub-rule (2), by
order - 
<P>

	(a)	Set aside the originating process.
<P>

	(b)	Set aside the service of the originating process on the defendant.
<P>

	(c)	...
<P>

	(d)	Discharge any order giving leave to serve the originating process outside
the state or confirming the service of the originating
service outside the
state.
<P>

	(g)	Declare that the court has no jurisdiction over the defendant in respect
of the subject matter of the proceedings.
<P>

	(h)	Decline in its discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in the
proceedings."
<P>

4	The Plaintiff asked that, if the motion of Pope does not succeed, the
Plaintiff be given leave under Part 10 rule 2(1).
<P>

5	The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in the Netherlands.  By Statement of
Claim filed on 27 December 1996 it sued Bollinger
Shipping Agency Pty Ltd
(hereinafter referred to as "Bollinger") and Pope.  The claim against Bollinger
is in contract.  It is said
that by an agreement made orally and in writing on
or about 2 October 1995 Bollinger agreed to ship a printing press owned by the
Plaintiff from premises of Arrow Manufacturing Limited at Auckland in New
Zealand to Delft in Holland.  In the alternative, and in
reliance on the same
documents, it is alleged that Bollinger had agreed to arrange the shipment of
the printing press from Auckland
to Delft.  It is claimed that in consequence
of deficiencies in the packing of the printing press - said to be or
demonstrate breaches
of contract by Bollinger - the printing press suffered
damage prior to its arrival in Holland.  The damages claimed exceed $267,000.
To the terms of the arrangement between the Plaintiff and Bollinger, it will be
necessary to return.
<P>

6	The claim against Pope is that it carried out the packing of the printing
press pursuant to an agreement with Bollinger but neglected
to exercise
reasonable care in carrying out that task.  This claim is solely in tort.
<P>

7	Other matters against which the issues raised must be decided include the
following.  Bollinger is incorporated in New South Wales
and carries on
business here.  In a Defence filed on 27 March 1997, Bollinger admitted that it
had agreed to arrange shipment of
a printing press from Auckland to Delft, that
it was a term of the agreement that Bollinger would arrange for a packer to
pack the
printing press, and that Pope packed the pieces of the dismantled
printing press.  
<P>

8	On 8 November 1996 Bollinger had commenced proceedings in the High Court of
New Zealand against two defendants.  The first was
Ryder's Customs Agency Ltd
(hereinafter referred to as Ryder's) and the second Pope Packaging Limited.
The Statement of Claim in
those proceedings recites that the Plaintiff in the
New South Wales proceedings claims that Bollinger had contracted to transport
a
printing press, that Bollinger denied so contracting but that Bollinger's had
contracted with the First Defendant to the New Zealand
proceedings to have the
printing press packed by a specialist export packer, that Ryder's had
sub-contracted to that packing to Pope
Packaging Limited, and that Bollinger
was entitled to $13,500 under Section 15(1) of the Carriage of Goods Act 1979
(New Zealand)
and to be indemnified by one or other or both of the defendants
for any consequential loss.  Pleadings in the New Zealand proceedings
have
closed but no further steps have been taken in them.
<P>

9	A letter from the New Zealand solicitors acting for "Pope" admits that Pope
entered into a non-written contract with Ryder Customs
Services for Pope to
provide packaging services.  A bill of lading issued by Ryder's Customs Agency
as agent for the carrier Nedlloyd
Lijnen B.V. Rotterdam records the shipping of
the goods from Arrow Manufacturing Ltd of Auckland to Nederlandsche Spec,
Drukkerijen
in Delft.
<P>

10	It will be observed that in the New South Wales proceedings the Second
Defendant has been named Pope Packaging Pty Limited whereas
in the New Zealand
proceedings the name used is Pope Packaging Limited.  In his affidavit, Mr
Thompson, the solicitor acting for
Pope in the New South Wales proceedings
seems to assume that only the one "Pope" company is involved and in the
proceedings before
me no-one suggested otherwise.  I will proceed on the same
assumption.
<P>

11	The solicitor for the Plaintiff said that he anticipated that there would be
called on behalf of the Plaintiff residents of the
Netherlands who inspected
the printing press prior to shipment and, as I read the affidavit, other
residents of the Netherlands to
prove the condition of the printing press on
arrival.  There would be some expert evidence from persons ordinarily resident
in New
South Wales, the Netherlands and/or New Zealand.  He said that he
expected the First Defendant would call evidence from at least
one person who
resided in New South Wales.
<P>

12	The Solicitor for Bollinger, Ms Madafiglio, said that she expected that
Bollinger "may" call:-
<P>

	(i)   One witness of fact from New South Wales.
<P>

	An expert witness from New Zealand as to New Zealand law.
<P>

	(iii) An expert witness from New Zealand as to good practice in packing and,

<P>

	(iv)  Possibly a surveyor from the Netherlands.
<P>

13	Ms Madafiglio also said that she had instructions to cross-claim against
Pope and to join Ryder's Customs Agency Ltd as another
cross-defendant.
<P>

14	Mr Thompson, the solicitor for Pope, gave evidence that Pope was likely to
call four witnesses of fact including the person who
arranged the contact
between Pope and Ryder's and the individuals who were involved in packing the
consignment.  It is a reasonable
inference that all of these people are
resident in New Zealand.  Mr Thompson went on to record his instructions that
Pope intends
calling a number of expert witnesses all of whom are likely to be
based in New Zealand.
<P>

15	I turn to the issues which arise.  It may be said at the outset that I am
satisfied that the circumstances fall within Part 10,
rule 1A(1)(b)(i).  As
Bollinger is incorporated and carrying on business with in New South Wales the
proceedings are properly brought
against Bollinger and served on Bollinger
within the State.  Pope is properly joined as a party to the proceedings both
because the
Plaintiff's rights to the relief claimed are in respect of, or
arise out of, the same transaction, viz. the carriage of the printing
press
from Auckland to Delft and, because there is a question which arises that is
common to claims by the Plaintiff against Bollinger
and Pope, viz. the extent
of the loss suffered by the Plaintiff in consequence of the damage alleged to
have occurred to the printing
press - see Part 8, rule 2.
<P>

16	The argument between Pope and the Plaintiff centred on two topics.  One was
whether Pope had demonstrated that New South Wales
was a clearly inappropriate
forum for the trial of the action, all parties accepting that <b>Voth v
Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538</a> had laid down this test.
The second was whether, in light of the terms of the Carriage of Goods Act,
1979 (New Zealand), the Plaintiff
had an arguable case against Pope.  It was
common ground that in the circumstances where the relevant events occurred in
New Zealand,
for the Plaintiff to succeed in tort against Pope in New South
Wales, the Plaintiff had to establish, inter alia, that under the
law of New
Zealand, Pope was under a liability of the same kind - <b>McKain v R.W.Miller
and Co (SA) Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 1</a> at 39, <b>Stevens V Head </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
176 CLR 433</a> at 453, <b>James Hardie &amp; Co v Hall </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 554</a> at
559, 577-8.
<P>

17	It was also submitted on behalf of Pope that, even if that question was
decided in the Plaintiff's favour, the difficulties thrown
up by the existence
and terms of that Act, were best determined by a New Zealand court and
strengthened the argument that New South
Wales was a clearly inappropriate
forum.
<P>

18	In written submissions, counsel for Bollinger limited himself to arguments
supporting the Plaintiff's opposition to all of the
relief sought by Pope.  In
oral argument he said he sought that there be one forum only.  Bollinger made
no formal application in
this regard.
<P>

19	It is convenient to turn first to a consideration of the New Zealand
Carriage of Goods Act, a copy of which was in evidence.
 It was also the
subject of evidence from a Mr Myburgh, a senior lecturer in commercial Law at
the University of Auckland and consideration
in a number of decisions to which
I was referred.  So far as is relevant the Act provides:- 
<P>

	"2.  <b>Interpretation</b> - in this Act, unless the contact otherwise
requires, -
<P>

	"Carriage" includes any incidental service; and "carry" has a corresponding
meaning:
<P>

	"Carrier" means a person who, in the ordinary course of his business, carries
or procures to be carried goods owned by any other
person, ... and ... includes
a person who, in the ordinary course of his business, performs or procures to
be performed any incidental
service in respect of any such goods:
<P>

	"Contract of carriage" means a contract for the carriage of goods:
<P>

	"Incidental service", in relation to any goods, means any service (such as
that performed by consolidators, packers, stevedores,
and warehousemen) the
performance of which is to be or is undertaken to facilitate the carriage of
the goods pursuant to a contract
of carriage:
<P>

	"International carriage", - 
<P>

	(a)	...
<P>

	(b)	In relation to the carriage of goods by sea, means carriage from any port
in New Zealand to any port outside New Zealand, or
to any port in New Zealand
from any port outside New Zealand, commencing when the goods are loaded onto a
ship and ending when they
are discharged from a ship.
<P>

	5.  <b>Application of Act </b> - (1) Subject to sub-section (4) of this
section and to section (4) of this Act, this Act applies to every carriage of
goods, not
being international carriage, performed or to be performed by a
carrier pursuant to a contract entered into after the commencement
of this Act,
whether the carriage is by land, water, or air, or by more than one of those
modes.
<P>

	6.  <b>Other remedies affected</b> - Notwithstanding any rule of law to the
contrary, no carrier shall be liable as such, whether in tort or otherwise, and
whether
personally or vicariously, for the loss of or damage to any goods
carried by him except - 
<P>

	(a)	In accordance with the terms of contract of carriage and the provisions of
this Act; or 
<P>

	(b)	Where he intentionally causes the loss or damage.
<P>

	9.  Liability of contracting carrier - 
<P>

	(1)	Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a contracting carrier is
liable as such to the contracting party for the loss
of or damage to any goods
occurring while he is responsible for the goods in accordance with the
succeeding provisions of this section;
whether or not the loss or damage is
caused wholly or partly by him or by any actual carrier.
<P>

	(6)	Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the
responsibility of a contracting carrier who contracts
for the carriage of goods
to a destination outside New Zealand ends for the purposes of this Act at the
time when the international
carriage of those goods begins."
<P>

20	An appreciation of the operation of the Act in the circumstances of this
case requires that further attention be paid to events,
at least as disclosed
by the evidence.  In a fax of 22 September 1995, one of the documents which
passed between the Plaintiff and
Bollinger and relied on by the Plaintiff as
forming part of the contract, Bollinger provided a breakdown of the services to
be arranged
and the costs or charges it was suggesting the Plaintiff bear.
These, and a provision which was no doubt at least part of the inspiration
for
allegations by the Plaintiff in the Statement of Claim that Bollinger was in
breach of contract, included:-
<P>

	"Dismantling of machine	AUD   639
<P>

	Carting of machine (*)		AUD   758
<P>

	Packing of container		AUD 1150
<P>

	Container cartage			AUD   380
<P>

	Sea freight to Rotterdam	USD  5020"
<P>

	"(*)  Nine fully enclosed cases, 58.50 M3, packed into 1 x 40ft GP container.
Each case lined with polyethylene sheeting shrink
wrapped over the machine,
silica gel moisture inhibitor used, each case with skidded base and heavy duty
steel strapping."
<P>

21	An invoice of 30 November 1995 from Bollinger to the Plaintiff sought
reimbursement for disbursements described as:-
<P>

	Packing and handling		   7758.00
<P>

	Container pack/unpack		   1725.00
<P>

	Cartage and labour		     620.00
<P>

	Export sea freight			10,846.53
<P>

22	It is appropriate to draw from the reference to "cartage" in these documents
the inferences that there was carriage of the printing
press in New Zealand to
the wharves prior to its loading on board ship and that this carriage was
pursuant to a contract of carriage.
 The form of the documents and common
knowledge would suggest that the packing occurred prior to any carriage.  Some
of the other
documents in evidence suggest the same.
<P>

23	Having regard to these matters, the conclusion at which I have arrived is
that the claim advanced by the Plaintiff against Pope
cannot succeed.  The
activities of Pope were undertaken to facilitate the carriage of goods pursuant
to a contract of carriage and
fell within the definition of incidental service.
The contract of carriage included at least the contract whereby the printing
press
was conveyed to the wharf.  This conclusion derives support from the
decisions to which I was referred of <b>Fletcher Panel Industries Ltd v Ports
of Auckland Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%202%20NZLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 2 NZLR 231</a> where it was held that the holding of
goods on a wharf prior to loading was incidental to the domestic carriage of
the goods from
their place of origin and of <b>International Cargo Express Ltd
v U-Jin Enterprises Inc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%202%20NZLR%20712" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 2 NZLR 712</a> where a similar decision was
reached in the case of goods intended to be shipped by air which were being
held in a warehouse near
an airport.
<P>

24	Furthermore, it does not seem to me that the definition of "incidental
service" requires that such services be provided pursuant
to the contract under
which the goods the subject of that incidental service were actually carried.
So long as the services are undertaken
to facilitate carriage (using that term
in its normal sense) under a contract of carriage - and not, for example, by
the owner of
the goods - the services are within the definition.
<P>

25	It may be that because Pope's services were also undertaken to facilitate
the carriage of goods from Auckland to Delft, they
fell within the definition
of "incidental service".  It may, I think, be taken that, despite the
definition of the terms "carriage"
and "carrier", "carriage", where used in the
definition of incidental service, means movement as distinct from merely
something that
constitutes an incidental service.  However, given the statement
in s 5 that "this Act applies to every carriage of goods, not being
international carriage" a question arises whether the term "carriage" where
used in the definition of incidental service includes
international carriage.
If it does not, then services incidental to international carriage only do not
fall within the definition.

<P>

26	On the other hand, it can be argued that what is excluded from the operation
of the Act is international carriage itself, not
incidental services wholly
performed within New Zealand.  After all, international carriage is not
excluded from the definition of
carriage.  In light of the conclusion at which
I have arrived above, it is unnecessary for me to form any concluded view on
the this
issue.  However as it is an issue on which I think the answer is by no
means clear, there is much to be said for the view that the
question should be
decided by a New Zealand court, rather than an Australian one.  The proper
construction of New Zealand statutes,
particularly one which undoubtedly
governs as many transactions as the Carriage of Goods Act does, is best left
for authoritative
exposition to the courts of that country.
<P>

27	Be that as it may, my earlier remarks lead to the view that Pope clearly
falls within the definition of carrier.  Although this
conclusion is one which
seems to me to flow from the mere terms of the Act, it accords with the opinion
of Mr Myburgh that "it is
the accepted legal position in New Zealand that the
Act applies to all carriage, including incidental services, performed in New
Zealand before international carriage begins, and performed in New Zealand
after international carriage ends".  There is no suggestion
that Pope
intentionally caused damage or that there is otherwise anything in the New
Zealand Act to provide a basis for a claim in
tort against Pope.  Thus Section
6 operates to bar any claim against Pope in tort for any deficiencies which may
have occurred in
and about the packing of the goods.
<P>

28	I turn to the other issue which arose.  As I have said, all parties accepted
that the question was whether Pope has demonstrated
that New South Wales is a
clearly inappropriate forum for the trial of the action.  Were the only persons
interested the Plaintiff
and Bollinger, this question might well be answered in
the negative.  The Plaintiff has chosen to sue here.  Bollinger is incorporated
and carrying on business here.  The contract seems to have been concluded by a
faxed acceptance sent to New South Wales.  The proper
law of the contract is
probably that of New South Wales.
<P>

29	However, the introduction of Pope, and as seems likely if the proceedings
are allowed to continue against Pope, Ryder's adds
additional features.  The
situation of those two parties in New Zealand, the number of transactions and
events that occurred there
and the number of witnesses resident there, compared
with the number of parties, transactions and witnesses in Australia, all argue
in favour of New Zealand having a closer connection with the dispute than does
Australia.  More particularly, the number of witnesses
- even excluding any
involvement of Ryder's - has an ongoing relevance on the topics of convenience
and cost of any trial.  Both
New Zealand and Australia are sufficiently far
from the Netherlands as to make the further distance any witnesses from the
Netherlands
would have to travel of little, if any, weight.  Subject to the
terms of any contract, New Zealand standards of packing may be relevant
to
liability.  (It is said that the timber used in the packing of the printing
press contained an excessive degree of moisture.)
 Part of the claim already
made by Bollinger against Ryder's and Pope is said to be pursuant to s15 of the
Carriage of Goods Act
1979 (NZ).  That section imposes limits on a carrier's
liability and it may well be that Bollinger's entitlement to the further
indemnity
it seeks will raise other operation of the Act.  I have already
indicated that I regard the proper construction and operation of
a New Zealand
statute as best left for exposition to New Zealand courts.  Of course, I do not
suggest that is conclusive.
<P>

30	It was submitted on behalf of Bollinger that to allow the application by
Pope would mean that Pope's liability would be determined
only in New Zealand,
with the risk that Bollinger might suffer from different findings being made
here and there.  Technically this
is not correct because the issue before me
concerns the Plaintiff's claim against Pope, Bollinger not having yet made such
a claim
in New South Wales.  However I accept that the conclusion at which I
arrive may well have an impact on the fate of any similar dispute
between
Bollinger and Pope.
<P>

31	At the forefront of the argument against granting Pope any of the relief
sought on this ground were two matters.  One was that
New South Wales was a
proper forum in which the Plaintiff was entitled to sue Bollinger.  The second
was the disadvantage of two
actions, one here and one in New Zealand, with all
the attendant additional costs, risk of inconsistent findings and other
disadvantages
of which many judges have spoken - see e.g. <b>Qantas Airways Ltd
v Dillingham Corporation </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 113</a> at 117E-118, <b>Citi-March Ltd
v Neptune Orient Lines Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 1 Lloyd's Rep. 72</a> at 77-8.
<P>

32	In the circumstances of this case while some of these disadvantages clearly
exist, I am not persuaded that they are as great
as in many other cases that
have come before the courts.  The factual issues common to the proceedings
between the Plaintiff and
Defendant on the one hand and proceedings against
Pope (and perhaps Ryder's) on the other fall within a relatively narrow
compass.
 Furthermore much will depend on the terms of the particular contracts
between the parties and, so far as damages are concerned,
the impact of Section
15 of the Carriage of Goods Act.  That section imposes substantial limitations
on the amount of a carrier's
liability and the documents between Bollinger and
Ryder's referred to in Bollinger's Statement of Claim in the New Zealand
proceedings,
and which became Exhibit B before me, do not suggest any expansion
of that liability.  Questions of choice of law may arise but that
Statement of
Claim is drafted as if some of the limitations in the Act apply. 
<P>

33	And I am not persuaded that it does not lie within the power of the
Plaintiff to conduct the whole of the litigation in New Zealand,
thus avoiding
the consequences which, it was submitted, were so bad.  Sections 18 and 19 of
the  Carriage of Goods Act do lay down
time limits which may apply to an action
by the Plaintiff against Bollinger but, particularly in light of Bollinger's
New Zealand
action, there would have to be a reasonable prospect of any time
limits which have expired being extended. 
<P>

34	Pope's presence in New Zealand allows the Plaintiff to sue Pope there and an
extract from the Rules of the New Zealand High Court
which was tendered makes
it clear that the Plaintiff could join Bollinger in such an action.  However in
light of the consideration
that has been given to the Carriage of Goods Act
during argument and in these Reasons, I am not prepared to assume that the
Plaintiff
will be disposed to sue Pope again.  On the other hand, those Rules
permit of service outside the jurisdiction in a number of other
situations
within which the circumstances here fall. This may occur, inter alia:-
<P>

	(a) Where any act or omission for or in respect of which damages are claimed
was done or occurred in New Zealand:
<P>

	(b) Where the contract sought to be enforced ... or for the breach whereof
damages or other relief is demanded in the proceeding
- 
<P>

	(i)  ...
<P>

	(iii) Was to be wholly or in part performed in New Zealand ...
<P>

	(c)Where there has been a breach in New Zealand of any contract, wherever
made.
<P>

35	It may be that the terms of sub-clause (m) are not as wide as they at first
appear.  While I accept that the proceedings commenced
by Bollinger in New
Zealand mean that Bollinger has submitted to the jurisdiction of the New
Zealand courts sufficiently to enable
a party to those proceedings to bring
certain claims against Bollinger, the commencement of those proceedings is not
a general submission
to the jurisdiction - see <b>National Commercial Bank v
Wimborne</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20NSWLR%20156" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 NSWLR 156.</a>  However, in light of the other provisions
which I have quoted, it is unnecessary to pursue this aspect.  I am satisfied
that the
New Zealand courts have jurisdiction to entertain the action which the
Plaintiff has brought against Bollinger here.
<P>

36	Bollinger is the party most at risk from having proceedings here and in New
Zealand although, apart from its submission that
there should be only one
forum, Bollinger gave no active support, even as a fall-back position, for that
part of Pope's claim as
sought the staying of the whole action.  Nor is there
any evidence to suggest that New Zealand law differs from that in New South
Wales whereby Bollinger can seek a declaration as to its liability to the
Plaintiff.  Even if such an application is possible, Bollinger
would, of
course, have to persuade this court that the Plaintiff's proceedings against it
should be stayed, but many of the factors
to which I have referred argue in
favour of such an application as they do in favour of Pope's.  However I do
acknowledge the risk
that any order I might make based on New South Wales being
a clearly inappropriate forum, unless the order is to stay the whole of
the
proceedings, will leave Bollinger exposed to two actions and that this matter
is a significant argument against Pope's application
succeeding on that ground.
Any order I make other than to stay the whole of the proceedings will also
leave Pope exposed to a cross-claim
by Bollinger and having to make another
application such as this.
<P>

37	The fact that, subject to any order I may make, the Plaintiff is entitled to
sue Bollinger in New South Wales must be recognised
and given weight,
particularly if Bollinger is content that that situation continue.  On the
other hand, so must the fact that prior
to the institution of the proceedings
before me action had been commenced, albeit not by the Plaintiff, against Pope
arising out
of much the same events and that Bollinger wishes to repeat that
claim by way of cross-claim here. 
<P>

38	Not all of the matters to which I have referred go to the question of
whether New South Wales is a clearly inappropriate forum
for the trial of the
action, a test which focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of allowing
the proceedings to continue in
New South Wales, albeit not to the exclusion of
all else - see <b>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd</b> (supra) at p 558.
Some go to issues of convenience and the practicality of the litigation being
conducted elsewhere; some to the
manner in which the Court's discretion should
be exercised if New South Wales is a clearly inconvenient forum.
<P>

39	The view at which I have arrived on this aspect of the case is that New
South Wales is a clearly inconvenient forum for the resolution
of the issues
which involve Pope, a fortiori if account is taken of the likelihood that,
absent some restriction by the Court, Ryder's
will also be joined.  Although I
recognise this is not the test, I would go so far as to say that if there is to
be evidence from
any significant number of New Zealand witnesses as to events
or standards there, I think New South Wales is an inconvenient forum
for the
resolution of the dispute between the Plaintiff and Bollinger.
<P>

40	I am much inclined to the view that the originating process should be set
aside, so that the totality of the issues can be determined
by one court, in
New Zealand.  Pope has an interest in such a result in that it will preclude
any cross-claim by Bollinger being
made in these proceedings and obviate the
occasion for any further application such as this.  Pope has an indirect
interest in the
result of the Plaintiff's claim against Bollinger in that
failure of that claim is likely to have an impact on the claim by Bollinger
against it.
<P>

41	On the other hand, if the Plaintiff and Bollinger wish to litigate their
dispute in New South Wales, it seems to me that they
must be allowed to do so.
It may be possible to preclude any cross-claim by Bollinger against Pope under
Pope's claim for "further
or other order" although the possibility of this was
not canvassed during argument - see Part 26 of the Rules. 
<P>

42	Furthermore, to stay the Plaintiff's action here would be unduly harsh on
the Plaintiff if there were any legal impediments in
New Zealand to the success
of its claim which it did not face in New South Wales.  An obvious one is any
limitation period, whether
in Section 19 of the Carriage of Goods Act or
otherwise, although presumably any such defence could be waived by Bollinger.
So far
as I can recall, no party adverted to these matters.
<P>

43	Because I am of the view that the Plaintiff's claim against Pope has no
reasonable prospects of success and that New South Wales
is a clearly
inappropriate forum for the determination of the proceedings against Pope and,
if these can not be severed from the
proceedings between the Plaintiff and
Bollinger, for the trial of the whole action, Pope is entitled at least to
orders refusing
leave to the Plaintiff to proceed against Pope, and setting
aside so much of the Statement of Claim as constitutes a claim against
Pope.
In part because the ramifications of some of the conclusions at which I have
arrived were not canvassed during argument, in
part because I am not sure how
far Bollinger meant to go by its submission that there should be only one
forum, I propose to publish
these reasons and stand the matter over to afford
the parties an opportunity of considering them and making such submissions as
to
the form of orders as they wish.
<P>
