<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>In the Torrens System of land title by registration
interests and rights over land which exist only in equity do not appear on the
register unless their registration is expressly authorised by legislation and
when they do they have effect in accordance with legislation
and not otherwise.
Restrictive covenants have contractual effect between their original parties
but they run with the land so as
to impose the burdens and confer the benefits
of them on the land while owned by others only if and in so far as legislation
so provides.
 Subs 88 (3) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> authorises entry of
notification of restrictive covenants in the register and the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
88</a> indicate the circumstances in which this is done and has effect.
<P>

2	     The plaintiff, Mr Pollak, owns the house property at 22 Kulgoa Road,
Bellevue Hill and the first and second defendants, Dr
D G Milder and Dr K R
Milder own the house next door at No 24 Kulgoa Road.
<P>

3	     In the summons of 11 February 1998 the plaintiff claims an order
extinguishing a restrictive covenant over his land created
by transfer G555295,
and names as defendants the Milders and their Bank.  The Bank has taken no part
in the proceedings. The land
was referred to in the transfer by its title
reference Certificate of Title volume 2981 folio 186. The transfer was dated 3
August
1956 and registered on 21 August 1956. The transferors were Annie
McHardie and Mary McHardie and the transferees were Louis Goodman
and Judith
Goodman his wife as joint tenants. The restrictive covenant was in these
terms:
<P>

	<i>     "And the transferees covenants with the transferor's their successors
entitled and assigns that the transferees their executors
administrators and
assigns shall not at any time cause to be erected on the subject land a
building having more than a ground floor
and that the building line of such
main building shall be not closer than 40 feet from Kulgoa Road.  The land to
which the benefit
of the restriction is appurtenant is the land in Certificate
of Title volume 2754 folio 36. The land which is subject to the burden
of the
restriction is the land referred to in Memorandum of Transfer and the parties
by whom or with whose consent the said covenant
may be released varied or
modified are the transferors their successors entitled and assigns.."</i>
<P>

4	     There was an earlier covenant in transfer A 498801 and a covenant
relating to fencing but those do not give rise to dispute.
<P>

5	     The restrictive covenant was intended to contribute to  amenity by
preventing development close to Kulgoa Road and much more
significantly by
preventing development higher than one storey at a height which would impact on
the views from nearby land. The
impact which a second story could well have on
the views from number 24 Kulgoa Road can be gauged in a general way from
photograph
annexure B produced by Mr Valuer Stamoulis. It seems plain that the
amenity of land at 24 Kulgoa Road would be significantly enhanced
if that land
had the benefit of a covenant restraining construction of a building having
more than a ground floor.
<P>

6	      Wholly on the footing of what is expressed by the transfer G 555295
there is no doubt about which land is the land intended
to be benefited. It is
the land in certificate of title volume 2754 folio 36. The terms of the
transfer do not raise any doubts about
this: such as for example would be
raised by referring to the benefited land as the land of the transferors or as
land in Kulgoa
Road or as land adjacent to the burdened land.
<P>

7	     However a different understanding of the transfer appears if it is taken
in conjunction with some surrounding circumstances.
 The terms of transmission
application G 533083 by which Annie McHardie and Mary McHardie applied for
transmission of title to themselves
under the will of a relative show that they
owned and lived in number 24 Kulgoa Road and that its certificate of title was
volume
2754 folio 236.  Search of certificate of title volume 2754 folio 36
shows that it relates to a small parcel of land in Second Street
Lambton near
Newcastle about one hundred miles from Kulgoa Road, and that the Misses
McHardie have never owned that land.  These
circumstances make it probable to
the point of fair certainty that the parties to transfer G 555295 intended to
annex the benefit
of the restrictive covenant to the land in certificate of
tile volume 2754 folio 236: there was a mistake in the terms of transfer.
<P>

8	     When transfer G 555295 was registered on 21 August 1956 the
Registrar-General did not make any notification of its registration
on the
certificate of title relating to the land having the benefit of the
restriction: it was not the Registrar-General's practice
to do so. It was not a
responsibility of the Registrar-General to consider or decide whether what the
transfer said about identifying
the land benefited was correct or effectual, or
whether it could be improved on. No notification of the restrictive covenant
appeared
on either of the certificates of title volume 2754 folio 36 and folio
236. However on the same date, 21 August 1956, a notification
was made on
certificate of the title volume 2981 folio 186 saying: "The above mentioned
transfer number G 555295 contains a restrictive
covenant". There was nothing on
the certificate of title to indicate which land had the benefit of the
restrictive covenant, and
to find that out it was necessary to inspect the
memorandum of transfer; a searcher who did that would find nothing to identify
the
benefited land except the reference to certificate of title volume 2954
folio 36.  The searcher would not find any indication that
the land in
certificate of title volume 2954 folio 236, or that the land at 24 Kulgoa Road
Bellevue Hill (however described), was
benefited. In particular the
transferors' address did not appear on the memorandum of transfer.
<P>

9	     The position did not materially change although number 22 Kulgoa Road
passed through several hands.  Mrs Judith Goodman became
sole registered
proprietor as surviving joint tenant on 1 July 1971.  Then Mr N C Todd and Mrs
S G Todd became joint tenants by a
transfer registered on 29 August 1984. At
this point that certificate of tile was cancelled but reference to the
restrictive covenant
was carried forward in later editions.  Mr Pollak agreed
to purchase number 22 Kulgoa Road from the Todds on 2 August 1997 and became
the registered proprietor at some time before the issue of his summons.  Number
24 Kulgoa Road also went through several ownerships
and was acquired by the
Milders in 1989. They did not then know of the restrictive covenant but learnt
of it several years later.
<P>

10	     Late in 1991 Mr Todd approached the Milders and sought their approval
of plans for a second storey at the rear of number
22 Kulgoa Road.  The Milders
signed the plans to indicate their consent, not then being aware that there was
a restrictive covenant
which might have some bearing on the matter. They say in
evidence that they saw the Todds' project as being (as indeed it was) one
in
which building and town planning controls required the neighbours to be
consulted. The Todds' plans were later approved by council,
but the Todds did
not build the second storey and the approval has lapsed. The Milders first
learnt of the restrictive covenant in
1992 when Mr Todd first asked them to
sign some documents. The terms of the documents are not shown but whatever they
were this caused
them to know of the existence of the restrictive covenant.  Mr
Todd offered them financial compensation for extinguishment of the
covenant,
although no agreement was reached.  I infer from his attempts to have the
covenant extinguished that Mr Pollak has some
building plans or wishes to have
the opportunity to build upwards.
<P>

11	     The contract (exhibit 2) by which Mr Pollak bought his house from the
Todds includes an acknowledgment in special condition
29.1 that a copy of
transfer G 555295 was annexed: it was and the restrictive covenant clearly
appeared in it. The contractual effect
was that as between himself and the
Todds Mr Pollak was clearly fixed with notice of the existence and terms of the
restrictive covenant
when he purchased the property and could make no objection
to completing his purchase on the basis that it existed. However, what
he was
told was the exact terms of the restrictive covenant including its annexation
to the land in certificate of tile 2754 folio
36: he was not told in the
contract and so far as evidence shows he was not told in any way that this
reference was wrong, or that
the benefit was actually annexed to some other
land or to number 24 Kulgoa Road, or that the Milders had any entitlement.
Further
he did not in his contract with the Todds give any contractual or other
undertaking or promise to observe or respect or in any way
to attend to any
rights of the Milders relating to the restrictive covenant or to anything else.
There is no possible view of the
facts in which Mr Pollak gave a contractual
promise or undertaking to the Todds the benefit which was to be held on trust
for the
Milders or which in any way related to the Milders.
<P>

12	     The restrictive covenant when understood according to the literal terms
of the transfer must be extinguished because it
could not  possibly benefit
land at Second Street Lambton and so understood it was invalid from the
start.
<P>

13	     Evidence before me did not explain why the Milders were joined as
defendants and Mr Pollak in evidence could not explain
this, but their conduct
of the proceedings shows that they have been active to maintain that they have
the right to enforce the restrictive
covenant.  The probabilities are that in
some way it became known to Mr Pollak or those representing him that it was
likely that
there would be some measure of attempted enforcement from the
Milders' quarter and that it was for this reason that they became defendants.
Their conduct in the litigation amply shows that they asserted an interest in
whether or not the restrictive covenant was to be extinguished.
<P>

14	     At some time about October or November 1998, and it would seem for the
first time, an approach was made on behalf of Mr
Pollak to the registered
proprietor of the land at Lambton. Naturally enough that person consented to
the extinguishment of the restrictive
covenant, and an application by Mr Pollak
led to the notification of the restrictive covenant being cancelled on 31
December 1998
when the Registrar-General removed the notification on
certificate of title volume 2981 folio 186 for number 22 Kulgoa Road. This
was
done by administrative steps and not by any order or step in the litigation
then pending in the Court;  the Milders were not
told that such steps were
being taken, nor was the Court.
<P>

15	     At the hearing before me on 1 February 1999 Mr Pollak by his counsel
took the position that the restrictive covenant now
has been extinguished and
effectively so, and that Mr Pollak has no need to press further for judicial
decision but should have leave
to discontinue.
<P>

16	     Dr R G Milder and Dr K R Milder who each appeared in person both
opposed leave to discontinue and Dr R G Milder pressed
three applications by
notice of motion, one of 10 September 1998 and two of 1 February 1999, in which
he asked in several different
formulations that transfer G 555295 be rectified
and that the Registrar-General's action which led to the removal of the
notification
of the restrictive covenant be set aside. Dr K R Milder supported
these positions.
<P>

17	     I find on the basis of the circumstances I have mentioned that the
parties to transfer G 555295 intended to annex the benefit
of the restrictive
covenant to the land at 24 Kulgoa Road which the Milders now own and the
reference to folio 36 was a mistake.
<P>

18	     It is easy to suppose that there was probably some contractual
relationship between the parties to the transfer other than
the transfer itself
(which in its own terms shows that it was a transfer for value), and that
either by referring to the terms of
their contract or simply by reasoning from
the circumstances the McHardies as transferors in proceedings brought against
the Goodmans,
the original transferees, were at one time able to obtain
rectification of the transfer and registration of the transfer as rectified.
It
is not, however, possible to be certain that this was so or to examine properly
the rights between those parties in view of the
time which has passed and the
many changes in circumstances including the identity of the parties affected.
It is not possible to
know whether there were or ever came to be any effective
defences  available to the transferees against a claim for the rectification
of
the transfer: the remedy is discretionary, delay is important, hardship is a
defence and the terms of their contract or later
dealings may have affected the
decision in some way which the Milders cannot now show.
<P>

19	     There is no relationship whatever between the Milders and Mr Pollak
which would confer on the Milders an equity against
Mr Pollak for the
rectification of the transfer.  In no sense are the Milders assignees of the
claim for rectification or authorised
to act in the names or on behalf of the
original covenantees: they have not suggested there has ever been an attempt to
assign such
a claim to them (and I interpose that assignment of such a claim
may not have been possible).  The Milders did not even know that
there was a
restrictive covenant let alone that the original transferors might have had a
rectification claim until some years after
they bought number 24 Kulgoa Road
and until thirty-five years after the covenant was given. There is no basis
either on which the
burden of or liability to a rectification claim could pass
to Mr Pollak.
<P>

20	     The Milders have no equity against Mr Pollak to rectification of the
transfer. This is so for a number of reasons. There
was no contractual
relationship between them, no contractual obligation of Mr Pollak to confer or
confirm a restrictive covenant,
and no other undertaking of any kind by Mr
Pollak to do any equivalent act, with or without consideration.  The parties
are simply
not relevantly related in any way which would confer an equity to
obtain rectification on the Milders.
<P>

21	     In my opinion a claim for rectification of a conveyance of land is a
mere equity and not an equitable interest, and the
law relating to notice
including constructive notice of equitable interests in land and the
obligations to respect equitable interests
which may fall on persons who take
conveyances do not apply to protect mere equities including rectification
claims. I have stated
my views that mere equities do not participate in such
competitions in<b> Double Bay Newspapers Pty Limited &amp; ors v A W Holdings
Pty Limited &amp; ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 409.</a></b>
<P>

22	     In any event there is, in my view, no basis on the facts for a finding
that Mr Pollak took title to the land with actual
or constructive notice that
the Milders or the land which the Milders owned had the benefit of a
restrictive covenant whether duly
created or arising out of a claim for
rectification of a transfer.  Quite to the contrary the copy of the transfer
annexed to the
contract and the search which the evidence shows Mr Pollak
carried out at about the time he bought his land showed him that the benefit
of
the covenant was annexed to the land at Lambton and did not show (but
contradicted) that the benefit was annexed to the  Milders'
land. The
information available to Mr Pollak definitely showed that the Milders did not
have the benefit of a restrictive covenant.
 There was no notice to him that
they had any claim to have one up to the time when he completed his purchase
and paid for it: or
indeed until much later when their position emerged from
their affidavits in these proceedings.
<P>

23	     The reasons I have given thus far do not deal with what I regard as the
most important source of Mr Pollak's protection,
subs 42 (1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act 1900</a>, the effect of which is that Mr Pollak owned his land
"...subject to such other  estates and interests and such entries, if any,
as
are recorded ... and absolutely free from all other estates and interests not
so recorded..."  Subs 42 (1) goes on to nominate
some exceptions none of which
relate to this case and none of which relate to restrictive covenants at
all.
<P>

24	     There is no indication in the evidence of anything which could
rationally be regarded as fraud in any sense on the part
of Mr Pollak. Dr D G
Milder suggested that there was, but this suggestion, which was not properly
considered and should have been
made, depended on reasoning to the effect that
it should have been clear to Mr Pollak when he bought the land from his
knowledge
of the transfer that the neighbouring land in Kulgoa Road was
intended to be benefited. The suggestion that there was any fraud was
quite
wrong in fact and utterly baseless. There is no possible element of a personal
equity enforceable against Mr Pollak such as
was considered by the High Court
in<b> Bahr v Nicolay [No 2] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%20164%20CLR%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 164 CLR 604.</a></b>
<P>

25	     In my finding the interest relating to the restrictive covenant
recorded in the register relating to 22 Kulgoa Road was
an interest the benefit
of which was annexed in purport (although without effect) to the land at
Lambton and on no basis could it
be known from reading the Register, including
reading both the certificate of title and the transfer referred to in the
notification,
or could it be supposed at all that the benefit was annexed to
the Milders' land.  Nor should the Register have made this known:
the transfer
as lodged was duly registered and everything that it purported to do was made
known to those who duly searched. Whether
or not the notification had been
cancelled on 31 December 1998 Mr Pollak was exempt from the Milders' claim. I
do not think that
the fact that the notification was written off on 31 December
1998 is of any real importance for the rights of the parties to these
proceedings, although it was a signal for the plaintiff to desist from asking
the Court to determine those rights.
<P>

26	     In my opinion Mr Pollak is entitled to a further protection having
regard to the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88.html" class="autolink_findacts">s88</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> as they stood in 1956
and as they are now: the amendments in the interim are not significant for what
I now say. Subs 88 (1) provides
to the effect that a restriction arising under
a covenant:-
<P>

	<i>     "... shall not be enforceable against a person interested in the land
claimed to be subject to the covenant or restriction, and
not being a party to
its creation, unless the instrument clearly indicates:-</i>
<P>

	<i>		(a) the land to which the benefit of the covenant </i>
<P>

<i>	or restriction is  appurtenant..."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

	and other matters.
<P>

27	     The protection created relates to what is clearly indicated by the
instrument itself and not what is indicated by the instrument
when indications
are also taken from surrounding circumstances which show that the terms of the
instrument are incorrect. In my view
the subsection enacts an additional reason
why rectification of an instrument creating a restrictive covenant cannot be
granted against
a person  other than a party to its creation.
<P>

28	     For these reasons I am of the view that the Milders are not entitled to
any of the relief claimed in Dr D G Milder's three
notices of motion.  It was
in retrospect inappropriate for him to make these claims by notices of motion
as they claim principal
and not interlocutory relief. However proper
consideration of the plaintiff's application for leave to discontinue required
that
they be addressed.
<P>

	
<P>

29	     The orders are:
<P>

     1. The plaintiff has leave to discontinue the proceedings.
<P>

     2. Direct that notice of discontinuance be filed within two 
<P>

days.
<P>

    3. The first defendant's notice of motion of 10 December 
<P>

1998 and two notices of motion of 1 February 1999 are dismissed.
<P>

30	      I turn to the questions of costs.  Dr K R Milder filed an appearance
in person on 11 May 1998 and has never been represented
on the record by any
solicitor although in fact Mr Southwick of counsel attended instructed by a
solicitor for the second defendant
before the Registrar on 11 May 1998. Dr D G
Milder filed an appearance in person on 13 March 1998.  Mr Goodman solicitor
went on
the record as his solicitor on 16 June 1998 and so continued until
notice of Dr D G Milder's intention to act without a solicitor
was filed on 9
September 1998.
<P>

31	     In my view they are entitled to an order for costs for the professional
attendances on their behalf at those stages in the
proceedings, having regard
to the discontinuance.  The costs orders which I make should be so understood.
The attendances at court
on 1 February 1999 and today are largely attributable
to resistance to the application for leave to discontinue and to the hearing
of
Dr D G Milder's notice of motion and that resistance and the notices of motion
were altogether unsuccessful. In my view the plaintiff
should recover the costs
of them.
<P>

32	     The costs orders are as follows:
<P>

     1. I order the plaintiff pay the legal professional costs of the 
<P>

proceedings incurred by the defendants D G Milder and K R Milder.
<P>

     2. I order that the defendant D G Milder pay the plaintiff's 
<P>

costs of the Notice of Motion of 10 September 1998 and the two Notices of
Motion of 1 February 1999 and of the attendances on 1
and 2 February 1999.
<P>

     3. I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of Australia and 
<P>

New Zealand Banking Group Limited as a submitting defendant.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-32 are the reasons for judgment of the
Honourable Justice John Bryson.
<P>

Dated 3 March 1999.	(H D LEWIS)
<P>

Associate.
