<b><u>1396/99 GAMILAROI BOOMERANGS SPORTS ABORIGINAL CORPORATION v MEMBERS OF
NEW ENGLAND GROUP 19 AND ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b> <b>on separate question</b>
<P>

<b>General Outline</b>
<P>

1	The Gamilaroi Boomerangs Sports Aboriginal Corporation has for some years
fielded a team, which I will call the Moree Boomerangs,
in the Country Rugby
League Competition and more recently in what is known as the New England Group
19 Competition conducted under
the auspices of the Country Rugby League of New
South Wales Incorporated (CRL).
<P>

2	A resolution of the third defendant, if valid, has had the effect of
excluding the plaintiff from the Group 19 Competition and
according to the CRL
from any competition conducted under its auspices.
<P>

3	On 17 February 1999 I ordered the following question be tried as a separate
question:
<P>

	Whether the third defendant had power pursuant to the constitution of the
second defendant to make the decisions purported to be
made on 3 February
1999:
<P>

(a)	to alter the boundaries of the Group 19 competition to exclude the Moree
Boomerangs;
<P>

(b)	determining that the clubs participating in the Group 19 rugby league
competitions for 1999 shall be Guyra, Armidale, Glen Innes,
Warialda, Inverell,
Uralla, Walcha, Armidale YCW, Tingha and Narwon without including the plaintiff
in some other competition conducted
by the second defendant.
<P>

4	The decisions of the Boundaries and Competitions Committee referred to in the
separate question were as follows:
<P>

		[To]
<P>

(a)	hereby alter the boundaries of the Group 19 competition to exclude the
Moree Boomerangs; and
<P>

(b)	determine that the clubs participating in the Group 19 rugby league
competitions for 1999 shall be Guyra, Armidale, Glen Innes,
Warialda, Inverell,
Uralla, Walcha, Armidale, YCW, Tingha and Narwon.
<P>

5	The CRL is a body formed for the purpose of promoting and conducting the game
of Rugby League in New South Wales.  Its objects
and powers are directed
towards this prime purpose and include power to control constituent bodies,
power to define territories allocated
to constituent bodies, power to determine
which clubs shall be entitled to enter a team for league competitions conducted
by the
CRL, power to hear complaints against a constituent body, and power to
impose penalties, including expulsion, on constituent bodies
for breach of the
constitution or rules and regulations of the League or the laws relating to
Rugby League.  The CRL is made up of
constituent bodies.  Those bodies include
football organisations referred to as groups of which New England Group 19 is
one, and
clubs within divisions or groups.
<P>

6	The plaintiff has been accepted as a member of Group 19 for some years and at
least until recent events was therefore a constituent
body under Clause 4(c) of
the constitution of the CRL.
<P>

7	The ordinary affairs of the CRL are managed by a general committee elected at
an annual conference.  The general committee has
some power of delegation to
sub-committees and certain specific sub-committees are provided for under the
constitution, including
a management committee, an executive committee, an
appeal board and a boundary and competition committee.  The provisions about
appeals
are quite elaborate, but appear on their face to be applicable in the
most part to appeals by individual players and not to be applicable
to some
challenge by a constituent body to some decision made by some higher
controlling body, such as the decision made by Group
19 about the Moree
Boomerangs.  In certain circumstances, which would include expulsion of a
player, there is a further right of
appeal to the general committee of the
CRL.
<P>

8	Clause 36 of the CRL constitution is that relevant to the Boundary and
Competition Committee:
<P>

	<b>Boundary and Competition Committee - Amended 30.11.96</b>
<P>

36.	(1)	The Boundary and Competition Committee shall be elected at the Annual
Conference and shall consist of the Executive plus
three members elected from
the General Committee - <b>Amended 29.11.97</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>(2)	Its duties shall be:
<P>

		(a)	to alter or otherwise fix boundaries as they deem advisable for the
benefit of Rugby League within the area under control
of the League
<P>

		(b)	to discuss and determine applications for alterations to Constituent Body
boundaries, both Group and Divisional which shall
be made by Constituent Bodies
prior to 1st September in each year
<P>

		(c)	to hear and determine any matters that may be referred to it concerning
boundaries by the Executive, Management Committee
or General Committee
<P>

		(d)	to establish competitions within those boundaries and to determine which
teams or clubs shall compete in those competitions
from time to time -
<b>Additional 2.2.91</b>
<P>

	(3)	The decision of the Boundary &amp; Competition Committee shall be final
<P>

	(4)	Each Division shall form a special Boundary and Competition Committee
within the Division to recommend competitions within
the Division and shall
submit same to the League Boundary &amp; Competition Committee for
consideration through their respective
Division.
<P>

So far as 36(4) is concerned Clause 39 provides that for the time being Group
4, New England 19 and Group 21 are to form the Northern
Division of the CRL.

<P>

9	Clauses 40 to 43 deal with discipline and appeals.  Clause 40 seems to be
relevant to conduct of individuals.  Clause 41, 42 and
43 are as follows:
<P>

41.	The General Committee, Management Committee or Executive Committee may call
upon any Constituent body or football association
or organisation within it to
make proper inquiry into any matter which in its opinion in any matter affects
the control and welfare
and/or interest of Rugby League Football.  Failing
compliance with any such direction the General Committee, Management Committee
or Executive Committee may take such disciplinary action as it deems fit.
<P>

42.	The General Committee or Management Committee shall have the power to
disqualify, fine or otherwise deal with any Constituent
Body or football
association or organisation within it found guilty of any breach of this
constitution or any by-law or regulation
made thereunder or of any non
compliance with any direction issued under the authority of this constitution
or any by-law or regulation
made thereunder.
<P>

43.	Any person, Constituent Body or other body aggrieved by a decision of the
Management Committee pursuant to Clause 40, 41 and
42 aforesaid, may appeal to
the General Committee whose decision shall be final.  The provisions of clause
31(10) of this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> shall be incorporated mutatis mutandis into this
clause as though set out in full.
<P>

10	It is clear that there arose, at least during 1998, complaints about the
conduct of Moree Boomerangs and their supporters, both
on and off the field.
For the purpose of the present decision it is not necessary to go further into
this.  At the annual general
meeting of Group 19 held on 8 November 1998, it
was resolved to accept all applications for affiliation for the 1999 season
except
that application of the Moree Boomerangs.  At a general committee
meeting of Group 19, held on 7 December 1998, a resolution to accept
the
affiliation of Moree Boomerangs was defeated.  In other proceedings, Hamilton J
has held that there was no power to pass the
first resolution and no power in
the general committee of Group 19 to take action which would have the effect of
excluding the plaintiff
from affiliation with Group 19.
<P>

11	On 23 December 1998, the General Manager of CRL wrote to the plaintiff
corporation stating that a meeting of the CRL Boundary
and Competition
Committee would be held on 23 January 1999.  The letter went on to state:
<P>

	The purpose of the meeting is to discuss and determine applications for
alteration to the boundaries of Group 19 and to determine
which Clubs shall
compete in the competition to be conducted by the Group.  As your Club is a
Club affected by the applications,
the Club is invited through its
representatives to attend the meeting and make such submissions as it is
advised.
<P>

	After hearing all submissions, the Committee shall make a decision.
<P>

12	The CRL has determined boundaries of groups on a geographical basis for a
considerable period.  The latest map delineating those
boundaries is in
evidence and shows the boundaries as determined in 1988.  There has been no
change to these boundary lines made
since.  The whole of New South Wales apart
from Newcastle, the Central Coast and Sydney, appears to have been divided into
group
areas.  Moree would be in the Group 4 geographic area and originally it
seems that two teams from Moree, namely the Moree Boomerangs
and Moree Boars,
played in the Group 4 competition.  It seems that in 1990 the Moree Boomerangs
were included in the Group 19 competition.
 In 1994 the Boundaries and
Competition Committee resolved that the Moree Boars and the Moree Boomerangs be
placed in separate competitions,
those being the Group 19 and Group 4
competitions.  Apparently there was then a draw conducted as a result of which
the Moree Boars
were placed in Group 4 and the Moree Boomerangs in Group 19.
<P>

13	All this was done at a time when the relevant committee was called the
Boundary Committee.  In 1996 the constitution was amended
and the name of the
relevant committee was altered to the Boundary and Competition Committee.  It
seems this was because territorial
boundaries had become less significant and
some teams were playing in competitions outside their geographic group
areas.
<P>

<b>Resolution of Separate Question</b>
<P>

14	The third defendant says that the resolution was within the powers of the
committee under Clause 36 of the constitution.  I am
not sure that it was
really argued that it was within Clause 36(2), but in any event it could not
have been, because there is no
suggestion that the committee was dealing with
an application for alteration of a boundary by a constituent body.  In addition
it
is clear that the word "boundaries" refers to the boundaries of geographic
areas.  Insofar as the resolution is framed as being a
determination of
boundaries it is clearly void.  Boundaries are not teams.
<P>

15	The argument based on Clause 34(2)(d) is somewhat stronger.  However, the
effect of the resolution is to expel the Moree Boomerangs
from the CRL
competition.  A letter from the solicitors for the CRL dated 10 February 1999
makes this clear, as it says in its final
paragraph, in response to an inquiry
from the plaintiff's solicitors as to what competition the Moree Boomerangs
team is part of
that:  "Your client, as a result of its past conduct, is not
now part of a CRL competition".  This letter, and the decision of the
Boundary
and Competition Committee itself makes it clear the action was taken on the
basis of conduct and not capacity.  The Committee
report and decision says it
was hearing "submissions, applications and complaints relating to Group 19".  A
power of expulsion needs
to be clearly stated unless its implication is so
obvious it goes without saying.  When the appeal provisions concerning players'
conduct are borne in mind, it would be extraordinary to imply power to exclude
- at least on a ground other than lack of footballing
capacity - with such
decision to be final.  I consider the widest powers given under Clause 36(2)(d)
are to place teams outside geographic
areas in competitions in those areas; to
relegate and advance teams in the various grades; and to exclude teams which do
not have
the capacity to play in any available grade.
<P>

16	What the committee has purported to do is first to alter the boundaries of
Group 19 in a manner for which there was no power,
and then to exclude the
Moree Boomerangs from the competition conducted in the altered boundaries.  On
any basis it seems to me that
resolution is bad.
<P>

17	The result of all of this is that the first question should be answered -
"No".  I do not think that it is desirable to answer
the second question yes or
no as in its general terms it could go to capacity and not to conduct and I
would have thought that the
Boundary and Competition Committee should have
power to determine that a team was not of sufficient standard to be admitted to
play
in any of the grades available in a particular group area.  I would answer
it "No if the basis of exclusion is based upon conduct".
<P>

18	I should end up by saying that I accept, as was pressed upon me at some
length and with considerable emphasis by senior counsel
for the League, that it
is desirable that matters of this kind be determined, at least in the first
instance, in the local area and
possibly then be subject to appeal to the CRL.
That is a matter which would readily be achieved by amendment of the rules of
the
CRL and of the group constitutions if necessary.  This decision relates
only to the power to make the determination made.  It says
nothing whatever
about the conduct complained of which was the reason for the determination.
<P>

19	The answers can be recorded but as it is likely they determine the outcome
of the proceedings the parties can consider whether
final orders should be made
and if so the terms of those orders.
<P>

I certify that paragraphs <b>1 to 19 </b>are a true copy of the Reasons for
Judgment given by Mr Justice Windeyer in matter <b>1396/99 Gamilaroi Boomerangs
Sports Aboriginal Corporation v Members of New England Group 19.</b>
