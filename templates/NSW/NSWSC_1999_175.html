SCAFFOLDING &amp; RIGGING </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: These proceedings commenced by a summons filed on 5 November 1998
under section 459G of the Corporations Law by which
the plaintiff seeks to set
aside the defendant's Notice of Demand dated 15 October 1998 and served on 19
October 1998.
<P>

2	The defendant's demand was for the sum of $11,795.45 and related to three
invoices, namely: 
<P>

	Invoice 73537 24 July 1998          $5,661.10
<P>

	Invoice 3557  6 August 1998          4,541.10
<P>

	Invoice 3567 13 August 1998         1,593.25
<P>

	These invoices relate to the hire, supply and erection of scaffolding by the
defendant to a building site where the plaintiff was
the builder.
<P>

3	The plaintiff contends that there is a genuine dispute as to the existence of
all but $2431.90 of the debt.  It appears that the
grounds for the plaintiff
resisting the statutory demand have shifted over time.  The plaintiff relied on
no fewer than five affidavits
of Mr Byrnes, its sole director, sworn on 30
October 1998, 4 December 1998, 29 January 1999, 18 February 1999 and 22
February 1999.
<P>

4	In the first affidavit Mr Byrnes denied that any money was owing.
Substantial parts of the plaintiff's affidavits were not read
and I was told by
counsel for the defendant that various earlier grounds of objection had been
abandoned.  While therefore there
is no evidence of the substantive grounds
which have been abandoned, I am entitled to infer that there has been a
shifting of ground.
<P>

5	Be that as it may, the plaintiff now says that its dispute with the
defendant, apart from a few minor amounts, relates to a single
issue:  namely,
whether there were two hiring contracts or only one between the parties.
<P>

6	The first hiring contract arose out of the defendant's contract quotation
number 2389, a document addressed to `Jim Burns' with
respect to `Burns
Corporation'.  The document was dated 19 February 1998 and was addressed to
facsimile number 99571041.  It related
to the hire of scaffolding for Lot 10
Playfair Road, Mt Colah and included a weekly hiring charge of $400 and other
charges.  The
contract arose through the acceptance of the offer constituted by
contract quotation 2389 and there is no dispute that such a contract
was in
existence.
<P>

7	The second alleged contract is disputed by the plaintiff.  The evidence is a
contract quotation number 2420 addressed to `Vlad/Jim
Burns' of `Burns
Corporation'.  It also refers to Lot 10 Playfair Road, Mt Colah.  The facsimile
number 99571041 is crossed out by
hand and another facsimile number, namely
96109687, is inserted by hand.  The document is dated 6 April 1998 and refers
to scaffolding
hire at a weekly hire rate of $970.
<P>

8	The defendant says that contract quotation number 2420 was accepted by the
plaintiff by documents which the defendant puts in
evidence.  Those documents
comprise a single page apparently headed `Purchase Order' (though the copy in
evidence is partly obscured),
and a handwritten facsimile from Vlad Barac to
the defendant.
<P>

9	The former document is dated 7 April 1998 and cross-refers to contract
quotation 2420.  It is endorsed `Your urgent attention
required' and bears a
signature which appears to be the signature of Vlad Barac.  The evidence is
that Mr Barac was a sub-contractor
of the plaintiff and was the site manager
for the project at Playfair Road, Mt Colah.
<P>

10	The second document appears on its face to have been transmitted from
facsimile number 96109687 `VNB Proj Man'.  I infer that
this facsimile was sent
from a facsimile machine operated by Mr Barac.  The facsimile number is the
same as the facsimile number
entered by hand on contract quotation 2420 and
therefore I infer that contract quotation 2420 was sent to Mr Barac.
<P>

11	The handwritten facsimile bears date 8 April 1998 and is addressed to Mr
McVeigh, who is the defendant's manager.  It says:
<P>

	`In regard to my telephone conversation even date with your office find
following our purchase order number 063902,'
<P>

	and purports to be signed by Mr Barac.
<P>

12	The defendant says that subsequently the parties acted on both contracts,
and invoices were submitted by the defendant to the
plaintiff in respect of
both contracts, which were paid, except for the three invoices in dispute.
<P>

13	The plaintiff says that Mr Barac, though he was site manager, lacked
authority to enter into a contract to bind it with respect
to the hire of
scaffolding.  According to Mr Byrnes' affidavit sworn on 4 December 1998, he,
as the sole director of the plaintiff
company, was the only person with
authority to enter into agreement with respect to such matters, and he says
that he did not agree
at any time.  He asserts that Mr Barac was never granted
authority and he says that in respect of the industry to which the plaintiff
and defendant both belong the usual practice and the usual authority of the
site foreman is merely to execute documents such as those
which confirm the
time spent by a sub-contractor at the site and similar matters forming the
source documents for the preparation
of sub-contractor invoices.
<P>

14	The defendant did not tender any evidence to contradict the plaintiff's
assertion that the usual authority of a site foreman
does not extend to
entering into a contract of this kind.
<P>

15	As to the subsequent payment of accounts referable to the alleged second
contract, Mr Byrnes says that there was a running account
between the plaintiff
and the defendant and that he did not notice that claims were made at a weekly
hiring charge of $970 rather
than $400 until after receiving the statutory
demand.
<P>

16	According to Mr Byrnes, the true position is that there was an original
hiring contract for scaffolding arising out of contract
quotation 2389 and then
subsequently there was a conversation, to which he deposed most recently in his
affidavit  of 22 February
1999.  According to that evidence, Mr Byrnes placed
the original order in a telephone conversation with Mr McVeigh in mid-February
1998 and then in late March or early April 1998 he had a further discussion
with Mr McVeigh.  During the further discussion Mr Byrnes
asked Mr McVeigh
whether he could supply scaffolding for a second unit and Mr McVeigh said:
`Yes.  Sure we can.  We will just double
the quantity.'
<P>

17	Mr Byrnes contends that the effect of that conversation was that the
additional scaffolding would be supplied under the original
contract at a
hiring rate of $400 per week.
<P>

18	This case comes before me as an application to set aside a statutory demand
for an asserted debt.  It is not an action in which
the existence of the debt
needs to be proved or disproved.  The correct approach to a matter of this kind
was described by McLelland
CJ in Eq in <i>Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACSR%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACSR 785</a> at 787.  
<P>

19	His Honour said that the issue to be determined is whether there is a
genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the debt.
 He said:
<P>

	`... that expression connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation,
and raises much the same sort of considerations as
the 'serious question to be
tried' criterion which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction
or for the extension
or removal of a caveat.  This does not mean that the court
must accept uncritically as giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement
in an affidavit 'however equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with
undisputed contemporary documents or other statements
by the same deponent, or
inherently improbable in itself, it may be' ...
<P>

	But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a court required to
determine whether there is a genuine dispute should
not embark upon an inquiry
as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute.
 There is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute.'
<P>

20	A similar approach is exhibited in the judgment of Hayne J in <i>Mibor
Investments Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i> (1993) 11 ACSC
363.
<P>

21	It appears from those two judgments that the Court ought to allow
cross-examination, if at all, only sparingly.  The question
of whether there is
a genuine dispute ought in most cases be assessed on the basis of the
documentary evidence.
<P>

22	In this case the defendant indicated that it wished to cross-examine Mr
Byrnes.  After the affidavit evidence was read and the
evidence was otherwise
closed, I decided not to permit cross-examination of Mr Byrnes.  The
plaintiff's counsel indicated at that
stage that he wished to adduce further
evidence from Mr Byrnes through his re-examination of that witness.  I
indicated to him then,
and I remain of the view, that it is not appropriate to
rely on re-examination to adduce evidence after the evidentiary case has
otherwise been closed.  I also remain of the view that it was not necessary in
the present case to permit cross-examination of Mr
Byrnes, essentially for the
reasons given by McLelland CJ in Eq and Hayne J in the cases to which I have
referred.
<P>

23	In its essence this case is a simple one.  The question is whether the
documentary evidence before the Court demonstrates that
there is a genuine
dispute as to whether the second contract was or was not entered into in a
manner binding the plaintiff.  On that
simple issue, I have come to the view
that there is no room for a genuine dispute on the question in view of the
evidence before
me.
<P>

24	The matter was put by the defendant on a number of bases.  In particular,
the defendant said that the proved facts demonstrated
the ingredients of
section 129(3)(b) of the Corporations Law.  According to that provision, a
person may assume that anyone who is
held out by the company to be an officer
or agent of the company has authority to exercise the powers and perform the
duties customarily
exercised or performed by that kind of officer or agent of a
similar company.
<P>

25	It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff held out Mr Barac as an
agent of the company; namely, a site manager.  Consequently,
the defendant was
entitled to assume that Mr Barac had authority to exercise the powers and
perform the duties of a site manager.
<P>

26	The difficulty for the defendant, however, is that the only evidence before
the Court on the question of usual authority of a
site manager indicates that
it does not extend to making contracts of this kind.  Therefore, in my opinion
the plaintiff's reliance
on section 129(3)(b) to show that there is no genuine
dispute is unsuccessful.
<P>

27	However, section 129 of the Corporations Law is not by any means an
exclusive code of the circumstances in which a company may
become bound by
conduct of a person purporting to be the company's agent.  It is
well-established by principles of the general law
of agency that a third party
may hold a company bound by conduct purporting to be undertaken on the
company's behalf if the person
purporting so to act is clothed with ostensible
authority by the company.
<P>

28	In my opinion, the undisputed facts in this case lead to the conclusion that
Mr Barac was in fact clothed with ostensible authority
to bind the plaintiff to
the alleged second contract in all the circumstances, even though purely as a
site manager he may not possess
such authority.
<P>

29	The facts which I have set out above indicate that contract quotation 2420
arose as a result of a conversation between Mr Barac
and someone on behalf of
the defendant, presumably Mr McVeigh.  After that conversation took place it
appears that the defendant
sent the contract quotation to a facsimile machine
operated by Mr Barac.
<P>

30	The next step is crucial.  Mr Barac responded by sending by facsimile to Mr
McVeigh a handwritten facsimile cover sheet enclosing
the document apparently
headed `Purchase Order' which appears, on its face, to be a document of the
plaintiff.  The document appears
to be in a standard form and the covering
facsimile refers to it by using a purchase order number.  I infer from this
evidence that
Mr Barac had access to stationery of the plaintiff. 
<P>

31	Further, in the absence of any other evidence, I believe the only
appropriate conclusion is that Mr Barac's access to that stationery
was
obtained with at least the acquiescence of the plaintiff.
<P>

32	That being so, it is correct to say that the plaintiff had in that way armed
Mr Barac with the means of binding it to contracts
with respect to the
operation of the site, even if the usual authority of a site manager would not
go sufficiently far to permit
such a contract to be made.
<P>

33	Given this evidence, it is not to the point for the plaintiff to seek to
prove that Mr Barac was not actually authorised by the
plaintiff through Mr
Byrnes to make the contract.  The plaintiff becomes bound by the contract
whether it knew the contract was entered
into, or whether it expressly
authorised the contract, solely because the person who made the contract on its
behalf was clothed
with ostensible authority to do so in all of the facts and
circumstances.
<P>

34	It seems to me therefore that this is one of the relatively uncommon cases
when it can be said there is no genuine dispute with
respect to the existence
of the second contract and, consequently, the existence of debts flowing from
that contract.  In reaching
my conclusion, I do not place any emphasis on the
fact that invoices referable to the second contract were paid by the plaintiff.
I rely on the ingredients of ostensible authority to which I have referred.
<P>

35	It follows from this reasoning that, except in a number of minor matters, my
conclusion is that there is no genuine dispute with
respect to the amount
claimed in the statutory demand.
<P>

36	There are, however, some further matters on which the plaintiff relies, some
of which are conceded by the defendant.
<P>

37	Mr Lawson, appearing for the defendant, conceded a point raised in paragraph
15 of Mr Byrnes' affidavit of 4 December 1998, in
which an over-charging is
alleged, and also a point raised in paragraph 12 of the same affidavit.  He
informed the Court that the
total reduction in the amount claimed should be
$370.  Mr Cross, for the plaintiff, submitted that there is also a dispute with
respect
to transport pick-up rates involving a charge of $50 on each of two
occasions, but conceded that the dispute with respect to one
charge of $50
depends upon the issue of whether there was or was not a second contract, a
matter which I have resolved against the
plaintiff.
<P>

38	Therefore, as I understand it from the submissions of counsel, it is agreed
that there should be a reduction in the statutory
demand of $370 and it is
contended by the plaintiff, but not conceded, that a further reduction of $50
should be made.  I propose
to make that further reduction as contended for by
the plaintiff.
<P>

39	The result is that the statutory demand should be varied by reducing the
amount claimed by a total sum of $420.  My orders are:
<P>

	1.	That the creditor's statutory demand for payment of debt in the amount of
$11,795.45 dated 15 October 1998 and served on 19
October 1998 be varied by
reducing the amount claimed to $11,375.45.
<P>

	2.	Pursuant to sections 459F(2) and 459(H)(4) of the Corporations Law I
declare that the demand has effect as so varied as from
the date when the
demand was served on the plaintiff.  
<P>

	3.	I dismiss the plaintiff's summons.
<P>

	4.	I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the application.
