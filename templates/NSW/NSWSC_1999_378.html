<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> 
<P>

1	These proceedings relate to the equitable ownership of one-half share
interest as tenant-in-common in the house property at 24
Bradford Street
Balmain.  The plaintiff sues as Administratrix and representative of the
intestate Estate of her late father Andre
Ivanovich Krassoff, and the defendant
is the son of the deceased and the plaintiff's brother.  Until 25 August 1978
the deceased
and Zoe Krassoff, to whom he had formerly been married, were
registered proprietors as joint tenants.  Their marriage was dissolved
on 14
October 1976.  The joint tenancy was severed on registration on 25 August 1978
of a Memorandum of Transfer  from the deceased
to the defendant of an undivided
one-half share.  The transfer was expressed to be for a consideration of Eleven
thousand dollars
($11,000.00), and stamp duty was paid on the basis of that
consideration.  Since registration Zoe Krassoff and the defendant have
been and
remain registered proprietors as tenants-in-common.  Zoe Krassoff's affairs
have for many years been under the control of
the Protective Commissioner, and
she is not a party to this dispute.  Her entitlement to her one-half share is
not under my consideration.
 
<P>

2	The deceased died aged 81 on 16 July 1992 intestate, and this court granted
Letters of Administration on 17 February 1997.  He
was an Age Pensioner and his
only significant asset was the interest which in these proceedings he is
claimed to have had.  The plaintiff's
primary claim is a claim for a
declaration that the defendant holds his half-interest as trustee for the
Estate. The plaintiff's
pleaded case when taken with particulars has the effect
that the trust arose out of an oral agreement between the deceased and the
defendant, and that it was a term of the agreement that the defendant would pay
all accounts and disbursements incidental to the
property and would be
reimbursed for all such payments out of the proceeds of sale of the deceased's
interest  There is an alternative
claim for "<i>a declaration that upon sale of
the said property, the Plaintiff is entitled to the nett proceeds of the sale
of the said half-share
of the said property after an account is taken of any
monies which the defendant has contributed to the maintenance of the property
by way of rates, land tax, mortgage payments, insurance payments and payments
for maintenance."  </i>This claim was based on Clause 2 of the Deed of Release.
There are also claims for ancillary relief, for accounts and inquiries and
for
transfer of the property to the plaintiff.  In oral submissions the plaintiff's
counsel also put forward a claim that there is
a constructive trust over the
property in favour of the Estate.  In a cross-claim the defendant seeks to
establish that if the Estate
has an interest it is subject to a constructive
trust or an equitable mortgage for him in respect of money he paid to the
deceased
relating to the property, or for loans.
<P>

3	There was no contemporaneous writing showing the constitution of the Trust
and conforming to Paragraph (a) or Paragraph (b) of
subs. 23C (1) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act, 1919</a>.  However a number of other writings and circumstances
show, in my finding clearly, that the deceased and the defendant intended
at
the time of the transfer that the defendant should not become the beneficial
owner of the property, but that he should hold it
on trust for his father.
Although the terms of the Memorandum of Transfer seem to show that
consideration of Eleven thousand dollars
($11,000.00) was actually paid, and
although the defendant's evidence shows, in my finding correctly, that he paid
significant sums
of money in excess of Eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) to
his father at about the time of the transfer, my finding is that no
payment was
in fact made to the deceased with the intention that it should be consideration
for the transfer of the land.  
<P>

4	The defendant's evidence clearly shows that the transaction was entered into
for the purpose of severing the joint tenancy so
as to end the possibility that
Zoe Krassoff would become sole owner by survivorship, after taking legal advice
about how that possibility
could be avoided.  The deceased's marriage to Zoe
Krassoff had been dissolved, he had married Nadeschda Kavetsky now known as
Nadia
Kavetsky- Krassoff on 8 May 1977, and he wished to prevent Zoe Krassoff
from benefiting by survivorship.  He also wished if possible
to get the
proceeds of a sale of his interest into his own hands.  The defendant obtained
some legal advice on how to bring this
about and told the deceased, shortly,
what was to be done.  I find that it was the intention of the deceased not to
part with the
beneficial ownership but to protect the beneficial ownership and
keep it at his disposition, and that the defendant shared this intention.
 The
defendant's evidence on affidavit and in cross-examination confirm strongly
that their intentions were as I have stated, and
that the transaction was not
one of sale.  
<P>

5	Letters written on behalf of the defendant by Mr Peter Jay, solicitor who had
acted for both parties on the transfer, confirm
that their intentions were as I
have found.  Mr Jay's letter of 13 December 1978 to solicitors who by that time
represented the deceased
in substance confirms that that was the true nature of
the transaction, although it is doubtful whether the letter would constitute
a
writing conforming with subs. 23C(1).  The letter stated, quite distinctly
"<i>Our client has at all times considered himself to be a trustee of
....."</i> (the house and other property).  The letter went on to say that on
advice the defendant wished to enter into a Deed of Trust declaring
that he
held the one-half share on trust, and the Deed was sent to the deceased's
solicitors.  A letter which Mr Jay wrote to the
deceased on 27 March 1981 also
confirms, with unmistakable clarity, that the one-half share belonged to the
deceased  -  <i>"I recently had a telephone call from David who advised me that
you wished to give him your half share in the Balmain property which
he has
been holding for some time as Trustee for you."  </i>Mr Jay went on to request
the deceased to return the earlier Deed of Trust on the basis that it was no
longer valid as the defendant
would hold the half share as beneficial owner,
and Mr Jay forwarded a form of Deed of Release for execution.  
<P>

6	The Deed of Release of 17 December 1981, which both the deceased and the
defendant executed, contains a recital: <i>"...the said son has at all times
held his interest in the said property in Trust for the father.....".  </i>
<P>

7	The correspondence, and also a recital in the Deed of Release referred to a
Deed of Trust confirming the trust, and the recital
says that the defendant had
executed it.  However, neither party has put the earlier Deed of Trust into
evidence; the correspondence
suggests that the last location for it which was
known was that it was in the hands of the deceased at some time in or before
1981.
 There is no evidence which establishes its date, and its date is left
blank in the reference to it in the recital.  There is no
clear secondary
evidence of its contents apart from what can be inferred from the reference to
it in the recital as a Deed of Trust
confirming the trust.  The defendant at
one place denied that he had executed the Deed of Trust and at another said
that he had no
recollection of executing it.  The solicitor Mr Jay who prepared
it was unable to give evidence about whether it was ever executed.
 Indeed he
had great difficulty in recollecting significant details of the transaction,
and I did not find his difficulty in any
way surprising in view of the length
of time which has elapsed.
<P>

8	My finding on the probabilities is that a Deed of Trust probably was executed
by the defendant and its terms probably established
or recorded the terms of
the trust alleged by the plaintiff.  This finding is principally based upon the
terms of the recital in
the later Deed.  The Deed of Trust  probably satisfied
subs.23C(1).  Even if it did not, the intention to create a trust and the
fact
that it was created are proved clearly, and the parties are shown to have acted
for several years on the basis that a trust
existed, and to have entered into a
further transaction, namely the Deed of Release on the same basis In these
circumstances the
absence of writing would not prevent the plaintiff from
establishing the trust, having regard to the doctrine associated with
<b>Rochefoucauld v Boustead </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281897%29%201%20Ch%20196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1897) 1 Ch. 196</a> at 20; see too <b>Last v

504.</a>
<P>

9	Even if the trust had not been lawfully constituted the effect of the
recital, in a Deed executed by both parties, is in my opinion
that both parties
are bound to have their rights determined in accordance with the state of facts
in the recital and are estopped
from setting-up any other position.
<P>

10	The Deed of Release of 17 December 1981 is the document upon which the
rights of the parties turn.  The Deed in evidence does
not bear a stamp but I
satisfied myself when it was tendered that a copy has been duly stamped.  It
contains three recitals; one
establishes that the defendant was the registered
proprietor, the second I have quoted and the third recites:
<P>

	<i>"it has been agreed by and between the father and the son that the son
should henceforth hold the interest in the said Balmain property
for himself
and not in Trust for the father."</i>
<P>

11	It is now necessary to address the meaning of the operative parts of the
Deed of Release, and I set them out:   
<P>

	<i>"1.  The father </i><cite>HEREBY CONFIRMS AND RATIFIES</cite><i> that the
interest in the said property of the son was held by the son beneficially for
himself and not in Trust for the father and
that the Deed hereinbefore referred
to shall henceforth be null and void and have no effect.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.  The father will use his best endeavours to cause the said Deed of Trust
to be forwarded to the son's Solicitors for cancellation
and in consideration
of the premises the son will take such steps as are mutually agreed upon
between the son and the father to provide
accommodation for the father.
Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained the terms covenants and
conditions herein are conditional
upon the son being able to purchase at a
reasonable market price from Zoey Krassof her share as tenant in common in
equal shares
in the said Balmain property and obtain vacant possession hereof
bearing in mind the funds available to the son and the necessity
for obtaining
the consent of Zoey Krassoff to the sale with vacant possession and/or an order
of the Supreme Court of New South Wales
appointing a Trustee for the sale of
the said property at Balmain i.e. of Zoey Krassoff's one half share at a price
he can reasonably
</i>
<P>

<i>	afford and which he is agreeable to pay.  Alternatively, should the said
David Krassoff sell his share in the property pursuant to
any such Court Order
then he will account to the father for the nett proceeds received upon such
sale and legal costs incurred in
acquiring into the name David Krassoff the
share in the property formerly held by Andre Ivanovich Krassoff and all other
subsequent
ancillary legal expenses including, and if necessary expenses
incurred in the Equity Court of New South Wales in obtaining an Order
for
Sale."</i>
<P>

12	According to its terms, Clause 1 confirms that the defendant held the
property beneficially for himself and annuls the Deed of
Trust.  The words used
speak of confirmation and ratification, but in substance they have the effect
of conveying the beneficial
interest in the property to the defendant; the
intention to do so is clearly to be inferred.  There is no express statement
that
the conveyance was a conveyance for consideration.  Consideration of a
kind appears from the terms of Clause 2; not necessarily very
onerous but
having substance as valuable consideration.  The Deed meets the formal
requirements of paragraph (c) of subs. 23C(1).
 Although there was no attack on
this ground, I will say that I do not think that this should be regarded as a
voluntary disposition
but if it were, it would be binding because it was
effected by a solemn document, executed under seal, and in the most formal
manner
possible for a voluntary assignment of an equitable interest in land.
<P>

13	The plaintiff's position in summary was that all the provisions of Clauses 1
and 2, indeed the whole of the Deed, are conditional
upon the condition in
Clause 2, and as that condition has not been fulfilled the Deed is not in
effect and in particular the conveyance
in Clause 1 is not in effect.
<P>

14	Clause 2 is difficult to follow and the difficulty mainly arises from the
long second sentence.  It is difficult to understand
how much of the provisions
of the Deed of Release is affected by the words <i>"Notwithstanding anything
hereinbefore contained"</i> and what is referred to as <i>"the terms, covenants
and conditions herein."  </i>It is open to doubt whether Clause 1 is part of
the matter <i>"hereinbefore contained" </i>which is made conditional, or
whether the reference is only to the promises, one by the father and one by the
son, made in the preceding
sentence of Clause 2.  It is also open to doubt
whether <i>"the terms, covenants and conditions herein" </i>mean only the two
contractual promises in the first sentence of Clause 1, or whether they extend
to the confirmation and ratification
in Clause 1 or, as the plaintiff's counsel
argued, to the recitals and also the whole Deed.
<P>

15	The provisions in the first sentence of Clause 2 could be spoken of as
terms, covenants and conditions; it does not seem that
the provisions of Clause
1 could be thought of as falling within the literal range of the words
<i>"covenants and conditions", </i>although they could be spoken of as terms.
I do not think that the recitals fall within the literal range of meaning of
<i>"terms, covenants and conditions herein".  </i>The third sentence opens with
the word <i>"Alternatively"</i>.  To what provisions are the provisions of the
third sentence alternative?  Looking at the matter narrowly, the words
<i>"Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained" </i>are ambiguous and they
could literally refer either to earlier provisions in Clause 2, or additionally
to the provisions in Clause
1 or (a third alternative) to the recitals also.
<P>

16	I will seek to look at Clause 2 at a slightly greater distance and to
consider the purposes of its provisions overall.  In the
Deed of Release the
father gave up something, an interest in land; and it is to be expected that by
another provision he got something
back.  The defendant gained something, the
interest in land; and he incurred a burden, the covenant to take steps to
provide accommodation;
not necessarily an onerous burden, depending on what was
later mutually agreed upon.  The purposes of the Deed included putting the
defendant into control of assets to enable him or to assist him to meet the
accommodation obligation.  The condition in the second
sentence gave the son an
opportunity to avoid obligations, if he could not purchase Zoe Krassoff's share
or could not sell his share
on a basis agreeable to him; the condition was
there to meet his difficulty and was wholly for his benefit.  The defendant's
inability
to purchase the other share or to force a sale by Court order would
not create any need for the deceased to avoid the transaction.
 No time limit
was set for the condition to be fulfilled, and there is no reason to think that
the time within which the defendant
could rely on the condition has yet
expired.  Consideration of the purposes of the provisions of the deed points
towards the condition
being one on which the defendant can escape from the
accommodation obligation if he wishes to do so; but the purposes are not
entirely
inconsistent with its being a condition upon which he can escape from
the whole transaction.  
<P>

17	The facts make it clear that the defendant has never done anything to avoid
the Deed or elect to rely on the condition.  The
evidence does not show that
the deceased ever did any such thing either, or for that matter that the
plaintiff has, and the evidence
included no examination of whether the
condition has been fulfilled or has failed.  As there is no time limit for it
to be fulfilled,
there is no reason to find that it has failed.  My view is
that the condition probably affects only the earlier covenants in Clause
2; but
even if this is wrong, the condition has never operated to have whatever
avoiding effect it was intended to have.  If the
condition ever did fail only
the defendant could rely on it, as it is wholly for his benefit.  The evidence
shows that the deceased
did not ever cause the Deed of Trust to be forwarded
for cancellation, and as the deceased has died and there is no longer any
accommodation
obligation, it is not practically possible that the son will ever
hereafter attempt to rely on the condition to avoid the transaction.
 I find
that the condition affects Clause 2 only, but the outcome would not be
different if it affected the whole Deed of Release
including the recitals.
<P>

18	In my view the provisions of the third sentence are alternative to the
accommodation obligation; that is the only alternative
burden which the
defendant could bear.  As he has not sold his share pursuant to a court order,
and has not sold it at all, the obligation
to account has never arisen.  In my
opinion, an obligation which was alternative to the accommodation obligation
could only exist
during the father's lifetime.  With the deceased's death, any
obligation to provide accommodation came to an end and any obligation
 which
was alternative to that obligation also came to an end.
<P>

19	It is clear that the accommodation obligation and the accounting obligation
in the third sentence do not create any equitable
interest in the Balmain
property, or any charge over it.  Even if they did, the condition in the second
sentence could not create
any interest in the Balmain property unless and until
the condition failed and was relied upon.  There is no practical possibility
that the covenant will be relied upon by the defendant, and there is no
practical possibility that any interest or charge can ever
come into
existence.
<P>

20	There is no evidence that the defendant ever provided the deceased with any
accommodation or showing whether or not he was willing
to do so.  The deceased
was never in need of such provision.  It is difficult to base any finding of
any relevant fact on the evidence
of Mrs Nadia Kavetsky-Krassoff, who was very
undisciplined in her thinking and expression and had difficulty adhering to any
line
of relevance, but her evidence was that the deceased lived with her in her
home at the time of the Deed of Release and continued
to do so.  No evidence
established that there was ever mutual agreement about the provision of
accommodation, or even any attempt
to reach mutual agreement.  
<P>

21	Both counsel put forward a view of the Deed of Release in which the
termination of the original trust is conditional upon the
terms of the Deed
being carried-out.  I do not think that this is a correct view of its
operation.  The terms in which the Deed is
expressed speak wholly as if it
operated forthwith, and the condition appears to me to have no impact unless
the condition fails,
and the defendant elects to rely on the condition.  That
is not practically possible.  I do not accept the view in which there must
be a
sale for the condition to be effective and for the Deed to have effect, or the
view that if there is no sale the earlier trust
continues and the deceased had
and his Administratrix as beneficiary now has the power to call for assignment
of the legal title
and bring the trust to an end. 
<P>

22	Ownership of the half interest has brought little realised advantage.  There
has never been any arrangement for sale with the
co-operation of the co-tenant
or the Protective Commissioner, and the defendant has never had actual control
of the premises, or
an opportunity to receive income from it.  There has been
an advantage of a different kind in that with the passage of years the
value of
the property, although it has been neglected, has greatly increased. An Estate
Manager in the office of the Protective Commissioner
gave evidence which showed
that in managing Mrs Zoe Krassoff's affairs the Protective Commissioner has,
since 1990, paid out $23,368.27
as expenses of the property, and has received
no contribution from the defendant.  The property has been unoccupied since
about 1992.
The defendant in his evidence associates the transfer of the
beneficial interest in the property to him in December 1981 with payments
made
to the deceased which by that time, he says had reached $34,000; this
association is not made by the terms of the second Deed.
<P>

23	Many payments were made by the defendant to the plaintiff; the amounts and
times of the payments cannot be exactly established.
 The defendant also
incurred relatively small sums for legal expenses or stamp duty; these were
greatly outweighed by other sums
which he paid to the deceased.  I accept the
evidence of the defendant, and other corroborating evidence which he called,
which shows
that various of these payments were made.  The amounts were large
and in my finding they were not in any way payments of consideration
for
acquisition of the property, or a recognition that the deceased had any
interest in the property.  With the small exceptions
I have mentioned the
defendant attributed the character of being gifts from son to father to these
payments with a view to assisting
his father in his old age, when he had very
little means.  I see nothing improbable in this evidence, which I accept, as it
seems
quite an ordinary incident of a relationship in which the father
conferred benefits on the son, the father was aged and had very
few resources
and the son had, in relation to the circumstances of the family generally,
relatively high earnings as an airline pilot.
 
<P>

24	There were no systematic records of these payments, and in the parties'
circumstances there is no reason to expect that records
should have been
maintained.  The defendant gave evidence of having lost a number of records
through their being spoilt by damp while
in storage.  I accept this
explanation, but quite apart from the explanation it is in no way surprising
that banking records or any
other records from years in the distant past which
might record or indirectly reflect large payments cannot now be produced.  
<P>

25	The defendant paid the deceased $3,000 on one occasion before the transfer,
a sum of $3,000 and a sum of $11,000 at about the
time of the transfer, and
significant payments later, including a payment for $20,000 which the defendant
recorded by making a jotting
in his air navigation log book, and another
payment of $22,000 which the defendant directed Mr Brix-Nielsen, who owed the
defendant
some money, to pay to the deceased.  There was a number of other
payments, not all of them of such significant sums.  They were gifts
in a
family situation and they were not business transactions or loans.  In the
deceased's circumstances in life there could have
been no expectation that he
would ever be able to pay back significant sums of money.
<P>

26	I do not accept contentions of the plaintiff's counsel that in the
circumstances there is a constructive trust of the property.
 I see nothing in
the circumstances which would demonstrate that the defendant's reliance on his
rights is unconscionable, and no
such case was pleaded.  I do not accept
defendant's counsel's contentions that provisions of Clause 2 of the Deed of
Release which
might benefit the deceased are precatory only and not intended to
create legal obligations.  Nor do I accept the contention that
the condition
constitutes a void restraint on alienation, as it does not restrain alienation,
and it has no operation except at the
election of the defendant.
<P>

27	The plaintiff tendered evidence of conversations between the deceased and
the defendant which were said to have taken place about
1990.  Their
significance was said to be that they show that the deceased then acted as if
he believed that he retained an interest
in the property, and that the
defendant continued to deal with the deceased in respect of the property by
seeking his advice and
wishes; it was contended that this shows recognition
that the deceased continued to have an equitable interest in the property. 

<P>

28	The plaintiff said in evidence to the effect that in about 1990, on an
occasion when the deceased and the defendant met for lunch
at the Russian Club
in Brisbane and then proceeded to her home at Upper Mount Gravatt, the deceased
said to the effect: "<i>I want all my papers and property back"</i> and the
defendant replied: <i>"you'll get them back when you pay me what you owe me."
</i>She said too that on that or it may be another occasion or occasions the
defendant told the deceased words to this effect: <i>"Okay I will give the
papers to Ray and he can give them to you."  </i>She said that the defendant
also spoke to her about the position of the Balmain property in terms which
were inconclusive and included
his saying: <i>"He can have it back any time he
wants it back as long as he comes up with the money"</i>; the amount required
was not stated.  She also said that he claimed that the property had cost him
significant money.  Her husband,
Mr Raymond Deen gave evidence corroborating
some of these conversations.  
<P>

29	The plaintiff's evidence about the conversation at her house at Mt Gravatt
about 1990 was to the following effects.  In her presence
the deceased said to
the defendant: (T8 L55)  <i>"I want my papers back" </i>and the defendant said:
<i>"You can have them but they cost me money.  You are going to be paying for
them."  </i>The deceased said that he wanted the deeds and everything returned,
that he wanted the deeds and the papers which the defendant was
holding back;
he wanted them all back.   They were talking about the deeds to his house.  The
defendant said that $12,000 was what
it was going to cost the deceased to get
them back.  (In chief, transcript 8,9 &amp; 10).  In evidence she also said:
<P>

	<i>"He just wanted everything that he had given David to do with the property
back and in his name and in his control".  (Transcript
12XX).  "....my father
didn't, you know, have excellent English; he could easily have called deeds
papers. He wanted all his  - 
anything he had given David he wanted it back,
that's what it amounted to".  </i>(T.14XX).<i> </i>
<P>

<i>	"...he wanted anything to do with his property, his house, returned back to
him that he had given David and he wanted full control."</i>  (She could not be
sure that he did not mention the word "<i>property".  </i> (T.14XX).
<P>

30	Mr Raymond Deen's evidence (T.23 in chief) was to the effect that on an
occasion which may well be the same occasion the deceased
said to the
defendant:
<P>

	<i>"I want my deeds back and my Power of Attorney back."</i>
<P>

	The defendant  said that he would not give them to him:  he said:
<P>

	<i>"They have cost me too much money and if you come up with the money, you
give me back the money, you can have the deeds."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Mr Deen did not recall any specific amount of money mentioned at that
time.  
<P>

In another conversation at a later date the amount of $12,000 was
mentioned.(See T.24X L.8).  The defendant said:
<P>

	<i>"If you give me back my $12,000 I will give you the papers."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>On another day, after the lunch at the Russian Club, and after a heated
argument when Mr and Mrs Deen intervened, the defendant said:
<P>

	<i>"I can give the papers to Ray and he can give them back to you."
(T.24).</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The deceased used the word <i>"papers"</i> and also used the word
"<i>deeds"</i> when saying what he wanted back.  (See T.25XX).  
<P>

31	The defendant denied the evidence of the supposed conversations of about
1990 and the parties are at issue, substantially on
the relative credit of the
witnesses who spoke of the matter.
<P>

32	In my finding there may well have been continuing discussions about the
Balmain property, which was a standing disappointment
for its being
unproductive and being neutralised by Zoe Krassoff's interest in it, and for a
long time it was occupied without producing
income by Zoe Krassoff's mother and
no income was produced from it.  
<P>

33	I am unable to make any conclusive finding on the evidence of the
conversations.  At the outset it should be said that assertions
by the
deceased, if he made any, to the effect that he had an interest in the property
would have no real weight or standing as evidence
that he did have such an
interest.  Further the statements attributed to him in evidence, even if they
were to be accepted, are not
rightly to be understood as assertions that he
owned the property or had some interest in it.  Even as put forward in her
affidavit-in-chief
by the plaintiff the assertions were made in terms quite
consistent with its being the deceased's wish to have the property returned
to
him, not to have recognition of some interest which he already had.  On that
reading the statements would confirm that the deceased
did not have an
interest.  As the plaintiff dealt further with the matter and was
cross-examined about the conversations, they lost
any elements of clarity that
otherwise might have been attributed to them, and my view overall is that the
evidence of the plaintiff
of conversations around 1990 supports no more than a
finding that the deceased made claims, not at all in precise terms, that he
should be given back control of the Balmain property.  I do not see this
circumstance as capable of assisting the plaintiff's claim.
<P>

34	I do not regard the plaintiff's evidence as reliable on any matter of
detail.  Her manner appeared to me to show signs of interest
and feeling.
Indeed the defendant's demeanour also revealed some such signs, but less
markedly so, and I have relatively greater
confidence in his evidence.  The
conversations in 1990, whatever exactly was said, were consistent with a
request for a new transaction
in which the equitable ownership was conveyed
back to the deceased.  In view of the terms of the second Deed the evidence is
not
on the whole consistent with there then being an existing trust interest.

<P>

35	Attempts to locate documents and recollect events from the distant past had
very little success and I could not feel high confidence
in evidence given of
conversations and negotiations of many years ago, in some cases of well over
twenty years ago.  The case gives
further support, if any were needed, to the
obvious wisdom of legislation requiring writing for effective dealings in real
property.
<P>

	
<P>

36	The orders are:
<P>

1.	On the plaintiff's claim I give judgment for the defendant with costs.
<P>

2.	On the cross-claim I give judgment for the cross-defendant.
<P>

3.	I order that each party pay his or her own costs of the cross-claim.
