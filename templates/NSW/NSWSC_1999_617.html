<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107(2)</a>
of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act</a></i></b> <b><i>1987 </i></b>(the Act)
from a decision of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 16
December 1998.
<P>

2   	By that decision the Tribunal made an order for the
termination and possession of premises at 8 Porter Avenue, Marrickville,
and
ordered the present plaintiff to pay to the second defendant, the Metropolitan
Local Aboriginal Land Council, $6,795.60 on account
of rent to that date,
payable by instalments of not less than $100 per week, the first payment on 30
December 1998 and a daily occupation
fee at the rate of $8.57 per day from 17
December 1998 until the date on which the possession should be given.
<P>

3   	The original summons was filed on 19 January this year and
on 2 March an order was made that execution of the order of the
Tribunal be
stayed, and that order has been extended from time to time.
<P>

4   	The defendant, on 23 March this year, filed a notice of
motion seeking summary judgment pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 13</a> r 5 and that is the
motion that is before me for hearing today. 
<P>

5   	There have been a number of adjournments in the past
because Miss Coe has not been able to arrange adequate legal representation,
and on a number of occasions my Associate has received messages that the
counsel then involved was not available on the particular
day.  Accordingly, on
1 June I indicated that the matter would proceed today irrespective of Miss
Coe's representation, and today
she has been represented by Miss Gillespie, who
has not previously been in the matter.
<P>

6   	Miss Gillespie sought an adjournment, but in view of the
length of time that the matter had been outstanding and as the reasons
of the
Tribunal were available and the only appeal is on a matter of law, I refused
the adjournment.
<P>

7   	No grounds of appeal are set out in the Summons, but two
affidavits have been filed by the plaintiff; one dated 12 March 1999
and the
other one dated today.  In her earlier affidavit the plaintiff said that she
was raising two legal issues as questions of
law:
<P>

"(1)	Whether a victim of government genocide is entitled to a maintained
dwelling for that victim and that victim's family from
that government for life
as immediate minimum compensation/reparation by the genocidist government for
acts of genocide ...
<P>

	...
<P>

 (2)	Whether a Local Aboriginal Land Council within the meaning of the NSW
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a> - or any other Land Council, including the NSW
State Aboriginal Land Council - has the legal jurisdiction to evict an
Aboriginal
Member of such a Council from her dwelling (including the
jurisdiction of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal to extinguish Aboriginal
people's rights to their country)."
<P>

8   	One might have thought that the issues sought to be raised
on the appeal were, therefore, rather clear.  However, Miss Gillespie
has
raised a number of other points as the matter has proceeded and, without
intending any disrespect to her, it appears to me that
those points have been
constantly changing during the course of the hearing.
<P>

9   	I deal first with the two points raised in the original
affidavit.  The plaintiff is an Aboriginal and Mr Murr SC who appears
for the
second defendant, is prepared, as he must be for the purposes of this
application, to concede in favour of the plaintiff,
the historical facts to
establish that genocide of the Aboriginal race can be made out and that the
plaintiff, as a victim of such
genocide, is entitled to compensation of some
kind against some entity.  
<P>

10   	However, even having regard to those concessions, there
can be no suggestion that any such alleged genocide has been the responsibility
of the present defendant, the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council, or
any predecessor of such Council for whom it is responsible
or any Aboriginal
authority whatsoever.  The genocide is referred to in the plaintiff's affidavit
as "government genocide"; such
alleged genocide has been committed by people
other than Aboriginals; namely, people of European descent or extraction, and
any remedy
for compensation or otherwise must be the responsibility either of
the Federal or the State Government or of some people of European
extraction or
background, or their descendants.
<P>

11   	It follows that the failure of the Tribunal to have regard
to such alleged genocide in the proceedings before it did not constitute
an
error of law.
<P>

12   	The second point raised in the plaintiff's affidavit is to
the effect that a Local Aboriginal Land Council has no power to
evict an
Aboriginal member of such a Council from her dwelling and, therefore, the
Tribunal has no power to terminate a residential
tenancy of an Aboriginal
person from a Local Aboriginal Land Council or to make an order for possession
in respect of the premises
the subject of such a tenancy agreement.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff has an immediate difficulty because she has
always claimed the right, and has taken proceedings in the Tribunal,
which have
been partly successful, to obtain a rent reduction or compensation from the
defendant on account of the defective state
and condition of the premises.  She
in fact recovered $4,530.85 in this regard.
<P>

14   	Furthermore, it is clear, in my opinion, that a Local
Aboriginal Land Council does have power to evict an Aboriginal member
of the
Council if such person is in breach of the terms of a residential tenancy
agreement, particularly if in breach of the obligation
to pay rent pursuant to
such agreement, which was the ground on which this plaintiff's tenancy
agreement was terminated and an order
for possession made.
<P>

15   	Section 40B(2)(a) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act
1983</a></i></b> expressly provides:
<P>

"A Local Aboriginal Land Council may, subject to the provisions of any other
Act and with the approval of the New South Wales Aboriginal
Land Council:
<P>

(a)	lease or change the use of land vested in it ...
<P>

...
<P>

but only if the lease, change of use or the grant or release of the easement
has been approved at a meeting of the Local Aboriginal
Land Council
specifically called for that purpose at which a quorum was present."
<P>

16   	In my view, the power to lease land vested in the Local
Aboriginal Land Council carries with it a right to terminate such
a lease if
there is a breach of any of the obligations under such lease, and this power is
reinforced by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 41</a> which provides that, subject to the Act, an Aboriginal Land
Council may do or suffer in relation to its property any act or thing
that it
could lawfully do or suffer if it were a natural person.  A natural person
having an estate in fee simple with a power to
lease has the power to terminate
such lease on the ground of non-payment of rent; so an Aboriginal Land Council
would have the same
right.
<P>

17   	This issue was fairly raised before the Tribunal and is
dealt with in the Tribunal's Reasons.  I can see no error of law in
the manner
in which the Tribunal has dealt with it.
<P>

18   	As I say, a number of other matters were raised by Miss
Gillespie on behalf of the plaintiff during the course of the hearing.
 She
drew my attention to s 12(1)(d) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights
Act</a></i></b>, which defines the functions of a Local Aboriginal Land Council as
including the implementation of the wishes of its members as decided
at a
meeting of the Council with respect to the acquisition, management, use,
control and disposal of land; and although she did
not refer to it, she might
also have included a reference to para (a); namely, in accordance with any
regulations to acquire, hold
or dispose of or otherwise deal with land vested
or acquired by the Council.  These provisions are in general terms setting out
the
functions of the Council.  They do not regulate the procedure which is
dealt with in ss 40B and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">41</a>, to which I have already referred.
<P>

19   	Her submission was that the Council was not empowered to
seek orders from the Tribunal for eviction of a Council member without
agreement at a properly constituted meeting of the Council, and she submitted
that the Tribunal made an error of law in not taking
this relevant
consideration into account because there was no resolution authorising the
taking of the proceedings at a Council meeting
duly called of which minutes had
been taken and she informed me that the plaintiff had been unable to obtain
evidence of the Council
minutes.
<P>

20   	In this regard she referred me to the further affidavit of
the plaintiff sworn today and, in particular, to para 11 of that
affidavit.
But that paragraph refers to repeated requests of copies of the minutes where
the resolutions to make the repairs to the
house were passed and a copy of a
report by the Department of Housing into the state of repairs of the premises
and Miss Coe swore
that she had not been given copies of those minutes; but
there was no suggestion that she had requested a copy of the minutes of
the
meeting which authorised the taking of the proceedings.  The submission was
then made that there was no evidence before the Tribunal
of a valid meeting of
the Council.
<P>

21   	At this stage there was tendered by consent a copy of the
minutes of the general meeting of the defendant, the Metropolitan
Local
Aboriginal Land Council, of 10 June 1998 and motion 7 expressly authorised the
taking of legal action against tenants who had
refused to sign the new
residential tenancy agreements and those who were in arrears, which latter
category at least, and probably
the former category also, would have included
the plaintiff.
<P>

22   	It was then submitted that the plaintiff had not
previously been furnished with a copy of these minutes and, therefore, had
not
been in a position to challenge them.
<P>

23   	When it was pointed out that there was no appeal except on
a question of law, it was submitted that the meeting was not a
duly constituted
meeting  because the plaintiff did not believe the procedures for calling the
meeting had been properly adhered
to and she had not received notice of the
meeting; and an application was made to call further evidence to prove that she
had not
received notice of the meeting.
<P>

24   	There were two difficulties that became apparent at this
stage.  One was that there was no evidence either way, and no one
was able to
inform me whether or not these minutes had been tendered before the Tribunal
and I cannot find a specific reference to
them in the Tribunal's Reasons.  The
other problem was that if I permitted the plaintiff to lead this evidence that
she had not received
notice of the meeting, it would be only fair to grant an
adjournment to enable the defendant to call evidence, if it were available,
of
the sending out of notices of the meeting and the numbers of persons who
attended and such-like, thereby delaying the further
conduct of the
proceedings.
<P>

25   	More importantly, this was not the time for the adducing
of fresh evidence and for considering fresh grounds of appeal.  The
grounds of
appeal had been set out earlier in the plaintiff's first affidavit.  Her
complaint about the minutes had been set out
in her affidavit and related to a
right to inspect the minutes in relation to the resolutions relating to
repairs; and now, at the
heel of the hunt as it were, a fresh point was being
raised which, as far as one could ascertain, had never been taken before the
Tribunal.
<P>

26   	Then I was informed that there were a number of other
witnesses, one in particular, Ms Weldon, who had been at the Tribunal
and was
available there to give evidence about the existence or non-existence or
conduct of this meeting of the defendant of 10 June
1998, but that the Tribunal
had refused to hear her evidence on this issue.  This was yet again a totally
new point which had never
been taken before.
<P>

27   	There has been no reference that I can find of Ms Weldon
being available or being proffered as a witness before the Tribunal
and if the
case to be sought was that there had been a denial of natural justice before
the Tribunal that should have been specified
long before now.
<P>

28   	I, therefore, refused the application to call Ms Weldon,
Ms June Coe or any further witnesses.
<P>

29   	As I say, there is no evidence before me as to whether or
not the minutes of the meeting of 10 June  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%20Exch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1998, Ex 1</a>, were tendered before the
Tribunal or not, so I cannot take them into account in the resolution of this
application.  
<P>

30   	However, it is clear that as an administrative body the
Tribunal is bound to satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction.  The
Tribunal, in
its Reasons, records the only issues that were raised before it in that regard,
at p 5.  It is noted as follows:
<P>

"Notwithstanding the fact that the tenant seeks an order from the Tribunal
reducing the rent payable, the tenant claims that the
Tribunal has no power to
make orders that an Aboriginal person pay a land council rent monies.  She also
contends that Local Aboriginal
Land Councils have no power to enter into
residential tenancy agreements."
<P>

This submission was discussed and at p 8 the Tribunal went on:
<P>

"The tenant says: 'I am a member of Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council.
All business goes before the members to approve,
amend and ratify.  I don't
believe that any eviction procedures have come up at any Local Metropolitan
Land Council meetings.  If
it has then I would like to see who moved seconded
and when.  I would like to see it tabled'.
<P>

The tenant did not tender any further documentation on the issue."
<P>

31   	The Tribunal then dealt with the case for the landlord
and, after dealing with various other submissions, said at p 11:
<P>

"The documentation supplied at the hearing indicated that the termination
notice was valid in all respects <i>and signed by the person duly authorised to
do so.</i>  Mr Geoff Bradford who represented the landlord was duly authorised
in writing to do so.
<P>

The Tribunal is satisfied that it has the necessary jurisdiction to hear and
determine both applications before it."
<P>

32   	The Tribunal then considered the merits of the two
applications before it and made the orders which were made.
<P>

33   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 63</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">64</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights
Act</a></i></b> deal with the authentication of documents and the fact that proof
of certain matters including resolutions of an Aboriginal Land
Council are not
required until evidence is given to the contrary.
<P>

34   	I am satisfied that the Tribunal was conscious of the need
to be satisfied that it had jurisdiction to embark on the hearing
of the
matter, and that it considered whatever evidence there was tendered before it
on that issue, and made the findings which it
did.  Those findings as to the
actual conferring of authority were findings of fact and are not subject to
review by this Court on
appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 107(2).</a>
<P>

35   	There is no evidence that the defendant was denied natural
justice and I am, therefore, satisfied that the defendant should
have summary
judgment as sought pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 13</a> r 5.
<P>

36   	The order will therefore be summons dismissed.
<P>

(COUNSEL ADDRESSED ON COSTS)
<P>

37   	I order the plaintiff to pay the second defendant's costs
of the motion and of the proceedings to date.
<P>

38   	(Miss Gillespie sought a stay of execution.  Discussion
ensued.)
<P>

I grant a stay of execution of the order for possession to 31 July 1999 on
terms that the plaintiff pay an occupation fee of $30
per week so long as she
remains in possession, the first payment on Wednesday 23 June 1999.
<P>

39   	I grant liberty to the second defendant to apply on two
days notice to lift the stay of execution if any instalment of the
occupation
fee remains unpaid seven days after the due date.
