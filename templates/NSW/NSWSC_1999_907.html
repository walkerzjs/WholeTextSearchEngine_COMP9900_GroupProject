CONVEYANCING - LAND TITLES UNDER THE TORRENS SYSTEM. MORTAGES.  TRUSTS AND
TRUSTEES. Trustees purport to appoint company, of which
they are sole
directors, trustee of a family trust.  The appointment is ineffectual, because
not registered.  The purported trustee
mortgages trust property to Bank (which
has notice of the trust), the mortgages are registered, and the Bank advances
money to the
purported trustee.  On default, the Bank seeks possession of the
mortgaged property.  On behalf of the trust, it is contended that
the Bank's
title is subject to the trust.   HELD that (assuming the participation of the
true trustees in the grant of the mortgages
did not bind the trust) the Bank's
title to the mortgages was indefeasible; that the advances of money to the
purported trustee effected
pro tanto purchases of charges over the property,
which were not indefeasible; that (assuming the participation of the true
trustees
in the reciept of the advances by the purported trustee did not bind
the trust) the Bank could rely on the legal title unless and
until it was shown
that the advances were applied otherwise than in accorance with determinations
of the true trustees and that there
was loss of the beneficiaries; that Section
66B of the Conveyancing Act (assuming it applied otherwise than to sales
properly so
called) did not give a cause of action without proof of loss and
causation of loss

<b><u>COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA  V.  NICK FRISINA PTY. LIMITED &amp;
ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	In these proceedings, the plaintiff Bank claims relief against
the first defendant (which I will call "the Company") pursuant
to mortgages
executed by it in favour of the Bank, and against the second to sixth
defendants pursuant to guarantees which they executed.
 The relief sought
against the Company is judgment for a sum of money, and judgment for possession
of the land the subject of the
mortgages.
<P>

2  	On 13th August 1999, Rolfe, J. ordered that the proceedings as
between the plaintiff and the Company be separately determined,
pursuant to
Pt.31 of the Rules.  I embarked on that separate hearing on 26th August 1999.
Mr. Raphael, appearing for the Company,
and also for the second and third
defendants, Mr. and Mrs. Frisina, applied to have Mr. and Mrs. Frisina joined,
in this separate
determination, as trustees of the Frisina Family Trust.  I
indicated that, if I was to accede to that application, I may require
that Mr.
Raphael also represent some beneficiaries of the Trust and have them also
joined.  
<P>

3  	Mr. Forster SC for the Bank did not oppose the application, so
long as no additional evidence was to be led.  The matter proceeded
on the
basis that I would consider evidence and submissions on behalf of the Trust, to
the effect that the Trust or beneficiaries
had a claim which they could assert
against the Bank, arising out of the circumstances of the giving of the
mortgages and the making
of advances under them, and that I would make
appropriate orders in due course. 
<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

4  	On 18th December 1987, Mr. and Mrs. Frisina became trustees of
the Frisina Family Trust, a trust of which they and various members
of their
family were beneficiaries.  It was not a true discretionary trust; although,
because the class of beneficiaries was not
closed, there were no persons who
could join to put an end to the Trust.
<P>

5  	On 5th April 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Frisina executed an instrument
whereby they were purportedly removed as trustees, and they appointed
the
Company as trustee.  This instrument was not registered pursuant to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.  
<P>

6  	On 25th June 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Frisina transferred what has been
called the Fenwick Street property to the Company, subject
to an existing
mortgage to the Commercial Bank of Australia.  On 7th February 1989, Mr and
Mrs. Frisina transferred what has been
called the Wilkins Street property to
the Company.  It is common ground that both these properties became subject to
and part of
the Frisina Family Trust.
<P>

7  	On 23rd March 1989, the Company mortgaged the Wilkins Street
property to the ANZ Bank; and on 21st September 1990, the Company
mortgaged the
Fenwick Street property to the ANZ Bank, subject to the existing Commercial
Bank of Australia mortgage.  
<P>

8  	On 5th December 1992, the Company executed mortgages over both
properties in favour of the Bank.  There is evidence that a copy
of the trust
deed of the Frisina Family Trust was provided to the Bank before this time.
Discharges of the ANZ mortgages, dated 9th
July 1992, were also provided to the
Bank, along with the mortgages themselves, and these discharges were registered
on 17th February
1993 and 14th March 1993.  
<P>

9  	A letter from the Bank dated 30th March 1994, approving an
increase of the Company's overdraft from $100,000.00 to $200,000.00,
required
production of the trust instrument of the Frisina Family Trust.  On 6th July
1994, a deed between the Bank and the Company
referred to the instrument of 5th
April 1988.  
<P>

10  	The Bank made advances to the Company on the security of the
mortgages; and those advances including interest now total about
$1 million.
There has been default by the Company in relation to such advances.  Notices
under s.57 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> have been given to the Company.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

11  	No substantial opposition has been raised to the giving of a
judgment against the Company for the amount of the advances plus
interest.  The
following contentions have been made by Mr. Raphael, especially on behalf of
the Frisina Family Trust.  
<P>

12  	First, it was contended that the purported appointment of the
new trustee was ineffectual, because it was not registered, registration
being
required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a>.  This point is in fact conceded by the
Bank.  
<P>

13  	Second, it was contended that accordingly the Company never
validly became the trustee of the Frisina Family Trust, but rather
held the
properties as a trustee de son tort, having obligations as a trustee but none
of the powers of a trustee.  Mr. and Mrs.
Frisina remained the true trustees of
the Trust.  This point was also conceded by the Bank.  
<P>

14  	Third, it was contended that the Bank was on notice that the
properties were subject to the Trust, and that the Company did
not have power
to sell or mortgage or transfer them on behalf of the Trust.  The Bank's
mortgage was therefore subject to the rights
of the Trust and the beneficiaries
of the Trust.  This point was the subject of contest.
<P>

15  	Fourth, it was contended that advances under the mortgages were
not made to two trustees as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66B</a> provides as follows:
<P>

<b><i>66B.(1)   A purchaser of property from trustees for sale or having power
of sale shall not be concerned with the trusts affecting
the proceeds of sale
of the property (whether made to attach to such proceeds by virtue of this Act
or otherwise), or affecting the
income of the property until sale, whether or
not those trusts are declared by the same instrument by which the trust for
sale or
power of sale is created. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the instrument (if any)
creating a trust for sale or power of sale of property or
in the settlement of
the net proceeds, the proceeds of sale or other capital money shall not be paid
to or applied by the direction
of fewer than two persons as trustees, except
where the trustee is a trust corporation, or the trustee was appointed as a
sole trustee
by the instrument creating the trust or power, but this subsection
does not affect the right of a sole personal representative as
such to give
valid receipts for, or direct the application of, the proceeds of sale or other
capital money; nor, except where capital
money arises on the transaction,
render it necessary to have more than one trustee. set out</i></b>
<P>

That issue was also a matter of contest.
<P>

16  	Prior to Mr. Raphael's application to join Mr. and Mrs. Frisina
on behalf of the Frisina Family Trust, the Bank had raised
an issue of
standing:  the contention was that the Company was in effect relying on a jus
tertii to resist the Bank's claim for possession.
 Having regard to the
application which has been made, it is not possible now to decide the matter in
favour of the Bank on that
basis alone.  
<P>

<b><u>SUBMISSIONS</u></b>
<P>

17  	I have been provided with substantial written submissions, which
I will leave with the papers.  
<P>

18  	Mr. Forster submitted that no breach of trust had been
committed, because the mortgage to the Bank had been effected through
the
agency of Mr. and Mrs. Frisina, who were the true trustees of the Trust:  they
were the only directors of the Company, and they
executed the relevant
documents on behalf of the Company.  It did not matter that they were not
expressly acting as trustees:  see
<u>Re J.W. Broomhead Pty. Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/88.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 88</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%209%20ACLR%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985)

466.</a>  
<P>

19  	Mr. Forster next submitted that, even if the grant of the
mortgage was a breach of trust, nevertheless, upon registration,
the Bank
acquired an indefeasible title; and that title supported the personal covenant
to pay:  see <u>P.T. Limited v. Maradona Pty. Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2025%20NSWLR%20643" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 25 NSWLR 643</a>
at 676-682.  Such notice as the Bank had of the breach of trust fell far short
of what was necessary to give rise to a personal equity
binding the Bank, or to
amount to fraud within s.43 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>:  see <u>Equiticorp
Finance Limited v. Bank of New Zealand</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 50</a> at 103; <u>Consul

Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20132%20CLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 132 CLR 373.</a>

<P>

20  	Next, Mr. Forster submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>
had no application, because the Company was appointed a sole trustee by the
transfers of the properties by Mr. and Mrs. Frisina.
 In any event, there was
no evidence that money advanced had actually been misapplied, and no evidence
of loss by the beneficiaries.
 The money having been advanced to the Company
was in any event under the control of Mr. and Mrs. Frisina who were the true
trustees
of the Trust.  
<P>

21  	Mr. Raphael for the Company and Mr. and Mrs. Frisina submitted
that the participation of Mr. and Mrs. Frisina in the grant
of the mortgages
was only as directors of the Company:  they did not either intend or purport to
act as trustees of the Trust.  The
mortgages were the acts of the Company, not
of Mr. and Mrs. Frisina, and were therefore breaches of trust.  
<P>

22  	Next, Mr. Raphael submitted that the indefeasibility of the
estate of the mortgagee did not extend to the covenant to pay money;
and he
referred me to <u>Travinto Nominees Pty. Limited v. Vlattas</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR
1.</a>  He also referred to <u>Quarrell v. Beckford</u> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1816/319.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1816] EngR 319</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281816%29%2056%20ER%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1816) 56 ER 100</a> at 103,
where a sharp distinction is drawn between the personal covenant under a
mortgage and the estate which is security for the
performance of that covenant.
Registration would protect the estate but not the personal covenant.  Mr.
Raphael also submitted that
a similar sharp distinction was drawn by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s102.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.102</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.
<P>

23  	Mr. Raphael next submitted that an enquiry or search as to
registration of the appointment of the new trustees was one which
ought
reasonably have been made, within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s164.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.164</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.  He referred
to <u>Bailey v. Barnes</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281894%29%201%20Ch%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1894) 1 Ch. 25.</a>  He submitted also that it was
notorious that there should be two trustees where new trustees were appointed.
The Bank therefore
had ample notice that there had been a breach of trust.
This was confirmed by the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.
<P>

24  	Finally, Mr. Raphael submitted that there was no onus on the
beneficiaries to prove loss, in circumstances where <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> had not been complied
with:  <u>Lee v. Sankey</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281875%29%20LR%2015%20Eq%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1875) LR 15 Eq. 204</a> at 211; <u>Re Flower</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%2027%20ChD%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 27 Ch.D. 592</a> at 596.  
<P>

<b><u>DECISION</u></b>
<P>

25  	On the view that I take in respect of later issues, particularly
the lack of evidence of loss, it is not necessary for me to
come to a firm
decision as to whether the participation of Mr. and Mrs. Frisina in the grant
of the mortgages by the Company is sufficient
to prevent there being a breach
of trust.  On the material before me, it appears that they did not purport or
intend to participate
in those transactions as trustees on behalf of the Trust;
but on the other hand, they did intend that the Trust, through the agency
of
the Company, do so.  It seems to me possible that the approach taken in
<u>Broomhead</u> and <u>Express Engineering Works</u> would support the view
that, in those circumstances, no breach of trust was involved.  However,
particularly where it is just possible
that the question may have to be
considered further on the basis of more satisfactory evidence, I would prefer
not to make that finding,
but rather to proceed on the assumption that there
was a breach of trust.  
<P>

26  	On that assumption, the Bank in my opinion nevertheless obtained
an indefeasible title.  Each mortgage contained a covenant
by the mortgagor to
pay the "Secured Moneys", and "Secured Moneys" was defined to include, among
other things, all moneys, including
moneys advanced by way of fixed term or
provided by way of overdraft, to become owing by the mortgagor.  In my opinion,
the Bank's
indefeasible title extended to its rights under that covenant, as
secured by the mortgage, as indeed was held by Giles, J. in <u>PT</u>.  In my
opinion, such notice as the Bank had of any breach of trust fell well short of
what would have been required to give rise
to a personal equity or to amount to
fraud.  I do not think the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> have any
relevance to this position.  However, the Bank has to go outside its
indefeasible title to quantify the amount in respect
of which it has a
charge.
<P>

27  	If the Bank's registered mortgage had itself specified the
amount of the debt secured by it, then in my opinion indefeasibility
would go
to the extent of the Bank having security for a debt in that amount.  But in
fact, no amount was specified in the mortgage.
 The Bank has by evidence proved
advances to the Company, so at least as against the Company it has a debt, in
the amount of the
advances plus interest, secured by the mortgage.  That right
is indefeasible, except in so far as the quantum of the debt depends
upon the
advances having been made to the Company.  
<P>

28  	These advances can be regarded as effecting pro tanto purchases
of property, the property in question being a commensurate
charge over the
land.  In relation to those purchases, it is not suggested that the Bank did
not act bona fide.  However, it is submitted
that the Bank had notice of the
interests of the beneficiaries of the Trust, so that the Bank's legal title
does not prevail over
the beneficiaries' equitable title to the land unaffected
by the Bank's charge.  
<P>

29  	However, the advances were made to an entity which had
purportedly been appointed trustee of the Trust by previous trustees;
and those
previous trustees remained the true trustees of the Trust and were also the
sole directors of the purported trustee.  The
advances were thus made to a
purported trustee which was in turn under the absolute control of the true
trustees.  There is in fact
no evidence that the Company's receipt of money and
the correlative expansion of the Bank's charge was other than the act of both
the Company and of the true trustees.  In relation to informal transactions of
this kind, the Court would, in my opinion, be less
ready to look minutely at
the capacity in which Mr. and Mrs. Frisina acted than in the case of the formal
grant of a mortgage, considered
earlier; so that the approach in
<u>Broomhead</u> and <u>Express Engineering Works</u> would more readily be
adopted.  And there is no evidence that these advances were applied otherwise
than in accordance with determinations
of the true trustees, or, even if they
were, that there was any loss to the beneficiaries.
<P>

30  	In those circumstances, in my opinion, the mere notice that the
Bank may be considered as having, that the appointment of the
new trustee was
ineffectual, is insufficient to defeat the Bank's legal title.  There would, in
my opinion, need to be positive evidence
supporting an equitable interest of
which the Bank had notice; that is, evidence of an actual breach of trust in
the receipt of advances
and the correlative expansion of the charge, of
application of the advances otherwise than in accordance with the determination
of
the true trustees, and of consequential loss to beneficiaries.  
<P>

31  	Furthermore, in the circumstances of this case, it seems
probable that some of the money was applied to discharge prior mortgages,
and
it is extremely unlikely that the rights of beneficiaries could impinge upon
the Bank's charge to that extent.  
<P>

32  	As regards <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, the first question is
whether it applies at all.  Mr. Forster submitted that the Company was
appointed as a sole trustee by the
instrument creating the trust or power,
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B(2).</a>  I reject that submission.  The Company was not
appointed trustee at all, but rather became a trustee de son tort by assuming
control
of the trust property following a purported appointment which was
ineffectual.  The actual transfers of the subject properties to
the Company
cannot be regarded either as appointments of the Company as a trustee, or as
instruments creating a trust for sale or
power of sale.  
<P>

33  	However, there are other indications in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> which raise a
question as to whether it applies in circumstances such as these.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66B</a>
appears in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> Division 5 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, which is headed
"Dispositions On Trust For Sale, Or With Power Of Sale".  The opening words of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B(2)</a>, referring to "the instrument (if any) creating a trust for sale or
power of sale of property" and to "the settlement of the net
proceeds" also
suggest that the section is directed to cases of sale; and "sale" is defined in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the Act to mean "only a sale properly so called".  On the other hand,
the reference in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B(2)</a> to "other capital money" seems wide enough to include
advances under a mortgage.  
<P>

34  	In those circumstances, without fuller argument and evidence as
to exactly what happened, I would be reluctant to decide on
the application of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> to this case, unless it were necessary to do so.  I am prepared to
proceed on the assumption that it does apply.  
<P>

35  	In this case, the payment was made to a single trustee, not
being a validly appointed trustee but rather being a trustee de
son tort.  It
seems to me that the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> is that the Bank did not get a good
discharge in respect of those advances; but that in the circumstances of this
case, that would
only mean that the Bank did not have a defence based on such a
discharge, if the beneficiaries had some identifiable cause of action.
 
<P>

36  	A further effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66B</a> may be that, if loss to the
beneficiaries is caused by the payment of money to one trustee, then, without
any further requirement,
the beneficiary has a cause of action for the loss of
that money.  Again, I would be reluctant to decide this definitively without
further submissions and consideration; but again I am prepared to proceed on
the assumption that this is so.  However, a cause of
action of that kind would
require not only proof of loss, which is absent here; but it would also require
proof of causation.  In
the present case, where the one trustee to which the
money was paid was a purported trustee controlled by the two true trustees,
proof of causation of loss may be problematic.  
<P>

37  	In my opinion, the consequence of all these reasons is that, on
the material before me, there is no basis for cutting down
the Bank's statutory
charge over the land securing the amount of advances to the Company, and
therefore nothing to defeat the Bank's
right to possession.
<P>

38  	The remaining question is whether I should make an order joining
Mr. and Mrs. Frisina, in their capacity as trustees of the
Trust, in this
determination.  This order was sought on their behalf, and not opposed.  There
has in fact been no appearance by any
of the beneficiaries.  The effect of
making the order joining Mr. and Mrs. Frisina in their capacity as trustees
could be that the
Trust, and the beneficiaries of the Trust, are bound by my
determination.  However, any such order would be an order made in the
absence
of the beneficiaries, so that the beneficiaries could apply to set it aside.
<P>

39  	On the whole, I think it is appropriate to make the order
sought, and not opposed.  
<P>

40  	For those reasons, I propose to give judgment against the
Company for the amount owing, just over $1 million; to order that
Mr. and Mrs.
Frisina, on behalf of the Frisina Family Trust, be joined in the determination
of issues as between the Bank and the
Company; to give judgment for possession
against the Company; and to order that the Company and Mr. and Mrs. Frisina pay
the Bank's
costs of this determination.  
<P>

41  	There may be a question as to the precise amount owing; and also
as to whether I should authorise the issue of a warrant for
possession, and if
so, at what time.  I will issue this judgment to the parties and have them
arrange with my Associate an early
appointment for the determination of the
precise orders.  I direct the Bank to provide Short Minutes on that
occasion.
<P>
