JUDGMENT: 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Outline of Action</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff is the elected member for the seat of Wollongong in the
Legislative Assembly of the Parliament of New South Wales.
 He is a member of
the Australian Labor Party.  He has not been selected by that Party as its
member to contest the next State election.
 He claims that the pre-selection
processes were not conducted in accordance with the appropriate rules of the
Australian Labor Party
so that the ballot under which the candidate was chosen
is void.
<P>

<b>Grounds for Challenge</b>
<P>

2	The plaintiff founds his action on two grounds.  The first is that the ballot
for selection of candidates was not a rank and file
ballot of all members of
branches in the appropriate district, but rather one conducted in accordance
with Rule N.40 of the Rules
and that the pre-conditions for an N.40 ballot had
not been met.  The second ground is that challenges to the numbers of delegates
from certain branches for the reformation meeting of the Wollongong State
Electoral Council were not determined by the Credentials
Committee of the Party
prior to the ballot taking place as required by Rule A37(c).  It is necessary
to add that the defendant did
not contend the action is not justiciable in this
Court, nor did the defendant base any argument on the fact that the challengers
are not plaintiffs.  Notwithstanding this it is desirable to set out Rule C.1
which is as follows:
<P>

		<b>Legal Status of Rules</b>
<P>

C.1	It is intended that these Rules and everything  done in connection with
them, all arrangements relating to them (whether in
these Rules or implied by
them) and any agreement or business entered into, or payment made by or under
the Rules, will not bring
about any legal relationship, rights, duties or
outcome of any kind, or be enforceable by law, or be the subject of legal
proceedings.
 Instead all arrangements, agreements and business are only
binding in honour.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

3	The ordinary method of selection of candidates for the Legislative Assembly
is by ballot of branch members living in the relevant
electorate who fulfil
certain conditions including the requirement of appearing on the most recent
Commonwealth or State Electoral
Roll for the electorate - rule N17.  Rule N40
is as follows:
<P>

<b>Suspension of Selection Ballots</b>
<P>

N.40	The Administrative Committee can, in consultation with the Parliamentary
Leadership and the local Electorate Council, decide
to hold a ballot under the
provisions of this rule;
<P>

(a)	in the case of the State By-election unless determined otherwise by the
Joint Campaign Committee or,
<P>

(b)	in case of any other by-elections; or
<P>

(c)	if an endorsed candidate needs to be selected while the Party is on a
campaign footing, as determined by the Administrative
Committee; or
<P>

(d)	in other urgent situations, as recommended by the Party Officers and with
the leave of the Administrative Committee.
<P>

	
<P>

	If this happens the candidate will be selected by a Committee made up of equal
numbers from the Administrative Committee, and where
practicable, the Local
Electorate Council.  The Committee's candidate will become the endorsed Labor
candidate.
<P>

	
<P>

4	On 20 November 1998, the Administrative Committee of the New South Wales
branch of the Australian Labor Party called for nominations
for pre-selection
for the seat of Wollongong.  Nominations closed on 2 December.  Mr. Sullivan
duly nominated.  On the same day,
namely 20 November, the Administrative
Committee made the decision to hold a ballot for the seat of Wollongong as
provided by Rule
N.40.  The numbers on the local electoral council became of
importance.
<P>

5	The pre-selection process was to take place on 4 and 5 December.  On 20
November 1998 there was not in existence a State Electorate
Council in the
Electorate of Wollongong.  Where an Electorate Council does exist its
membership comprises delegates from branches,
the numbers of delegates from
each branch being determined in accordance with Rule G.1 by the number of
members in the particular
branch.  The reason why there was no local Electorate
Council for Wollongong was that problems relating to member qualifications,
which arose in 1996, had not been determined.  There was to have been a further
meeting on 20 November 1998, but prior to that date
it was adjourned so that
the challenges to membership of certain branches could be determined by the
Credentials Committee.  Those
challenges - or two of them - were made by
letters dated 20 November 1998, in identical terms (other than in respect of
payment of
fees) by Mr. Warwick MacMillan and Mr. Wilf Billington.  The
challenges related to delegates nominated to the Wollongong Electorate
Council
from Berkeley Branch, Mount Keira Branch and Warrawong Branch.  It is
convenient to set out the terms of one of the challenges
in full.

HAYMARKET NSW 2000
<P>

Dear John
<P>

I hereby wish to challenge the elections to be held at the Reformation Meeting
of Wollongong SEC on 20 November 1998 in the A.W.U.
Offices (Ironworkers
Building), 325 Crown Street, Wollongong, commencing at 7.30 pm.  Specifically I
wish to appeal under Section
A37(a) of the Party Rules against the list of
voting delegates from the following Branches and against the nomination of
candidates
from those Branches for the following reasons.
<P>

<b>Berkeley Branch</b> - Delegates T Flynn, D. Staggs, T Jones, T Foye, B
Hogan, K Hingle, S. Deeley, J. Parker, L Jones, and alternative delegates M
Benn,
L Benn, J Morante, R Pickham, L Watts, D Baldacchino, J Holmes, E James,
G Crofts are hereby challenged under G1(a).  I believe the
Branch has elected
too many delegates.
<P>

<b>Mt. Keira Branch</b> - Delegates G Harrison, D Brown, S Denton, J Stanley, A
Harrison, G Hurley, M Tillbrook, J McKay, P Georghallis, J Harrison, I Poo
and
alternate delegates, V Harrison, N. Manias, D. Bosma, J. Yiannaki, P Myajevic,
M Croaker, J Thom, G Gogich, L Thom, R Clarke,
P Felvus.
<P>

<b>Warrawong Branch</b> - Delegates K Jonovski, Z. Todoroski, Z. Esen, A Sawan,
and alternate delegates G Jonovski, C Erginli, C Ozturk, A Siriovski, are
hereby challenged under G1(a).  I believe they have too many delegates.
<P>

Specifically I wish to challenge under Rule I b(a) Mt Keira S Denton, J
Stanley, G Hurley and alternate delegates N Manias, D Bosma,
R Clarke, who do
not appear on the electoral roll.
<P>

Also, mail has been returned marked "not at this address" for delegates M
Tillbrook, I Poo and the alternate delegates M Croaker
and P Felvus.
<P>

Family members have also verified that L Thom does not reside at his stated
address.
<P>

As a consequence of the above I challenge the abovenamed peoples' ability to be
included on the list of eligible voters for his/her
Branch.
<P>

I challenge the ability of Mt Keira delegate G Hurley and Berkeley alternate
delegate Eva James (who do not appear on any current
financial or unfinancial
branch list within Wollongong Electorate) to be included on the list of
eligible voters for his/her Branch.
<P>

I request that the above delegates' credentials be investigated (and any
alternates representing them) and no counting of votes
for positions be
conducted until the bona fides of Branches and delegates be established by the
appropriate authority.
<P>

I request Branch Returns to Wollongong S.E.C. of those Branches listed above,
be seized or copies to be held by the appropriate
authority.
<P>

Yours sincerely,
<P>

WARWICK MacMillan
<P>

P.S.	I understand that a fee is to be lodged with this Appeal.  As I and my
wife do not have any credit cards and there would be
a delay in me mailing a
cheque to the NSW Branch of the ALP, I have asked the Assistant Secretary of
Coniston Branch, Rhonda Sullivan
to pay this on my behalf and I will reimburse
her.  Rhonda Sullivan's credit card details are:  Teachers Credit Union Visa
Card,
name:  Rhonda A Sullivan, No. 4564 1219 4067 5089, expiring 8/99.
<P>

Encls:	Notification of Reformation Meeting of Wollongong S.E.C. (including
ballot draw and S.E.C. delegates list)
<P>

	
<P>

6.	It seems clear from this that the challenges to voting of delegates from
Berkeley and Warrawong branches related not to the qualifications
of selected
delegates but to the entitlement of the branch to the particular number of
delegates claimed.  So far as Mt Keira branch
is concerned that challenge
appears to relate to qualifications of elected delegates pursuant to Rule I 6
which is as follows:
<P>

<b>Joining a Local Branch</b>
<P>

I.6	(a)	Branch members and those wanting to join the branch must live within
the State electorate.  Unless there is overwhelming
evidence against this,
proof of where a branch member or an applicant for branch membership lives is
taken from the up-to-date Commonwealth
Electoral Roll or by production of an
up-to-date Commonwealth Enrolment Card.  For the purpose of this Rule, the
Commonwealth Electoral
Roll includes supplementary rolls and computer
printouts.
<P>

	(b)	In the case of people who are not citizens, a passport or other
documentary proof of non-Australian nationality must be produced,
along with
documentary proof of residence.
<P>

	(c)	In the case of people who are under eighteen years of age, a birth
certificate or the certified copy of entry of birth must
be produced.
<P>

	(d)	Any person who wants to join the branch must prove that he/she is a
paid-up member of that union if eligible.
<P>

	(e)	Any unemployed person who wants to join the branch may be asked to prove
that he/she was a paid-up member of the union which
covered his/her work at the
time he/she became unemployed.  An unemployed person will be asked to produce
documentary evidence of
unemployment, such as a Social Security card.
<P>

7.	In addition Rule N.17(a) sets out certain qualifications to vote in a
selection ballot which in general go to the qualifications
required by
delegates and do not go to the branch entitlement to a particular number of
delegates.
<P>

<b>N. 40 Challenge</b>
<P>

8.	The only arguments relied upon for this challenge were that the decision was
not validly made because there had been no consultation
with the local
electorate council, and because there was no evidence the requirements of one
of Rule N.40(c) or (d) were satisfied.
 As to the first there could be no
consultation as there was no body in existence to consult, and Rule D.4(e)
provides that the Administrative
Committee is in charge of all matters relating
to the selection of parliamentary candidates where there is no Electorate
Council
in existence, so that ground fails.  As to the second, there is
evidence of consultation with the parliamentary leadership and there
is no
evidence adduced by the plaintiff to show that the requirements of one of Rule
N.40(c) or (d) did not exist.  This challenge
fails.
<P>

<b>Credentials Protest</b>
<P>

9.	Rule A.37 which sets out the procedure for a protest in respect of a list of
voters for an electorate council ballot is as follows:
<P>

A.37	(a)	A protest can be made after a list of voters has been prepared for a
branch or Electorate Council ballot.  A branch member
can only protest about
the list of voters for his/her branch.  An Electorate Council delegate can only
protest about the list of
voters for his/her Electorate Council.  All protests
are made to the NSW Credentials Committee but must:
<P>

(i)	Be received in writing by the General Secretary, within seven days of the
branch or Electorate Council credentialling.
<P>

	Note:  Credentialling is the process whereby a list of members is determined
who can vote in Party ballots.
<P>

(ii)	Detail the basis for the protest and include a deposit of $50 plus $5 for
each member charged.  The deposit will be returned
if there is a good reason
for the protest.
<P>

(b)	The NSW Credentials Committee only deals with specific matters in the
protest.  It is the final decision-maker, other than Rule
A.41.
<P>

(c)	There cannot be a protest or appeal by any member over a list of eligible
branch or Electorate Council voters after the result
of the ballot.
<P>

	
<P>

10	Mr. MacMillan and Mr. Billington were informed their challenges would be
dealt with by the Credentials Committee on 1 December
1998 at 337 Sussex
Street, Sydney.  They attended for that purpose with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sullivan,
who were involved with another challenge
from the Coniston branch, which is not
relevant here.  Other challenges from other electorates were being dealt with
the same evening.
 The relevant ones came on at about 8.00 p.m.  
<P>

11	Although the evidence is far from clear on this and many other matters, I am
satisfied that the Committee made an immediate decision
that persons whose
applications for membership had been referred under Rule A.20 but not
determined could not be considered when
determining branch entitlement to
delegates.  These can be referred to as undetermined A.20's.  The rule appears
to be a rule aimed
at preventing branch stacking by delaying admissions to
membership for certain periods if there is a rush of applications to join
a
branch.
<P>

12	After this decision the Committee split up with two committee members being
allocated to each branch.  Mr. Sullivan said that
this was the purpose of
excluding from membership lists those caught by the undetermined A.20 ruling.
He, together with his wife,
Mr. MacMillan and two Committee members, Messrs.
Scimone and Gartrell, dealt with Coniston branch.  That took up until about
10.00
p.m.  He said that Mrs. Sullivan then said to Mr. Scimone and Gartrell
that there were some names and membership lists for Berkeley,
Mt. Keira and
Warrawong who had not been notified of the A.20 rule.  These people can be
referred to as "unnotified A.20s" as distinct
from "undetermined A.20s".  He
said that he was asked to go into the Prime Minister's room to write out lists
of names and he, his
wife and Mr. MacMillan did so and that at about 10.30 p.m.
Mr. Gartrell rushed in to collect the lists.  Mr. Sullivan said that he
asked
about the "other challenges to members who are not on the electoral roll, not
living in the electorate, not living at the address
given, not on the 1997
branch lists, those who were unfinancial in 1997, and those who paid
concessional membership but who were
employed".  He said that Mr. Gartrell had
said that could not be done then and would have to be looked at later as the
committee
was about to consider matters for the Bligh electorate.
<P>

13	Mrs. Sullivan said in affidavit that after the Coniston branch A.20s were
excluded the following conversation took place:
<P>

4.	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"Is the same process taking place with Warrawong and
Berkeley?"
<P>

	Gartrell or Scimone: 	"Yes."
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"But that won't address the problem of the A20s that have
the same dates of issue that have not been notified
to head office.  They are
on these lists."
<P>

	I then produced lists relating to the Berkeley, Warrawong and Mt. Keira
branches copies of which are at pages 5-7 hereof.
<P>

4. 	Amanda Fazio then joined the meeting at our table and I gave her a copy of
those documents following which there was a conversation
in words to the
following effect:
<P>

	Fazio	"I'll take these to Warrawong and Berkeley then."
<P>

	Gartrell	"But dates of issue aren't important, it's the date of their first
meeting that's important.
<P>

	I showed him a summary of meeting dates during the period and said:
<P>

 
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan:	"There are 13 listed here.  What other meetings could there
have been?"
<P>

	Gartrell:  	"Have these people been listed in your challenge?"
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"The number of delegates is dependent on the eligible votes
so we don't need to look at people who are not on
the electoral role [sic],
etc."
<P>

	Gartrell:  	"Are they listed?"
<P>

	Gerry Sullivan:  	"This challenge was following the model of a successful
challenge in 1996 and you can't have one way of interpreting
a rule in 1996 and
a different one now."
<P>

5. 	There was then further conversation about the Rules and  Amanda Fazio took
a copy of the lists for the three branches to the
other end of the room where a
group of committee members were talking.  She returned after a while and there
was a conversation in
words to the following effect:
<P>

	Fazio:   	"There has been a precedent."
<P>

	Scimone:  	"Let's see if any of these individuals have been removed as
A20s."
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan  	"I tried not to include them when I made up these lists but
they could appear in the category of concessional
membership."
<P>

	We then checked the Berkeley list and removed some people  who had been caught
by the A20 Rule.
<P>

6.	The conversation then continued in words to the following  effect:
<P>

	Gartrell:   	"I don't suppose you have the electoral rolls with you do
you?"
<P>

	Gerry Sullivan:  	"Which ones?"
<P>

	There was then discussion as to which ones should be used  and we looked up
the roles [sic] current in 1997.
<P>

	There was then a conversation in words to the following  effect:
<P>

	 Scimone or Gartrell:	"What about these non-notified A20s?"
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"I'm happy to list them for you and fax them through."
<P>

	Gartrell:  	"No they have to be done tonight. Can you go and write out lists
of them."
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan or 
<P>

	Gerry Sullivan:  	"Yes we can."
<P>

7. 	My husband, Warwick MacMillan and I then went into another room and we each
took a branch list and prepared lists of the "non-notified
A20s."
<P>

8.	My husband then said:  "I'll just photocopy these," and started to do so
whereupon Mr. Gartrell said:  "There's no time for that.
 I'll give you a copy
later," and took them out of his hand.
<P>

14	The lists referred to in paragraph 3 of that affidavit are lists relating to
each of the three branches.  I have annexed copies
at the end of this
judgment.
<P>

15	Mr. MacMillan in affidavit evidence said that after dealing with the
Coniston branch the following conversation took place:
<P>

	MacMillan:  	"We can accept that but we still want to get them in for a rank
and file vote."
<P>

 	Scimone:  	"You can show us the evidence later.  That's all we have to do
now."
<P>

 	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"What about Warwick's challenge?"
<P>

	Scimone (or Gartrell): 	"We're not here for that".
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"The Credentials Committee should deal with this now."
<P>

	Scimone:	"You can't go ahead with it.  We're not going to do it."
<P>

 	Either MacMillan or
<P>

	Rhonda Sullivan: 	"David Brown lodged an identical challenge in 1996 and you
accepted that."
<P>

 	Gartrell:  	"Let me go and see Amanda about this."
<P>

9. 	Shortly afterwards Amanda Fazio came over to us and there  was a
conversation in words to the following effect:
<P>

 
<P>

	Fazio:    	"What is this challenge?"
<P>

 	MacMillan   	"It's a challenge about non-notified A20s and a lot of other
things, failing to prove addresses, etc."
<P>

 	Fazio    	"What do you mean by non-notified A20s?"
<P>

 	MacMillan:   	"There are a lot of people who joined at meetings who should
have been caught by the A20 rule but who were not previously
notified by the
secretaries to head office. I have identified them."
<P>

 	Fazio:	"Okay, on that basis you can go ahead."
<P>

10. 	Gerry Sullivan, Rhonda Sullivan and I then wrote out three handwritten
lists of the "non-notified A20s".  Just after 10.30
p.m. I observed Gerry
Sullivan go to copy the lists in an ante room just off the meeting room and I
saw Tim Gartrell go after him
and there was a conversation in words to the
following effect:
<P>

 	Gartrell:   	"We haven't go bloody time to do this.  I'll get you a copy
later.  Just give them to me."
<P>

 	Gartrell then took the notes into the meeting room and  shortly afterwards
Gerry Sullivan, Rhonda Sullivan and I left.
<P>

16	Ms Fazio, who is an executive officer of the New South Wales Branch of the
Australian Labor Party said that when the unnotified
A20 issue was raised the
Credentials Committee decided it would not deal with it as it was not part of
the original challenge.  I
do not understand  this to be attacked.  She said
that this decision was made after the plaintiff and his colleagues left the
meeting
and that does at least sit with some of the other evidence.  She said
that the reports of the sub-committees dealing with Coniston,
Warrawong and
Berkeley branches were dealt with, but as there had been no time to determine
the Mt. Keira branch entitlement that
was delegated to a sub-committee which
met the next day.  The evidence was that the undetermined A20s had been deleted
from the list
but the branch list had not been checked.
<P>

17	In oral evidence Ms Fazio said that the lists which I have annexed to this
judgment were handed in by Mr. Sullivan before the
sub-committees split off in
response to a question whether there was any other material to support the
challenges.
<P>

18	The minutes of the meeting of the credentials committee show that the
committee decided on the evening of the meeting that Berkeley
branch had 78
registered members giving them an entitlement to six delegates, a reduction of
three.  In fact under rule G.1 the entitlement
was seven and that may have been
amended later.  Warrawong was determined to have 27 members giving entitlement
to three delegates,
a reduction of one.
<P>

19	According to the minutes and the evidence of Ms Fazio, the Mt. Keira
challenge could not be finally determined that night as
there was no time, and
all that was concluded was the deletion of the outstanding A20s. It was then
determined that the task of checking
the branch books would be delegated to two
senior branch officials Messrs. O'Connor and Arbib.  Ms Fazio said that she
handed to
them the original challenge and the later list of Mr. Sullivan
applicable to the branch, and the branch records.  I accept that.
 According to
the minutes they completed the task next day and determined the branch had 67
members giving it an entitlement to six
delegates to the electorate council as
against a claimed eleven.  
<P>

20	Thus the total reduction of delegates as a result of the protests was
nine.
<P>

21.	Of the delegates put forward by Mt. Keira, apart from the general challenge
about numbers, three delegates and three alternate
delegates were challenged
under Rule I6(a) on the ground that their names were not on the Electoral Roll;
two delegates and two alternate
delegates were challenged on the basis that
they did not live in the Wollongong area; and one was challenged on the basis
that he
did not live at his stated address.  One of those challenged for
non-inclusion on the Electoral Roll was also challenged on the basis
that he
did not appear on a current branch list of financial or unfinancial members.
Assuming that all the challenges were proper,
were not dealt with, and would
have succeeded had they been dealt with, the branch membership would have been
reduced from 67 to
56, decreasing delegation entitlement numbers by one.
Strictly speaking there was no general challenge to numbers of delegates from
Mt. Keira branch, but only a challenge to qualifications of some delegates, but
no point seems to have been taken on this.
<P>

22 	It is fair to say that the evidence is quite confused and quite deficient
insofar as important matters are concerned.  However,
I am satisfied on the
following matters:
<P>

a. 	that members caught up by the outstanding A20 referrals determination were
excluded from the lists of the three branches;
<P>

b.	that unnotified A20's were not included because no notice was given of this
challenge and this has not been shown to be an incorrect
determination;
<P>

c. 	that the branch books were checked to determine the number of registered
members after exclusion of the outstanding A20 referrals;
<P>

d. 	That the committee made the final determinations in the absence of the
challengers, who make no complaint about that.
<P>

23	The question then is whether the lists of specific matters and names for
each of the three branches were considered and determined
by the committee.  So
far as Berkeley branch and Warrawong branch are concerned, in spite of the
confusion in the evidence, I find
that they were and certainly that the
plaintiff has not established on the balance of probabilities they were not.
There are two
pieces of evidence of some significance on this aspect.  The
first is that the electoral rolls were called for; the second is that
a careful
checking of the names of persons determined by the committee to be registered
members does not include the names of some
persons challenged in the Sullivan
lists under various headings.  On the Berkeley list the deletions include two
persons claimed
as not being on the roll, one person as not living within the
electorate, one unfinancial member and at least five concessional members.
 On
the Warrawong list the deletions include two out of the three persons claimed
not to be on the electoral roll, two out of three
claimed as not living in the
electorate and five claimed as having joined after the relevant date.
<P>

24	I find that the challenge in respect of those branches was determined prior
to the poll.  In coming to this conclusion I have
kept in mind the strong
submission made by Mr. Perram for the plaintiff that it would have been easy
enough for the defendant to
have called one of the members of credentials
committee, and that his witnesses were not cross-examined on their affidavits.
There
is, I think considerable force in that submission, but in view of the
evidence that the particular challenges must in some way have
been dealt with,
I do not think it carries the day.  As a matter of interest had those members
on Mr. Sullivan's lists for Berkeley
and Warrawong, who do not appear to have
been excluded, been excluded, the result might have been that the relevant
branch membership
for Berkeley was 53 giving an entitlement to five delegates,
not six or seven and the Warrawong branch membership would have been
reduced by
seven to 20, giving the same branch entitlement as determined.
<P>

25.	So far as Mt. Keira Branch is concerned the matter is less clear.  One
reason for this is that the list of members determined
to be registered members
of the branch is not set out in the minutes or the report of the Credentials
Committee prepared by Ms Fazio
as it was for the other two branches.  Had it
been, it might have indicated that the particular challenges had been dealt
with. 
However, the minutes on their face indicate that after the outstanding
A20 referral names were deleted, the checking of the books
was referred to a
sub-committee.  In the absence of any evidence that the particular challenges
notified were dealt with, which evidence
could easily have been given by the
members of the sub-committee, it is open to me to find that they were not dealt
with and I so
find.  In addition, the committee itself is not shown to have
made any determination on Mt. Keira.  I was not referred to any rule
authorising the delegation of decision making.  The result of this is that Mt.
Keira, after the reduction of its original entitlement
to a figure of six, may
have been, but was not necessarily, susceptible to a further reduction.  That
figure is undetermined but
according to the minutes of the Review Tribunal of
12 February 1999 the entitlement at the least would be three.  That is a matter
which I find was not determined, and thus the result is that I must find that
the Credentials Committee did not determine the challenges
before the relevant
election.
<P>

<b>Claim for declaration and discretion</b>
<P>

26.	Details of the pre-selection ballot are not before the court.  There is no
evidence of the number of candidates but there is
evidence that the final
decision was between Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Markham.  According to the report of
the review tribunal meeting
of 12 February 1999, the outcome of the ballot,
presumably after distribution of preferences, was Markham 58.78 votes and
Sullivan
17.206 votes.  On that basis it is impossible to conclude that six
votes less could have made any difference, the reduction being
three fewer
delegates from Mt. Keira branch and thus three fewer electors put forward by
administration.
<P>

27.	It is not really relevant to this claim, but even had the plaintiff
established his claim to the review tribunal - based it
seems on material not
placed before the Credentials Committee - that the delegates should have been
reduced by nine resulting in
a decrease in votes on the election committee by
18, that is unlikely to have made any difference unless those deleted were
extremely
persuasive.
<P>

28 	This is a claim for a declaration, that the pre-selection ballot which was
held is void and without effect and for an order
for a fresh ballot.  I do not
understand how that latter order can be made.  As to the declaration there is a
discretion in the court
as to whether or not it should make the declaration
sought.  In the view of the matters discussed under this heading I have
concluded
that I should decline to make that declaration as I consider it clear
there would be no utility in it as a new vote would not assist
the plaintiff.
I consider also that Rule C.1 gives added reason to exercise the discretion to
refuse to make a declaration in proper
circumstances.  It is proper to consider
whether Mr. Sullivan, a person bound by the rules, should obtain a declaration
in proceedings
which on their face are contrary to the rules, giving rise only
to a Phyrric victory.  In the circumstances however there should
be no order as
to costs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

1. 	Summons be dismissed.
