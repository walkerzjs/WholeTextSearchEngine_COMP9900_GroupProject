<b>55044/98:	EXXON (AUSTRALIA) LTD (FORMERLY WHITE  INDUSTRIES LIMITED)      v
 CHADTECH PTY LTD  </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:	There is before the Court a summons filed on 23 October
1998 in which Exxon Coal Australia Limited  (formerly White Industries Limited)
(`Exxon') seeks orders with respect to an award made by Mr T.M.McDougall ("the
Arbitrator") dated 25 September 1998 in respect of
a dispute arising out of a
subcontract made on 13 August 1987 between Exxon as head contractor and the
defendant Chadtech Pty Limited
("Chadtech) as subcontractor.
<P>

2	Exxon seeks an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a>
(`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>') setting aside Mr McDougall's award.  
<P>

3	Exxon seeks in the alternative, an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
granting Exxon leave to appeal from the award in respect of questions of law
said to arise out of the award.
<P>

4	The subcontract required Chadtech to perform RFI Screening Works (`Screening
Works') for the Telecom Resources Management Centre
in respect of a number of
buildings at St Leonards.  Exxon was the construction manager for the
project.
<P>

5	The subject works involved a common form of screening to screen out certain
radio frequencies which are emitted by a range of
electrical devices.  The
subject buildings at St Leonards apparently include Telecom communications
equipment.
<P>

6	The subcontract included an arbitration agreement [clause 44(b)].  Disputes
or differences having arisen between the parties,
Chadtech gave Exxon notice in
writing of those disputes or differences on or about 14 August 1992.  The
parties then agreed upon
Mr McDougall as the Arbitrator. A preliminary
conference was convened on 23  November 1994 and thereafter pleadings were
exchanged
between the parties and the hearing took place on 13 July 1998.
Submissions were advanced in writing to the Arbitrator after the
hearing and in
due course the award was handed down.
<P>

7	The matters raised before the Court require inter alia a close examination of
the pleadings and submissions and statements of
issues which passed between the
parties. They were as follows:
<P>

	<i>(a)	Points of Claim dated 20 December 1994 [Tab 45 - see paragraph 8 for an
explanation as to the Tab numbers]</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Points of Defence and Points of Cross-claim dated 23 November 1995 [Tab

47]                                                  
      </i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	Amended Reply and Amended Defence to Points of Cross claim dated 22
February 1996  [Tab 48]</i>

claim dated 29 February 1996  [Tab 49]</i>

<i>	(p)	Exxon's submissions in reply dated 20 August 1998.  [Tab 67]</i>
<P>

8	Exhibit PX Volumes 1 to 3 include these documents. The exhibit is divided
into segments with the above tab numbers.  The tab numbers
will be referred to
from time to time during this judgment for convenience.
<P>

9	Certain sections  of the Summons were not pressed, these being the
plaintiff's contentions at pars 11, 12(c), 14(f) and 14(g).
<P>

	<b>Exxon's <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> claim</b>
<P>

10	In par 12 of the Contentions, Exxon alleges that the Arbitrator misconducted
the proceedings by making conclusions in respect
of matters that were not  the
subject of any claim or submission made by Chadtech.  In short, Exxon claims to
have been denied procedural
fairness which is said to have required that no
issue not pleaded or otherwise sufficiently raised and dealt with by both
parties,
be decided by the Arbitrator.
<P>

11	The principles which obtain in relation to a claim such that pressed by
Exxon are not in doubt. They were expressed by Goff LJ
in <i>Interbulk Ltd v
Aiden Shipping Co Ltd</i> <i>(`The Vimeira')</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2  Lloyd's Rep 66</a> at 74
to 75 in a passage later cited by Giles J in <i>Thiess Watkins White
Construction Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) v
Commonwealth of Australia</i>, (Unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 23 April
1992, Giles J) at pages 14-15.
<P>

12	Goff LJ said:
<P>

	<i>"There is plain authority that for arbitrators so to decide a case, without
giving a party any warning that the point is one which
they have in mind and so
giving the party no opportunity of dealing with it, amounts to technical
misconduct and renders the award
liable  to be set aside or remitted ... In
truth we are simply talking about fairness.  It is not fair to decide a case
against a
party on an issue which has never been raised in the case without
drawing the point to his attention so that he may have an opportunity
of
dealing with it, either by calling further evidence or addressing argument on
the facts or the law to the tribunal".</i>
<P>

13	Ackner LJ said:
<P>

	<i>"If an arbitrator considers that the parties or their experts have missed
the real point ...then it is not only a matter of obvious
prudence, but the
arbitrator is obliged, in common fairness or, as it is sometimes described, as
a matter of natural justice, to
put the point to them so that they have an
opportunity of dealing with it" </i>
<P>

<i>	(1984) 2 Ll LR at p76</i>
<P>

14	As Giles J pointed out in <i>Thiess Watkins</i>, there are a number of cases
to the same effect:  see <i>Societe Franco-Tunisienne d'Armement-Tunis v
Government of Ceylon</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%201%20WLR%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] 1 WLR 787</a>; <i>Faghirzadeh v Rudolff Wolff (SA)
Pty Ltd</i> [1977] 1 Lloyd's.Rep.630; <i>Fox &amp; Ors v P.G. Wellfair Ltd (In
Liquidation)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 Lloyd's Rep 514</a> and <i>Edible Oil Products (Malaysia)
BHD v Jayant Oil Mills Private Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1982] 2 Lloyd's Rep.95.
<P>

15	In <i>Thiess Watkins</i>, Giles J at p15 made the point that the question is
to an extent a question of degree, as is shown by the recognition in <i>Edible
Oil Products</i> at 97, that failure to draw attention to a point may not be
technical misconduct, and by <i>Mabanaft GmbH v Consentino Shipping Co SA (`The
Achillet')</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2 Lloyd's Rep 191.</a>
<P>

16	In <i>Mabanaft</i> the following was said at 194:
<P>

	<i>"As Mr Justice Ackner said in Fox v Wellfair at p520 in a judgment upheld
on appeal, it must always be a question of fact and degree
whether a party has
had an adequate opportunity of dealing with any substantive criticism of the
claim or defence.  In assessing
the question of fact or degree the Court will
bear in mind both the importance of the point not put, and </i><cite>the
likelihood that the result would have been affected</cite><i>.  Fox v Wellfair,
where the application to set aside succeeded, was a case at one end of the
spectrum.  This case is at the other".</i>  [emphasis added]
<P>

17	To those authorities there may be added a reference  to the <i>Re
Association  of Architects of Australia; Ex parte Municipal Officers
Association of Australia </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2063%20ALJR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 63 ALJR 298</a>, where at 305 Gaudron J
said:
<P>

	<i>"As was pointed out by Deane J in Sullivan v Department of Transport  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2020%20ALR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978)
20 ALR 323</a> at 343, procedural fairness requires only that a party be given `a
reasonable </i><cite>opportunit</cite><i>y to present his case' and not that
the tribunal ensure `that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity
that he is entitled'.
 And it is always relevant to inquire whether the party
or his legal representative should reasonably have apprehended that the issue
was or might become a live issue:  see Re Building Workers Industrial Union of
Australia; Ex parte Gallagher( <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%29%2062%20ALJR%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988) 62 ALJR 81</a> at 84".</i>
<P>

18	Three particular matters are relied on by Exxon in respect of its misconduct
case.  The Arbitrator's misconduct is said to have
involved reaching the
following conclusions in respect of matters said  not to have been the subject
of any claim or submission made
by the Chadtech:
<P>

	(a)	Exxon directed deviations pursuant to clause 29(b) of the sub-contract by
letters dated 22 June and  13 September 1998 (Part
G10, G14 and K1 of the
Award);
<P>

	(b)	The directions issued by Exxon pursuant to clause 29(b) of the
sub-contract are extensions of time for completion of the works
(Part G5, G7,
H18, I6 and K1 of the Award).
<P>

(d)	Chadtech's notice of its intention to claim costs in respect of future
delays dated 20 June 1998 was a proper notice pursuant
to clause 47 (as
amended) of the sub-contract of its intention to make a claim (Part I9) of  the
Award.
<P>

[Notice of Contentions paragraph 12, where paragraph 12(c) was not proceeded
with.]
<P>

	<b>The Claim made in Notice of Contentions sub-paragraph 12(a)</b>
<P>

19	The provisions in the subcontract of central relevance to these proceedings
are conveniently to be found in paragraphs C(3),
C(4) and C(5) of the Award.
Those paragraphs set out on pages 5 to 9 of the Award are appended to this
judgment as Appendix "A".
<P>

20	Exxon submits that Chadtech's claim  was pleaded as one for loss and damage
for various breaches of contract and further and
in the alternative, for
additional costs and expenses for deviations directed by Exxon from the
construction programmes.  Exxon refers
to the Points of Claim at paragraphs 15
and 20;  Points of Claim at 8(a), 9, 10-14, 16-19 and to Points of Claim
paragraph 8(c),
21-23.
<P>

21	Exxon then focuses attention upon the particulars given of the alleged
directed deviations in paragraph 21 of the Points of Claim.
<P>

22	Paragraph 21 of the Points of Claim was in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>"Further and in the alternative, whilst Chadtech was carrying out the works
[Exxon] directed deviations from the construction programme
pursuant to clause
29 of the subcontract</i>
<P>

<i>	Particulars of Directions of Deviations</i>
<P>

<i>	(a) 	Revision 5 of the construction programme dated December 1987</i>
<P>

<i>	(b) 	Unnumbered Revision of the construction programme dated approximately
August 1988."</i>
<P>

23	I interpolate that clause 29(b) of the sub-contract clearly permits Exxon to
direct a deviation from a relevant construction
programme.
<P>

24	Exxon submits that  the Arbitrator held that there were also directed
deviations arising from letters of 22 June 1988 and 13
September 1988 from
Exxon. The letter of 22 June 1988 is referred to in the award at paragraph G9
and  the letter of 13 September
1988 is referred to in the award at paragraph
G13.
<P>

25	It is convenient to further append to this judgment as Appendix B, pages 15
to 25 inclusive of the Award inter alia setting out
paragraphs G to K.
<P>

26	Exxon's submission is that the deviations said to have arisen from the
letters of 22 June and 13 September 1988 were not contended
for by Chadtech and
are not to be found in its Statement of Issues of 2 July 1988, Statement of
Facts and Law of 10 July 1988, Submissions
of 12 August 1988 nor Submissions in
Reply of 20 August 1988 and were not otherwise raised prior to the Award being
handed down.
<P>

27	The parties addressed detailed written and then oral submissions to a number
of paragraphs in the pleadings and in the statements
of issues to which I have
referred.  Having carefully examined both the pleadings and the issues as well
as the particular sections
of those documents relied upon by each party in
their written and their oral submissions I have come to the very clear view
that
there is no substance in Exxon's claim of  misconduct on the matter.  In
my view and applying the principles above referred to, it
is plain that Exxon
received procedural  fairness.  It was in my view given a reasonable
opportunity to present its case.  It ought
reasonably have apprehended that the
issue now said  not to have been a live issue and not to have been contended
for by Chadtech,
was a live issue and was so contended for.  Further, I am
entirely satisfied that the result would have been unaffected had Chadtech's
pleaded particulars given in paragraph 21 of the Points of Claim, extended to
expressly recite the so-called `missing' two letters
of 22 June and 13
September 1988.
<P>

28	It is plainly necessary to descend into some degree of detail in examination
of the pleadings and issues and in giving the Court's
reasons for the above
expressed view.  I turn to that matter.
<P>

29	I have already referred to par 21 of the Points of Claim.   The paragraph
forms part of Section B of the pleading dealing with
`Prolongation Claim'.
<P>

	Section B is structured as follows:
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 8 pleads express terms of the contract.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 9 pleads implied terms of the contract.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 10 pleads breaches of the express terms.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraphs 11 to 14 pleads breaches of the implied terms.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 15 pleads loss and damage flowing from these breaches.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraphs 16 to 19 plead alternative modes of breach of the implied
terms.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 20 pleads loss and damage flowing from these breaches.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 21 is set out above.
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraph 22 pleads that `by reason of the aforesaid deviations to the
construction programme and its compliance with them, Chadtech
has incurred
additional costs and expenses to which it is entitled [pursuant to clause
29(f);  it being asserted in paragraph 8(c)
that an express term provided for
by clause 29(f) entitled Chadtech' to any extra cost resulting from a deviation
from a construction
program directed by [Exxon] where the need for the
direction or deviation was due to an act, default or omission of the Principal,
Superintendent or (Exxon)].
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

30	In Chadtech's Reply to the Amended Points of Defence dated 17 June 1998,
Chadtech pleaded inter alia as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Chadtech says that ... Chadtech gave [Exxon] sufficient and/or proper
notice as required under the express terms of the subcontract
specified in
paragraphs 25(a)(i) and 30(a) of the  Amended Points of Defence</i>
<P>

<i>	Particulars</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	Chadtech relies upon and refers to the Statements of  Evidence by
Messrs Henderson, Davidson and Vercoe served in support of
its claim."</i>
<P>

31	Fleshing out the pleading, Chadtech was asserting that it gave sufficient
and proper notice as required by clause 31(b) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> sub-section 2.2,
clause 1(i) of the contract.  And with reference to the particulars to this
paragraph insofar as they referred to
evidence given by Mr Henderson, it is
necessary to note that Mr Ian Henderson in his statement of 27 January 1998.
[Tab 68 in paragraph
73] had stated as follows:
<P>

	<i>"On 20 June 1988 I forwarded to [Exxon] another extension of time on behalf
of Chadtech".	</i>
<P>

32	In paragraph 74 of his statement, Mr Henderson had referred to Exxon's
response of 22 June 1988 to Chadtech, this being one of
the alleged missing
particulars to paragraph 21 of Chadtech's Points of Claim.
<P>

33	In Chadtech's Statement of Issues of 2 July 1998 [Tab 54] Chadtech raised as
issue 1(h) the following "What is the proper construction
and effect of clause
29".
<P>

34	In Exxon's Further Amended  Points of Defence dated  8 July 1988 [Tab 59]
Exxon at par 25(c) stated:
<P>

	<i>"In further answer to paragraphs 8-20 of the Points of Claim, Exxon did not
extend the time for completion of the Works or a separable
part of the Works
for any delay caused by any of the breaches of Sub-Contract alleged in Points
of Claim paragraphs10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 16, 17, 18 or 19".</i>
<P>

35	In par 26 of Exxon's Amended Points of Defence dated 8 July 1998, it
admitted that it issued the December 1987 Revision 5 and
the August 1988
unnumbered Revision but otherwise denied paragraph 21 of the Points of
Claim.
<P>

36	In par 27 of the further Amended Points of Defence Exxon denied the
allegations made in the Points of Claim at paragraphs 22
and 23.
<P>

37	Chadtech in its Statement of Facts and Law Contended For of 10 July 1998
[Tab 61] included the following issue
<P>

	<i>"1(h)	The proper construction and effect of clause 29 is that where a
deviation from the construction programme occurs, then Chadtech
is entitled to
any extra cost resulting from such a deviation where the deviation is due to an
act, default or omission of the principal,
superintendent or the
contractor."</i>
<P>

38	In Exxon's Statement of Fact and Law appearing at Tab 62 the following
appears
<P>

	<i>"(8)	Clause 29 of the Conditions of Contract generally permits the issuance
of programmes to the Respondent during the course of the
works.  The Respondent
</i><cite>admits that it did issue further programmes during the course of the
work to the claimant</cite><i> that illustrated different access or possession
and completion requirements to that shown in the Annexure to the
Contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	(10)	Clause 29(d) is an all embracing provision </i><cite>whereby the
issuance of a programme would not relieve the claimant from seeking an
extension of time from the original contract obligations</cite><i>.  If the
programme showed completion dates  at variance with the original dates, then it
fell upon the claimant to seek extensions
of time within 14 days from the
issuance of such programmes.  The claimant did not seek such extensions of time
or at all as a result
of the issuance of programmes."    </i>[emphasis
added]
<P>

39	As indicated by the passages emphasised above, Exxon's Statement of Fact and
Law makes plain that Exxon in fact admitted that
it had issued further
programmes during the course of the work and raised specifically the question
of the interaction of clause
29(d) and clause 31.  To my mind as the Award
makes plain, the Arbitrator in fact looked closely at and determined as an
issue between
the parties, the relationship between those two clauses and the
question of whether or not a directed deviation amounted to an extension
of
time in the circumstances.
<P>

40	Continuing through the relevant chronology one comes to Exxon's Statement of
Issues of July 1998 [Tab 60].  In par 5 of Exxon's
Statement of Issues the
following appears
<P>

	<i>"Does the issue of programmes by [Exxon] that show delayed possession and
completion dates indicate a deviation to the original construction
programme or
merely reflect delays in possession of the site or sufficient of the site and
consequential delays in the completion
of the works?"</i>
<P>

41	In par 10 of Exxon's Statement of Issues of July 1998 the following
appears
<P>

	<i>"Does the force and effect of cl 29(f) require Chadtech to have sought an
extension of time to the dates for completion stated in
the Third Schedule,
notwithstanding that programmes issued to Chadtech by [Exxon] show completion
dates beyond those shown in the
Third Schedule".</i>
<P>

42	In Chadtech's submissions of 12 August 1998 [Tab 64] Chadtech at par 22
submits
<P>

	<i>". . . that White is in breach of the implied terms pleaded, the obligation
to consider properly Chadtech's claims for extensions
of time and, thereby,
failed to pay to Chadtech the delay costs which it ought to have paid."</i>
<P>

43	In Exxon's submissions of 12 August 1998 [Tab 65] one finds at pages 14-19 a
detailed analysis of the claims of Chadtech to rely
on clause 29.  It is
convenient to append these pages as Appendix C to this judgment.  Of particular
importance are the terms of
pars 5.34 and 5.35 to Exxon's submissions of 12
August 1998.  It is chrystal clear from paragraph 5.35(e) that Exxon litigated
the
very question now said not to have been litigated, namely whether the issue
of the programs constituted acts or omissions within
the meaning of clause
31(b).
<P>

44	It is clear enough from Exxon's submissions of 12 August 1998 that Exxon
admitted the issue of the subject construction programmes
and took its stance
before the Arbitrator in terms of the proposition that Chadtech's analysis was
flawed in that the provision of
construction programmes could not amount to a
deviation.  In this regard I note that the second full paragraph of clause
5.35(g)
put that clause 29(d) means that regardless of what any programme might
show in respect of completion dates, if the completion date
shown on the
programme is beyond that shown in the contract, Chadtech was obliged to seek an
extension of time pursuant to clause
31 and to lodge a notice pursuant to
clause 47.  The further significance of the second full paragraph of paragraph
5.35(g) is that
the whole question of the suggested clause 31 extension of time
requirement was litigated.  The Arbitrator'' finding that the subject
letters
and updated programmes constituted in the alternative, either clause 29(b)
directions to deviate or clause 31(e) extensions
was clearly open on the facts
and on the respective analyses contended for by the parties.
<P>

45	Moving on in the chronology, Chadtech's Submissions in Reply of 20 August
1998 [Tab 66] included the following
<P>

	<i>"10.  Chadtech submits that in circumstances where White has admitted
delays in providing sufficient access to the site  then White
is not entitled
to rely upon a strict interpretation of the contractual regime to avoid
granting Chadtech extensions of time and
consequently paying delay costs.
Chadtech submits that it is fundamentally inequable and a breach of the implied
term to act fairly
and honestly for White to candidly admit significant  and
substantial delays in respect to providing sufficient access to the site
to
enable Chadtech to proceed with the works and yet</i>
<P>

<i>	(a) refuse to exercise its discretion under cl31(e) to grant extensions of
time and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b) seek to deny the entitlement of Chadtech  to extensions of time and
delay costs on the basis of an alleged failure to provide
sufficient notice
pursuant to clause 31(b) in respect of acts and omissions solely attributable
to White and which White admits caused
Chadtech to be significantly delayed in
the performance of its works".</i>
<P>

46	Ultimately the matter was clearly litigated upon the basis that
notwithstanding the failure of Chadtech to furnish by way of
express
particulars in its Points of Claim, the letters of 22 June and 13 September
1998 as constituting in part directed deviations
pursuant to clause 29(b), the
fact that Chadtech was relying upon this correspondence as part of a course of
directed deviations
was clear.  One only has to look, it seems to me, at the
sequence of letters, to see that they form a flow of correspondence each
dealing with the position up to that point of time and thereafter, as opposed
to being discrete letters the effect of which require
to be independently
assessed out of context and on the artificial basis that the letters were the
only letters ever sent.  Further
it is quite plain that the answer which Exxon
advanced was that any construction programme which was issued was not, and
could not
have been a deviation, as the construction programmes were
meaningless and bearing in mind the submissions advanced by Exxon as to
the
proper construction of the relevant clauses in the contract and the
inter-relationship or lack thereof of such clauses.
<P>

47	The plaintiff's claim pressed in the Contentions par 12(a) is rejected.
<P>

	<b>The claim pressed in par 12(b) of the Contentions</b>
<P>

48	Exxon's claim here has already in substance, been dealt with.  It is closely
intertwined with that advanced in relation to Notice
of Contentions paragraph
12(a).  Exxon contends that `extensions of time pursuant to clause 31(e) (or at
all) were never contended
for by [Chadtech]'.  [submissions paragraph 5] Exxon
submits that it actually pleaded in its Further Amended Points of Defence at
Tab 59 paragraph 25(c), that Exxon did not grant any extension of time.  Exxon
submits that whilst Chadtech replied to that paragraph
of the pleading (Points
of Reply Tab 53 paragraph 2), Chadtech did not traverse, specifically or
generally, that assertion by Exxon.
<P>

49	Exxon refers to Chadtech's Submissions in Reply which  are said to have
conceded [Tab 66 par 10 set out above] that Exxon refused
to exercise its
discretion under clause 31(e) to grant extensions of time.
<P>

50	Exxon also relies upon a letter which the Arbitrator wrote to the parties
shortly after the hearing [Tab 63 p 2] in which letter
the Arbitrator in
referring to clause 31 commented
<P>

	<i>"Again the sub-clause (e) gives the contractor the power to extend by
notice, the time for completion, and to do this at any time.</i>
<P>

<i>	From the evidence, no such notice was given by the contractor and the
subcontract finished way beyond the date for completion".</i>
<P>

51	Exxon submits that notwithstanding these matters, the Arbitrator found that
extensions of time had been granted by it and in
this regard relies upon the
Award at paragraphs G5, G7, G9. H18 and, I6 and K1.
<P>

52	It is plain enough that clause 31(e) of the contract was squarely addressed
by the parties.  Exxon's further Amended Points of
Defence at Tab 59 in
paragraph 25(a) specifically pleaded several subsections of clause 31 including
clause 31(e).  And in paragraph
25(c) of the same document, Exxon pleads that
it did not extend the time for completion of the works, or a separable part of
the
works.
<P>

53	In its Statement of Facts and Law contended for at 10 July 1998 [Tab 61] at
paragraph 1(i)(i)-(iv), Chadtech sets out its contentions
as to the proper
construction and effect of clause 31 and in particular asserts that "the
contractor may, at any time and from time
to time and for any reason thought
sufficient extend the time for completion of the works notwithstanding the
absence of any notice
claiming an extension of time".
<P>

54	To my mind the Arbitrator did not go outside the matters litigated in his
findings sought to be impugned in the manner set out
in contentions paragraph
12(b). The inter-relationship of the various clauses was squarely addressed by
the parties.  The findings
attacked by Exxon in par 12(b) of the Contentions
were, it seems to me, clearly litigated.  
<P>

55	<b><u>Notice of Contentions par 12(d)</u></b>
<P>

56	The letter of 20 June 1998 was clearly relied upon by Chadtech for the
purpose of constituting notice.  This is plain from Chadtech's
Statement of
Facts and Law [Tab 61] paragraphs 3(a)(i)(F) and 3(b)(ii).  Paragraph 3 is
entitled "Notice of Provisions and states
inter alia
<P>

	<i>"Chadtech gave sufficient notice of its claims for extension of time and
delay costs and refers and relies upon  the statements of
Ian Henderson,
Neville Vercoe and Peter Davidson </i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Chadtech gave notice or sufficient notice of any and/.or all of its
claims for extensions of time and delay costs </i><cite>for the purposes of cl
47</cite><i> in that ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	Chadtech relies upon the notice given and identified and 	Statement
reference outlined  at 3(a) above."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[emphasis added]
<P>

57	The relevant reference is to Mr Henderson's Statement of 27 January 1998,
paragraph 73 set out above.  It will be recalled that
Mr Henderson stated that
on 20 June 1988 he had forwarded to WIL another extension of time claim on
behalf of Chadtech.
<P>

58	Further support for this conclusion is to be found in Chadtech's Reply [Tab
53, paragraph 2(a)] already referred to wherein Chadtech
had squarely responded
to Exxon's Amended Points of Defence [Tab 50].  Chadtech negated the
proposition that it had not given Exxon
sufficient or proper notice as required
under the express terms of the contract which had been pleaded in pars 25(a)(i)
and in par
30 of Exxon's Amended Points of Defence..
<P>

59	In the result there is no substance in Exxon's claim contended for in par
12(d) Notice of Contentions.
<P>

60	Before leaving Exxon's <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> Contentions it is appropriate to return briefly
to the principles earlier referred to.  To my mind this case is a good example
of
a situation where it is indeed a question of fact and degree whether Exxon
had an adequate opportunity  of dealing with the matters
complained of in
Contentions paragraphs 12(a), (b) and (d).  Exxon ought to have reasonably
apprehended that the matters were the
subject of the Arbitrator's holdings now
attacked were live issues and to my mind Exxon clearly was given a reasonable
opportunity
to present its case.  In the case of any doubt about the matter
raised by the complex of exchanged submissions, Exxon clearly ought
to have
reasonably apprehended that the matters, the subject of the Arbitrator's
holdings now sought to be attacked, might become
live issues.  As Gaudron J
said in Association of Architects [supra], procedural fairness does not require
that the tribunal  ensure
that a party takes the best advantage of the
opportunity to which he is entitled.   Procedural fairness requires <u>only</u>
that a party be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case.   Exxon
clearly had such a reasonable opportunity.
<P>

1999, Einstein J, - Butterworths Unreported Cases 9807527].
<P>

65	I did not understand either party to dissent from the statements of
principle set out in Horizons which repeated statements of
the Court of Appeal
in <i>Promenade Investments Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2026%20NSWLR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 26

1996].  It is unnecessary to repeat what was said in Horizons.
<P>

66	Dealing with the Notice of Contentions relevant paragraphs seriatim I turn
to the suggested questions of law.  The contentions
plead as follows:
<P>

	<i>'14.	The questions of law arising out of the conclusions of the Arbitrator
referred to in paragraph 13 are whether:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the Works Program (which was included in the plaintiff's invitation to

that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)    the Works Program showed:</i>
<P>

<i>	(A)	work commencing on 20 July 1987 (Part G1 of the Award);  and</i>

<P>

<i>	17.	The errors of law referred to in paragraph 16 are manifest errors of
law on the face of the Award.</i>
<P>

<i>	18.	Alternatively:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	there is strong evidence that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)    the Arbitrator made the errors of law referred to in paragraph 16;
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)   the determination of the questions of law referred to in paragraph
14 may add, or may be likely to add, substantially to the
certainty of
commercial law;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the determination of the questions of law referred to in paragraph 14
may add, or may be likely to add, substantially to the
certainty of commercial
law because they:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)    relate to a standard form of contract commonly used in the
construction industry;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)    relate to important provisions of that standard form, which, or the
substance of which, are:</i>
<P>

<i>	(A)	incorporated in other standard forms of contract commonly used in the
construction industry;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(B)	included in other contracts commonly used in the construction
industry;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)   arise in circumstances which commonly occur in the construction
industry;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)    relate to issues which are not yet the subject of any authoritative
determination by the courts known to the plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	19.	The determination of the questions of law referred to in paragraph 14
could substantially affect the rights of the parties, in
that the plaintiff may
not, depending on the determination, have any liability to the
defendant.'</i>
<P>

67	To my mind, leave to appeal should clearly not be granted for a number of
reasons.  The first is that no manifest error of law
on the face of the Award
is exposed.  At the highest, Exxon's submissions in certain cases simply point
up analyses which may be
arguable but are by no means evident or obvious.  If,
contrary to the views which I have, there are any errors of law exposed of
the
type that Exxon points out, they were clearly not plain in the sense of being
obvious, nor manifest in the sense that there is
little or no doubt that error
exists.  Exxon has in consequence not shown that there is strong evidence that
the Arbitrator made
an error of law.  Finally, I am not satisfied that the
determination of any of the matters raised by Exxon may add, or may be likely
to add, substantially to the certainty of commercial law.
<P>

68	Mr Callaghan SC for Exxon, conveniently dealt with paragraph 14 of the
notice of contentions by categorising particular sub-paragraphs.
 I note that
sub-paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) were not pressed.
<P>

	<b>Directed Deviations and Extensions of Time - Notice of Contentions
paragraphs 14(b), (h) and (i)</b>
<P>

69	These matters revert to so much of Exxon's case under its <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> head as was
treated in Notice of Contention pars 12(a) and (b).
<P>

70	Exxon contends that the letters and programmes referred to in par 14(b) of
the Summons could not have involved directed deviations
and could not be
properly construed so as to involve directed deviations. The submission is that
a direction to deviate  is necessarily
a direction to change the order or
sequence of the work to be carried out from that shown in the construction
programme.  The submission
is that a direction which merely reflects the fact
that work is not being, and cannot be, carried out within the times
contemplated
by the construction programme because of delays which have
occurred to the works or the main contractor works or both is not a direction
to deviate within the meaning of clause 29(b) of the contract.  The submission
is that such a direction is merely a recognition of
the prevailing
circumstances and is possibly a statement of future expectation.
<P>

71	The further submission is that on the basis of the evidence accepted and the
conclusions set out by the Arbitrator in Part E
of the Award for which a remedy
is said to be conferred on Chadtech by clause 31 of the contract, and on the
basis of the terms of
the plaintiff's letters, those letters cannot be
construed as to directions to deviate from the construction programme within
the
meaning of clause 29(b) of the contract. This is said to be particularly
true of the plaintiff's letter of 22 June 1988 which was
a circular letter
addressed to all subcontractors.  
<P>

72	In relation to the very same letters and programmes the submission is made
that they could not constitute "an automatic extension
of time" [Award par H18]
on any extension of time situation.  The reasons are said to be as follows
<P>

	<i>  (i)	Clause 29 of the contract does not provide for an extension of time
for delay in the construction of the works  that may arise
from a 	direction to
deviate from a construction programme or a direction 	to supply a further
construction programme.</i>
<P>

<i>	 (ii)	In fact clause 29 (b) of the contract specifically states that the
supply "of a further construction programme under this clause
	shall not
relieve the (defendant) of any of his obligations under this 	contract". These
obligations include the obligation to complete
the 	works within the required
time.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The position can hardly be different if the plaintiff directed the
defendant to deviate from the construction programme but
did not 	direct the
defendant to supply a further construction programme 	or, having directed the
defendant to supply a further construction
	programme, the defendant failed or
refused to supply it to the 	plaintiff</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	Clause 31 of the contract is the only provision which deals with
delays in the execution of the work. It does so in two different
ways</i>
<P>

<i>	 (v)	First, clause 31(b) confers a right on the defendant to claim an
extension of time in certain circumstances.  If the claim is
justified, 	clause
31(c) of the contract requires the plaintiff to grant the 	defendant "such
extensions or time to complete the
works as the 	(plaintiff) thinks fit and
shall, as soon as practicable after he is 	granted that extension of time,
notify  the defendant
thereof".</i>
<P>

<i>	( vi)	Secondly, cl 31(e) of the contract  confers a discretion on the
plaintiff to "at any time and from time to time and for any
reason 	he thinks
sufficient, by notice addressed to the(defendant) extend 	the time for
completion of the works by nominating a
date specified 	in the notice as the
date for completion of the works".		</i>
<P>

73	It is said by Exxon that it necessarily follows from the scheme provided by
these provisions that clause 29 of the contract "does
not give an automatic
extension of time for the completion of the works which then gives Chadtech
(although albeit it in a somewhat
backhand manner), an entitlement what are
said in fact to be no more than delay costs (see Part H19 of the Award".
<P>

74	Exxon further submits that the two letters of 22 June and 13 September 1988
and the programme of 26 August 1988 were found to
constitute extensions of
time, notwithstanding that neither of them "nominated a date specified in the
notice as the date for practical
completion" as required by clause 31(e).
<P>

75	To my mind there is no substance in these submissions of Exxon..  The
determination of whether the subject letters sent by Exxon
to Chadtech were
directions to deviate from the contracts works programme under clause 29(b) of
the contract involved at least significant
questions of fact.  There is no
dispute that the letters were sent by Exxon and received by Chadtech.  Each of
the letters concerns
the programming of the works.  I accept Chadtech's
submission that clause 20 of the contract contemplates that a direction
includes
an extremely broad range of instructions.  The findings of the
Arbitrator were based on evidence tendered in the Arbitration and
here again
Exxon did not tender any evidence in the Arbitration in support of its
Contention that the letters did not constitute
direct deviations under the
contract.
<P>

76	To my mind there is much to be said for the proposition that clause 29(b) of
the contract should not be construed in the limited
manner in which Exxon has
construed it. The clause I accept properly contemplates directed deviations
which lead to the continuation
of works beyond the contract completion date.
It is clear that there is no express restriction on the right of the contractor
to
only direct deviations prior to the date of completion under the
contract.
<P>

77	I accept Chadtech's submission that there is no evidence, or at least no
strong evidence, that the delays were the fault of the
principal or
superintendent as contended for by Exxon.  Exxon did not seek in the
Arbitration to prove (nor has it sought otherwise
to prove) that the principal
or the superintendent was to blame for the delays as opposed to Exxon's own
management of the works
and of its subcontractors.  To my mind Exxon  has not
shown a manifest error of law in relation to this question.  If error there
was, it was neither plain in the sense of being obvious nor was it manifest in
the sense  that there was little or no doubt that
error it was.
<P>

78	To my mind, the reasoning given by the Arbitrator in the sections of the
Award which are appended to this Judgment, cannot be
said to be obscure or
unclear.  As Kirby P pointed out in <i>Natoli</i>, what may be `manifest' to
one judicial officer may fail to persuade another.  Hence, what Exxon faces in
terms of its <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)</a> case is a swift and easy persuasion of the Court and
rapid recognition by the Court of the suggested error.  Exxon does not succeed
in that task and I reject these claims as lacking substance.
<P>

79	As to the matter dealt with in contentions paragraph 14(i), this matter may
be dealt with fairly shortly.  To my mind, Exxon's
argument is without
substance at least for the reason that it seeks, it seems to me without a
proper basis, to suggest that the Arbitrator
in the Award gave one and only one
basis for holding that there had been an extension of time allowed by Exxon
pursuant to clause
31(e).  In short, Exxon fixes upon the second sentence of
the Award paragraph I6 to first suggest that the Arbitrator determined
that
there had been an allowance of an extension of time by Exxon pursuant to clause
31(e) because, and only because, the Arbitrator
held that Exxon had no claim on
Chadtech for liquidated damages.  This analysis of the Award is incorrect as
the Arbitrator's reasons
for concluding that there had been an allowance of an
extension of time by Exxon pursuant to clause 31(e) was supported by reasons
altogether different from, although in his view corroborated by, Exxon's
failure to make a claim for liquidated damages.  See in
this regard the Award
at paragraphs G5, G10 and the second sentence of I6.
<P>

80	There is further substance in Chadtech's submission that the determination
of whether Exxon allowed an extension of time pursuant
to clause 31(e) involved
at least as an important element, questions of fact being determined.
<P>

81	Clearly the Arbitrator found that the subject letters dated 21 December
1987, 22 June 1988, 26 August 1988 and 13 September 1988
constituted extensions
of time pursuant to clause 31(e) of the contract.  There was no dispute that
those letters had been sent and
received.  Each of them concerned the
programming of the works and delays in the progress of the works.  The
Arbitrator's finding
was based upon a number of facts.  First it was based upon
the fact that each of those letters constituted directions to deviate
from the
contract works programme and that if those letters did not have the effect of
extending the time for completion, this would
lead to an absurdity.  Exxon did
not tender any evidence in the Arbitration in support of its contention that
the letters did not
constitute directed deviations under the contract.
Secondly, Exxon admitted that the works had been substantially delayed.
Thirdly,
the fact that Exxon had not claimed liquidated damages supported the
conclusion that the plaintiff had allowed an extension of time.
<P>

82	I reject the submission that paragraph 14(i) of the contentions raises a
manifest error of law on the face of the Award.
<P>

	<b>The Clause 47 Issue - Contentions Paragraph 14(c), (d) and (j)</b>
<P>

83	Here again in my view, Exxon's claim to have exposed a manifest error of law
on the face of the Award fails.  The Arbitrator's
reasoning is generally set
out in Part H of the Award.  It is unnecessary that I repeat that reasoning.
The circumstances before
the Arbitrator were unusual in the extreme.  There was
no authority binding the Arbitrator in terms of the interrelationship between
clause 29 and clause 47.  In <i>Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Ltd v Salmond
&amp; Spraggon (Aust) Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1912/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%2d78%29%20139%20CLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977-78) 139 CLR 231</a>, Barwick CJ at 238, as
the Arbitrator reminds us in the Award at page 10, dealt with the relevant law
as to enforceability of a time
limitation clause and cited <i>Suisse Atlantique
Societe d'Armement Maritime SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20AC%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1
AC 361</a> for the proposition that:
<P>

	<i>`. . . whilst exemption clauses which, for present purposes, can be assumed
to include a time limitation such as clause 17, should
be construed strictly,
they are of course enforceable according to their terms </i><cite>unless their
application according to those terms should lead to an absurdity or defeat the
main object of the contract </cite><i>or, for some other reason, justify the
cutting down of their scope.'</i>   [emphasis added]
<P>

84	At paragraph H20 and H21, the Arbitrator's holding was effectively that the
application of clause 47 according to its terms in
the manner contended for by
Exxon, led to an absurdity.  I see no difficulty with the Arbitrator's
reasoning and note the care with
which the Arbitrator went back through several
authorities from which he discerned the underlying rationale for time
limitation clauses
such as clause 47.  That rationale was to alert the relevant
contractor entitled to notice of a proposed claim and to give such a
contractor
the opportunity to investigate and check such claims.  Difficulties of proof
might arise from lack of timely notification.
<P>

85	To my mind, the Arbitrator's reasoning, treating with Exxon's here having
been fully acquainted with the facts and having in
fact directed the delay,
does not expose any manifest error of law in the requisite sense sufficient to
enable Exxon to succeed in
its <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38</a> claim.  At its highest, Exxon's
submissions raise something which may be arguable but they do not result in a
swift and easy persuasion
in the Court of the suggested error said to have been
made nor a rapid recognition of that error.  If error there was, it was neither
plain in the sense of being obvious, nor manifest in the sense that there was
little or no doubt that error it was.  I am by no means
persuaded that the
Arbitrator should have concluded that Chadtech was required to notify Exxon
pursuant to clause 47 of Chadtech's
intention to make a claim pursuant to
clause 29(f).
<P>

86	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(ii)</a> claim fails for the same reasons.
<P>

87	That then, it seems to me, disposes of notice of contentions paragraph
14(d).
<P>

88	There is no substance in the contentions set out in paragraph 14(c).  The
document at Tab 51 was a clear concession by Exxon
in formal terms to the
effect that Exxon did not hold a Certificate of Practical Completion under the
head contract.  That document
was relied upon by the Arbitrator in paragraph
H6.  The reasoning in paragraph H7 is unexceptional.  No manifest error is
involved
in the Arbitrator's holding that the letter of 11 December 1989 did
not constitute a Certificate of Practical Completion.  The contra
proferentem
rule was applied requiring that Exxon comply strictly with its obligations in
relation to the notice provision.  In any
event here again, there is no evident
or obvious error of law.  At highest, Exxon may have exposed a matter capable
of argument.
 In my view, Exxon has not exposed an obvious nor manifest error
of law in the sense that there was little or no doubt that error
it was.  The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(ii)</a> claim fails for the same reasons.
<P>

89	In relation to paragraph 14(j) of the contentions, I accept Chadtech's
submission that the question propounded by Exxon requires
a consideration of
the letter of 20 June 1988 from Chadtech to Exxon, which must be viewed in the
context of the evidence tendered
in the proceedings, including in particular
the evidence of Mr Henderson which described in detail the delays which were
occasioned
in the progress of the works and the correspondence between Exxon
and Chadtech regarding those delays.  The letter, I accept, cannot
be viewed in
isolation.  Chadtech had made a previous claim for delay on 28 January 1988.
Between 2 May 1988 and 20 July 1988, the
defendant had no labour on site and
during that time apparently attended numerous site meetings in respect of the
delay.  The letter
is said to have been sent in circumstances where Chadtech
was off-site and an end to the delays were not within sight.  In the
circumstances,
Chadtech was alerting Exxon to delays which had begun almost
eleven months previously and had not improved.  In that letter, Chadtech
expressed its intention to claim in respect of future delays.
<P>

90	I accept Chadtech's submission that the notice given by it could not be
described as speculative, as it related to delays which
had been continuing for
some time and which had not been resolved.  I accept that whilst there was a
range of delays caused by a
range of events (bringing Chadtech within the scope
of the relevant clause 47 time limitation), those delays were not unrelated,
to
the extent that they all concerned access to the site and the progress of other
sub-contractors at the site.  To this extent,
the notice could not be said to
be unfairly speculative in the sense that it related to events not within the
contemplation of the
parties at the time.
<P>

91	In this regard to my mind, Exxon has not made good its proposition that
there is a manifest error of law on the face of the records.
 If the Arbitrator
erred in relation to the providence of the notice, the error is to my mind not
obvious and is at best weakly arguable.
<P>

92	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(50(b)(ii)</a> claim fails for the same reasons.
<P>

	<b>Notice of Contentions - Paragraph 14(a)</b>
<P>

93	Exxon's submission that the Arbitrator erred in law in that he ought to have
concluded that the works programme was meaningless,
only has to be stated to be
dismissed.  Notwithstanding the closely reasoned argument put to the Arbitrator
and to the Court with
respect to the matter raised in contentions paragraph
14(a), I have no difficulty whatever in accepting the Arbitrator's reasoning,
which to my mind, firmly and justifiably rejected as totally misconceived,
Exxon's proposition that its formal updated construction
programme was
meaningless in contractual terms.  One only has to read paragraphs 5.13 and
following of Exxon's submissions of 12
August 1998 behind Tab 65, to see how
empty Exxon's argument is.  That argument was to the effect that its
construction programmes
issued in December 1987, August 1988 and October 1988,
were meaningless.  The submission that `in truth there was no deviation from
any programme as there was not a meaningful programme to deviate from' only has
to be stated to, it seems to me, to be rejected.
 Far from being persuaded that
there was a manifest error of law in the Arbitrator's reasoning in this regard,
to my mind the Arbitrator's
reasoning was correct.  If I be wrong in this
regard, Exxon has failed dismally in terms of the very high test which the
above described
authorities pose for its success under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5).</a>
<P>

94	I further accept as correct Chadtech's submission that the determination of
whether the works programme was included in the contract
was meaningless
involved, or involves at least in important degree, the determination of a
question of fact.
<P>

95	There is plainly evidence that a works programme was included in the
programme documents.  Hence the finding of the Arbitrator
was based on evidence
tendered in the Arbitration.  The Arbitrator  found (in light of the evidence
of the issuing of revised construction
programmes by Exxon), that  this works
programme was a programme under the contract.  It was common ground that Exxon
did not during
the Arbitration tender any evidence in support of its contention
that it had resiled from or had abandoned the works programme included
in the
contract as being the works programme.  Exxon seeks  to rely solely upon the
commencement date of the works in support of
its contention that the works
programme was meaningless.
<P>

96	Exxon's central submission is that the works programme was meaningless and
should be disregarded by reason of the facts that:
<P>

	<i>(a)	the works programme (which was included in the plaintiff's 	invitation
to tender dated 5 May 1987) showed</i>
<P>

<i>		(i)	work commencing on 20 July 1987 and</i>
<P>

<i>		(b)	work proceeding during the period 20 July to 17 August 			1987.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	Exxon awarded the contract to Chadtech by letter of 	acceptance dated
13 August 1987</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the contract showed that the anticipated date of commencement of 	work
was17 August 1987</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> sub-section 2.1 clause 13(2) required Chadtech to submit its
construction programme to the plaintiff within 7 days of the letter
	of
acceptance</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	the letter of acceptance was issued subject to the works 			programme
being adjusted to suit the overall co-ordination 	programme"</i>
<P>

97	Exxon's contention is that Chadtech did not 
<P>

	<i>(a)	adjust the works programme, to suit the overall co-ordination
programme as contemplated by the letter of acceptance</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	submit its construction programme to Exxon as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 	2</a>
sub-section 2.1, clause 13(2)</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	otherwise submit a construction programme to the plaintiff</i>
<P>

<i>	with the result that there was never any construction programme for the
purposes of cl 29(b) of the contract.</i>
<P>

98	Exxon has not made good the proposition that the Arbitrator erred in
relation to his construction and interpretation of the works
programme included
in the contract.  Exxon's claim falls very far short of the requirement that
there be error of law in the face
of the award  by way of something evident or
obvious rather than arguable.  If error there was at law, it does not seem to
me that
it was manifest.  It was neither plain in the sense of being obvious
nor was it manifest in the sense that there was little or no
doubt that error
it was.
<P>

99	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38(5)(b)(ii)</a> claim fails for the same reasons.
<P>

	<b>Notice of Contentions - Paragraph 14(e)</b>
<P>

100	The determination of whether Chadtech incurred extra cost as a result of
deviations directed by Exxon pursuant to clause 29(b)
of the Contract involved
the determination of a question of fact.
<P>

101	The arbitrator found that the letters dated 21 December 1997, 22 June 1988,
26 August 1988 and 13 September 1988 constituted
directed deviations from the
contract works programme.  The arbitrator found that extra cost was incurred by
the defendant as a consequence
of the delay to the progress of the works:  see
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/index.html#p50" class="autolink_findacts">Part L</a> of the award;  the evidence of Mr Blumer;  the evidence of Mr Henderson
and the evidence of Mr Davidson.  It was admitted by the
plaintiff that there
were substantial delays in the completion of the works.
<P>

102	I do not accept that clause 29(f) of the contract should be construed in
the limited manner in which the plaintiff has construed
it.  There is no clear
limitation in that clause to the entitlement to extra cost, only in
circumstances where the order of the works
has been changed.  The clause is
capable of including costs which are incurred by the delay of works to a later
date.
<P>

103	If there is any error, there is no manifest error of law.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
38(5)(b)(ii)</a> claim fails for the same reasons.
<P>

	<b>Discretionary Considerations</b>
<P>

104	There is a further discretionary consideration of relevance in relation to
the plaintiff's construction claims earlier dealt
with.  Evidence was given by
Mr C.P. Pudig, a partner of Clayton Utz since July 1993 and prior to that, a
partner of both Minter
Ellison and Morris Fletcher Cross.  Mr Pudig has
practised almost exclusively in the area of construction law for over sixteen
years.
<P>

105	Mr Pudig deposed that in his experience, the use of the standard form
contract NPWC3 (1981) and its associated sub-contracts
SCNPWC3 (1981)
throughout the construction industry has diminished to the extent that it is
almost no longer in use at all.  Mr Pudig
deposed that as indicated by its
title, the standard form was drafted approximately eighteen years ago.  His
evidence was that NPWC3
(1981) was a contract that was one of two contracts
used predominantly by government instrumentalities in the early to mid-1980s.
In Mr Pudig's experience, the standard forms of contract predominantly used in
the construction industry today, particularly by government
instrumentalities,
are AS2124-1986 (with the associated sub-contract AS2545-1987) and AS2124-1992
(with the associated sub-contract
AS2545-1993).  Further on, Mr Pudig's
evidence, AS400-1997 (with the associated sub-contract AS4901-1998) is the most
recent edition
of the AS series of standard form terms and conditions.
<P>

106	Mr Pudig's evidence was that the provisions of the AS series of standard
form contracts and sub-contracts relating to the issues
which concern the
dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant in these proceedings, are
significantly different from those which
appeared in NPWC3 (1981) and the
associated SCNPWC3 (1981).
<P>

107	Mr Pudig gave further evidence that another standard form contract used
commonly is the JCC (versions D, E and F) 1994.  This
standard form contract,
he said, was developed by the Joint Contract Committee, the constituent bodies
of which are :
<P>

	(a)	The Royal Australian Institute of Architects,
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	Master Builders of Australia Incorporated,
<P>

<i>	</i>(c)	The Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia
Limited.
<P>

108	Mr Pudig's evidence was that the JCC form of contract (versions D, E and F)
have been in use in the construction industry since
1994.  His evidence was
that the provisions of those standard form of contracts are also significantly
different from the provisions
relevant to the dispute between the plaintiff and
the defendant.
<P>

109	In Mr Pudig's view, the meaning of and the relationship between the
particular clauses in issue in these proceedings would not
add, and was not
likely to add, substantially to certainty in the area of construction law.
<P>

110	Mr B. Casey, solicitor for the plaintiff in his responsive affidavit,
accepted that the NPWC edition 3 and SCNPWC edition 3
are not used as
extensively as they were prior to the introduction of Australian Standard
2124-1996, but his evidence was that they
are still used in the construction
industry.
<P>

111	Plainly, each contract must be construed in its terms and subtle
variations, may lead to very different interpretations.  It
seems to me that
there is substance in the defendant's submission that an important factor to
take into account as a discretionary
consideration in rejecting leave to
appeal, is that the dispute arises out of a contract entered into now in excess
of ten years
ago and in relation to which that form is not used anything like
as extensively as it had previously been used.  A further discretionary
consideration which I take into account in refusing leave, concerns the amounts
in dispute weighed against the costs of the proceedings.
 [See transcript of
argument pages 78 to 79.]
<P>

112	I direct that short minutes of order be brought in and at the same time
costs may be argued.
