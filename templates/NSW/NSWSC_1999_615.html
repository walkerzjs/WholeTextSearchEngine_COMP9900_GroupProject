<P>

<b><u>REMARKS ON SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	Before the Court for sentence is a young girl
who was born on 1 July 1982. The offence in respect of which she stands for
sentence
was committed on or about 12 March 1997. She was aged, therefore, 14
years and not quite 9 months at the time of the offence; and
she is now aged a
few days short of 17 years. She is, therefore, and was at all material times, a
"child" as defined in the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings Act) 1987</a></b>. The
provisions of that Act are, therefore, applicable to the present proceedings.
Having regard to the provisions of section 11
of that Act, I propose to refer
to her either by her initials or as "the young person". I take note of, and
draw attention to, the
provisions of section 11(1) and (5) of the Act.
<P>

2  	On 19 March 1999 the young person was arraigned before Barr J of
this Court sitting at Lismore. There was presented against
her an indictment
charging that on or about 12th March 1997 she had been an accessory after the
fact to a murder, on or about 9 March
1997 and at Casino, by one Adam John
Bowhay of one Steven Lindsay Jarvis. The young person pleaded guilty upon such
arraignment,
and Barr J recorded, accordingly, judgment of conviction. His
Honour remanded the young person for sentence to this Court on Thursday
last 18
June instant. For administrative reasons the Court was not able to deal with
the matter until Friday last 19 June instant,
when the Court heard all
necessary evidence and submissions in connection with sentence.
<P>

3  	The young person was arrested on 20 March 1997. She was
thereafter in custody until 21 April 1997 when she was admitted to bail
by a
Judge of this Court. Thereafter, and until today, the young person has been at
liberty on conditional bail. The bail conditions
as originally set are in
evidence as Exhibit 2 in the proceedings on sentence. It is not necessary to
refer to their fine detail,
it being sufficient to understand that they were,
in comparative terms, onerous conditions, and that the young person has
complied
strictly with them throughout the period of her liberty on bail.
<P>

4  	The relevant objective facts can be stated shortly, and in terms
drawn substantially from a lengthy recorded interview between
the investigating
police and the young person, which interview took place on 21 March 1997 at
Wangaratta in Victoria.
<P>

5  	It thus appears that in March 1997, and for a period of about 8
months previously, the young person had been in what is described
these days
conventionally, if somewhat euphemistically, as a "relationship" with the
previously mentioned Adam Bowhay. He was then
aged about 19 years, and she was
then aged, as I have earlier noted, somewhat less than 15 years. They were both
described in various
of the submissions put to the Court on Friday last as
having been, at the material times, "out of control". I think that is an
entirely
appropriate description of their then situation.
<P>

6  	It seems that they had travelled together to Byron Bay where they
had stolen a car in which they had driven through Beaudesert
to Kyogle in order
to visit a friend of R.A.F. Having spent a night at the home of the friend,
they set off again, but the vehicle
in which they were travelling broke down,
and so they hitch-hiked to Casino. They had very little in the way of money or
other possessions;
they were not familiar with Casino; and the time at which
they were dropped off in Casino was in the vicinity of 9.00 pm to 9.30
pm. They
were sitting outside the Commonwealth Bank in Casino and contemplating, as I
infer, what their next moves might be. It was
then that the eventual victim,
the late Mr. Jarvis, came upon the scene. Mr. Jarvis apparently lived alone in
a room at the Commercial
Hotel in Casino. When he came upon the young person
and Adam Bowhay, he was apparently intoxicated. He invited R.A.F. and Bowhay
to
have a drink with him, and they agreed to do so. They went in company to the
Oxford Hotel in Casino, where they had something
to drink, and where they
socialised for a time. It seems that Bowhay and R.A.F. told Mr. Jarvis that
they were without accommodation,
and that they were looking to sleep in a park.
He asked whether they would like to come back to his room at the Commercial
Hotel,
and that is what happened. In Mr. Jarvis' room, the three of them appear
to have had some desultory conversation for a time. According
to the young
person, and perhaps significantly in the light of what subsequently occurred,
Mr. Jarvis:
<P>

"........ was talking about, saying, saying I'm his baby, I'm his baby, I'm his
baby not Adam's baby, and that, saying me and Adam
were clowns. Um - what else?
Nothin' much else. Just about, you know, just saying, How long have youse been
goin' out for and that."
<P>

7  	Eventually, although it is not clear at whose particular
instigation, it was agreed that the three of them would go for a walk
to a
nearby park. They did so, and at or in the near vicinity of the park a fight
broke out between Mr. Jarvis and Adam Bowhay. What
happened, put shortly, was
that Adam Bowhay bashed and stabbed Mr. Jarvis to death in the most appallingly
brutal fashion. According
to R.A.F., she did not actually see the killing, she
then being some five or so metres distant from the two men, and deliberately
ignoring the progress of the fight between them. That there was in fact a fight
going on between the two men was certainly known
to her: <i>first</i>, because
she heard Mr. Jarvis crying out to Bowhay not to hurt him; and <i>secondly</i>,
because, at one point during the fight, she saw Mr. Jarvis <i>"spinnin' around
........... just like, um, like you look like when you get punched in the
head.............. and spin around"</i>. 
<P>

8  	The young person and Bowhay subsequently left the scene of the
killing and returned to Mr. Jarvis' room, from which they stole
a travel bag
and some $12.50 in money. They hitch-hiked thereafter from Casino to a small
town called Whiporie; and from Whiporie
to Wauchope, where they stole another
motor vehicle and travelled down to the Central Coast. They there visited
R.A.F's mother and
uncle. The uncle showed R.A.F. a newspaper report of the
death of Mr. Jarvis. According to R.A.F., this was the first knowledge she
had
that Mr. Jarvis had not only been bashed, but had been killed, by Adam Bowhay.
R.A.F's uncle gave her some money which she in
turn passed on to Bowhay to use
in order to buy petrol for the car that he and she were then using, and
cigarettes. 
<P>

9  	R.A.F. and Bowhay thereafter travelled to Victoria where,
eventually, they were arrested and extradited to this State.
<P>

10  	As I have earlier stated, but the fact will bear repeating, the
killing of Mr. Jarvis was a callous and brutal crime. Adam
Bowhay was brought
to trial in December 1998 upon a charge of having murdered Mr. Jarvis. He
pleaded not guilty, and appears to have
based his defence, essentially, upon
diminished responsibility in the sense recognised by section 23A of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b>. On 4 December 1998 the jury at trial returned a verdict
finding him guilty as charged. He was sentenced by Dunford J on 17 December
1998 to penal servitude for 23 years, made up of a minimum term of 16 years and
an additional term of 7 years.
<P>

11  	It is, therefore, clear that the accessorial crime to which
R.A.F. had pleaded guilty was ancillary to a principal crime of
great objective
criminality. If one accepts her own version of events, - as I am disposed to
do, there being no evidence to the contrary,
- she did not realise until some
time after the event that Adam Bowhay had not only bashed Mr. Jarvis, but had
in fact bashed and
stabbed him to death. It is true that R.A.F's own actual
assistance to him does not seem to have extended beyond obtaining some material
assistance from her uncle; and thereafter assisting and encouraging Bowhay in
the sense that she continued to give him the support
and encouragement of a
continuing "relationship". These were positive acts of assistance; they tended
to assist Bowhay to avoid justice;
it is clear, as the plea of guilty itself
acknowledges, that such was R.A.F.'s intention, she then knowing that what Adam
Bowhay
had done to Mr. Jarvis extended beyond an assault to an actual
killing.
<P>

12  	I emphasise these matters because, as will appear presently,
R.A.F's particular situation has about it subjective features
of a very
compelling kind; and they must be brought to proper account as the law
requires. That makes it all the more important to
ensure that nobody, and
particularly not R.A.F. herself, runs away with the idea that what she herself
did is not, in purely objective
terms, particularly serious. An accessory after
the fact to a crime of murder is liable, by reason of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s349.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
349(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b>, to a maximum penalty of penal servitude
for 25 years. That provision makes unmistakably clear the gravity with which
Parliament,
as representative of the community at large, regards the offence
for which R.A.F. is now to be sentenced.
<P>

13  	The statutory provisions to which I have just referred have a
direct bearing upon the applicability in principle, and the application
in
fact, of the ameliorative provisions of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act 1987</a></b>, in the case of a person convicted of having been an accessory
after the fact to a murder. Such an accessorial offence is a <i>"serious
indictable offence"</i> as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal
Proceedings) Act</a></b>. That being so, the offender is required, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> of
that Act, to be <i>"dealt with according to law"</i>. Of course, that does not
entail that the entirety of the ameliorative provisions of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children
(Criminal Proceedings) Act</a></b> is withdrawn from an offender who has committed
a <i>"serious indictable offence"</i>; and, in particular and importantly for
present purposes, the general principles that are stated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> of that
Act continue to apply. It follows, therefore, that this Court is obliged, when
exercising its present jurisdiction in R.A.F's
case, to have regard to those
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> principles, which are stated in the following terms:
<P>

"(a)	That children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those
enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard,
and a right to
participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them;
<P>

(b)	That children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions
but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity,
require guidance and
assistance;
<P>

(c)	That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or
employment of a child to proceed without interruption;
<P>

(d)	That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his
or her own home; 
<P>

(e)	That the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater
than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence
of the same kind."
<P>

14  	As I have previously said, the subjective features of the young
person's case are compelling. In summarising them as follows,
I rely in large
part upon the pre-sentence report prepared by Mrs. Cheryl Latu, a Juvenile
Justice Counsellor with the Central Coast
office of Juvenile Justice Community
Services. That report is in evidence as Exhibit 1 in the proceedings on
sentence. The contents
of the report were supplemented by oral evidence from
Mrs. Latu. I found Mrs. Latu a convincing witness, and I accept her evidence.
The whole of that material is supplemented further by some brief evidence that
was given by R.A.F. herself. It was brief, and not
particularly articulate,
evidence; but I accept it in the terms in which it was given.
<P>

15  	As previously noted, the young person is at present aged not
quite 17 years. Her personal history to date has been a sadly
troubled one. Her
natural father was killed in a road accident when she was aged only 1 year.
Thereafter, her widowed mother's own
domestic situation was itself unstable and
productive of real problems for the young person as she moved into adolescence.
The sad,
although not surprising, results of this personal and domestic
instability were of a kind with which the Court is all too familiar:
a general
deterioration of personal behaviour; a virtually complete breakdown in personal
discipline; a wilful rebellion against
all forms of authority, whether in the
home or at school; and a steady drift into the orbit of an unsavoury peer
group. When R.A.F.
was aged about 13 years, she experienced an incident of
sexual abuse by a stranger; and this reinforced, not surprisingly, the other
personal and societal problems to which I have referred.
<P>

16  	Since her arrest and subsequent admission to bail, R.A.F. has
attempted, with a great deal of assistance from the Juvenile
Justice
authorities and with some success, to rehabilitate and to stabilise her
personal situation. She has broken off her "relationship"
with Adam Bowhay. She
has established a home of her own with another young man, of whom the Court
knows nothing except that they
seem to have established a reasonably stable
home; that they have a baby son born in December 1998 and to whom they are
both, apparently,
devoted; and that she has active and useful support from her
mother and from her paternal grandparents and maternal grandmother.
<P>

17  	R.A.F. has not had much in the way of stable employment in the
past; but she has had some such employment, and she appears
to have been well
motivated and diligent in it. She is conscious of her lack of education, and is
both willing and able to do what
she can in order to improve that position. In
that regard she has been counselled and supported by the Juvenile Justice
authorities;
and she appears both to have made some worthwhile progress in the
past, and to have in a real sense future prospects of continuing
that
progress.
<P>

18  	R.A.F pleaded guilty, as I accept, at the first available
opportunity; and she is entitled, in accordance with well established
principle, to proper consideration in that regard. She has criminal
antecedents; but I do not regard them as having significant adverse
weight in
the present sentencing context. I am satisfied, - although I say it in a spirit
of cautious optimism rather than of unqualified
conviction, - that she is not
likely to commit in the future serious breaches of the law.
<P>

19  	I have not found it easy to bring into what I regard as a just
and proper balance the objective and the subjective matters
to which I have
earlier herein referred. I do not regard R.A.F's offence as being at all an
insubstantial offence in terms of its
objective criminality. A person who gives
comfort and encouragement to a known killer to the end of assisting that person
to escape
his just desserts, does something that has the potential to subvert
the proper maintenance of the rule of law, the paramount objective
of which
must always be to maintain the sanctity of human life. 
<P>

20  	It is, however, the case that no Court can fail to be conscious
of the extreme youth of R.A.F; and to be conscious, therefore,
of the need to
be properly concerned not to deal with her on the present occasion in a way so
heavy-handed as to negate her prospects,
which I think to be real and
substantial prospects, of rehabilitation. Nor am I unmindful of the situation
of R.A.F's  baby. It is
no easy thing to deal now with R.A.F in such a fashion
as would entail of necessity that that little child would spend some of its
most important formative years deprived of the nurture, in a stable domestic
environment, of his own mother. 
<P>

21  	I have come to the conclusion that it would be proper, in the
circumstances as I have previously outlined them of this particular
case, to
deal with R.A.F in the manner for which provision is made by section 558 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></b>. Such course seems to me to have the following proper
advantages: <i>first</i>, it respects the integrity of the conviction actually
recorded by Barr J on 19 March last; <i>secondly</i>, it affords R.A.F every
proper opportunity and encouragement to break with her past and to make
something worthwhile of her future;
and <i>thirdly</i>, it leaves open as a
real, - and it is to be hoped, an effective, - sanction the imposition of a
gaol sentence in the event that
R.A.F throws away the opportunity thus given to
her by the Court.
<P>

22  	I order, therefore, and pursuant to section 558 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act 1900</a> (NSW)</b>, that the passing of sentence upon R.A.F be deferred, and
that she be released upon her entering into a recognisance , without sureties,
and in the amount of $500, to be of good behaviour for a period of 4 years from
today's date, and to come up for sentence at any
time within that period if so
required by the Court. The recognisance to which the order refers is subject to
the following conditions:
<P>

1.	The young person is to accept throughout the entire period of the
recognisance the supervision and counselling of the Juvenile
Justice Community
Services branch of the Department of Juvenile Justice.
<P>

2.	The young person is to attend from time to time, as may be required by any
Juvenile Justice Counsellor who is assigned to supervise
her case, such
counselling as may be required by such Counsellor.
<P>

3.	The young person is to take part, participating in every reasonable way, in
any group or other programme nominated by such Counsellor.
<P>

4.	The young person is to reside at such place or places as may be either
directed or approved from time to time,by such Counsellor.
<P>

5.	The young person is to undertake with all reasonable diligence any
educational, or vocational training, course nominated by such
Counsellor. 
<P>

6.	The young person is to have such contacts as may be required by her
Counsellor with any appropriate community worker or social
worker in connection
with the planning and the implementation of any community-based-plan designed
for her.
<P>

7.	The young person will work, in cooperation with and under the supervision of
her Juvenile Justice Counsellor, with any District
Officer from the Department
of Community Services who shall be assigned to assist the young person in the
proper parental care of
her son.
<P>

8	The conditions of the recognisance are not to be altered, attenuated or
suspended, except by the prior order of a Judge of this
Court, or of a higher
Court.
