WOOD CJ at CL
<P>

FRIDAY 12 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

THE PROTHONOTARY  v  JOHN WILSON
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  When the matter was before me last for sentence, I
neglected to deal with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>, which
has been brought to my attention.
<P>

2  	PRISONER:  Speak up, please.
<P>

3  	HIS HONOUR:  The reasons for the order, I think, were otherwise
obvious, but in order to be clear about it, I will state that
in accordance
with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>, I specify that I have
imposed fixed term sentences for the two offences of contempt of which the
defendant has been convicted, rather
than sentences offering the opportunity
for release on parole, because of his refusal to acknowledge the criminality
involved in
the throwing of paint bombs at a judicial officer.  In the absence
of any sign of contrition or of insight on his part into the wrongness
of his
conduct and in the presence of his belligerent defiance of the Court, it is
evident that no purpose whatsoever will be served
by a period of supervised
release on parole and, accordingly, in the imposition of a sentence structured
so as to include a minimum
and an additional term.  The court will now
adjourn.
<P>
