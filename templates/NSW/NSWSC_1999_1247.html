<b>4827/97 - PECE (PETER) SITNOVSKI &amp; 1 OR v NADA TRPKOSKI - AKA NANCY
DIMEJON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is a family property dispute with respect to
the beneficial ownership of 49 Angle Road, Leumeah (`the Leumeah
property').
Pece (Peter) Sitnovski, the first plaintiff, and his mother Sofia Sitnovski,
the second plaintiff, claim a declaration
by summons filed on 20 November 1997
that the defendant Nada Trpkoski, their sister and daughter respectively (also
known as Nancy
Dimejon), holds any interest she may have in the Leumeah
property in trust for them jointly and that they alone are entitled to be
the
registered proprietors of the property. In the alternative they say that the
defendant is estopped from asserting that she has
any interest in the Leumeah
property.
<P>

2  	By her cross-claim filed on 24 April 1998 the defendant asserts
that she is entitled to a one-third interest in the Leumeah
property and seeks
an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW) for the appointment of
a trustee for sale.
<P>

3  	The facts relevant to this unfortunate dispute begin in 1974,
when the second plaintiff received $12,500 from the sale of a
property at
Arncliffe which she owned with her former husband.  On 5 October 1976 the first
and second plaintiffs purchased a home
unit at 20/31 Villiers Street, Rockdale
for $22,500, settlement occurring on 10 December 1976.  The second plaintiff's
$12,500 was
applied towards the purchase price, and the balance was borrowed by
the first and second plaintiffs on mortgage from the Commonwealth
Bank, secured
over the Rockdale unit.  The first plaintiff made no cash contribution at the
time of purchase, but he and his mother
say that he contributed to the mortgage
payments from his wages at various jobs (about which there is evidence), and I
accept that
this was likely.  The vendors of the Rockdale unit were the
defendant and her then husband, who sold it in order to move into a larger
home.
<P>

4  	The defendant's marriage ended and in 1979 she moved back into
the Rockdale unit with the first and second plaintiffs.  She
brought her
daughter, Adriana, born in 1972, with her.  The defendant says she contributed
two-thirds of her wages to the family
finances during the period after she
moved into the Rockdale unit.  I shall return to this claim.
<P>

5  	On 17 June 1979 the first plaintiff married Nikolina Nasarouski,
and later that year the plaintiffs sold the Rockdale unit,
settlement taking
place on 20 February 1980.  The Rockdale unit was sold for $43,750.  The
balance of the proceeds of sale after
discharging the mortgage to the
Commonwealth Bank was about $32,000, according to the first plaintiff.  The
proceeds of sale were
deposited into a joint savings account of the first and
second plaintiffs with the Commonwealth Bank, account number 43133 (the first
account).  The evidence shows that there were deposits of $27,050.94 and
$2,762.50 into that account on 22 and 27 February 1980 respectively.
<P>

6  	The plaintiffs, the defendant and Adriana then moved into a
rented property at Mortdale.  Shortly afterwards the first plaintiff's
marriage
to Nikolina broke down, leading eventually to divorce proceedings.
<P>

7  	In March 1980 the defendant received $16,046.88 from a property
settlement with her former husband.  On 27 March 1980 this money
was paid into
a second joint savings account with the Commonwealth Bank in the names of the
first plaintiff and the defendant, account
number 43333 (the second
account).
<P>

8  	Early in 1980 the plaintiffs and the defendant had discussions
about the acquisition of a family home and possibly also an investment
property.  In about March 1980 the plaintiffs applied to the Commonwealth Bank
for a housing loan, but their application was refused
by letter dated 25 March
1980.  The reason for refusal, according to that letter, was that `average
balances held in accounts are
below normal eligibility'.  On 11 April 1980,
$10,000 was withdrawn from the second account and deposited into the first
account.
The parties are completely in dispute as to the circumstances in which
that transfer occurred, as I shall point out.
<P>

9  	On 19 April 1980 (or perhaps 19 May 1980) a holding deposit was
paid for the acquisition of a property at lot 9 Victoria Place,
Thirlmere
(`Thirlmere property').  Contracts were exchanged for the Thirlmere property on
4 July 1980, and the purchase was settled
on 29 August 1980.  The purchasers
and registered proprietors were the plaintiffs and the defendant as tenants in
common in equal
one-third shares.  The purchase price was $11,200.  $10,709 was
withdrawn from the first account on 13 August 1980, and I infer that
this
withdrawal was for the purpose of providing purchase money for the acquisition
of the Thirlmere property. 
<P>

10  	On about 6 June 1980 a holding deposit was paid for the
acquisition of the Leumeah property.  A further housing loan application
was
made to the Commonwealth Bank, this time by the plaintiffs and the defendant,
and on 30 June 1980 the bank wrote to them indicating
that a housing loan of
$12,500 had been approved on the security of the Leumeah property. Contracts
for the purchase of the Leumeah
property were exchanged on 25 July 1980, and
the purchase was settled on 5 September 1980.  The Leumeah property was
purchased for
$43,000 with approximately $1,500 for stamp duty and costs.  The
purchasers and registered proprietors were the plaintiffs and the
defendant as
tenants in common in equal one-third shares.  
<P>

11  	The plaintiffs say they paid $32,000 towards the purchase price
of the Leumeah property out of the proceeds of sale of the
Rockdale unit, and
that the balance of $12,500 was borrowed from the Commonwealth Bank.  They say
that although the defendant was
a mortgagor to the bank, she did not contribute
to the mortgage repayments and they never intended that she would acquire any
interest
in the Leumeah property.  There is evidence that on 5 September 1980
$26,382 was withdrawn from the first account, and I infer that
this was for
purchase of the Leumeah property.  I also infer that a deposit of approximately
$4,300 was paid on exchange of contracts,
though the evidence does not disclose
the source of that payment.  I shall return to the acquisition of the Leumeah
property because
there are substantial disputes as to the facts relating to
it.
<P>

12  	In November 1980 the first plaintiff was involved in a serious
motor cycle accident and was in hospital for several months,
and unwell for a
substantial period afterwards.
<P>

13  	On 24 September 1981 an application was filed for the
dissolution of the first plaintiff's marriage to Nikolina.  A decree
nisi was
pronounced on 11 November 1981, which became absolute on 12 December 1981.  The
plaintiff executed a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 87</a> deed on 30 April 1982, pursuant to the terms of which
he paid Nikolina the sum of $6,000 by way of property settlement.
<P>

14  	The Thirlmere property was sold in 1985 for net proceeds of sale
of approximately $21,000, and the defendant received that
amount.  She says
that she subsequently gave $7,000 to each plaintiff out of those proceeds.  The
plaintiffs deny this.  The first
plaintiff says he `signed over' his one-third
interest to the defendant.  The defendant says they agreed that she could keep
the
proceeds of sale of the Thirlmere property if she would give the plaintiffs
her share in the Leumeah property.  She says that the
first plaintiff changed
his mind and she then paid out the plaintiffs' shares.  
<P>

15  	In 1984 the first plaintiff borrowed $15,000 from the ANZ Bank
to start up a business.  Repayments were made by a company Alimtim
Pty Limited,
of which the first plaintiff is a director.  The defendant made no contribution
to the repayments but she consented
to a mortgage over the Leumeah property
which was granted as security for the loan.
<P>

16  	Relations between the first plaintiff and the defendant broke
down in about 1982.  It appears that the trigger was a dispute
between them
about another bank account which was in his name in trustee for Adriana.  He
withdrew an amount (either $150 or $200)
from that account to purchase car
tyres, but says that he intended to pay it back.  The defendant found out about
the withdrawal
and objected to it, and instructed a solicitor who wrote a
letter of demand. She says that the first plaintiff assaulted her violently
in
the course of an argument about the bank account.  He denies that the assault
occurred.  On balance, it appears to me likely there
was an assault, since
Adriana has given evidence recollecting it, and the fact is that the defendant
ceased living with the plaintiffs
at about that time.  The defendant was
spending some time with her boyfriend in that period, but it seems to me likely
that she left
because of her brother's behaviour rather than to be with her
boyfriend.  
<P>

17  	The relationship between the first plaintiff and the defendant
has clearly not improved over the intervening years.  She claims
that he
assaulted her again in 1987 and 1989, and he admits the assault on the last
occasion, for which he was charged and convicted.
 He says that she did not
claim any interest in the Leumeah property until 1997, when he and his mother
wished to dispose of it,
and seeks to raise the inference that she made her
claim out of spite.  But I accept her evidence that after the assaults she was
concerned for her safety.
<P>

18  	The second plaintiff appears to have sided with her son and
against her daughter throughout the period of their antagonism,
and clearly
does so now.  However, the evidence on this is not entirely clear.  In 1987 the
second plaintiff herself made an application
for an apprehended violence order
against her son.  The first plaintiff's evidence is that the defendant coerced
the second plaintiff
to sign the papers for the application, but that seems to
me to be very unlikely. In any event, the application was subsequently
withdrawn.
<P>

19  	I have indicated during my narration of the facts that there are
some very material matters which are in dispute. The documentary
evidence of
the relevant events is thin and  incomplete.  The evidence includes some
correspondence in respect of the acquisition
of the Leumeah property, with the
Commonwealth Bank and the solicitors who acted for the purchasers at the time,
and also the passbooks
for the two bank accounts.  Also in evidence are
documents with respect to the divorce proceedings between the first plaintiff
and
Nikolina, and documents relating to the defendant's income during the
period from 1979 to 1982.  These various documents, considered
together, do not
give any clear picture of the events to which they relate, but they do serve to
contradict parts of the accounts
given by the parties in their oral evidence.
In the result, they force me to conclude that parts of the oral evidence of the
plaintiffs
and the defendant are untrue.
<P>

20  	As far as the plaintiffs are concerned, I must reject their
testimony on the following crucial matters.  First, the first plaintiff
said
that his mother kept control of the first account and that he made withdrawals
from it only occasionally, with permission. 
The second plaintiff says that her
daughter handed her the passbook for the second account after it was used up,
and she subsequently
forgot about it until she found it in her papers while
preparing for the proceedings.  I find the plaintiffs' evidence implausible
and
I reject it.  The account was jointly in their names.  Observing the second
plaintiff in the witness box, I concluded that she
would be an unlikely
controller of the family's finances.  Her English was poor.  She said she did
not know that the second account
was a joint account.  She denied that money
was withdrawn from the first account to pay for the Thirlmere property.  She
could not
remember how much was borrowed from the Commonwealth Bank to pay for
the Leumeah property.  I regard it as much more likely that
as the male of the
family he had a substantial and probably a determinative say with respect to
the money in both the first and the
second accounts. That is consistent with
his influential position, again probably determinative, when it came to
decisions about
the acquisition of property.  His evidence, confirmed by his
mother's, indicates that the decisions to acquire the Thirlmere and
Leumeah
properties were taken by him, whether or not (as is disputed) he inspected the
properties with his sister.<b>  </b>
<P>

21  	Secondly, the first plaintiff's evidence was that he did not
know anything about the second account until his mother discovered
it when
preparing for the present proceedings, and he denies that his sister handed it
over to him in 1980, or that he ever operated
or was able to operate the
account.  Since that was a joint bank account in his and his sister's names, I
find his evidence implausible
and I reject it.  The second account was put in
evidence by the first plaintiff in his affidavit of 22 May 1998.  It is
plausible
that the defendant, opening the account at the time of her divorce
settlement when she was living with the plaintiffs, would make
the account a
joint one between her and the first plaintiff, who (as I have found) was the
family's financial controller.  It is
implausible that she would do so without
giving him access to it or even telling him about it.  It was faintly suggested
in cross-examination
that she did so because her entitlement to social security
would be affected by having the account solely in her name, but there
is no
evidence to support the suggestion.  I conclude that the first plaintiff knew
about the second account from the beginning,
and was able to operate it as a
joint account holder.  
<P>

22  	The defendant says she gave him control of the passbook after
the bank refused the plaintiffs' loan application, and before
the $10,000 was
withdrawn from it.  The plaintiffs deny this.  On balance, I prefer her
evidence to theirs on this point.  The first
plaintiff made major family
decisions for the purchase of property, according to his mother's evidence as
well as the defendant's,
and was (as I have found) the controller of family
finances.  It is plausible that she would have given him control over money
which
she intended to be used for property acquisition, just as she gave him
control over her daughter's trust account. 
<P>

23  	The first plaintiff's evidence about the transfer of the $10,000
from the second to the first account is unconvincing, and
indeed it is very
confused.  At one point he said that the defendant intended to make a gift of
that money to him and his mother
because they had looked after Adriana.
Nevertheless, he said that he put her name on the title to the Thirlmere land
in case she
`changed her mind'.  He appeared to be saying that the Thirlmere
property was to belong beneficially to his sister alone, and that
she was free
to `change her mind' by claiming absolute beneficial ownership (as he said she
eventually did by taking the proceeds
of the sale of the Thirlmere property).
But if it was intended that the Thirlmere property would belong beneficially to
her alone,
it is hard to see how the payment of $10,000 prior to its
acquisition could be said to be a gift.  In any event, I find it totally
implausible that the defendant would have intended to dispose of the $10,000 in
April 1980 by way of gift - as opposed to allowing
her brother to use it for
property acquisition for the family's benefit, and to improve their chances of
success with the bank loan
application.  I reach this conclusion because by
that time she was a single mother with very limited earnings and no other
significant
assets and the $10,000 was the major part of her divorce
settlement. 
<P>

24  	The most unsatisfactory part of the first plaintiff's evidence
related to the beneficial ownership of the Leumeah property.
 He said that he
and his mother and the defendant all intended, at the time of its acquisition,
that the defendant would have no
beneficial interest in that property and the
owners would be the plaintiffs.  Nevertheless, the registered proprietors
became the
plaintiffs and the  defendant in equal one-third shares.  He sought
to explain this outcome in various ways in his written and oral
evidence.  In
his affidavit of 9 March 1998, paragraph 25, he said:
<P>

`My belief at the time [that is just prior to the purchase] was that if I had
half the property under my name my ex-wife would have
a potential claim over my
half share whereas if I only had a third share in my name she only had a
potential claim over that third.
 I never intended that my sister would
actually have an interest in the Property; rather that by having her name on
the title, my
exposure to my ex-wife would be limited.'
<P>

25  	On the face of it, this seems to be an admission of an intention
to defraud the ex-wife, by concealing the first plaintiff's
half share interest
and representing through the registered title that the interest was only a
one-third interest.  When this was
put to him in cross-examination, the first
plaintiff gave a somewhat different explanation of what he claimed to be the
common intention.
 He said that he was, to the knowledge of his mother and his
sister, attempting to keep `his equity the same'.  He referred to having
a half
share in the proceeds of sale of the Rockdale unit, in an amount of about
$16,000.  The implication seems to be that he intended
that his proportionate
interest would remain at the same financial level after the acquisition of the
Leumeah property.  But if this
was his intention, it would have given him not
much more than a one-third interest in the Leumeah property.
<P>

26  	The plaintiffs say that they discussed their intention with the
defendant, but she denies that any such conversation occurred.
 They say they
saw a solicitor who told them to put the defendant's name on the title, but
their evidence about the solicitor's advice
is confused, and the solicitor did
not give evidence.  I find, on balance, that neither conversation occurred.
<P>

27  	It appears to me that the first plaintiff was on the horns of a
dilemma.  Either his intention was to keep his proportionate
interest in the
Leumeah property down (limiting it to an interest representing his half share
in the proceeds of sale of the Rockdale
unit), in which case he cannot now
claim a half interest in the Leumeah property; or his intention was to acquire
a half interest
in the Leumeah property, in which case that interest should
have been disclosed and taken into account in the property settlement
with his
ex-wife.  In fact he appears to have attempted to straddle two inconsistent
positions.  As far as his ex-wife was concerned,
he admitted only to having a
one-third interest in the Leumeah property.  This can be seen in his affidavit
in the Family Law proceedings,
in which he said that the Leumeah property was
acquired by himself, his mother and sister as tenants in common in equal
shares, and
in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 87</a> deed, which recites that he is registered as tenant in
common as to a one-third interest in the Leumeah property.  To assert, as
he
does in the present proceedings, that he is entitled to a one half interest,
but that he placed the legal title in three names
as tenants in common in equal
one-third shares in order to keep his equity the same, is either to deny the
truth of his earlier evidence
or to admit to an intention to defraud his
ex-wife.
<P>

28  	Taking all this into consideration, my view is that the first
plaintiff is not to be trusted in any of his evidence, and that
I should treat
his evidence with suspicion unless it is corroborated by independent oral
evidence or documents.
<P>

29  	The second plaintiff gave evidence through an interpreter.  Her
evidence suffered from the same inconsistencies as the first
plaintiff's.  In
my view her evidence was mostly derivative of his.  I regard it as  unreliable
in the same way.
<P>

30  	Regrettably, there are also some inconsistencies in the
defendant's evidence.  Her affidavit evidence about the first defendant's
employment history was wrong, as she conceded in cross-examination.  When she
swore her first affidavit on 20 April 1998 it appears
that she did not have
access to the deposit book for the second account.  Photocopies of the relevant
pages were provided only in
the first plaintiff's affidavit of 22 May 1998.  In
her affidavit of 20 April 1998 she claimed that she signed withdrawal forms on
the second account when asked by the plaintiffs to do so, but this seems
unlikely given that the account was a joint account with
the first plaintiff.
She also claimed that she made a financial contribution to the plaintiffs
between 1979 and 1982 of two-thirds
of her net wages from permanent full time
work with Pacific Private Hospital and then with the Department of Health.  She
said her
gross income was $12,500 to $15,500 per year.  In fact documentary
evidence adduced by the plaintiff indicates that the defendant
received a
widow's class A pension during the period from December 1979 to the end of
1982, and she admitted in cross-examination
that she was unemployed in 1979 and
until May 1980.  She worked full time for six weeks from late May 1980 and
thereafter part time
until October that year.  From October 1980 she deposited
into the second account $160.20 per fortnight, which was probably her social
security payment, although in her oral evidence she claimed that her social
security payments went into a separate account of her
own.  I conclude that she
did not receive the amount of money she alleges and did not make payments of
the amounts which she claims
to have paid to the plaintiffs.  It appears to me
likely that she made some contributions to family's income throughout the time
during which she was living with the plaintiffs with her daughter, but her
level of earnings was relatively low and it is impossible
to determine, on the
evidence, the amount contributed.  
<P>

31  	During 1980 the plaintiffs and the defendant planned and
executed the purchases of the Thirlmere and Leumeah properties.  I
cannot say,
on the evidence, that the defendant's contributions from her income were
towards living expenses or towards the purchase
money for either property.  The
most likely inference, which is supported by the defendant's oral evidence and
which I accept on
balance, is that she contributed to a pool of income which
was used partly for living expenses, partly towards the purchase money
for the
properties, and partly towards rent before the Leumeah property was acquired
and towards mortgage repayments thereafter.
 It appears that one stage there
was an intention, at least on the plaintiffs' part, to use some of the family's
money to acquire
property in their names alone, although the defendant would be
allowed to live on the property.  But after the bank rejected the
plaintiffs'
loan application, all negotiations were conducted and transactions effected in
the names of the plaintiffs and the defendant,
reflecting the fact that there
were contributions to the family savings by all three family members.
<P>

32  	I prefer the defendant's evidence to the first plaintiff's with
respect to the withdrawal and deposit of the $10,000, though
her evidence is
not entirely clear.  For the reasons set out above, I have found that she did
not make a gift of the money, but put
the first plaintiff in control of it for
the acquisition of property.  It appears to me to be likely that she made the
payment of
$10,000, or (more likely) acquiesced in it being transferred by her
brother, so as to assist the plaintiffs to obtain a housing loan
from the
Commonwealth Bank, who had rejected their application on the ground that the
balance of the account was insufficient.  The
payment was not intended to be a
gift to the plaintiffs.  Nor, seems to me, was the payment intended to be the
provision of the bulk
of the purchase money for the Thirlmere property alone.
Given that the Thirlmere and Leumeah properties were being acquired more
or
less contemporaneously, and that after the payment of $10,000 the defendant
became co-purchaser of the Thirlmere property as tenant
in common in respect of
only a one-third share, it appears to me likely that her intention in making
the payment was to acquire a
one-third interest in both properties.  It appears
to me equally likely, for the reasons which I have given, that the plaintiffs'
intention was that she would acquire a one-third interest in the properties.
Their claim that she was to obtain the absolute beneficial
ownership of the
Thirlmere property and no beneficial interest in the Leumeah property is
contrary to the way in which the properties
were transferred on purchase and is
not supported by any evidence external to the plaintiffs' evidence.  Since the
parties were not
estranged at that time, the most likely construction of their
financial arrangements at the time the $10,000 was transferred was
that they
intended that the properties be acquired out of the pool of family savings in
equal one-third shares.
<P>

33  	For the reasons given earlier, I have accepted the defendant's
evidence that as well as contributing the $10,000, she put the
second account
under the control of the first plaintiff and gave him access to the balance of
proceeds of the account, although by
agreement an amount of about $1,800 was
withdrawn to acquire a car for her.  I therefore infer that she contributed
most of her property
settlement in an amount of about $14,000 to the plaintiffs
for the acquisition of the Leumeah and Thirlmere properties by the three
of
them as tenants in common in equal one-third shares.
<P>

34  	I also accept that the defendant made payments to or for the
benefit of her mother after the properties were acquired, which
would have
indirectly assisted the plaintiffs to make mortgage repayments on the Leumeah
property.  The defendant says she paid approximately
$1,800-$2,400 during the
period from 1982 to 1984.  Given that I have rejected her quantification of her
contribution to family finances
in the period 1979 to 1982, I am not prepared
to accept her estimate of the subsequent contribution.  I therefore find that
she made
financial contributions to her mother during the period from 1982 to
1984 in an amount which cannot be determined on the existing
evidence.  
<P>

35  	On the evidence before me I am unable to say whether, when the
Thirlmere property was sold, the defendant retained  the entire
balance of
proceeds of sale.  It appears that the proceeds were received by her but she
says that this was because of an arrangement
with the plaintiffs that she could
keep the proceeds of sale of the Thirlmere property if she transferred her
interest in the Leumeah
property to them.  She says that her brother changed
his mind about this and then she transferred approximately one-third of the
proceeds, $7,000, to each of the plaintiffs.  I cannot determine on the present
evidence whether that is true.  But since the sale
of the Thirlmere property
occurred well after the acquisition of the Leumeah property, any change of
intention on the part of any
party at that time would not affect my conclusion
as to the parties' intention at the time of the acquisition of the Leumeah
property.
<P>

36  	The plaintiffs say that they made various improvements to the
Leumeah property, for a total cost of $8,720.70.  But there is
no evidence for
the expenditure other than the assertion in the first plaintiff's affidavit,
and no evidence of the intention of
the parties or the surrounding
circumstances when the alleged improvements were made.  I am unable to conclude
that the improvements
were made, nor that if they were, they gave rise to any
augmentation of the proportional beneficial interest of the plaintiffs. 

<P>

37  	In summary, the Leumeah property, which is the subject of the
proceedings, was purchased by the plaintiffs and the defendant
as tenants in
common in equal one-third shares.  My conclusion is that the evidence does not
show any intention on the part of the
plaintiffs at the time of acquisition
that the Leumeah property would be held in any other than one-third shares.  I
reject the plaintiffs'
evidence to the contrary.  The evidence does not show
that the defendant intended anything other than to acquire a one-third share
in
the Leumeah property.  It does not show that the financial contributions to the
acquisition were such that the defendant acquired
her one-third interest on a
resulting trust for the plaintiffs.  The defendant's direct and indirect
contributions to the purchase
of the two properties included the $10,000
transfer, part of the remainder of her $16,046.88 settlement, an unquantifiable
contribution
to family savings, and the mortgaging of her interest to provide
security over the Leumeah property to the Commonwealth Bank, for
its loan of
$12,500 on settlement of the acquisition of that property.  
<P>

38  	There being no evidence pointing to any other outcome, it
appears to me that the legal title to the Leumeah property carries
with it the
beneficial interest, and consequently the defendant is entitled to a one-third
interest in the Leumeah property.
<P>

39  	In the result the plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration
that the defendant holds her interest in the Leumeah property
in trust for
them, or that she is estopped from asserting her one-third interest in that
property.  The summons must, therefore,
be dismissed.  The defendant seeks the
appointment of a trustee for sale under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> by her cross-claim and in the
circumstances of this case my view is that she is entitled to that relief.  I
am prepared to make the
orders which she seeks in paragraphs 1 - 4 of the
cross-claim, but I intend to defer the making of the orders in case the parties
are able to agree upon a mechanism for sale which might avoid the cost of the
appointment of a trustee.
<P>

40  	Since the defendant is successful on the summons and
cross-claim, I am inclined to order that the plaintiffs pay the defendant's
costs of the summons and cross-claim, but I shall give the parties an
opportunity to make submissions on costs if they wish to do
so.
<P>
