MASTER MACREADY
<P>

Wednesday 10 February 1999
<P>

<b>3089 of 1998 ALLSTATE EXPLORATIONS NL &amp; ORS v  BEACONSFIELD GOLD
NL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b> This is a hearing of a Notice of Motion filed by the
defendants on 19 November 1998 seeking that the time fixed by an order made
by
the Court on 12 October 1998 for the defendants to file and serve a further
amended Cross Claim on or before 26 October 1988 be
extended.  On 12 October
1998 Master McLaughlin dealt with an application which was then before him to
strike out paragraphs 29,
30 and 31 of an amended Cross Claim which was filed
on 12 October 1998.  He gave reasons for his decision to strike out those
paragraphs
and gave leave to file a further amended Cross Claim as I have
indicated.
<P>

2		The defendants prepared their Cross Claim and had it ready for filing by 28
October.  However a difference arose between the
defendants and the plaintiffs
on the form of the Cross Claim and, accordingly, it was not filed.  No point is
taken by the plaintiffs
in respect of the late filing of the Cross Claim as
there is no prejudice and, accordingly, the argument before me has been whether
it is appropriate that the latest amended Cross Claim should be filed having
regard to the terms of the paragraphs that have been
inserted to replace
paragraphs 29, 30 and 31 in the previous Cross Claim that had been struck out
by Master McLaughlin on 12 October
1998.
<P>

3		The dispute between the parties concerns a Joint Venture Mining Agreement
made on 19 October 1992.  At the time of entering into
the joint venture
Allstate Prospecting Pty Limited was a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the
plaintiff and had interest in the joint
venture.  In due course there were
various changes in the interests in the joint venture and at the present time
the first plaintiff
controls a 51.51 percent interest in the joint venture
through two subsidiaries, Allstate Prospecting Pty Limited and CAN 070 164
653
Pty Limited.  The remaining 48.49 percent interest in the joint venture is held
by the defendants.  
<P>

4		The Joint Venture Agreement provides for a Management Committee which has
defined functions and there is provision for appointment
of a Manager of the
joint venture.  On 1 May 1994 the first plaintiff commenced acting as a Manager
of the joint venture and has
acted in that capacity since that date.  Although
the Joint Venture Agreement requires that the Manager shall execute a deed
agreeing
to be bound by the Joint Venture Agreement upon appointment, this has
not occurred.  
<P>

5		On 29 June 1998 the defendants gave to the first plaintiff a notice
requiring it to rectify certain failures which it alleged
had occurred.  The
matters in contention concern charging of management fees by the first
plaintiff and charging a mark up for the
use of certain of its employees.  
<P>

6		On 9 July 1998 the first plaintiff commenced proceedings and on 29 July
1998, pursuant to consent orders, filed a Statement of
Claim in which it seeks,
inter alia, a declaration that the notice of 29 June 1998 is not a valid notice
issued pursuant to the Joint
Venture Agreement.
<P>

7		The debate before me has concerned the form of the proposed new amended
Cross Claim which is Exhibit "A" on the hearing of the
motion before me.  In
broad terms the Cross Claim alleges that the first plaintiff owed fiduciary
duties to the defendants in carrying
out its activities as Manager under the
Joint Venture Agreement.  Breaches of these duties are alleged in respect of
the charging
to the joint venture of costs of services of some of the first
plaintiff's employees at a rate greater than that provided for in
the Joint
Venture Agreement and also the payment of management fees to the first
plaintiff.  The Cross Claim seeks restitution damages
or, alternatively,
equitable compensation and other remedies.
<P>

8		On the last occasion before Master McLaughlin the debate centred on a number
of areas.  These included whether the then existing
paragraph 29 of the Cross
Claim asserted sufficient facts to give rise to a fiduciary relationship and
whether it was necessary to
plead that the Manager's actions took place without
the knowledge of or the informed consent of either the defendants or the
Management
Committee created under the Joint Venture Agreement.  The Master
held that paragraph 29 was deficient for reasons to which he referred
and he
also held that the cause of action had as an essential element an absence of
knowledge or informed consent on the part of
the defendants or of the
Management Committee.  Given that there has been a change in the terms of the
pleading it is not necessary
to consider in any detail the earlier pleading
that was before Master McLaughlin.
<P>

9		I turn to the first question which is whether or not the present pleading
contains a pleading of sufficient material facts to
give rise to a fiduciary
relationship between the parties.  The two paragraphs which plead facts which
are said to give rise to the
fiduciary relationship are paragraphs 29 and 30
and these are in the following terms:-
<P>

		"29. By clauses 9.3 and 9.4 of the BMJVA the Manager on behalf of the Joint
Venturers, was bound to carry out Joint Venture Activities
in accordance with
the principles set out in the Management Agreement.
<P>

		30. By clause 2.01 of the Management Agreement (as defined in paragraph 13 of
the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim) the Manager
was bound to manage, supervise
and conduct Joint Venture Activities on behalf of the Joint Venturers in a good
and workmanlike and
cost effective manner."
<P>

10		It is apparent from this pleading that no extraneous facts are relied upon
to give rise to the existence of fiduciary duties.
 The case is plainly put
upon the provisions of the Joint Venture Agreement and the duties on parties
arising under the terms of
that agreement.  There is nothing unusual in this
for, as was observed in <b>United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Bryant Pty
Limited </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d1985%29%20157%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-1985) 157 CLR 1</a> at 11:-
<P>

		"The most that can be said is that whether or not the relationship between
joint venturers is fiduciary will depend upon the form
which the particular
joint venture takes and upon the content of the obligations which the parties
to it have undertaken."
<P>

11		The pleading clearly in articulating the matters giving rise to the
fiduciary duties derives support from a number of standard
formulations of
circumstances in which fiduciary duties might arise.  For example, in
<b>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156
CLR 41</a> at 96 Mason J as he then was observed:-
<P>

	"The accepted fiduciary relationships are sometimes referred to as
relationships of trust and confidence or confidential  relations
 (cf.
<b>Phipps v. Boardman</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1966/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%202%20AC%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 2 AC 46</a> , at p 127), viz., trustee and
beneficiary, agent and  principal, solicitor and client, employee and employer,
director and company,
and partners.  The critical feature of these
relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on
behalf of
or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or
discretion  which  will affect the interests of  that other person
in a legal
or practical sense.  The relationship between the parties is therefore one
which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity
to exercise the power or
discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable
to abuse by the fiduciary
of his position.  The expressions "for", "on behalf
of" and  "in the interests of" signify that the fiduciary acts in a
"representative"
character in the exercise of his responsibility, to adopt an
expression used by the Court of Appeal."  
<P>

12		In a similar way the Court of Appeal formulated the circumstances in which
a fiduciary relationship may arise <b>Reading v The King</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1949%29%202%20KB%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1949) 2 KB 232</a> in
the following terms at 236:
<P>

		"A consideration of the authorities suggests that for the present purpose a
`fiduciary relation' exists (a) whenever the plaintiff
entrusts to the
defendant property, including intangible property as, for instance,
confidential information, and relies on the defendant
to deal with such
property for the benefit of the plaintiff or for the purposes authorised by
him, and not otherwise (for instance,
<b>Shallcross v Oldham </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1862/353.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1862] EngR 353</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%202%20John%20%26%20H%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 2 J
&amp; H 609</a>, 616 and <b>Attorney-General v Goddard</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=98%20LJ%20%28KB%29%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">98 L.J. (K.B.) 743</a> and
(b) whenever the plaintiff entrusts to the defendant a job to be performed, for
instance, the negotiation of a contract on his
behalf or for his benefit, and
relies on the defendant to procure for the plaintiff the best terms available
(for instance, <b>Lister v Stubbs </b>a(1905) 1 K&gt;B. 11 and<b> Powell Thomas
v Even Jones </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2045%20Ch%20D%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 45 Ch. D 1."</a>
<P>

13		This formulation has been referred to with approval by the High Court in
<b>Breen v Williams </b>1995-1996 186 CLR 71 at 107.
<P>

14		If one has regard to the pleadings it would appear that the matters pleaded
may be sufficient to give rise to the fiduciary
duties having regard to these
statements of principle.  The plaintiff however submits that there are no
material facts identifying
the existence of a discretion or power which the
Manager could exercise nor the pleading of material facts involving the actual
exercise
of any relevant discretion or power.  To make good this submission the
plaintiffs refer to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement
in somewhat
greater detail than are pleaded in the amended Cross Claim.  They submit that
in effect when one considers the whole
of the terms of the joint venture there
is no room for the finding of the existence of fiduciary duties and that the
complaint is
merely one of breach of contract.  Such a case has not been
pleaded perhaps because the first plaintiff as Manager has not executed
the
Joint Venture Agreement or agreed in writing to be bound by it.  Whether or not
the cross claimant would wish to so plead is
not a matter concerning this
present application which focuses upon the sufficiency of the pleadings to
establish fiduciary duties.
 
<P>

15		In furtherance of their submissions the defendants point to a number of
clauses including of course the full terms of the clauses
which are pleaded in
the amended Cross Claim.  Clauses 9.3 and 9.4 which are referred to in
paragraph 29 are in the following terms:-
<P>

		"9.3  All Joint Venture Activities must be carried out by the Manager,
subject to the control and direction of the Committee and
in accordance with
the principles set out in section 2 of the Management Agreement.  In applying
the principles of the Management
Agreement to the management of the Joint
Venture, references to "the Company" must be taken to be references to the "the
Committee"
and in the event of any inconsistency between the principles
contained in the Management Agreement and the substantive provisions
of this
Agreement, this Agreement will prevail.
<P>

	9.4  All Joint Venture Activities carried out by the Manager must be carried
out in the name of the Joint Venture and on behalf
of all the Joint Venturers
in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests."
<P>

16		A notable omission from the pleading is the absence of reference to the
words "subject to the control and direction of the Committee".
<P>

17		In a similar manner when one has regard to paragraph 30 one finds a
reference to part only of what appears in 2.01 of the Management
Agreement
which is annexed to the Joint Venture Agreement and has operation according to
the terms of that agreement.  The part quoted
in paragraph 30 picks up an
obligation which is set out at paragraph 2.01(c).  Paragraph 2.01(a) also
provides that the Manager shall
conduct the affairs of the project and the
undertaking of operations in accordance with approved programmes and budgets.

<P>

18	Both the Joint Venture Agreement in paragraph 10.1 and the Management
Agreement in paragraph 2.02 have provisions for approval
of budgets by the
Committee (which equates to "the Company" in the Management Agreement.  In both
documents there are obligations
upon the Manager to carry out joint venture
activities in accordance with such approved programmes and budgets.  The case
that the
first plaintiff as Manager desires to present to the Court can be
taken to include the fact that the fees whether they be management
fees or the
mark up on employees' fees were included in approved programmes and budgets.

<P>

19		It is useful at this stage to note some more things about the structure of
the Joint Venture Agreement in order to understand
how the parties are at issue
on the charges that have been made.  The Management Agreement is Annexure C to
the Joint Venture Agreement.
 Its force seems to be taken, at least in part,
from clause 9.3 of the Joint Venture Agreement which I have quoted above.  It
requires
the joint venture activities to be carried out in accordance with the
principles set out in section 2 of the Management Agreement.
<P>

20	By virtue of the provisions of the clause 11.3 of the Joint Venture
Agreement, the definitions in clause 1.1 of costs, joint
venture activities and
accounting procedure the relevant costs which may be recouped are those which
are set out in Annexure A which
is the accounting procedure annexed to the
Joint Venture Agreement.  Clause 3.1 of that accounting procedure provides that
the Manager
may acquire goods or services from a party at prices or rates not
greater than the prices or rates at which such goods or services
are otherwise
available to the Manager.
<P>

21		In contrast in the Management Agreement by virtue of the definition of
programme and budget, the definition of project expenses
and the schedule to
the Management Agreement one finds a provision (17) in that schedule which
allows the charging of certain of
the Manager's employees at a rate 2.4 times
their salary.  In respect of management fees the Joint Venture Agreement is
silent (apart
from 2.1(r)) whereas the Management Agreement in paragraph 2.05
provides for the charging of such fees.  There is thus arguably a
conflict
between the definitions of costs in the Management Agreement and the similar
provisions in the Joint Venture Agreement.
 
<P>

22		As I observed the first plaintiff, as Manager, relies upon the provisions
in the Joint Venture Agreement and the Management
Agreement which oblige them
to act in accordance with approved budgets.  Such budgets it alleges contain
the appropriate charges
which are properly within them.  Differences between
the parties in their construction of the agreement is highlighted by the
provisions
of clause 9.3 which provides that provision of the Joint Venture
takes priority in the event of an inconsistency between that agreement
and the
Management Agreement.
<P>

23		It is worth noting the principles in the context of which the present
question has to be decided.  The main proposition is that
any proposed
amendment must not be obviously futile such that it would be liable to be
struck out if it had appeared in the original
pleading.  This formulation then
leads one to Part 15 rule 26 which allows a pleading to be struck out where it
discloses no reasonable
cause of action.  The considerations under this rule
are different from those which apply under Part 13 rule 5 which grants a
somewhat
wider discretionary power rather than focusing on deficiencies in the
pleading.  Accordingly, one has to see whether as a matter
of pleading what is
alleged does disclose reasonable cause of action.
<P>

24		It is tempting when considering the extent of the obligations on the
Manager to act in accordance with approved budgets and
programmes to see how
little room there is for the imposition of fiduciary duties arising simply from
an obligation to manage, supervise
and conduct the activities in a good and
workmanlike and cost effective manner.  If the budgets contain the relevant
costs and are
approved where is the "special opportunity" to exercise a power
or discretion to the detriment of a joint venturer?  A little thought
suggests
that the matter might factually be more complex.  For instance, under clause
10.3 of the Joint Venture Agreement it is the
Manager who must bring in to the
Committee programmes and budgets for the Committee's approval.  The
circumstance in which that is
done, the form of the budgets and the
identification of expenditures may be in a way which leaves room for members of
the Committee
not to appreciate the precise extent of the charges being
approved.  This complication raises the second named question which has
been
debated concerning the pleading and that is the question of whether or not it
is necessary for the cross claimant to allege
a lack of knowledge not only by
the parties but by the members of the Committee.  
<P>

25		Master McLaughlin came to the conclusion that it was necessary to allege a
lack of knowledge of one or other of these.  However,
I am informed that he did
not have the benefit of reference to a number of authorities to which I was
referred.  In <b>Birtchnell v Equity Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co Ltd
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1929/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2042%20CLR%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 42 CLR 384</a> at 398 Isaacs J discussed the onus of satisfying the
Court in respect of consent which is, of course, an answer to a claim for
breach
of fiduciary duty.  Strictly the matter was not a matter for decision
given His Honour's conclusion on the facts but at 398 he said
the
following:-
<P>

		"But assuming the respondents' point were sound, that the appellants had not
affirmatively proved the non-existence of their consent,
the question arises:
on whom does the onus rest of satisfying the Court with respect to consent.
The case <b>Kuhlirz v Lambert Bros Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281913%29%20108%20LT%20565" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1913) 108 L.T. 565</a> cited by Mr
Gorman, is distinct that it rests on the partner receiving the benefit.  That
case (reported also in <b>Commercial Cases </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281913%29%2018%20Com%20Cas%20217" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1913) 18 Com Cas 217</a> followed
<b>Rothschild v Brookman</b> ((1931) <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1831/214.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1831] EngR 214</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20Dow%20%26%20Cl%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 Dow &amp; Cl 188.</a>  The principle was
stated by Turner LJ in <b>Clegg v Edmondson</b> (1857) 8 DeG. M &amp; G at p
806:-
<P>

		`The onus of this case rests, as I think, upon the defendants, the managing
partners.  Having stood in a confidential relation,
both as partners and as
managers, the consequences which, according to the ordinary rules of this
Court, flow from that relation
must attach upon them, unless they can by some
means exonerate themselves from those consequences.'
<P>

		It is not at all like a case in which the adverse litigants are, so to speak,
strangers, and unconnected by any relation which
begins by creating an
obligation.  If A sues B for fraudulent concealment producing damage, the
concealment is an essential element
in the cause of action.  But in a case like
the present, equity has always held that the fiduciary relation itself imposes
on the
party bound to fidelity the obligation of justifying any private
advantage he obtains in the course of his trust, or by reason of
an interest
conflicting or possibly conflicting with his duty.  This is invariable.
<b>Massey v Davies </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1794/2192.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1794] EngR 2192</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281794%29%202%20Ves%20Jr%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1794) 2 Ves Jun 317</a> is a notable instance.<b>  Lowther

</b>((1874)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=18%20Eq%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">18 Eq 524</a> is another instance.<b>  </b>(See also<b> Fullwood v

<P>

26		This passage and the authority of <b>Clegg v Edmondson </b>(1857) 8 De
G.M.&amp; G. at p 806 referred to in it is relied upon by Glover in his
discussion in Fiduciary Relationships paragraph
5.127 dealing with consent as a
defence to fiduciary claims.  He clearly adopts the proposition that consent is
a defence the onus
of proof of which lies upon the fiduciary.  These comments
are picked up in <b>Breen v Williams</b> by Gummow J at page 135.  
<P>

27		In support of the proposition that there would be an onus on the person
alleging the breach of fiduciary duty to establish the
lack of consent,
reference was made to the standard forms of pleading for the recovery of secret
commission.  However, in my view
such matters do not assist in this case as
that is a particular form of claim somewhat akin to the element of fraudulent
concealment
referred to in <b>Birtchnell's case</b>.  In my view consent in the
circumstances of this case is properly a matter of defence and does not have to
be alleged by the cross
claimant as an essential element in the cause of action
which is proposed. 
<P>

28		Having concluded this I return to the earlier question of whether there are
sufficient facts pleaded.  Each joint venturer and
the manager have a
representative on the Management Committee which approves budgets.  Clearly the
question of consent will be raised
as a defence.  On that issue it would seem
likely that the cross claimant may wish to avoid the result that would flow by
suggesting
that the way in which the programmes and budgets were presented to
the Committee did not allow an appreciation of the relevant facts
contained in
them.  One could then imagine that such a fact would also be relied upon to
support the existence of the fiduciary duty
said to flow from the contractual
obligations.  At present the cross claimants do not put it forward as one of
their pleaded facts.
<P>

29		It seems to me that as informed consent is to be raised in the Defence that
there will be no lack of surprise by the time the
trial in respect of the
material which would be available on that issue.  The only matter of concern is
whether questions of onus
in respect of the way in which budgets were presented
may become relevant.  
<P>

30		It is important that I do not in a consideration of this matter trespass
into a final determination of whether or not a fiduciary
duty might arise.  At
the present moment the cross claimant takes the view that it is prepared to
rely upon the allegations that
it has pleaded.  A Court might find that this
would support fiduciary duties although I would not rate it as a high chance.
However,
in my view it is certainly sufficient to establish a cause of action.
The comments which I have made may lead the cross claimants
to perhaps
reconsider their position particularly having regard to what might possibly be
the ultimate factual dispute and the part
that might play in a finding that
there was a fiduciary duty.  In these circumstances I would be minded to allow
a short period for
further amendments in this regard but I would not strike out
the paragraphs in the Statement of Claim.
<P>

31		There were a number of other matters that were raised by the plaintiffs to
which I should refer.
<P>

32		The first of these was that there was no proper identification of the
alleged benefit that was obtained.  I think that in respect
of the mark up on
salaries the benefit is adequately defined for pleading purposes in paragraph
32.  It may be that further particulars
particularly of the rate that is
appropriate will have to be given prior to trial.  The other benefits, namely,
the management fees,
are clearly identified in paragraph 36.  There was also
criticism of paragraph 34 in that the individual allegations of breach were
not
referable to particular benefits.  I do not think that that is necessary.  Each
of them can be taken to have led, at least for
the pleading purpose, to the
relevant benefit obtained.
<P>

33		The orders that I make are as follows:-
<P>

34	1.	I extend the time in which the defendants may file a further amended
Defence and Cross Claim to 14 days after the date of
this judgment.
<P>

35	2.	I give leave to the defendants to include in such amended Cross Claim
matters generally in accordance with this judgment.
<P>

36	3.	I will hear argument on the question of costs.
<P>
