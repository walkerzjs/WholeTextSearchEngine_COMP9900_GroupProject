<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES </b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY, 2 SEPTEMBER 1999</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>13264/96   -   STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>			DAVID STEWART WHITE &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Leave to file cross claim)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 23 April 1999 the
second defendant/cross claimant seeks orders that D S &amp; L White Carrying
Pty Limited
(the company) be added as a cross claimant and that leave be
granted to add the company as a party to these proceedings.  The second
defendant/cross claimant relied on two affidavits of Peter Brian McKell sworn
17 March 1999 and 31 May 1999.  The plaintiff did not
rely upon any affidavit
evidence.  It opposed the order sought.  There was no appearance of David
Stewart White the first named defendant.
<P>

2  	The statement of claim pleads a cause of action which arose as
between the State Bank of New South Wales Limited as plaintiff
and David
Stewart White and Lesleigh White as defendants.  The defendants mortgaged to
the plaintiff by way of third party mortgage
the whole of the land and
improvements contained in Certificate of Title Folio Identifier 15/702410 being
the property known as 23
Shand Close Illawong (the property) to secure certain
advances made by the plaintiff to D S &amp; L White Carrying Pty Limited.
<P>

3  	On about 19 July 1989 the funds were placed in the company
account.  It is pleaded that the company failed to repay the moneys
advanced
under the mortgage.  The plaintiff has claimed a monetary sum of $442,273.50
and possession of the property from the defendants.
<P>

4  	A cross claim has been filed by Lesleigh White as cross claimant
against the plaintiff as cross defendant.  The proposed amended
cross claim
names Lesleigh White as the first cross claimant and D S &amp; L White Carrying
Pty Limited (the company) as cross claimant
and the plaintiff as cross
defendant.  The company had been deregistered but has now been "registered".
The company consents to being
joined as a cross claimant (Ex A).  The company
has not been named as a defendant in the statement of claim.  It is a new party
that
is seeking to cross claim against the plaintiff.  The plaintiff has not
pleaded a cause of action against the company nor does it
seek any judgment or
orders against it.  
<P>

5  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the <b>Supreme Court Rules (SCR)</b> refers to cross
claims.  Part 6 r 6 provides:
<P>

<b>"Conduct of proceedings generally</b>
<P>

<b>6(1)	Subject to this Part, the proceedings on a cross-claim shall follow as
nearly as may be the course of proceedings on the originating
process in
respect of which the cross-claim is filed.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Subject to this Part, and without limiting the generality of subrule
(1), these rules apply to a cross-claim and the proceedings
arising from it as
they apply to the originating process in respect of which the cross-claim is
filed and the proceedings arising
from it.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	Subrules (1) and (2) apply as if--</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the cross-claim were the originating process in respect of which the
cross-claim is filed;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the cross-claimant were a plaintiff; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the defendant to the cross-claim were a defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	A plaintiff in an originating process need not enter an appearance to a
cross-claim in the same proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	An appearance entered by a party to the proceedings shall, upon service
of a cross-claim on him, operate as an appearance to the
cross-claim.</b>
<P>

<b>(6)	Subject to this Part, the trial or hearing and all other steps in the
proceedings on the cross-claim shall as far as practicable
be carried on
together with the trial or hearing and similar steps in the proceedings on the
originating process in respect of which
the cross-claim is filed."</b>
<P>

6  	The second defendant referred to Part 8 r 8 of the <b>SCR</b>.
Part 8 refers to causes of action and parties.  Part 8 r 8 states:
<P>

<b>"Addition of parties</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Where a person who is not a party--</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	ought to have been joined as a party; or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	is a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all
matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually
and completely
determined and adjudicated upon,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court, on application by him or by any party or of its own motion, may
order that he be added as a party and make orders for the
further conduct of
the proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A person shall not be added as a plaintiff without his consent.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	Without limiting the generality of subrule (1), where a person not a
party to proceedings for possession of land is in possession
(by himself or by
a tenant) of the whole or any part of the land, the Court, on application by
him, may order that he be added as
a defendant and make orders for the further
conduct of the proceedings."</b>
<P>

7  	It is pleaded in the proposed cross claim (and by the cross claim
already filed) that in February 1990 the first defendant,
as a director of the
company, breached his duties by releasing funds belonging to the company to the
plaintiff for the purposes of
crediting an account with the plaintiff in the
name of Gregory J White Pty Limited.  It is pleaded that the plaintiff
participated
in a dishonest and fraudulent scheme by the first defendant
whereby the plaintiff and/or Gregory J White Pty Limited received a benefit
and
that the company is entitled to an equitable set off for the amount the
plaintiff is claiming against the second defendant. 
It is also pleaded that
the funds on term deposit as at 2 August 1989 was approximately $350,000
standing to the credit of the account
of the company and at that time the
plaintiff waived the mortgage.
<P>

8  	It is my view that the company cannot be joined as a defendant
under Part 8 r 8 as the plaintiff has not sought any orders or
judgment against
it.  In these circumstances the joinder of the company is not necessary.
<P>

9  	The second defendant submitted that a cross claim which names a
new party as a cross claimant would permit proceedings on the
cross claim to
follow as nearly as may be the course of the proceedings on the originating
process in respect of which the cross
claim is filed.  The second defendant
submitted that the company may be the true owner of some of the funds and
should be permitted
to be a cross claimant so as to allow all the issues to be
heard and determined.  The second defendant referred to <b><u>Payne v Young
&amp; Ors</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%2d80%29%20145%20CLR%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979-80) 145 CLR 609</a> which involved the interpretation of
O.16 r 1 of the <b>High Court Rules</b>.  I did not find this case helpful.
The plaintiff submitted that a new party cannot be a cross claimant.
<P>

10  	In <b><u>Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd &amp; Anor v
Dowd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11%20ACSR%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">11 ACSR 68</a> at 73 McLelland CJ in Equity held that a cross claim is
a claim for relief under s 78 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970 (see
definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> r 8 of <b>SCR</b>) and the capacity to file such a claim
is limited to "the defendant in any proceedings".  The word defendant is
defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> to include "any person
entitled to attend any proceedings".
<P>

11  	It is my view that the dispute currently pleaded is a cause of
action between the plaintiff and defendants in relation to obligations
arising
out of a third party guarantee.  There is no basis for the company being
entitled to attend these proceedings.  Had the plaintiff
joined the company as
a defendant and sought relief against it, the company could have cross claimed
against the plaintiff.
<P>

12  	If the company has a cause of action against the State Bank, it
can commence fresh proceedings.  It may then be appropriate
for these matters
to be ordered to be heard together.  It is my view that the company should not
be permitted to cross claim against
the plaintiff.  Accordingly, the motion
should be dismissed.  Costs should follow the event.
<P>

13  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The second defendant's notice of motion filed 23 April 1999 is
dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The second defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
