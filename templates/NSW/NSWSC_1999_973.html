<b>3968/99 - PATRICK CLEARY &amp; ANOR  V  AUSTRALIAN CO-OPERATIVE FOODS
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered ex tempore on 21 September 1999 and revised on 22
September 1999)</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

<b>The Proceedings  </b>
<P>

1  	This matter commenced on 14 September 1999 when the plaintiff
filed a summons seeking various orders with respect to a postal
ballot and
meetings which had been convened to consider a proposal (`Restructure
Proposal') put forward by the directors of Australian
Co-operative Foods Ltd
(`Dairy Farmers') under Pt 13 of the Co-operative Act 1992 (NSW) (`Act') and
ancillary resolutions.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff has foreshadowed amendments to the summons and in
its amended form the summons will seek orders and declarations
along the
following lines:
<P>

(1)	an order avoiding or declaring void the postal ballot, or cancelling the
postal ballot process;
<P>

(2)	an order restraining the defendants (they being Dairy Farmers, its
directors and the returning officer) from counting the postal
ballot or
publishing the result;
<P>

(3)	an order that the Court-ordered meeting of the Dairy Farmers be adjourned
or vacated;
<P>

(4)	declarations that Dairy Farmers and its directors have engaged in
misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce by reason
of their
receiving and not adequately disclosing a merger proposal (`Parmalat Proposal')
from Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. (`Parmalat')
in various ways which I shall
specify;
<P>

(5)	declarations that by so doing the directors or one or more of them breached
their fiduciary duty to make a full and fair disclosure
of material to members
and the holders of co-operative capital units called `Members' Capital Units'
or `MCUs';
<P>

(6)	declarations that by so doing Dairy Farmers and its directors or one or
more of them breached the duty set out s 354(3)(b) of
the Act to provide, in
the two-volume explanatory statement for the Restructure Proposal (`the
Restructure Booklet'), information
that is material to the making of a decision
by members and MCU holders whether to agree to the Restructure Proposal;
<P>

(7)	declarations that by so doing Dairy Farmers and its directors or one or
more of them breach a duty arising under s 266 of the
Act and s 1022 of the
Corporations Law to provide such information as investors and their
professional advisers would reasonably
expect to find in the Restructure
Proposal;
<P>

(8)	a declaration that the directors are obliged to consider the Parmalat
Proposal and inform members and MCU holders of the result
of their
consideration;
<P>

(9)	declarations that the refusal by the directors to consider the Parmalat
Proposal and to put the Parmalat Proposal to a ballot
without full and frank
disclosure is invalid and involves breach of fiduciary duty, misleading or
deceptive conduct and failure to
comply with the duty under ss 266 and 1022,
and that their conduct in failing to supplement the explanatory statement for
the Restructure
Proposal with adequate material concerning the Parmalat
Proposal was misleading or deceptive conduct and was in breach of s 354 of
the
Act; 
<P>

(10)	an order that the Court-ordered meeting for approval of the Restructure
Proposal (made in proceedings 2882/99) was procured
ex parte in breach of an
obligation to disclose all material information with respect to the Parmalat
Proposal;
<P>

(11)	an order that Dairy Farmers and its directors be restrained from
proceeding without the leave of the Court with any business
at the
Court-ordered meeting or any adjournment of it other than taking steps that may
be necessary to give effect to an adjournment.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff has produced a statement of issues according to
which some eight matters arise in these proceedings: 
<P>

(A)	whether the dispatch of the Restructure Proposal involved breach of
fiduciary duty by one or more of the directors, or failure
to give adequate
disclosure under s 354 of the Act, or misleading or deceptive conduct, or
failure to give adequate disclosure under
s 266 of the Act and s 1022 of the
Corporations Law; 
<P>

(B)	whether the information provided to members and MCU holders by a circular
dated 24 August 1999 involved any deficiencies of
the same kinds;  
<P>

(C)	whether the information provided to members and MCU holders by the material
sent to them on 6 September 1999 involved any deficiencies
of the same kinds;

<P>

(D)	whether the directors had a fiduciary duty or a statutory duty to consider
and decide whether to accept or reject the Parmalat
Proposal and if so, whether
they breached their duty by deciding to defer consideration;
<P>

(E)	whether any of the defendants engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in
respect of their discussions referred to in Mr Cochrane's
affidavit; 
<P>

(F)	whether the arrangements set out in the materials sent to members on 6
September 1999, which permit postal votes to be recalled
and replaced, are
valid; 
<P>

(G)	whether there was a failure to make full and frank disclosure to the Court
prior to the orders which I made on 30 July 1999
in proceedings 2882/99;  
<P>

(H)	whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief claimed in the
summons.
<P>

<b>The present applications</b>
<P>

4  	On 20 September 1999 the plaintiffs applied to me for an order
for an expedited final hearing of the present proceedings.  However,
in the
course of submissions the plaintiffs conceded that it may be appropriate to
seek a final determination of only some of the
issues and suggested that this
could be achieved by defining some separate questions for determination under
Part 31 of the Supreme
Court Rules.
<P>

5  	On the same day the defendants, pursuant to leave, filed in Court
a Notice of Motion in which they sought orders having the
effect that the
present proceedings be heard concurrently with the hearing of any motion to
approve the schemes of arrangement in
proceedings 2882/99.  
<P>

6  	The purpose of the present judgment is to deal with these two
applications.
<P>

7  	I have set out the relief which is sought, and the issues raised,
in so much detail so that I can make to make two points at
the outset.  First,
the relief sought implies that there are some very serious allegations raised
against Dairy Farmers and its directors
which will require careful
consideration in due course. Secondly, it can be seen that the allegations are
broadly divisible into
two categories:  first, allegations of breach of duty
with respect to what has occurred in the past;  and secondly, allegations as
to
whether sufficient information has been placed before the members and MCU
holders for them to make the decisions on the Restructure
Proposal which they
have been invited by the directors to make, and whether the voting procedure
which is in train is valid.  There
seems to me to be a stronger case for urgent
determination of the latter than the former issues.
<P>

<b>The Restructure Proposal</b>
<P>

8  	Dairy Farmers is a co-operative which carries on the business of
manufacturing, marketing and distributing dairy and other food
and beverage
products under the business name `Dairy Farmers' and other well known names.
It has approximately 5,600 members of whom
approximately 5,000 are dairy
farmers who operate approximately 3,700 dairy farms in east coast States.
<P>

9  	By the application brought before me in July this year in
proceedings 2882/99, Dairy Farmers sought to convene a meeting to
consider a
scheme of arrangement between itself and certain of its creditors, being the
MCU holders.  There is also a scheme of arrangement
between Dairy Farmers and
its members explained in the same explanatory material as the creditors'
scheme, namely the Restructure
Booklet.
<P>

10  	Under s 344 of the<b> </b>Act a scheme between a co-operative
and its creditors requires two Court hearings, namely, a hearing at which the
Court orders the
convening of a meeting of the creditors and after the meeting,
a hearing at which the Court considers whether to approve the scheme.
 However,
in the case of a scheme between a co-operative and any of its members the same
section requires Court approval after the
members have voted on the proposal
but not a Court order for the convening of any meeting.  The procedure which is
prescribed for
voting by members is a procedure by special postal ballot as
defined in ss 193 and 194 of the Act.  The Restructure Proposal also
involves a
special resolution by special postal ballot under s 316 of the Act approving an
application during the ensuring three
years for Dairy Farmers to become
incorporated as a company under the Corporations Law.
<P>

11  	The purpose of the Restructure Proposal, according to the
explanatory documents to which I shall refer, is to permit capital
flexibility
and sustained growth of Dairy Farmers' operations.  There are two stages in the
restructure.
<P>

12  	In Stage 1 the schemes of arrangement for members and MCU
holders will interpose a new co-operative referred to as the `Supply
Co-operative' between them and Dairy Farmers, by cancelling 75% of their shares
and MCUs in exchange for 100% ownership of the Supply
Co-operative, which will
in turn hold a controlling interest in Dairy Farmers.  After this stage of the
restructure has been completed
milk will initially be supplied to the Supply
Co-operative rather than to Dairy Farmers, and Dairy Farmers will acquire the
milk
from the Supply Co-operative for processing and selling purposes. These
arrangements will be reflected in a milk supply agreement.
<P>

13  	Stage 2 involves the conversion of Dairy Farmers from a
co-operative to a company incorporated under the Corporations Law.
 By virtue
of the approval by members of the Restructure Proposal, the directors of Dairy
Farmers will have a discretion to determine
the exact date for conversion,
although their discretion will be required to be exercised within three years
from the date of implementation
of Stage 1.  Conversion will facilitate the
raising of external capital and will permit Dairy Farmers to list on the stock
exchange.
 
<P>

14  	The Restructure Proposal, which I have described only in broad
outline, involves many issues of legal and factual complexity.
 It was
necessary for the Court to consider Dairy Farmers' application over several
hearing days before being satisfied that the
orders which were sought for the
convening of a meeting of MCU holders and, more generally, the Restructure
Proposal as a whole were
appropriate, so that the Court would be in a position,
should there be no opposition to the schemes, to make orders approving them.
 I
made the orders sought by Dairy Farmers on 30 July 1999, and the Restructure
Booklet and other materials were sent to members
and MCU holders on about 6
August 1999.
<P>

<b>The Parmalat Proposal</b>
<P>

15  	The evidence before me shows that the Restructure Proposal
emerged as a result of extensive discussions between management
and members, at
`ward' level within Dairy Farmers, in New South Wales and in the other States
where its members are located.  One
of the key issues in those discussions was
the maintenance of farmer control of the business, to the extent that control
could be
maintained comparable with the achievement of capital flexibility.
Farmer control will be preserved by the Restructure Proposal because
in Stage 1
the Supply Co-operative, 100% owned by the members and MCU holders, will hold
75% of the shares in Dairy Farmers;  and
in Stage 2, control will be maintained
by provisions of the constitution which Dairy Farmers will adopt as a company
under the Corporations
Law, which will include a 15% shareholding limitation,
and by arrangements made in principle with the Australian Stock Exchange which
will allow listing to occur even though the Supply Co-operative retains a
controlling interest in Dairy Farmers. 
<P>

16  	An indication of the importance placed upon the issue of control
emerges in the Restructure Booklet.  Thus, in paragraph 5.9
of Volume 1 of the
Restructure Booklet there is a reference to the main competitors of Dairy
Farmers, who are said to be National
Foods and Parmalat Australia, the latter
being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parmalat.  The document notes that both
competitors have
the flexibility to make large capital raisings and that Dairy
Farmers does not.  A further reference to the competitive positions
of Dairy
Farmers and Parmalat may be found in paragraph 4.2 of Volume 2.
<P>

17  	The message appears to be that farmer control will permit Dairy
Farmers to remain independent of its competitors, while the
Restructure
Proposal will help it to compete effectively.  The discussions between Parmalat
and Dairy Farmers, to which I shall now
turn, must be seen in this context.
<P>

18  	The evidence before me indicates that discussions had begun
between Parmalat and Dairy Farmers by no later than 4 May 1999.
 By facsimile
of that date the Chief Executive of Dairy Farmers (Mr Tooth) wrote to the
Regional Director of Parmalat for Australia/Asia
(Mr Ferraris) setting out some
items which he wished to discuss in the following week including the question:
`What structure can
facilitate the ongoing participation of farmers in the
downstream value-adding processes of processing and distribution?'
<P>

19  	In evidence is a set of presentation notes prepared by Salomon
Smith Barney, Parmalat's financial advisers, setting out in
some detail a
merger proposal described as `Project Kangaroo', dated 15 June 1999.  It
appears from the evidence that this material
was made available, at least, to
Mr Tooth.  On 30 June 1999 Mr Tooth wrote to Mr Ferraris referring to a meeting
on 15 June and to
the Salomon Smith Barney document, and indicating that in his
opinion the issues raised by the document could not be addressed at
that time
for a number of reasons which he then set out.  On 28 July 1999 Mr Ferraris
wrote to Mr Tooth referring to the letter of
30 June and the previous meeting,
reiterating Parmalat's belief that the merger proposal outlined in the Salomon
Smith Barney document
would offer significant benefits including cash to
members of Dairy Farmers and could be combined with the Restructure Proposal,
expressing an understanding of Mr Tooth's wish not to permit an alternative
proposal to divert attention from the restructure process,
and looking forward
to progressing the merger discussions at the earliest appropriate time.
<P>

20  	Mr Cochrane, one of the plaintiffs, deposes to some
conversations which he had with a director, Mr Zandstra, on 5 and 6 August
1999
when Mr Zandstra denied rumours that Parmalat had made an offer to acquire an
interest in Dairy Farmers.
<P>

21  	On 11 August 1999 the plaintiffs, and other members, wrote to
the directors of Dairy Farmers setting out their understanding
that Parmalat
had made an offer, referred to as an `indicative proposal and correspondence',
and seeking an assurance that all information
relevant to the members' decision
on the Restructure Proposal, including matters relating to Parmalat, had been
properly evaluated
by the board.  On 18 August 1999 the Secretary of Dairy
Farmers, on behalf of Mr Langdon, the Chairman, replied broadly to the effect
that all that had been received from the Parmalat was an indicative concept
insufficiently developed to warrant further consideration
at that stage.  
<P>

22  	Some members of Dairy Farmers, including the plaintiffs,
purported to requisition a special general meeting by requisitions
sent to the
Company Secretary under cover of a letter of 24 August 1999, with the objective
of suspending the postal ballot and meeting
process and requiring directors to
review Parmalat's indicative proposal.  By letter dated 27 August 1999 Mr
Robinson, the General
Manager (Finance and Administration) of Dairy Farmers,
responded to the effect that the requisitions were not binding and that a
meeting would not be convened, but the members would receive a statement
indicating the attitude of Dairy Farmers to the purported
requisition.  That
statement was in a letter to members dated 24 August 1999, which referred to
Parmalat and `the Parmalat concept',
saying it did not represent an offer and
was insufficiently developed to warrant further consideration.
<P>

23  	On 31 August 1999 Parmalat transmitted to the directors of Dairy
Farmers a letter of 11 pages including attachments which purported
to set out a
proposal for a merger broadly in conformity with Salomon Smith Barney's
document of 15 June 1999, but giving specific
figures.  For present purposes
the document may be summarised in this way:
<P>

(i)	the merger would be effected by the sale of Pauls Ltd, a dairy company
owned by Parmalat, to Dairy Farmers in consideration
of the issue of
approximately 107 million shares by Dairy Farmers;
<P>

(ii)	an enterprise value of $676 million was placed on Dairy Farmers for the
purposes of the proposal and after deducting debt Parmalat
valued the equity in
Dairy Farmers at $471 million or $4.02 per share;
<P>

(iii)	the valuation of Dairy Farmers was derived by applying a multiple of 13.5
times EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) for
the year to 30 June 1998;
<P>

(iv)	on the same basis Parmalat assessed the enterprise value of Pauls at $561
million and the equity in Pauls at $431 million;
<P>

(v)	Parmalat's proposal was to make a cash payment of $4.02 a share in respect
of a minimum of 25% of the Dairy Farmers shares held
by each of the members;
<P>

(vi)	a share sale facility would be established for the balance of Dairy
Farmers shares which would enable the members to sell shares
at $4.02 each
until 31 December 2000, and thereafter for a cash consideration calculated by
using a formula;
<P>

(vii)	a new Supply Co-operative would be formed with each farmer member being
eligible for membership and holding one share each,
and the Supply Co-operative
would enter into a supply agreement with Dairy Farmers similar to the one
proposed in the Restructure
Proposal;
<P>

(viii)	after the merger Parmalat would own a minimum 60.9% of the equity of the
merged entity.
<P>

24  	Two things appear from this proposal, which I have called `the
Parmalat Proposal'.  The first is that an integral component
is that control of
Dairy Farmers will pass to Parmalat and, therefore, the Parmalat Proposal
represents a different vision for the
future of the Co-operative than the
Restructure Proposal.  Secondly, it would appear to be open to Dairy Farmers to
accept the Parmalat
Proposal, were it to remain open, after implementation of
Stage 1 of the Restructure Proposal, though the respective roles of the
directors and members in any such decision would need to be considered.
<P>

25  	On 6 September 1999 Dairy Farmers' directors issued a press
release in which they purported to `reaffirm their commitment to
the
restructure proposal', and by documents bearing the same date they communicated
with members and MCU holders.  The documents
sent to members and MCU holders
were a letter from Mr Langdon, a document headed `Restructure Proposal to
Continue in the Best Interests
of Members and MCU Holders' and the full text of
Parmalat's letter of 31 August 1999, which sets out the Parmalat Proposal.  Mr
Langdon's
letter announced that the board had decided to extend the closing
date for the postal ballot to 23 September 1999 and to permit voters
to recall
and replace their postal votes, and to adjourn the meetings of members and MCU
holders to 29 September, and in the meantime
to defer consideration of the
Parmalat Proposal.
<P>

<b>The Relationship between the scheme procedure and the issues raised in the
present proceedings</b>
<P>

26  	Counsel for the defendants submitted with some force that it is
inappropriate for the Court to permit questions about the adequacy
of
procedures and disclosure in a scheme approval process to be raised and
agitated in separate proceedings.  The scheme of arrangement
procedure under
the Act, which bears some close analogies with the scheme procedure under s 411
of the Corporations Law is, according
to the defendants, a special procedure
for judicial review, not unlike the electoral procedure in which a court of
disputed returns
is responsible for protecting the integrity of the franchise,
after voting has taken place (citing <i>Australian Electoral Commission v

(No.2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1904] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20CLR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 CLR 121</a>, 123 (Griffith CJ)). <i> </i>The scheme of
arrangement procedure contemplates that the adequacy of the disclosure made and
procedures followed to obtain the approval
of the members or creditors
concerned in the scheme should be raised and determined after the decision of
the members or creditors
has taken place, at the hearing at which an
application is made for the Court to approve the scheme.  It is said to be
inappropriate
to expose the proponents of the scheme to multiple suits by
allowing questions of these kinds to be raised in separate proceedings.
<P>

27  	I regard that submission as having considerable weight. To the
extent that it can, the Court should try not to allow collateral
proceedings to
be used in a manner which may de-rail the process which has been ordained by
the statutory scheme provisions of the
Act or the Corporations Law, as the case
may be. However, it cannot be right that the procedure for Court approval of a
scheme is
an exclusive code which prevents a party from seeking vindication of
legal rights which arise in some other fashion.  In my view
the defendants'
submission identifies a weighty matter to be taken into account by the Court in
the exercise of its discretion, particularly
with respect to balance of
convenience, when an application is made for discretionary relief during the
process for approval of a
scheme of arrangement.
<P>

28  	In the present case the application for relief, if the entire
proceedings are expedited, will seek to enforce statutory duties
alleged to
arise under the Act and the general law fiduciary duty of directors, and to
invoke a statutory regime dealing with misleading
and deceptive conduct.  As I
have mentioned, some aspects of the plaintiffs' complaints relate to past
events, as to which the case
for expedition does not seem to me to be pressing.
But some relate to the quantity and quality of the information now available to
members, whose decisions may not yet have been made.  There would be a case for
intervention if there were defects in that information
which could be overcome
in time to permit better-informed decisions.  It seems to me that the
expeditious resolution of issues (A),
(B), (D), (E) and (G) would be unlikely
to improve the quality and quantity of material information in a sufficiently
timely way
to justify the urgent hearing of those matters.  However, a review
of the information provided to members and MCU holders on 6 September
1999
might lead to some remedial action, if specific defects are found, which would
give members and MCU holders access to adequate
information before their final
decisions were made.
<P>

29  	To the extent that the question of the adequacy of the
information dispatched on 6 September 1999 is to be assessed under the
Act
(especially ss 354 and 266), the contention that the question should be
deferred until completion of the voting is strengthened
(as a matter of
discretion) by the consideration that the scheme procedure is set out in the
very same legislation.  To the extent
that the question is to be assessed by
the application of fiduciary principles, some intricate issues of standing and
the appropriateness
of relief against Dairy Farmers itself could well arise.
But to the extent that the question is to be assessed under a statutory
regime
dealing with misleading and deceptive conduct, the impediments to intervention
in the scheme process are less compelling,
since the duty to avoid misleading
or deceptive conduct is an `overarching duty', even during the scheme of
arrangement process:
 see <i>Ford's Principles of Corporations Law
</i>(Butterworths, looseleaf), p24,120.
<P>

<b>Allegation of misleading and deceptive conduct by the distribution of 6
September 1999</b>
<P>

30  	This case bears some analogy with<b> </b><i>Fraser v NRMA
Holdings Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%204%20ACSR%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 4 ACSR 656 (Gummow</a> J);  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=55%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">55 FCR 452, (Full</a> Federal
Court).  There are obvious differences.  In the NRMA case the companies
concerned were a newly formed holding company and
companies limited by
guarantee rather than co-operatives; the procedure which the plaintiffs sought
to enjoin was the convening of
meetings to consider proposals for the adoption
of new corporate constitutions, coupled with a prospectus in respect of
potential
acquisition of shares, whereas in the present case the procedure is a
scheme under special co-operatives legislation which involves
a postal ballot
and decisions at meetings, together with constitutional amendments and other
decisions to be taken at a meeting.
 Nonetheless, it seems to me that the
observations of Gummow J at page 685 are a useful guide with respect to
discretionary matters.
 His Honour found that there had been misleading or
deceptive conduct for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> and noted
that the Court may grant an injunction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of that Act.  He observed
that the contravention by the new holding company which had issued the
prospectus was directed to encouraging
a course of conduct by members of the
two companies limited by guarantee in relation to general meetings which at the
time of his
judgment were due to be held within a few days.  For the companies
limited by guarantee to proceed with those meetings would be for
them to become
parties to and knowingly concerned in the misleading or deceptive conduct.  He
stated that injunctive relief should
be granted to restrain those companies
from proceeding with any business at the meetings.
<P>

31  	In the present case the Restructure Proposal involves a postal
ballot, the result of which was at first intended to be declared
on 15
September 1999, and meetings of members and MCU holders which would be held on
the same day.  The dates were extended on 6
September 1999, to 23 September
1999 for the close of the postal ballot - two days from now - and 29 September
1999 for the meetings.
 It seems to me that if there is misleading or deceptive
conduct for the purpose of an applicable statutory regime, to allow the
postal
ballot to continue and to permit the meetings to take place would involve
continuation of that unlawful conduct.  In those
circumstances, given that the
alleged deficiencies of information are of a serious kind, it seems to me that
in the exercise of my
discretion I ought, if possible, to take steps to enable
these issues to be addressed while there is time to consider them prior
to the
closing of the postal ballot and the conduct of the meetings, provided there is
sufficient substance in the allegations.
<P>

<b>The plaintiffs' complaints about the disclosure of 6 September 1999</b>
<P>

32  	The essential complaints made at the hearing on 20 September
1999 are of two kinds.  
<P>

33  	First, attention is drawn to a statement in the materials of 6
September 1999 to the effect that the Parmalat Proposal is based
on a valuation
approach which is flawed in favour of Parmalat, including calculations on
financial information 15 months out of date,
thus failing to recognise the
substantial changes in the market place during that period.  The plaintiffs
complain that the directors,
in putting forward that statement, acted in a
misleading way because they failed to communicate any view as to the true worth
of
that for which Parmalat had made its bid.  The plaintiffs say that, given
Parmalat was offering $4.02 cash per share in contrast
to a specified maximum
possible payment under the Restructuring Proposal for only 25% of the interests
of members and MCU holders,
the subject matter which was omitted was of
fundamental materiality to the recipients.
<P>

34  	The second complaint focuses on a statement in the 6 September
material in respect of the Dairy Farmers' expert, Ernst &amp;
Young Corporate
Finance Pty Limited.  The statement is as follows:
<P>

`Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Finance Pty Limited, the independent expert on the
restructure proposal has been provided with a copy
of the Parmalat proposal.
While it has not performed an evaluation on the Parmalat proposal it has
reviewed its Independent Expert
Report in light of the Parmalat proposal. Ernst
&amp; Young Corporate Finance Pty Limited has advised the Board that its
opinion
that &#180;the proposed restructure is fair and reasonable and in the
best interest of existing ACF [Dairy Farmers] members and MCU
holders' is not
altered by the Parmalat proposal'.
<P>

35  	The plaintiffs say that on the expert evidence which they
propose to adduce, a proposal such as the Parmalat Proposal may materially
change an expert's assessment of the likely advantages and disadvantages of a
proposal such as the Restructure Proposal. Further,
they say that the statement
set out above is misleading because it fails to incorporate qualifications
which Ernst &amp; Young Corporate
Finance have imposed on the opinion which the
statement sets out.  In evidence before me is a facsimile letter by Ernst &amp;
Young
Corporate Finance, dated 6 September 1999, which on its face appears to
me to support the plaintiffs' contention.  It is not appropriate
for me to
determine the matter at this stage.  But as at present advised, my view is that
there is at least a very serious question
for consideration as to whether the
statement in the material of 6 September 1999 with respect to Ernst &amp; Young
Corporate Finance
is misleading, in view of the explanations and qualifications
contained in that company's letter of 6 September.  
<P>

36  	This leads me to conclude that there is one matter which should
be considered and determined at the earliest possible time,
namely whether the
materials which were sent on 6 September 1999 together with the press statement
of that date are misleading or
deceptive for the purposes of an applicable
statutory regime.
<P>

<b>Retrieval and replacement of postal votes</b>
<P>

37  	There is another matter which, it seems to me, should be dealt
with on an expedited basis, given my conclusions on the question
of the
adequacy of the disclosure of 6 September 1999.  That is the allegation (issue
(F)) that the procedure adopted on 6 September
1999 for retrieval and recasting
of postal votes by members is an invalid procedure.  
<P>

38  	Section 193 of the<b> </b>Act<b> </b>states that a postal ballot
may be held as provided by the rules of a co-operative and must be conducted in
accordance with the Regulations.
 Section 194 then imposes some additional
requirements with respect to a special postal ballot which are not presently in
issue.
<P>

39  	The Rules of Dairy Farmers are unhelpful in the sense that they
merely purport to adopt the provisions in the Regulations (Rule
36B).  The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Regulation 1997</a>, Schedule 2, paragraph 3 deals with the
preparation of ballot papers. When read together with paragraph 7, it seems to
envisage that
a vote is cast when the ballot paper is completed, placed in an
envelope and dispatched. Paragraph 4 empowers the returning officer
to send a
duplicate ballot paper to any voter if the returning officer is satisfied that
the voter has not received a ballot paper,
or the ballot paper has been lost,
spoilt or destroyed and that `<i>the voter has not already voted</i>' (emphasis
supplied). There is at least a plausible contention that Schedule 2, and in
particular paragraph 4, imply that a duplicate
ballot paper is not to be sent
except in the circumstances there set out.
<P>

40  	In the present case the materials of 6 September 1999 include
the following:
<P>

`<i>Change of Vote or Proxy</i> Members who wish to change their minds in the
postal ballot  ... may do so by calling [a specified telephone number].  A new
voting
paper... will be sent to you, and on receipt of your instructions, your
previous vote ... will be cancelled'.  
<P>

Having regard to what I have said about the Regulation there is an issue as to
whether that procedure is permissible.  
<P>

41  	The plaintiffs also contend that the procedure is incompatible
with the secrecy of the ballot voting process, a requirement
which (they say)
is implied by Schedule 2 of the Regulation.  It seems to me that this
contention, too, is not without substance.
<P>

42  	The consequence of the plaintiffs' being right about the
retrieval of postal votes might arguably go to the integrity of the
vote.
There is every reason to expedite the hearing of that issue while it is not too
late for remedial action, if any such action
is shown to be needed and
feasible.
<P>

43  	It is true that this issue, like the issue about defective
information, might be raised and considered at the second scheme
hearing.
However, at that point the principal matter before the Court is to approve the
scheme or to deny approval.  By considering
both matters at an earlier time,
there is a prospect, either by consent of the parties or by the exercise of the
Court's relevant
powers, that the situation may be sufficiently retrieved that
members and MCU holders will be given adequate opportunity to express
their
opinions on the Restructure Proposal in a valid way while in possession of all
relevant material information.  It may be possible
to salvage something of the
process which has been embarked upon, even if the information or procedure is
found to be defective.
<P>

<b>The applicable statutory regime regarding misleading and deceptive
conduct</b>
<P>

44  	I have referred somewhat elliptically to the applicable
statutory regimes dealing with misleading and deceptive conduct, so
that the
parties may have the opportunity to consider the matter and make appropriate
submissions.  I should set out my present thinking
on that matter very briefly
so that the issue is exposed for consideration.
<P>

45  	By virtue of amendments which took effect on 1 July 1998, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>
of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> was subjected to an exception which applies
in relation to financial services (s 51AF).  Section 12DA of the<b>
</b>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1990 (Cth) (as
amended) states that a corporation must not in trade or commerce
engage in
conduct in relation to financial services that is misleading or deceptive or is
likely to mislead or deceive.  If the claim
based on misleading and deceptive
conduct relates to conduct `in relation to financial services', then s 12DA
applies and s 52 does
not.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW) does
not appear to have been similarly amended.
<P>

46  	One significance of the amendments is that the relevant
regulator under s 12DA is the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission
rather than the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.  The Commission
has the power to apply for relief, including
an order for publication of
corrective information under s 12GE.  
<P>

47  	`Financial service' is defined in s 12DA to mean, inter alia, a
service supplied in relation to a  financial product.  `Financial
product' is
defined to include a security.  Section 5(3) of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act adopts the definition
of `security' contained in the
Corporations Law.  Section 92 of the Corporations Law defines `security' by
reference to a `body',
defined in s 9 in very broad terms which would appear on
their face to encompass a co-operative.  While a NSW co-operative is `an
exempt
body' for the purposes of s 66A, it does not appear that the concept of exempt
body has any relevance to the issue before
me.
<P>

48  	Section 995 of the Corporations Law deals with misleading and
deceptive conduct in connection with any dealings in securities.
 As far as I
can see, s 995 is not confined to dealing in the securities of any particular
kind of body, and so for the purposes
of that section it appears that
securities of a co-operative are encompassed.  The word `deal' is defined in s
9 in a manner which
appears to encompass acquiring or disposing of securities
under a scheme.  It seems to follow that s 995 and s 12DA, as well as s
42 but
not s 52, would have a potential application to a case such as the present.
There may be an issue as to whether, for the purposes
of s 12DA, there is any
relevant conduct in trade or commerce, but that issue does not arise under s
995.
<P>

49  	Given these considerations, which could have significant
ramifications for other cases, I have thought it appropriate to direct
that
these proceedings be brought to the attention of the Commission, in case it
sees any need to intervene.  
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

50  	I propose to grant leave to the plaintiffs to apply under Part
31 of the Supreme Court Rules for the determination of separate
questions,
formulated in conformity with my reasons for judgment.  I also propose to grant
the plaintiffs' application for an expedited
hearing of the separate questions.
I shall adjourn until 3.30pm today to give the parties the time to consider
these reasons and
draft appropriate orders for me to make at that time.
<P>
