<b>2145/99 -  DIRECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES  v  MB &amp; 2
ORS </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore, revised 16 June 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:   In this matter the plaintiff applies by summons for
a declaration of parentage under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/" class="autolink_findacts">Status of Children Act 1996</a>
(NSW) with respect to the baby, IKG. By notice of motion filed on 28 April
1999, the plaintiff as applicant has sought orders that
an accredited
laboratory carry out a parentage testing procedure on DB and IKG pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> of the Act for the purpose of determining the paternity of IKG, and
that DB and IKG provide bodily samples accordingly.  The notice
of motion was
heard by me on 11 May 1999.
<P>

2  	In order to make the orders sought in the notice of motion, it
was necessary for the Court to be satisfied that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/socr1998290/" class="autolink_findacts">Status of Children
Regulation 1998</a>, a regulation made under the Act, could be complied with. It
became evident at the hearing on 11 May 1999 that there were two obstacles
to
compliance with the regulation. 
<P>

3  	The first related to the definition of `accredited laboratory'.
The scheme of the regulation is that a parentage testing procedure
of the kind
prescribed in clause 6 of the Regulation is taken to be carried out in
accordance with the Regulation only if carried
out at an accredited laboratory
(clause 7).  The problem with the definition of `accredited laboratory' was
that the definition required
that the name of the relevant laboratory be
published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette. The Attorney General of the
Commonwealth
no longer publishes the names of such laboratories in the
Commonwealth Government Gazette and consequently there was no accredited
laboratory and no prospect of compliance with the requirements of the
Regulation.
<P>

4  	The second problem arose out of the definition of
`representative' in the Regulation. The procedure for parentage testing
requires
that the donor (in this case both DB and IKG) provide a declaration
under clause 11(2) `immediately' before the sampler takes a bodily
sample, and
an affidavit under clause 11(1)(a) as well. By clause 11(3) of the Regulation
the affidavit and the declaration may be
completed by a representative where
the donor is under the age of eighteen years, as IKG obviously is. The
definition of `representative'
stated that, in relation to a donor under the
age of eighteen years, the word `representative' means the parent or guardian
of the
donor. The reference to guardian is irrelevant.  As far as the parents
are concerned, in this case the whole point of the  parentage
testing procedure
is to establish the identity of the father of IKG, and consequently it is not
feasible for the declaration and
affidavit to be supplied by the father. The
mother is currently in custody and the evidence before me on 11 May 1999
satisfied me
that it would not be practicable for her to supply either the
affidavit or the declaration, and indeed practically impossible for
her to
supply the declaration `immediately'' before the bodily sample of her baby was
taken.
<P>

5  	In these circumstances the plaintiff's application was stood over
on the basis that an attempt would be made to amend the Regulation
to overcome
these two difficulties. On 21 May 1999 the Status of Children Amendment
Regulation 1999 took effect. The new regulation
amends the definition of
`accredited laboratory'' by removing the requirement for the name of the
laboratory to be published in the
Commonwealth Government Gazette.  This
overcomes the first of the two problems. 
<P>

6  	As far as the definition of `representative' is concerned, the
new regulation expresses the definition to be subject to a new
subclause (4),
which is in the following terms:
<P>

`(4) The Supreme Court may appoint a person to be the representative of a donor
for the purposes of this Regulation in relation
to a particular matter if the
Court is satisfied that there is no other representative who is available who
is suitable in the circumstances.'
<P>

7  	For the reasons I have already given, I am satisfied that neither
of the parents of IKG is suitable in the circumstances to
be the baby's
representative for the purpose of complying with the requirements of clause 11
of the Regulation. It has not been suggested
that any other representative
would be available and suitable apart from the proposed representative
nominated by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff proposes that I make an order
appointing Cheryl Purchase, who is a District Officer (Aboriginal) in the
plaintiff's
Department as the representative and I am satisfied that that is an
appropriate course to adopt. 
<P>

8  	I note that the first defendant (the mother) by her solicitor has
consented to the orders sought by the plaintiff, including
this order.  The
second defendant, ICG, who has been named as the father of IKG, was not present
on 11 May 1999 and is not present
today, though there is evidence that he has
been served with the summons and notice of motion. The third defendant, DB, is
in Court
today and consents to the orders sought by the plaintiff, including
this order.  The separate representative of IKG also consents
to the orders
sought by the plaintiff, including this order.
<P>

9  	Other orders sought by the plaintiff are intended to ensure
compliance with the labyrinthine procedures prescribed by the Regulation.
I am
informed that this is the first occasion upon which the plaintiff has sought to
invoke the Regulation. In particular, the directions
which I propose to make
are intended to ensure that when my orders and directions are taken out, that
step will constitute notice
of the Court's order to the Registrar under clause
8(2)(b) of  the Regulation.  I understand that the plaintiff will today file a
form of notification for the purposes of clause 9, which obliges the Registrar
to give that notice to the person in charge of the
accredited laboratory which
he selects. The orders which I will make assume that the accredited laboratory
selected by the Registrar
will be DNALABS.HIV, a laboratory which in my opinion
on the evidence satisfies the requirements of the Regulation.
<P>

10  	The Regulation requires that a report on the parentage testing
procedure is to be sent to the Registrar, together with certain
other documents
(clause 19(6)).  I propose to direct the Registrar to provide a copy of the
report to the solicitor for the plaintiff
as soon as practicable after it is
received. Obviously there is an element of urgency in these proceedings because
the welfare of
IKG is at stake.  It is contemplated that the solicitor for the
plaintiff will then make the report or its substantive content available
to
other interested persons.
<P>

11  	My intention is that the hearing of the summons will take place
before me on 16 June 1999, and I shall so order.  I shall give
liberty to any
party to apply on forty-eight hours notice so that any interlocutory issue
which may arise can be brought to the Court's
attention at the earliest
possible time.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff has handed up a document entitled `Minutes of
Orders sought by the Plaintiff' which I have amended in the course
of
discussion with the legal representatives of the parties.  I initial and date
that document for the purposes of identification.
 I make orders and directions
1 to 10 in that document.
<P>
