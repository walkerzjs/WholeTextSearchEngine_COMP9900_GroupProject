<b>MASTER MACREADY</b>
<P>

<b>Thursday 23 September 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1052/99 STERLING ESTATES (SA) PTY LIMITED v MICHAEL BRADLEY</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  This is an application under s 459G of the
<b><i>Corporations Law</i> </b>to set aside a statutory demand dated 19
December 1998 served by the defendant upon the plaintiff.  The demand seeks the
repayment
of the sum of $110,000.
<P>

2  	The application is an unusual one in that the parties have been
in dispute since 1997 about payments due to the defendant from
the plaintiff.
The defendant's case in support of the statutory demand is one which relies,
inter alia, upon a number of alleged
admissions on behalf of the plaintiff that
the defendant is owed at least $110,000.  The admissions are said to arise in a
document
dated 19 December 1997 signed at a meeting held on that day to discuss
issues between the parties and in a letter dated 20 January
1998.  
<P>

3  	The plaintiff and the defendant in this matter are developers of
real estate and have been involved in a number of projects
together.  The
plaintiff is a 50 percent shareholder in a company called Setpave Pty Ltd
("Setpave").  The other 50 percent holder
is a company known at Fapodu Pty Ltd
("Fapodu").  Setpave is a joint venture vehicle which operates as the trustee
of the Carlton
Trust a unit trust in which the units are owned equally by the
plaintiff and Setpave.  The plaintiff in respect of its share or entitlement
from Setpave entered into subsidiary joint venture arrangements with the
defendant which apparently required contributions of capital
by the defendant
in projects undertaken through Setpave.  The defendant was a director of the
plaintiff from 1991 until January 1998.
 He is also a director of Setpave.
<P>

4  	Setpave the joint venture vehicle between the plaintiff and
Fapodu entered into a number of real estate development projects
in the period
1993 to 1998.  As part of the joint venture arrangements between the plaintiff
and Fapodu in relation to Setpave, Fapodu
was to contribute the bulk of the
funds required for each development with the plaintiff providing the remaining
funds, management
and supervision of the projects.  After a return of capital
Fapodu and the plaintiff were to share equally or as otherwise may be
agreed in
any instance any profits or losses on each project.  There was apparently no
formal joint venture instrument or written
agreement recording the terms of the
joint venture.  Three of the projects which were undertaken concerned
properties at Cromer,
Cammeray and Mona Vale.  
<P>

5  	The precise terms of the oral arrangements in respect of the
subsidiary joint venture arrangement which was entered into between
the
defendant and the plaintiff in respect of the plaintiff's share of the
development being carried out by Setpave are not in evidence.
 There is,
however, sufficient evidence to indicate that the projects required capital
contributions from the defendant and that
these would be repaid in due course.
In addition there would also be a payment between the plaintiff and the
defendant in respect
of profits or losses.  The parties are in dispute as to
the method of calculating any such profits particularly whether it should
include administration charges claimed by the plaintiff to be deductable before
arriving at the net profits of any venture.  There
also seems to be a dispute
about the number of projects in which the defendant participated with
consequent liability for losses.
 However, the evidence in this area is
uncertain given that the main evidence sought to be led on this aspect was in
inadmissible
form and was rejected.  
<P>

6  	The first project was the Cromer project to which the defendant
alleges that he contributed $86,000 in capital.  That project
was completed in
December 1994 and distributions were made.  
<P>

7  	The Cammeray and Mona Vale projects.  These are more recent and
apart from the sale of one or two units have been substantially
completed.  
<P>

8  	It is useful at this stage to turn to the admissions which are
the foundation for the claim in the statutory demand.  They arise
out of a
meeting held on 17 December 1997 to discuss the contributions.  The defendant
gave evidence in paragraph 46 of his affidavit
of the terms of the conversation
which he had with Mr Yu of the plaintiff.  Mr Yu gave his evidence of what
occurred in the discussions
in paragraph 32 of his affidavit.  There is, not
unnaturally, a difference between what is alleged.  In essence Mr Bradley's
conversation
includes what can be said to be admissions that at least $110,000
was owed for return of capital while Mr Bradley maintained that
the correct
amount was about $180,000.  Mr Bradley indicated in his conversation that
payment of $110,000 would be paid no later
than 15 March 1998.  When one looks
at Mr Yu's version he in effect asserts that Mr Bradley's contribution would
not be more than
$100,000 but that did not take account of money paid back to
him or shares of overheads or project losses.  He gives no indication
of a time
for payment.
<P>

9  	On 19 December 1997 here came into existence a note signed by Mr
Davey and Mr Yu which is attached to the affidavit verifying
the demand.  There
is also attached to that demand a letter of 20 January 1998 addressed to the
defendant, the author of which on
the face of the document is Mr Yu.  However,
the document is not signed and there is a dispute as to how this got into the
possession
of Mr Bradley.  There has also been located a further amendment of
that letter of 20 January which appears at page 37 of the affidavit
of Mr
Davey, a director of the plaintiff.  It appears to be slightly more detailed
than the one attached to the affidavit in support
of the demand but likewise it
is not signed.  In the first draft of the letter of 20 January 1988 there was
included the following:-
<P>

"The following was agreed:-
<P>

1. The equity contribution currently contributed by Bradley is in the region of
$110,000 (SESA) to $180,000 (Bradley), the actual
amount will be computed by
Justin Davey as soon as he has been able to produce a financial audit of our
accounts."
<P>

The second version is in these terms:-
<P>

"The following was agreed:-
<P>

1. The equity currently contributed by Bradley is in the region of $110,000
(SESA) to $180,000 (Bradley), the actual amount is to
be agreed with the
assistance of Justin Davey who will provide the accounting for same by no later
than 15.3.98.  The repayment of
the equity contribution to Bradley will be made
from distribution from the Mona Vale development."
<P>

11  	The are many other parts of the documents but the above is the
substantive admission said to be constituted by the document.
<P>

12  	It is necessary to see what status these documents have in order
to determine whether they might be admissions.  Mr Bradley
in his affidavit
swears that the letter of 20 January 1998 which he annexed to his statutory
demand was given to him by Patrick Yu
on or about 20 January 1998.  Mr Yu
swears it was not given by him to Mr Bradley and was prepared as a working
draft.  He denies
that he gave him any copy of the other draft of 20 January
1998 and does not know how it came into Mr Bradley's possession.  He does,
however, point out that Mr Bradley had full access at that time to all the word
processing facilities  in the plaintiff's offices.
 Mr Bradley does not deal
with how it came into his possession.
<P>

13  	For the purposes of this application it is necessary to consider
whether there might be a genuine dispute in relation to the
making of the
admissions recorded in the document.  How the document came into the possession
of Mr Bradley and whether it does constitute
an admission is something with
which the parties are at issue.  So far as the principles to be applied in
these matters are concerned
I think the most useful summation is that given by
McLelland CJ in Equity in <b><i>Eyota Pty Limited v Hanave Pty Limited</i>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 669.</a>  At page 671 his Honour made the following comments in
respect of the expression "Genuine dispute":
<P>

"It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression 'genuine
dispute' where it occurs in s.459H.  In my opinion
that expression connotes a
plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of
considerations as the 'serious
question to be tried' criterion which arises on
an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal
of
a caveat.  This does not mean that the Court must accept uncritically as
giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an
affidavit 'however
equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary
documents or other statements by the
same deponent, or inherently improbable in
itself, it may be' not having 'sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit
further investigation
as to (its) truth' (cf <b><i>Eng Mee Yong v
Letchumanan</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC 331</a> at 341), or 'a patently feeble legal
argument, or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence' (cf <b><i>South
Australia v Wall</i> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2024%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 24 SASR 189</a> at 194).
<P>

But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a Court required to
determine whether there is a genuine dispute should not
embark upon an inquiry
as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute.  There
is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute.  In <b><i>Mibor
Investments</i> </b>(at ACLC  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1066%20ACSR%20366%2d7" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1066; ACSR 366-7)</a> Hayne J said, after referring to
the state of the law prior to the enactment of Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.4</a> of the
Corporations Law, and to the terms of Division 3:
<P>

'These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in those cases, it
is not expected that the Court will embark upon any
extended inquiry in order
to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and
certainly will not attempt to weigh
the merits of that dispute.  All that the
legislation requires is that the Court conclude that there is a dispute and
that it is
a genuine dispute.'
<P>

In <b><i>Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20919" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 919</a>
at 922;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 601</a> at 605 Thomas J said:
<P>

'There is little doubt that Division 3 . . . prescribes a formula that requires
the Court to assess the position between the parties,
and preserve demands
where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine
offsetting claim.  That is not
to say that the Court will examine the merits or
settle the dispute.  The specified limits of the Court's examination are the
ascertainment
of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there is a
"genuine claim".
<P>

It is often possible to discern the spurious, and to identify mere bluster or
assertion.  But beyond a perception of genuineness
(or the lack of it) the
Court has no function.  It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more
likely than the other to succeed,
or that the eventual state of the account
between the parties is more likely to be one result than another.
<P>

The essential task is relatively simply - to identify the genuine level of a
claim (not the likely result of it) and to identify
the genuine level of an
offsetting claim (not the likely result of it).'
<P>

I respectfully agree with those statements."
<P>

14  	Given the dispute between the parties as to how the document
came to be in Mr Bradley's possession it would seem that I could
not conclude
on this application that the document had been given to Mr Bradley by Mr Yu and
therefore would, if authority was proved,
constitute an admission by him on
behalf of the plaintiff.  Indeed, the evidence is that it was a working draft
and not final.  There
are perhaps two ways in which the document may be
admissible  The first is that it is a document in the possession and control of
a party.  It is said in <b><i>Cross on Evidence</i> </b>para 33510 that a
strong case should be necessary for the reception of the document for such a
purpose.  Given the evidence of the
status of the document it is difficult to
see how it should be admissible.  It is quite a different situation to that
which concerned
the court in <b><i>Alderson v Clay</i> </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1814/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1814] EngR 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281816%29%201%20Stark%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1816) 1 Stark 405</a>,
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=171%20ER%20511" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">171 ER 511.</a>
<P>

15  	The second is that the statement is that of an agent of the
plaintiff.  In <b><i>Cross on Evidence</i> </b>at para 33540 it is asserted
that normally the statement of the agent which is tendered as an admission
must, on the preponderance
of authority, have been made to a third person, not
to the principal unless it has been adopted by the principal.  
<P>

16  	Upon closer analysis the cases cited in Cross really deal with
the issue of determining when a person is speaking on behalf
of the company
This is noted by Young J in <i>Friends Provident Life Assurance Co Ltd v
Arbitrage Financial Group Pty Ltd</i> SCNSW, 22 February 1995, Butterworths
Unreported Judgments.  <b><i>In re Devala Provident Gold Mining Company</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2022%20Ch%20D%20593A" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 22 Ch D 593A</a> is authority for the principle that a confidential report
made by an agent to a company is not admissible against the company unless
adopted by it. The case concerned a statement made by the chairman of the
company to a meeting of shareholders. Fry J states at 595-596:
<P>

"Now the rules which limit the admissibility in evidence of statements not made
on oath are somewhat stringent, and the only ground
upon which, in my view,
this statement could possibly be admitted would be that the chairman was the
agent of the company, and that
he was making the statement in the course of a
transaction with a third party in which he was acting as the agent of the
company,
and that it was within the scope of his agency.  If that were so, the
statement would be admissible against the company.  It appears
to me, however,
that it is not admissible, for it was made by the agent, not in a transaction
between the company and a third party,
but at a meeting of the company.  It is
the case of an agent making a report to his own principal, and, in my view,
when an agent
is making a confidential report to his principal the report is
not admissible evidence in favour of a third party."  
<P>

17  	Although the general principle that reports to a company must be
adopted before they can be taken as admissions by the company
is accepted law:
see, for example, <b><i>In re Djambi (Sumatra) Rubber Estates Ltd</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%20WN%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) WN 192</a>,<i> <b>Guarnaccia v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd</b></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1976/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] VicRp 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20VR%20302" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] VR

that statements made by a company chairman speaking to shareholders at a
company meeting is not speaking on behalf of the company
for the purposes of
admissibility has been doubted in<i> <b>Finance Guarantee Co Ltd v The
Commissioner of Taxation</b></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2044%20ALJR%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 44 ALJR 368</a>, <b><i>Trade Practices

FLR 174</a> and <b><i>Friends Provident Life Assurance Co Ltd v Arbitrage Financial
Group Pty Ltd</i></b> SCNSW, Young J, 22 February 1995, Butterworths Unreported
Judgments. 
<P>

18  	In <b><i>Friends Provident Life Assurance Co Ltd</i></b> Young J
also casts doubt on the analysis in <b><i>Devala</i></b> which requires that
the agent make a statement in the course of a transaction with a third party.
His Honour said, again in obiter,
that "properly analysed ...
[<b><i>Devala</i>'s</b>] principle is not focused upon the happenstance that
statements are made from one agent to another but, rather focuses on the
question
of authority".  This is supported by cases where ledgers or records
kept by employees of the company are admissible. For example,
in <b><i>Warner v
The Women's Hospital</i> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1954/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] VicLawRp 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1954%5d%20VLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1954] VLR 410</a>, Sholl J (at 413) determined that
hospital records of the admission, treatment and discharge of hospital patients
kept by hospital
staff  were documents made in the course of the employees'
duties for the purpose of constituting the hospital's records capable
of being
regarded as admissions that the particular facts and opinions therein were
accepted as accurate.  The hospital records were
akin to a diary or log. (His
Honour also went on to find that the subsequent conduct by the hospital
constituted the adoption of
the records as accurate.)  <b>Gowans J in
<i>Guarnaccia</i></b> (supra) (at 304-305) said the "characteristic feature" of
entries in records made in the course of an agent's duties was "that they
are
made for the purpose of a record to be acted upon, not as a report."
<P>

19  	On the other hand, communications or records of company
business, which can be characterised as reports to the company by an
employee
or agent acting as a principal, will not be admissible unless the company
adopts the contents of the communications.  In
<b><i>RW Miller &amp; Co Pty Ltd
v Krupp (Australia) Pty Ltd</i></b>,<i> </i>NSWSC, Giles J analyses a note made
by one employee recording a telephone conversation with another employee of the
relevant company
and an unsigned review of a business operation prepared by an
employee of the company as being records of the company's business
which were
akin to "a report by an agent to his principal [which] is not an admission
affecting the principal" and cites (at 2) <b><i>Re Devala, Guarnaccia v Rocla
Pipes Ltd</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1976/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] VicRp 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20VR%20302" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] VR 302</a><i> </i>and <b><i>General Jones Pty Ltd v
Wildridge and Sinclair Pty Ltd</i></b> (Neasey J, 12 April 1988, unreported).
In <b><i>Swann v Miller</i></b> [1919] 1 Irish Reports 151 a letter written by
an agent to its principal reporting the outcome of a conversation was held to
be a
mere narrative of events which could not bind the principal unlike a
letter which was part of the contract or <b><i>res gestae</i></b>.
<P>

20  	In<i> <b>Settlement Wine Co Pty Ltd v National and General
Insurance Company Ltd</b></i>, Full Court SCSA, 8 September 1988, Butterworths
Unreported Judgments, the Court determined that an insurance assessor's reports
directed to the insurer were not admissible on this basis although statements
made by an insurance assessor to the insured have been
treated as admissions in
<b><i>Fire and All Risks Insurance Co Ltd v Caratti (Bullfinch) Pty
Ltd</i></b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20WAR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] WAR 49.</a>
<P>

21  	The fineness of the distinction between records and reports was
noted by Sholl J in <i> <b>Warner v Women's Hospital</b></i> (at 413).  The
distinction is found in the authority given to the agent.  In making records in
the course of duties the authority
is to make observations and record opinions
on behalf of the employer.  In compiling a report the authority is to present
the agent's
version of events or the agent's opinions to the company for
consideration.  In order to determine when an agent is acting on behalf
of the
principal, that is with the authority of the principal, "one has to consider
the nature of the statement and the circumstances
in which it is made,
including, for example, the person, to whom, and the time at which, the
statement is made".  See Lord Justice
O'Connor in <b>Swann v Miller </b>at
183.
<P>

22  	In the present circumstances the actions of Mr Yu in preparing
the draft letter seem to me to be more in the nature of making
a record for the
company which it may use rather than a report to the company.  Given his
position in the company and in the negotiations
he would be acting within his
authority when preparing the document.  It would thus seem to be capable of
being an admission.  If
this were not so then it would be necessary to consider
the effect that s 87 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i></b>may have on this body of
common law dealing with internal reports to a company.
<P>

23  	Section 87 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> </b>provides:-
<P>

"87 Admissions made with authority
<P>

(1) For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a
person is also taken to be an admission by a party,
the court is to admit the
representation if it is reasonably open to find that:
<P>

   (a)  when the representation was made, the person had authority to make
statements on behalf of the party in relation to the
matter with respect to
which the representation was made, or
<P>

   (b)  when the representation was made, the person was an employee of the
party, or had authority otherwise to act for the party,
and the representation
related to a matter within the scope of the person's employment or authority,
or
<P>

   (c)  the representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common
purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had
with the party or one or
more persons including the party.
<P>

(2) For the purposes of this section, the hearsay rule does not apply to a
previous representation made by a person that tends to
prove:
<P>

   (a)  that the person had authority to make statements on behalf of another
person in relation to a matter, or
<P>

   (b)  that the person was an employee of another person or had authority
otherwise to act for another person, or (c) the scope
of the person's
employment or authority."
<P>

24  	The section seems to change a number of the common law
principles on authority of agents such as the principle that proof of
agency
cannot be found in the statement itself.
<P>

25  	The dictionary in the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> </b>is important as
it provides:-
<P>

<b>"<i>Representation</i> </b>includes:
<P>

(a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing); or
<P>

(b) a representation to be inferred from conduct; or
<P>

(c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by
another person; or
<P>

(d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated."
<P>

26  	Clearly the "working draft" was not intended by Mr Yu to be
communicated at the time it was prepared.  The Law Reform Commission
interim
report No 26 on the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> </b>noted the disparate views in the
cases on the need for the agent to have communicated the matters to someone
other than the principal.
 It suggested that such a requirement was too strict.
It did not make any recommendations in this regard but the incorporation of
the
definition of representation in a section dealing with agent's admissions
indicates that a change in the common law position
was intended.  It would seem
therefore that s 87 overturns the possible common law position.  This makes the
statement admissible
if the appropriate authority exists.  As I have said,
given Mr Yu's role in the negotiations and his position in the company, the
preparation of such a letter would be within his authority and thus the
document can constitute an admission.
<P>

27  	Given that the document is capable of being an admission the
form of words used in the later version suggest that payment will
be made from
a distribution from the Mona Vale development.  The evidence on this aspect
seems to be that there is still one unit
to be sold and hence the condition has
not yet been satisfied.  
<P>

28  	In addition on both versions the actual amount is to either be
agreed or computed.  Neither event has happened.  Until this
happens no
admission occurs particularly as the contribution is spoken of as being "in the
region of".  In the absence of any evidence
of the arrangement for repayment of
the capital the admission needs to be in clear terms.
<P>

29  	I have already referred to the hand written document which is
said to constitute an acknowledgment.  In it there are what appears
to be words
"Cromer - ..... 110/120 - 180".  It also contains other matters which obviously
reflect some of the discussions which
occurred in the 19 December meeting.
There is an inconsistency in the document in that it seems to put the amount of
capital towards
Cromer but this is not so.  Clearly from both sides of the
discussions at the meeting there is in respect of the $110,000 a reference
being made to capital for all projects.  On the face of the document itself it
does not constitute an  admission that the amount
of $110,000 was due.  To
explain the document reference has to be made to the discussions and there is a
substantial dispute between
the two parties to those discussions.  I have
already indicated that Mr Yu's version would not constitute an acknowledgment
that
the amount was presently owing or would be owing on 15 March 1998.  
<P>

30  	In these circumstances, it seems to me that there is no
admission of the amount owing.
<P>

31  	The defendant's case in respect of the statutory demand is
presented as one based upon admissions.  Given that this case has
not succeeded
it probably is not necessary to consider any alternative basis for the claim.
However, notwithstanding this, I note
the following matters on the evidentiary
basis for a claim.
<P>

1.	There is no evidence before me as to the terms of the subsidiary joint
venture agreement between the parties and thus I have
no evidence of the terms
of repayment of what are said to be capital contributions.  I cannot therefore
conclude that any such capital
contribution is presently due for repayment.
<P>

2.	In paragraph 14 of Mr Davey's affidavit there is a suggestion that the terms
of the joint venture arrangement between SESA and
Fapodu in Setpave required
Setpave's approval to repayments of capital.  That is disputed by Mr Bradley
but logic would suggest that
at least there might have to be a repayment to
SESA before a liability to Bradley arose.
<P>

3.	There is a dispute about the allocation of overheads in respect of Cromer.
Paragraph 16 of Mr Davey's affidavit shows a sufficient
level of overhead to
make a significant difference to the result but the absence of evidence of the
terms of the arrangement does
not allow one to determine that there is a
genuine dispute in this area.
<P>

4.	Losses on other projects are claimed in paragraph 17 of Mr Davey's
affidavit.  However, once again, there is no evidence of the
terms of the
arrangement and one thus cannot determine that there is a genuine dispute in
this area.
<P>

32  	Even though the case has failed on the admission claim I am not
satisfied that there is any other evidentiary basis for the
present recovery of
capital contributions.
<P>

33  	At the commencement of this case there was reference to the
question of whether Mr Davey's affidavit was sufficient to attract
jurisdiction.  No reference was made to this matter in submissions but in case
it is a live issue I will address it.
<P>

34  	The law in this regard is conveniently set out in the Judgment
of Sunburg J in <b><i>Graywinter Properties Pty. Limited v Gas and Fuel
Corporation Superannuation Fund</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/822.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 822</a>; ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20ACSR%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 ACSR, 581.</a>  At 587.8 his Honour had
the following to say:
<P>

"Is a complying affidavit a condition of jurisdiction?
<P>

 
<P>

It seems to me that s 459G(3) makes plain that the Court can entertain an
application to set aside only if within the prescribed
period an affidavit
supporting the application is filed and copies of the application and affidavit
are served.  The High Court in
Grant said that compliance with the subsection
is a limitation or a condition upon the authority of the Court to set aside a
demand;
it is a condition of the jurisdiction that subs (3) be observed; if the
condition is not observed there is no application before
the Court.  I am thus
unable to agree with the Senior Master that the failure of an affidavit to
satisfy the minimum requirements
for an affidavit to be a "supporting
affidavit" is not a jurisdictional impediment.
<P>

 
<P>

The minimum requirements in a genuine dispute case.
<P>

 
<P>

In order to be a "supporting affidavit", an affidavit must  say something that
promotes the company's case.  An affidavit which
merely says "I am a director
of the company but am too busy at present to make a full affidavit, and I will
do so later" would not
support the application.  It would in no way advance,
further or assist the company's cause, which is to have the notice set aside.
At the other extreme, the affidavit need not detail, in admissible form, all
the evidence that supports the contention of a genuine
dispute: John Holland.
That evidence must be available at the hearing of the application to set aside,
because that application is
for final and not interlocutory relief:  71 Paisley
Street.
<P>

 
<P>

In a s 459H1(a) case, the affidavit must in my view disclose facts showing
there is a genuine dispute between the parties.  A mere
assertion that there is
a genuine dispute not enough.  Nor is there a bare claim that the debt is
disputed sufficient.  It follows
from the fact that the affidavit need not go
into evidence, which is the customary function of an affidavit, that it may
read like
a pleading.
<P>

 
<P>

An affidavit which exhibits an exchange of correspondence between the parties
or between their solicitors from which it appears
that a claim is made and
rejected for reasons given can qualify as a supporting affidavit.  And an
affidavit verifying the pleadings
in an action may qualify.
<P>

 
<P>

I am thus unable to accept the respondent's submission that the affidavit must
contain sufficient material to make out a case under
s 459H.  In reply, that
submission was somewhat retreated from. It was said that the affidavit must, as
a minimum, contain a statement
of the material facts on which the applicant
intends to rely to show a genuine dispute - it might read more like a pleading
than
a story.  That accords with what I consider to be the minimum
requirement.
<P>

............
<P>

A multitude of affidavits?
<P>

 
<P>

In several cases, it has been held that an applicant is not restricted on the
hearing to the affidavit that is served with the application.
 See
<b><i>Scanhill</i></b> at 467 and <b><i>Mibor Investments Pty. Limited v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1994/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] VicRp 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 362</a> at 368.  An applicant
whose initial affidavit has satisfied the threshold test must be able to
supplement the material, because while
the "supporting" affidavit does not have
to deploy the evidence, on the hearing only admissible evidence can be relied
on.  In <b><i>Louisbridge</i></b>, Ryan J said that "provided that an affidavit
is filed and served within the 21 day period which supports the application by
providing
grounds for concluding that there is a genuine dispute... or that the
company has an offsetting claim", supporting affidavits may
be filed under the
period has expired.  Apart from Hire Works, the cases do not support the
proposition for which the applicant contended,
namely that an affidavit that
does not satisfy the threshold test can be supplemented later on.  That issue
did not arise in <b><i>Scanhill</i></b> or <b><i>Mibor</i></b>.  It did arise
in Hire Works, but for the reasons I have given, I am respectfully unable to
agree that  the Court can entertain as
an application under s 459G a case in
which an affidavit containing the minimum requirements has not been served
within time."
<P>

 
<P>

35  	Given the fact that the affidavit does not need to be in
strictly admissible form, I think it is appropriate to consider the
whole of
the affidavit, not just the part that was admitted into evidence on the hearing
before me.
<P>

36  	The relevant affidavit is that of Mr Davey.  Clearly it raises
the dispute about the admissions and also addresses most of
the substantive
matters although in an inadmissible manner.  In these circumstances it is a
sufficient affidavit to attract jurisdiction.
<P>

37  	I order that -
<P>

1.	The creditors Statutory Demand for payment of debt dated 17 December 1998
issued by the defendant to the plaintiff be set aside.
<P>

2.	The defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs.
