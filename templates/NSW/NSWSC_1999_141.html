<P>

	HER HONOUR  :  
<P>

1	Three plaintiffs sue the defendants, The Ten Group Pty Limited, and Network
Ten Pty Limited, each alleging that he was defamed
in a news item (or two
different news items) broadcast on television station Channel 10 on 26 March
1998.   The first plaintiff is
Cong Thanh Doan;   the second is Nhut Long
Trinh;  the third is Vinh Tran.
<P>

2	It makes no difference whether there was a single news item broadcast more
than once, or different news items broadcast at different
times.   The same
questions would arise whichever is the position.
<P>

3	The news item showed film images of three men and one woman.   The four were
shown walking a short distance in an outdoor setting.
  The face of one man had
been subjected to a process called "pixillating" which obscured his face.
However, his body could be seen,
and he was seen to be holding the hand of the
woman who accompanied him and who was obviously pregnant.   She was not
obscured and
her face would have been recognisable to acquaintances.   The
other two men were also identifiable. 
<P>

4	It was not disputed that the three men were the three plaintiffs.   The first
plaintiff was the man whose face was pixillated.
 
<P>

5	The film images were accompanied by the following words (or words to
identical effect):
<P>

	"One of the three men accused of murdering New South Wales MP, John Newman,
walked free to-day.   Quang Dao was released from prison
after his family
raised $1.2 million security.   In granting bail, the judge took into
consideration the fact that Dao's wife is
pregnant.   The 35 year old is
required to report twice a day to police."
<P>

6	None of the three men depicted was in fact the person identified in the
broadcast as Quan Dao.  None of them had been or has been
charged with the
murder of Mr Newman.   The unambiguous implication, however, was that the man
with the pixilated face, the first
plaintiff, was Quan Dao, the man charged
with murder.
<P>

7	The first plaintiff alleges that the broadcast conveyed the following
imputations, each of which defamed him:
<P>

	"(a)	The first Plaintiff so conducted himself that he has been charged with
murder;
<P>

	(b)	The first Plaintiff so conducted himself that he was reasonably suspected
by the police of being guilty of murder;
<P>

	(c)	The first Plaintiff so conducted himself that he was imprisoned;
<P>

	(d)	The first Plaintiff so conducted himself that he was released from prison
only because his family could raise the large amount
of $1.2 million
security;
<P>

	(e)	The first Plaintiff so conducted himself that he was required to report
twice a day to the police;"
<P>

8	The second plaintiff claims that the broadcast conveyed the following two
imputations, each of which defamed him:
<P>

	"(a)	The second Plaintiff so conducted himself that he has been charged with
murder;
<P>

	"(b)	The second Plaintiff so conducted himself that he was reasonably
suspected by the police of being guilty of murder,"
<P>

	The third plaintiff makes an identical claim.
<P>

9	On behalf of the defendant a number of objections were raised concerning the
imputations pleaded.   It is convenient to deal firstly
with those relating to
the second and third plaintiffs.   The defendant argued that the matter
complained of was incapable of conveying
either of the imputations pleaded in
relation to these plaintiffs.
<P>

10	The test to determine whether a publication has the capacity to convey
imputations pleaded is well known and has frequently been
referred to.   It was
stated by Hunt J (as he then was) in <b>Farquhar  v  Bottom</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20380" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR
380</a> and is essentially a test dependent upon the ordinary reasonable recipient
of the content of the publication, the person of fair,
average intelligence,
not perverse nor morbid nor suspicious nor avid for scandal, who is capable of
some loose thinking but also
of an appreciation of what might be conveyed other
than in the literal words (or images) of a publication.
<P>

11	Bearing that test in mind, I turn to the arguments put on behalf of the
second and third plaintiffs.   One argument was that
what is conveyed to the
ordinary average reader by a television broadcast is to be considered in the
knowledge that the broadcast
is a fleeting one not (usually) available for
repeated, more considered, viewing, as might be the case with, for example, an
unclear,
ambiguous, or confusing newspaper report.   Bearing this in mind,
these plaintiffs argued, the presentation of their images with
that of the
first plaintiff was capable of conveying the imputation that the second and
third plaintiffs were the other two men charged
with that murder.   Although it
was coincidental that there were three men depicted in the broadcast, and three
men reported to have
been charged with the murder, that coincidence reinforced
the appearance that these plaintiffs were the men charged. 
<P>

12	This analysis omits some very important additional factors.   The first of
these is that the opening words that accompanied the
pictorial matter were:
<P>

	"One of three men accused of murdering ... walked free today."
<P>

13	The clear implication from these words is that the other two men charged
with the murder remained in custody.   It is not reasonably
possible, in my
view, to torture the language as was suggested on behalf of the second and
third plaintiffs to draw from it the meaning
that the man identified by the
pixillation (wrongly) as Quang Dao, was the third of the three men charged to
be released.   Both
the opening words, and the whole of the text, are
reasonably capable only of suggesting that the remaining two men charged with
the
murder had not been granted bail and remained in custody.   Accordingly,
the pictorial image showing those two men, outdoors and
obviously at large,
accompanying the man identified as the man charged with murder and granted
bail, could not, consistently with
the text, be taken to identify them as men
charged with the murder.   A viewer who inferred that these two men were the
other two
men charged with murder would be drawing an inference that
contradicted the words in the broadcast.
<P>

14	Added to this is the effect of the use of the pixillation technique on the
image of the first plaintiff.   The ordinary reasonable
viewer would infer from
this that the man whose image was obscured was the man charged with the murder;
 those whose images were
not obscured would not be so identified.
<P>

15	In my opinion the most that any viewer could have drawn from the broadcast,
concerning the second and third plaintiffs, was that
they were in some way
associated with, and supporters of, the man whose image was obscured.   I am
therefore of the view that neither
of the imputations pleaded in relation to
the second and third plaintiffs is capable of being conveyed by the matter
complained of
and they should be struck out.
<P>

16	I propose to make such an order, and, unless I am persuaded that leave
should be granted to the second and third plaintiffs to
amend, the appropriate
order which follows is that there should be a verdict for the defendant on the
causes of action represented
by each of those imputations.
<P>

17	After hearing the argument of counsel in relation to the imputations pleaded
by the first plaintiff, counsel for the plaintiffs
sensibly acknowledged that
reconsideration could be given to their drafting, and possible redrafting.   It
is therefore not necessary
at this stage to rule on these objections, although
if resolution cannot be reached between the parties, I will do so.
<P>

18	The only order I make at present is that the imputations pleaded by the
second and third plaintiffs are struck out.
