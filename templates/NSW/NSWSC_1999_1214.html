<P>

<b>117254/97 - ESTATE OF DOROTHY EDITH BOEHM;  JAMES ROBERT FUGGLE  V  ANDREW
NICHOLAS SOCHACKI</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore;  revised 8 December 1999)</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

<b>Introduction </b>
<P>

1  	Dorothy Boehm died on 27 June 1997.  Probate in common form of
her will dated 2 July 1993 (`the last will') was granted on 2
September 1997 to
the executor named in the will, her solicitor Andrew Sochacki. Her estate
comprised her house at 40 Kolora Way,
Ocean Shores, valued for probate purposes
in 1997 at $152,000, furniture and personal effects valued at $3,765 and about
$39,000
in current accounts.
<P>

2  	She had no children and both her husband and her de facto partner
had died many years before her death.  By her last will she
gave pecuniary
legacies of $5,000 each and specified personal effects to Mark Faulkner, Honor
Faulkner and Timothy Faulkner.  Timothy
Faulkner is the son of the half-brother
of the deceased and was her closest living relative at the time of her death.
Mark and Honor
Faulkner are Timothy's children.  All three live in England.
<P>

3  	She gave her house at Ocean Shores to Monica Paron, her carer,
and another pecuniary legacy to her goddaughter, Caroline Davies.
 She gave the
residue of her estate to Mark, Honor and Timothy Faulkner and Monica Paron in
equal 25 per cent shares.  It is evident
that the value of the residue is low
in view of the specific gift of the house and the pecuniary legacies.
<P>

<b>The proceedings</b>
<P>

4  	By a Statement of Claim filed on 7 November 1997 and subsequently
amended, the plaintiff brought proceedings as attorney of
Timothy Faulkner
seeking revocation of the grant of probate and (inter alia) an order that
probate of an earlier will made on 6 August
1992 (`the 1992 will') be granted
to him, on the ground that the deceased was not of sound mind, memory and
understanding at the
time of making the last will.   The defendant as executor
of the last will has contested these proceedings.
<P>

5  	The 1992 will was very similar to the last will, the main
differences being that it contained an additional pecuniary legacy
of $2,000 to
Marie Hayes, a former neighbour of the deceased, and the specific gift to Mrs
Paron was of the house then owned by the
deceased, but sold prior to the making
of her last will, namely, the house at 53 Fingal Street, Brunswick Heads.  No
doubt the plaintiff's
expectation is that if the 1992 will is admitted to
probate, the specific gift of the house will be ineffective since the named
property
was not owned by the deceased at the time of her death, and the house
at Ocean Shores will be treated as part of the residue of the
estate in which
Mark, Honor and Timothy Faulkner, as well as Mrs Paron, each have a  25 per
cent interest.
<P>

<b>Background facts</b>
<P>

6  	The deceased was born, Dorothy Edith Faulkner, in England in
1908.  She had no brothers and sisters.  Her mother died when she
was three,
and her father subsequently married Florence Faulkner (`Mrs Faulkner', to whom
the deceased occasionally referred as &#180;Bubbles').
 The deceased married
Frederick Biggerstaff, from whom she separated in 1948, though without a
divorce.  He died in 1950, though
it appears the deceased did not become aware
of this fact.  In 1949 she emigrated to Australia and her father and Mrs
Faulkner joined
her here about eight months later.  In the early 1950s the
deceased met Erwin Edward Boehm and commenced a de facto relationship
with him.
She eventually came to be known as Mrs Boehm, though they never married.  They
lived in the Blue Mountains near Sydney
until the late 1950s when they moved to
Brunswick Heads.  After the deceased's father died in 1962, her stepmother
moved to Brunswick
Heads and lived with the deceased, though she spent some
time in England as well. Mr Boehm died in 1977, and Mrs Faulkner died on
20
January 1986.
<P>

7  	From that time on the deceased was very lonely.  She was in
contact with her longstanding neighbours Mr and Mrs Hayes and with
her third
cousin, Rosalie May Faulkner-Camden (`Mrs Faulkner-Camden', whose nickname was
`Bud').  She also had regular contact with
Monica Paron.  Mrs Paron was
employed by Home Care Service, who had assigned her in 1984 to take care of Mrs
Faulkner, after the
deceased had fallen and broken her hip and was unable fully
to care for her stepmother.  Initially Mrs Paron provided two hours of
housework once a week, but that increased when Ms Faulkner became ill.  Mrs
Paron and the deceased became close and after Mrs Faulkner
died Mrs Paron
continued to provide two hours housekeeping per week and also visited the
deceased as a friend, sometimes having dinner
with her and occasionally
sleeping over.  This arrangement continued until 1992, as I shall record.
<P>

<b>Contact with relatives</b>
<P>

8  	Timothy's ex-wife Patricia Mary Faulkner, (`Patricia Faulkner')
visited the deceased and her stepmother in May 1985, and the
deceased wrote
several friendly conversational letters to her during 1986 and 1987.  Patricia
Faulkner sent the deceased a Christmas
card in 1993 and inquired about her
during that year, but there is no other evidence of correspondence or contact
between her and
the deceased.  Since the attempts at contact in 1993 occurred
after Mrs Faulkner-Camden's long visit to the deceased (which happened
in
1992), they could well have been as a result of communication between Mrs
Faulkner-Camden and Patricia Faulkner.  
<P>

9  	Similarly, Timothy and Honor Faulkner wrote to the deceased's
solicitor in February and March 1993, but there is no evidence
of communication
at other times after 1985 apart from the evidence of the visit to which I shall
refer.  Once again their communications
in 1993 may have occurred after contact
between them and Mrs Faulkner-Camden, though there is no direct evidence on
that point. 
In December 1989 Timothy and Mark Faulkner travelled to Australia
and visited Brunswick Heads.  There is conflicting evidence as
whether they
made actual contact with the deceased.  I shall return to that.
<P>

<b>Wills and financial management, 1985-1991</b>
<P>

10  	During the period from 1985 to 1991 the deceased made  three
wills, dated 4 April 1985, 16 February 1989 and 23 September 1991.
 In the 1985
will the residuary beneficiary was Patricia Faulkner, and Mrs Faulkner, Mark
and Honor Faulkner received pecuniary legacies.
 In the 1989 will Patricia
Faulkner and Mrs Paron received pecuniary legacies ($10,000 and $20,000
respectively), Mrs Hayes received
a pecuniary legacy of $2,000 and Mark and
Honor Faulkner received pecuniary legacies of $7,000 each as well as 37.5 per
cent each
of the residue of the estate (the remaining 25 per cent going to
another beneficiary about whom there is no evidence).  In the 1991
will Mrs
Paron, Mrs Hayes, Mark and Honor Faulkner received pecuniary legacies in the
same amounts as the earlier will, while Mark
and Honor Faulkner each received
37.5 per cent of residue and the remaining 25 per cent residue went to Mrs
Faulkner-Camden.
<P>

11  	By the time of her stepmother's death, the deceased herself was
a woman of advancing years and she sought and obtained assistance
from her
solicitor and her accountant with respect to her financial affairs.  She
granted a power of attorney to Mrs Sochacki by
deed dated 24 August 1998. Mr
Sochacki explains that when that arrangement was put into place he and Mr John
Robinson, her accountant,
attended to her accounting needs, including the
filing of tax returns and the drawing of cheques for the payment of bills.
<P>

<b>Contact with Mrs Faulkner-Camden, 1991-92</b>
<P>

12  	In 1991 the deceased visited Ms Faulkner-Camden in Sydney on two
occasions.  Then in 1992 Mrs Faulkner-Camden came to visit
the deceased in
Brunswick Heads for a period of about seven to ten weeks, beginning on 16 May
1992. Mrs Faulkner-Camden says that
she made the visit after Mrs Paron phoned
to say the deceased's mental condition was deteriorating.  But I find it
unlikely that
Mrs Paron would have said this in view of the latter's evidence
that late in 1992, the deceased was an able and intelligent woman
who
understood and took part in conversations, though she had occasional losses of
short term memory.  
<P>

13  	The deceased had a hernia operation complicated by an attack of
influenza or pneumonia early in July 1992.  Mrs Faulkner-Camden
was still
staying in the deceased's house when the operation occurred but she left
shortly afterwards.  She wrote to Mr Sochacki
on 4 July 1992 from the house,
saying that `urgent business in Sydney' would compel her to leave shortly.  Her
recollection in oral
evidence was she did not do so, but the letter is in
evidence.
<P>

14  	The deceased made a new will on 26 June 1992.  The will was
executed at the office of Mr Sochacki.  The deceased was accompanied
there by
Mrs Faulkner-Camden.  By this will the pecuniary legacies to Mark and Honor
Faulkner were reduced to $5,000 each, the legacy
to Mrs Paron was reduced to
$17,000 (and specific bequests of chattels were added) and legacies were given
to Timothy Faulkner ($5,000),
Mrs Faulkner-Camden ($15,000), and Caroline
Davies ($5,000).  The pecuniary legacy for Ms Hayes was increased to $15,000
and she
was given specific bequests of some chattels.  The residue was divided
into equal 20 per cent shares given to Mark, Honor and Timothy
Faulkner, Mrs
Faulkner-Camden and the New South Wales Cancer Council.
<P>

15  	The circumstances in which the will of June 1992 arose are
recounted in Mr Sochacki's affidavit of 29 October 1999. According
to his
evidence on this point, which I accept, he went with his secretary, Mrs Curtis,
to the deceased's home to take instructions
for that will on 21 June 1992.
When he arrived Mrs Faulkner-Camden handed him a list, which is in evidence.
That document, which
bears the date 19 June 1992, is addressed `Dear Andrew',
and although it is not signed it appears to be in the same hand as other
documents which were prepared by Mrs Faulkner-Camden.  It purports to be a
`rough inventory of &#180;some goodies'' which in Mrs
Faulkner-Camden's opinion
were of some value.  It deals with items in the house in considerable detail.

<P>

16  	There was conflicting evidence as to whether it was proper to
describe this document as an instruction to Mr Sochacki.  In
my opinion, not
much turns on this.  The document is not in terms an instruction to Mr Sochacki
for the purpose of preparing the
will, but is rather more than merely a set of
unathoritative suggestions.  Given the circumstances in which it was handed
over, Mrs
Faulkner-Camden clearly intended that although she was not Mr
Sochacki's client, Mr Sochacki would use the document for the purpose
of
preparing the will.  
<P>

17  	Mr Sochacki's evidence is that during the course of taking
instructions Mrs Hayes, the next door neighbour (who is a friend
of Mrs
Faulkner-Camden) was present for part of the time and Mrs Faulkner-Camden was
present for most of the time.  At one stage
Mrs Faulkner-Camden went around to
the house pointing at various items of furniture and other articles, saying to
whom the items
were to go.
<P>

18  	Mrs Faulkner-Camden's interest in the deceased's testamentary
dispositions is confirmed by other evidence.  In the letter to
Mr Sochacki of 4
July 1992, to which I have referred, she expresses concern about safety of the
contents of the house if it is unattended,
and also expresses an interest in
the deposition of its contents. Specifically she confesses to an interest in a
grand picnic hamper.
 
<P>

19  	Also in evidence is a document in Mrs Faulkner-Camden's hand
which is unaddressed but bears on the back of the last page a
date stamp for 25
May 1992, which according to evidence was affixed in Mr Sochacki's office. This
document began `I wish to be present
at all times with Dorothy.  I feel it only
fair if you have a witness so should she request I am present at all interviews
please.'
 The letter asked that she be made a trustee or co-executor so she
could be involved in `policing her affairs'.  It asked that Mrs
Paron be
interviewed to express her request for inclusion in Dorothy's will.  The
document is not hostile to Mrs Paron but it expresses
an apprehension that she
may find that attending to Dorothy's needs would become too much of a burden.
The letter also gives an account
of Mrs Faulkner-Camden's constrained financial
situation.  
<P>

20  	It is difficult on the evidence to draw any firm conclusion as
to the purpose for which that document was prepared or as to
the manner in
which it came to be received in Mr Sochacki's office. However, at least one
thing is clear.  In my opinion the document
confirms Mrs Faulkner-Camden's
considerable interest in the testamentary dispositions of the deceased's assets
and her desire to
have a role in the process of distribution of the estate.
<P>

<b>Events after Mrs Faulkner-Camden's visit in 1992</b>
<P>

21  	When the deceased was discharged from hospital in July 1992
arrangements had been made for respite care.  However, according
to Ms Paron's
evidence, which I accept, she formed the view that as the deceased was still
taking antibiotics and seemed to be still
quite sick it would be inappropriate
for her to look after herself in a hostel. She said she took the deceased to
see Dr Holmes,
who cancelled the arrangements for respite care, and she then
took the deceased to her own home.  The deceased continued to live
with Mrs
Paron for the ensuing ten months or so, although she returned to her house at
Brunswick Heads during the day on a frequent
basis.  Mrs Paron and members of
her family assisted the deceased to move out of the Brunswick Heads house and
it appears that some
chattels which the deceased no longer wished to retain
were sold for the benefit of the deceased. There is no suggestion that Mrs
Paron acted in any way improperly in doing so.
<P>

22  	After Mrs Faulkner-Camden returned to Sydney from Brunswick
Heads she continued to be concerned about the disposition of the
deceased's
assets and the situation which obtained in Brunswick Heads.  It appears she
contacted Home Care Service who wrote her
a letter to assure her that Mrs Paron
had not acted improperly and had at no time any involvement in the making of
wills.  The terms
of the letter give rise to the inference that Mrs
Faulkner-Camden had expressed concern to Home Care Service on those matters.
The
letter continued that while there was no suggestion of impropriety that was
room for a possible conflict of interest, and so arrangements
had been made for
Mrs Paron to work with Mrs Boehm privately, with the blessing of Mr Sochacki.
The letter from Home Care Service
is not dated, but it seems to me probable
that it was written in the latter part of 1992. In any event Mrs Paron ceased
to work for
Home Care Service at some time in 1992 and thereafter she continued
to care for the deceased on a private basis.  Her evidence, which
I accept, is
that while they were living together in Mrs Paron's house the deceased paid for
some parts of housekeeping and she paid
for other matters.  Subsequently, after
orders were made in the Protective Division in the manner to which I shall
refer, Mrs Paron
was paid $75 per week by the manager of the estate, Mr
Robinson, for the deceased's food, medicine and other expenses.
<P>

<b>The making of the 1992 Will and the sale of the Brunswick Heads house</b>
<P>

23  	On 31 July 1992 the deceased came to see Mr Sochacki at his
office.  She told him that she wished to change her will, and according
to Mr
Sochacki's evidence the deceased said that the previous will had been made
`under duress from my cousin Bud'.  She told Mr
Sochacki that she wanted Mrs
Faulkner-Camden out of her will.  The evidence does not make entirely clear the
reasons for the antagonism
which the deceased had developed towards Mrs
Faulkner-Camden, but obviously a strong antagonism existed at that point.
Specifically,
it is not clear to me whether there were some other events not
the subject of evidence, beyond Mrs Faulkner-Camden's behaviour in
the manner
which I have outlined, though it may be that this behaviour would itself have
been sufficient to antagonise the deceased.
<P>

24  	Mr Sochacki took instructions for the making of a new will and
they were reflected in the 1992 will, the contents of which
I have already
summarised.  I should reiterate, however, that the important changes were that
Mrs Paron was to receive the house
at Brunswick Heads and that the previous
substantial bequest in favour of Mrs Faulkner-Camden were removed.
<P>

25  	The deceased had contemplated for some time that she would sell
her house at Brunswick Heads.  It was a two-storey house and
her limited
mobility made it difficult for her to manage the stairs.  Eventually the house
was sold with settlement occurring on
16 March 1993.  She purchased the house
at Ocean Shores by contract dated 29 March 1993, settlement occurring on 16
April 1993. 
Mr Sochacki acted for her.  Obviously 1993 was already, prior to
the events to which I am about to refer, a year of substantial activity
and
presumably stress for the deceased.
<P>

<b>The Protective Division proceedings</b>
<P>

26  	Early in March 1993 Mr Sochacki became aware that Mrs
Faulkner-Camden had approached the Legal Aid Commission for assistance
with
respect to a proposed application to the Protective Division to place the
deceased's affairs under management under the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a>
(NSW).
<P>

27  	On 16 June 1993 Mr Sochacki telephoned the deceased to report on
a conversation which he had had with Mr Tunbridge of Legal
Aid.  He told her
that Mr Tunbridge would be sending documents with respect to the Protective
Division application.  The deceased
became upset and insisted on a meeting with
Mr Sochacki, and a meeting was duly arranged for later that day. The summons in
the Protective
Division proceedings was taken out in June 1993, originally
returnable on 7 July 1993. Documents, presumably including the summons,
were
served on Mr Sochacki on 17 June 1993.
<P>

28  	It is evident that the effect of the initiation of the
Protective Division proceedings on the deceased was dramatic, and the
antagonism which appears to have already existed in her mind towards Mrs
Faulkner-Camden was exacerbated.  She filed an affidavit
in the Protective
Division proceedings in which she said this:
<P>

`I am perfectly capable and I stress with great emphasis and indignation that I
am perfectly capable of charting the path of my
future and of making decisions
in respect of my future and in choosing the people whom I want to look after my
affairs.  I am also
perfectly capable of choosing my friends and/or carers and
I resent the unqualified or unwarranted, uninvited interference from my
third
cousin Rosalie May Faulkner-Camden.  I have a very good and close friend,
confidant and carer, Monica Paron, who has been looking
first after my mother,
and now after me for a period of some nine (9) years.  She is a person I love
and trust implicitly.'
<P>

29  	Thus by June 1993 the disruption to the deceased's life which
had begun in the previous July with her operation and illness
and her move out
of and subsequent sale of the Brunswick Heads property, took a significant
further turn for the worse because of
the Protective Division proceedings and
her consequent determination to make her own decisions about the disposition of
her property.
<P>

30  	The Protective Division proceedings ultimately led to orders
made by the Deputy Registrar in December 1993 declaring that the
deceased was a
person who was incapable of managing her affairs and ordering that the estate
of the deceased be subject to management
under the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act
1983</a> (NSW), making other consequential orders.  However, those orders were not
the product of a full contested hearing, since eventually
the deceased decided,
on advice of her counsel and Mr Sochacki, that she should not contest the
matter because of the stress  and
cost involved.
<P>

<b>The signing of the last Will</b>
<P>

31  	On 18 June 1993 the deceased consulted Dr Norbert Weber.  Doctor
Weber interviewed the deceased with Mrs Paron and was subsequently
asked to
attend when she signed a further will.  Instructions for the further will,
which was her last will, were given to Mr Sochacki
when he met with her on 16
June 1993.  It must be remembered that this was about the time when she was
first made fully aware of
the Protective Division proceedings.  Mr Sochacki
says that at the time of giving instructions the deceased said, `I must be very
careful with my will because I am leaving my house to Monica.  My cousins and
various other distant relatives may cause trouble in
respect of this will.'
According to his evidence the deceased told him that `all they could speak of
is what it is I will leave them
in my will.'
<P>

32  	Mr Sochacki prepared the last will and arranged for the deceased
to execute it on 2 July 1993.  He also took precautions to
prepare for that
occasion having regard to what had been said to him by the deceased.  Present
at the time of the execution of the
will were Dr Weber, Mr Robinson, Mrs Curtis
(Mr Sochacki's secretary), and Mr Sochacki.  The will was witnessed by Mrs
Curtis and
Dr Weber.  Mr Sochacki, Dr Weber, Mr Robinson and Mrs Curtis have
all given evidence as to what occurred before the will was signed
by the
deceased.  It emerges from that evidence that before she signed the will Mr
Sochacki spoke to her for the purpose of ensuring
that she understood the
document.  He took her through the will clause by clause and asked her whether
she understood each clause
after he had read it to her.  At some stage in the
process, probably after working through the whole of the will, he asked her
whether
she realised that she was leaving her real estate, being a major asset,
to Monica Paron, her friend and carer. The deceased replied
in the affirmative.
He also asked her whether anyone including Monica Paron had exerted any
pressure on her to leave the house to
Mrs Paron and the deceased replied
`certainly not'.  The will was then executed.  The evidence of those who were
present is that
she appeared to them to understand what she was doing.
<P>

33  	After the execution of the last will the deceased continued to
live at Ocean Shores with Mrs Paron and Mrs Paron's evidence,
which I accept on
this point, is that after a while the deceased had increasing problems with her
hip.  By 1995 Mrs Paron was unable
to assist her to wash herself due to a back
injury and it was decided that the deceased would move into nursing home at
Lismore.
 After the deceased moved into the nursing home Mrs Paron continued to
visit her regularly and during those visits the deceased recognised
her.
<P>

<b>The law</b>
<P>

34  	In those circumstances the sole question for the Court to
resolve is whether at the time when the last will was made the deceased
had the
testamentary capacity to make it.  The law on the subject is not relevantly
contested.  The starting point is the judgment
of Sir Alexander Cockburn CJ
in<b> </b><i>Banks v Goodfellow</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281870%29%205%20QB%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1870) 5 QB 549.</a>  His Lordship said (at
565):
<P>

`It is essential to the exercise of [testamentary] power that a testator shall
understand the nature of the act and its effects,
shall understand the extent
of the property of which he is disposing, shall be able to comprehend and
appreciate the claims to which
he ought to give effect, and with a view to the
latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections,
pervert
his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties -
and that no insane  delusions shall influence his will in
disposing of his
property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound,
would not have been made.'
<P>

35  	Most of the cases on the subject deal with circumstances where
it is alleged that the testator suffered from a delusion which
poisoned his
affections towards someone who otherwise would have been a natural object of
bounty.  There is an element in the evidence
in the present case, to the effect
that the deceased became highly antagonistic towards Mrs Faulkner-Camden and
decided to prefer
her loyal friend Mrs Paron both in the 1992 will and (by
continuation) in the last will, upon which the plaintiff based a submission
that this was such a case.  But the main thrust of the present case relates to
the former part of his Lordship's observation, that
is, the simple question
whether the deceased was able to understand the nature of the act of
will-making and its effects in the context
of the property of which she was
disposing.  Perhaps the case which comes closest to the present case in a
factual way is the decision
of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in<b>
</b><i>Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Baker</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/244.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 244</a> (16 July 1999),
where the allegation of testamentary incapacity arose out of the testatrix's
cerebral haemorrhage, and not only out
of allegations of delusional beliefs
about those with a natural claim on her bounty.  That case shows, however, that
the principles
which emerge from<b> </b><i>Banks v Goodfellow</i> and
subsequent cases are nonetheless applicable in such circumstances.
<P>

36  	Counsel for the plaintiff has relied on several propositions of
law which I accept for the purposes of this judgment.  The
first is that
unsound mind for the purpose of establishing a lack of testamentary capacity
may take the form of general mental imbalance.
 This is established by
<i>Perpetual Trustee Co v Baker</i> and also by another case relied on by both
counsel,<b> </b><i>Re Estate of Griffith, Easter v Griffith</i> (Court of
Appeal New South Wales, unreported, 7 June 1995).  Secondly, any delusion which
affects the will makes the entire will
invalid (<i>Woodhead v Perpetual Trustee
Co Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 267).</a>  Thirdly, where in the light of the
medical evidence it appears that the deceased suffered from an affliction which
was relevant
to testamentary capacity, the onus is on the propounder of the
will to show that the deceased's mental state did not influence the
will
(<i>Bull v Fulton</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1942/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1942] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281942%29%2066%20CLR%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1942) 66 CLR 295).</a>  In such cases the question is
whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to establish affirmatively that
the testator was of
sound mind when the will was executed (<i>Timbury v
Coffee</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1941] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281942%29%2066%20CLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1942) 66 CLR 277</a>, 283;<b> </b><i>Woodhead</i> at 273).
<P>

37  	A particular issue on the facts of this case is whether the
orders made in the Protective Division proceedings should be taken
to determine
the issue of testamentary capacity.  As I have mentioned, they were made by
consent.  It may be arguable, nonetheless,
that an issue estoppel arises out of
the Court's declaration that the deceased was incapable of managing her
affairs.  However, any
such estoppel does not bear directly upon the issue for
determination in this case.  The question of incapacity to manage affairs
which
arises under the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a><b> </b>1983 (NSW) is not the same
as the question which arises when the issue is about testamentary capacity.
Specifically it is not hard
to imagine cases (and perhaps this is one of them)
where it is possible to conclude that a person is incapable of managing their
affairs but nevertheless of sound mind, memory and understanding to the extent
required to enable that person to make a valid will.
<P>

38  	I should mention one other point of law.  During the hearing I
inquired of counsel whether either party submitted that the
deceased's
testamentary capacity was different on 16 June 1993 when instructions were
given from 2 July 1993 when the will was executed.
 And if there was such a
submission, I inquired, which would the law identify as the relevant date for
the purpose of determining
testamentary capacity?  Counsel for the plaintiff
referred me to a passage from <i>The Laws of Australia</i>, Law Book Co,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1999%20Ch%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1999,
Ch 4</a>, Pt A, Div 3, paragraph [65], according to which: 
<P>

`If a testator was of sound mind at the time of giving instructions and not at
the time of the execution, the will will be admissible
to probate if at the
time of execution the testator was aware that he or she was executing a will
for which he or she had previously
given instructions'.  
<P>

39  	Several authorities are given for that proposition, including<b>
</b><i>Parker v Fellgate</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%208%20PD%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 8 PD 171.</a>
<P>

40  	However, in the view I have taken of the facts it is unnecessary
for me to determine that issue.  For the reasons which I shall
give, my
conclusion is that the deceased was sufficiently of sound mind, memory and
understanding that she was capable of both giving
instructions on 16 June 1993
and of executing the will on 2 July 1993.
<P>

41  	An allied issue, whether the level of understanding which must
be proved for the making of a new will may be reduced if the
new will is
similar to a previous will not under challenge, also does not need to be
decided.  This is because, in my opinion, the
deceased had the requisite
testamentary capacity even to exclude an object of bounty in June and July
1993, as well as it to confirm
an exclusion which had been achieved in a
previous will.
<P>

42  	In these circumstances the question of testamentary capacity is
to be determined with respect to the evidence of the deceased's
capabilities in
the period June-July 1993. The evidence before me comprises medical evidence
and lay evidence and I shall consider
them in turn.
<P>

<b>Medical Evidence</b>
<P>

43  	I was impressed by the evidence of Dr Hugh Fairfull-Smith, who
swore affidavits on 4 November 1998 and 4 November 1999 and
gave oral evidence.
He is a specialist geriatrician who has had 13 years' experience specifically
related to assessment of people
with varying degrees of dementia.
<P>

44  	He saw the deceased in 1987 and again on 23 June 1993. He
expressed the opinion in his report of 30 June 1993 that the deceased
had a
mild to moderate degree of dementia  affecting her ability to make judgments
based on details.
<P>

45  	His evidence distinguishes between the forgetful phase of
dementia and the confused phase to which it progresses. He says that
the
initial symptom of the form of dementia known as Alzheimer's disease is short
term memory loss which gradually expands from simple
things (for example,
misplacement of an object) to more severe forgetfulness (for example, that a
cousin has died; or to refer to
the facts of this case, that friends have
recently visited).  It progresses to the confused state when the patient has
difficulty
in dressing, gets lost in her own house, and experiences day/night
disorientation.  Eventually the dementia proceeds to a third phase
when the
patient is completely demented and is in a vegetative state.  The basis for Dr
Fairfull-Smith's conclusion that the deceased
had reached only the forgetful
stage was his interview with the deceased and a test which he performed.
<P>

46  	In his interview the deceased showed him what he described as
`excellent social knowledge'.  He said she was aware of the things
of most
significance to her and was able to remember things that had some emotional
context.  In his observation she was able to
function socially and determine
how she would spend her day.
<P>

47  	He observed some elements of forgetfulness such as her inability
to recall the Prime Minister's name, and poor orientation
to place, and to some
extent time.  However, he found her to have good problem solving skills and
visuo-facial orientation.  
<P>

48  	The test which he applied was the mini-mental status examination
of Blessed and Tomlinson.  In 1987 she had scored 30 out of
34.  By 1993 her
score was 19 out of 34, principally because of deficit in short-term memory.

<P>

49  	On the basis of his observations and that test, he concluded
that she retained the ability to manage her affairs in a broad
sense, she was
able to communicate and make a stable choice, and could grasp the significance
of information.  However, she would
have difficulty recalling all relevant
information and would only be able to get the gist of things, though she would
be able to
use that to manipulate her position rationally to a logically
consistent conclusion.  He specifically disagreed with Dr Holmes' assessment
that she had advanced senile dementia.
<P>

50  	Doctor Fairfull-Smith agreed that there may be day-to-day
fluctuations in the performance or ability of a person with senile
dementia.
Improvements could be brought about, he said, by some good event.  Likewise,
stress elements could make the patient appear
worse.  Then when the stress was
taken away the patient would revert to a better state.  He said that in the
right surroundings and
circumstances the deceased, in a position of comfort
with people with whom she was familiar, not feeling threatened or rushed, would
be capable of making a rational decision.
<P>

51  	Counsel for the plaintiff drew my attention to some evidence of
Dr Fairfull-Smith in cross-examination, in which he had admitted
that while it
was possible that she could make a rational decision on a given day such as 2
July 1993, he could not say with any
certainty that she was in fact capable of
making a rational decision on that day.  It seems to me, however, that Dr
Fairfull-Smith's
evidence in  cross-examination is entirely consistent with his
affidavits and goes no further than the affidavits on this question.
 The
condition of the sufferer of dementia depends on the circumstances which obtain
on the particular occasion when an assessment
is needed.  Doctor Fairfull-Smith
based his answer to the cross-examiner on the statement that he was not there
on 2 July.  Considering
his evidence as a whole it appears to me he was
reasonably confident that her disease had not progressed so far as to prevent
her
from ever making a rational decision and in the right circumstances she
would be capable of doing so.
<P>

52  	I was also impressed by Dr Fairfull-Smith's general manner.  It
appears to me that he would be able to put a patient at ease
and create an
environment in which an accurate assessment of her capabilities could be
undertaken.  The description of the interview
in his report of 30 June 1993
indicates in my mind that he did so when he saw her on 23 June.
<P>

53  	Doctor Fairfull-Smith's evidence is consistent with the evidence
given by Dr Weber.  Doctor Weber is a general practitioner
who cannot be
expected to have the level of expertise of senile dementia possessed by Dr
Fairfull-Smith. Nevertheless, he did have
the opportunity of examining the
deceased on 18 June 1993 and perhaps more significantly, attending at Mr
Sochacki's office on 2
July 1993 and witnessing the will.  His somewhat
impressionistic evidence was that on 2 July, observing the deceased, he was
confident
that she was capable of making her own decisions.
<P>

54  	The medical evidence for the plaintiff was given by Dr Petroff
and Dr Holmes.  Dr Petroff's report was dated 11 October 1993,
relating to his
examination of the deceased on 23 September 1993.  This examination arose out
of orders made by Hodgson J in the
Protective Division proceedings, on an
application by the Legal Aid Commission.  Hodgson J had taken the view that
since there was
clearly a dispute about the capability of the deceased to
manage her affairs, the Court would be assisted by further assessment.
 Mr
Tunbridge, the solicitor for the Legal Aid Commission, confirmed that Dr
Petroff would be available and Dr Petroff was accordingly
appointed.  Dr
Petroff is a psychiatrist whose expertise is in dealing with mental disorders
including depression and schizophrenia.
<P>

55  	Alzheimer's disease is a physical disease affecting the brain.
Doctor Fairfull-Smith gave evidence, which I accept, that one
would normally
refer a patient with senile dementia to a geriatrician rather than to a
psychiatrist.  That is consistent with Dr
Petroff's own evidence to the effect
that he had not treated a patient whose sole illness was Alzheimer's disease
without any other
components of mental disorder.  Nevertheless, though a
patient with Alzheimer's disease would typically be treated by a doctor other
than a psychiatrist, it appears on the evidence that a psychiatrist is an
appropriate person to assess the effect of such a disease
on the level of
understanding of the patient.  In that sense Dr Petroff as an expert whose
opinion is to be carefully considered.
<P>

56  	Dr Petroff found that the deceased was disoriented as to time,
not knowing the year, the month or even the season. She did
not know where she
lived and mentioned Brunswick Heads, which was her previous place of abode.
She was unable to recall Dr Petroff's
name, despite being told what it was and
wrongly identified him as the tax man or someone sorting out her will.  She had
profound
impairment of recent memory and could recall virtually nothing of the
conversation which had occurred previously in the consultation.
 He said she
had a very pleasant, placid demeanour giving one the impression of a person in
control, but in his opinion she was severely
disoriented.  He said it was
fairly pointless discussing matters with her as it only tended to upset her. He
noted her belief that
the Protective Office would cause a man to live with her
and to tell her what to do.  He found that she had Alzheimer's disease with
dementia of moderate severity and that she was certainly not able to manage her
own affairs.  In reaching this conclusion he was
influenced by his observation
that she could very easily be taken advantage of.
<P>

57  	Some aspects of Dr Petroff's evidence have caused me disquiet.
Observing him in the witness box, I noticed he was inclined
to speak rather
quickly and at times not clearly. The explanation which Dr Petroff gives in his
report of the interview, reinforced
by his oral evidence, implies that nothing
about the interview would have put her at ease or relieved her stress or made
her feel
comfortable.  It appears from his report that at least a significant
part of the interview related to her financial affairs. He told
her - he says
he did so on four occasions - that he was there to `assess' her fitness to
manage her affairs, and he inspected her
cheque butts.  Her interpretation that
the interview was with the `tax man' may not therefore be surprising.  
<P>

58  	The interview with him was the result of orders by the Court
which had been opposed by the deceased. In these circumstances,
while she was
undoubtedly disoriented during the interview, it seems to me that the
disorientation may not have been as extreme as
the `delusion' to which the
cases refer.  The interview with Dr Petroff is an application of the prediction
made by Dr Fairfull-Smith,
that the reaction of the deceased would be affected
by her surroundings and that she may well be disoriented when under stress.
While
I do not reject Dr Petroff's evidence I am inclined to discount his
conclusion to the extent that it is inconsistent with the conclusion
of Dr
Fairfull-Smith.
<P>

59  	Dr Holmes was the deceased's general practitioner from 1984
until May 1993.  He gave evidence that she suffered from `advanced
senile
dementia', recording that she was unable to remember the details of day-to-day
activities and had lost her short term memory.
 I regard Dr Holmes' evidence as
consistent with the opinion of Dr Fairfull-Smith, except in one respect.  The
difference is that
Dr Fairfull-Smith, on the basis of his knowledge and
experience, describes the condition as mild to moderate in the forgetful phase
of dementia, whereas Dr Holmes, relying essentially on observation of
forgetfulness, describes the condition as advanced.  I prefer
the evidence of
Dr Fairfull-Smith.
<P>

<b>Non-medical evidence</b>
<P>

60  	The defendant relies on the evidence, described above, of those
who were present when the last will was signed. In my opinion
it is more likely
than not that the circumstances in which she signed the last will were
conducive to rational decision-making, in
terms of the criteria explained by Dr
Fairfull-Smith.  She knew the people who were there, and was familiar with the
surroundings.
 The meeting was conducted by Mr Sochacki, whom she trusted.  And
most importantly, the meeting was arranged at her request and she
wanted to be
there.  
<P>

61  	The plaintiff relies on a number of incidents observed by Mrs
Faulkner-Camden and Mrs Hayes.  It seems to me that most of those
incidents are
consistent with Dr Fairfull-Smith's diagnosis that the deceased was in the
first stage of dementia, for they are accounts
of various kinds of the
forgetfulness.  Thus, Mrs Hayes gives evidence that on at least one occasion
the deceased discovered an account
which was very old and expressed concern
that it had not been paid, and that she misplaced her keys on several
occasions.  Mrs Hayes
also gives evidence that the deceased forgot that she had
had visitors on the same day, that she could not remember, during her trip
to
the airport to visit Mrs Faulkner-Camden in 1991, that she was heading to the
airport and assumed that her destination was a hotel,
and that in 1992 she
persistently forgot that her destination with Mr Faulkner-Camden and Mrs Hayes
was Jupiters Casino.  I accept
that these events occurred, and that they
indicate a significant level of forgetfulness referable to dementia, but I do
not, in view
of Dr Fairfull-Smith's subsequent diagnosis, take them as implying
that the deceased had moved beyond the forgetful phase of the
disease.
<P>

62  	I am apprehensive about some aspects of Mrs Faulkner-Camden's
evidence.  She was very much concerned with the destination of
the deceased's
estate, as I have said.  She had an interest, though not necessarily a direct
pecuniary interest, in presenting the
deceased's mental state in a bad light.
She gave evidence in the Protective Division proceedings to the effect that the
deceased's
house was in a dirty state, but that is inconsistent with the
evidence of Ms Paron and the fact that Mrs Paron assisted in the cleaning
of
the house on a regular weekly basis. I therefore conclude that Mrs
Faulkner-Camden's evidence on that point, not repeated in the
affidavits in
these proceedings, was untrue.  Her evidence in the present proceedings was not
consistent on all points and in particular,
she gave an unconvincing account of
the origin and destination of the documents which became Exhibits D 2 and D 3.
In the circumstances
I regard it as unlikely that the deceased failed to
remember Mrs Faulkner-Camden's identity, and also unlikely that Mrs
Faulkner-Camdem
found the deceased's wallet in the oven.  But even if Mrs
Faulkner-Camden's evidence on this point is accepted, it would not show
in
light of all other evidence that the deceased had moved beyond the forgetful
phase.
<P>

63  	The evidence of Mark Faulkner is that he visited the deceased
with his father Timothy at a nursing home in Brunswick Heads,
and that she
could not remember where she had put things and did not recognise his father or
himself. Mrs Paron gave evidence that
the deceased received a letter from
Timothy Faulkner which was posted to her from Sydney to the effect that he had
come out to visit
her and that he did not see her because he was running late.
I find the evidence of Mark Faulkner unsatisfactory.  It is a very short
affidavit, and naturally enough Mr Faulkner was not available to give oral
evidence, and the affidavit attributes the wrong location
to the nursing home.
I found Mrs Paron to be a witness of truth and I accept her evidence.  I
conclude that it is  unlikely that
Timothy and Mark Faulkner made contact with
the deceased during their 1989 visit and therefore I reject the evidence of her
state
of mind which they purported to give.
<P>

<b>Particular instances of alleged delusion</b>
<P>

64  	Counsel for the plaintiff invited the Court to find that there
were specific items of evidence which established that the deceased
was
deluded.  Apart from matters to which I have already referred, he placed
particular emphasis on some matters reported by Dr Fairfull-Smith
in his report
of 30 June 1993.  According to Dr Fairfull-Smith the deceased said that she had
been sent some letters which, she understood,
asserted she was `off her head'.
She said, `I am aware of my cousin in Sydney wanting my money, I would rather
it went to a cat's
home than any of them getting it.'  Dr Fairfull-Smith says
that the deceased explained to him that most of her relatives were in
England,
that she had had very little contact with them for several decades, and that
she never had a good relationship with them.
 She explained that her cousin in
Sydney was the only relative in Australia.
<P>

65  	In my opinion these statements of the deceased to Dr
Fairfull-Smith do not signify any state of delusion.  It is clear that
by June
1993 the deceased was extremely antagonistic towards Mrs Faulkner-Camden.  I
infer that her antagonism must have extended
by that time, at least to a
degree, to Mrs Hayes, because Mrs Hayes and Mrs Faulkner-Camden were good
friends, and Mrs Hayes had
been present during Mrs Faulkner-Camden's visit in
1992 when questions of destination of the deceased's assets were discussed.  I
also infer that Mrs Faulkner-Camden saw herself as a spokesperson for the
English relatives and must have been understood by the
deceased in that light.
Therefore, when the deceased talked about `them' getting her money, she
probably had in mind the English
relatives, represented by Ms Faulkner-Camden,
and possibly also Mrs Hayes.  Her assertion that she had never had a good
relationship
with her English relatives is contrary to the evidence.  But in
the state of mind which had been induced by the Protective Division
proceedings, it is not surprising that she would have magnified the antagonism
she felt towards Mrs Faulkner-Camden as the representative
of the English
relatives to a degree which would have caused her to disregard the earlier
history of their relationship, or exaggerate
the breakdown of the relationship.
In any event while the relationship does not appear to me to have been bad
during the 1980s, it
was certainly not a close relationship with the English
relatives directly and could plausibly be described as `not a good one'.
<P>

66  	It appears to me that the antagonism which the deceased felt
towards Mrs Faulkner-Camden, and through her the English relatives,
had an
objective basis which cannot be described as an irrational.  After all, Mrs
Faulkner-Camden antagonised her in 1992 in a manner
which caused her to exclude
Mrs Faulkner-Camden personally from the 1992 will, and in 1993 Mrs
Faulkner-Camden had deepened the upset
which the deceased already felt by
initiating the Protective Division proceedings, and at about the same time the
deceased's solicitor
was contacted by the English relatives.  Looking at those
things together, a rational testatrix may well have decided that she should
take steps to ensure that her loyal friend received the property which was
intended for her, and that this property should not pass
to her relatives.
Perhaps the only slightly surprising aspect of the last will is that the
English relatives figured in it at all.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

67  	I conclude, weighing the medical and lay evidence together, that
during the period June to July 1993 the deceased, though under
stress because
of the Protective Division proceedings, and highly antagonistic towards Mrs
Faulkner-Camden, had a sound mind, memory
and understanding in the sense
required for her to make a valid will.  Consequently the proceedings must fail.
I shall hear argument
from the parties with respect to costs.
<P>

<b>Costs (after hearing submissions)</b>
<P>

68  	The plaintiff seeks an order that costs be paid out of the
estate or that the parties be left to bear their own costs, notwithstanding
that he has been unsuccessful in the proceedings.  He makes submissions on
three bases.  
<P>

69  	First, he refers to a well-known exception to the rule that
costs should follow the event, in the field of probate litigation,
that where
the testator has been the cause of the litigation, the costs of unsuccessfully
opposing probate may be ordered to be paid
out of the estate:  <i>Re Hodges</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20708" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 708</a>, 709.  In the present case there is no proper basis for
applying this principle.  The testator did not engage in any intentional
conduct which created the problem which has been the subject of the litigation,
which has arisen out of her mental disease. 
<P>

70  	Secondly, the plaintiff relies on another exception to the
normal rule about costs, that if the circumstances led reasonably
to an
investigation in regard to the document propounded as the will, the costs may
be left to be borne by those who respectively
incurred them:  see <i>Re
Hodges</i> at 709.  The plaintiff says that Dr Petroff's reports, the first
with respect to the Protective Division proceedings and the second
confirming
his opinion in the context of the present proceedings, led reasonably to an
investigation into the testamentary capacity
of the deceased and produced this
litigation.  But I have found that on the basis of the medical and lay evidence
the testator had
the mental capacity to make the will.  In my opinion a
comparison of the medical evidence of Dr Petroff and Dr Fairfull-Smith would
lead to the reasonable conclusion that the evidence of the latter was to be
preferred to the evidence of the former, both because
the reports indicate the
contrasting environments in which the deceased was assessed by the doctors and
also because it was evident
from the reports and surrounding circumstances that
Dr Fairfull-Smith had a superior level of experience as well as relevant
expertise.
<P>

71  	Finally, the plaintiff seeks to invoke the Court's discretion by
referring to two matters.  The first matter is that the executor
chose to apply
to and obtain probate in common form, although in the plaintiff's submission
the better course would have been to
seek probate in solemn form.  That  may
well be so, but it seems to me that whether the parties were as present aligned
or on the
other sides of the record the results would have been the same.  The
absence of an application for probate in solemn form has not
affected the
outcome.
<P>

72  	The plaintiff also refers to some correspondence from which it
emerges that in October 1999, not long before the hearing, the
plaintiff
offered to settle the matter on the basis that the proceedings be dismissed
without any order as to costs.  But by that
time, the defendant had presumably
incurred significant costs in respect of which there was no offer of
reimbursement.  
<P>

73  	In all the circumstances, therefore, it appears to me the proper
order is that the plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

74  	I order that the Statement of Claim be dismissed and that the
plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.
