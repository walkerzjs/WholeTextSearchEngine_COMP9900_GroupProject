<b><u>30066/98 - LEWIS &amp; ANOR. v REGISTRAR CONSUMER CLAIMS TRIBUNAL &amp;
ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HER HONOUR:  </b>    In these proceedings the plaintiffs, Michael and
Maree Lewis, seek an order setting aside a determination made by a referee in
the Consumer Claims Tribunal in proceedings commenced against them by Ideal
Roofing Pty Ltd, the second defendant.  A declaration
is sought that the
plaintiffs were denied natural justice in the proceedings before the
Tribunal.
<P>

2	The plaintiffs appeared in person in the proceedings before me.  Maree Lewis
is admitted to practice as a solicitor and she conducted
the proceedings on
behalf of herself and her husband.
<P>

3	In April 1996 the Lewises were renovating their home at 12 Westringia Place,
Gymea Bay.  They obtained a quote from Ideal Roofing
Pty Ltd for the
installation of a new roof at those premises.  The quote obtained from Ideal
Roofing was for the supply and installation
of a "0.60 Colorbond custom orb
sheeting curved to radius" roof.  On or about 29th April 1996 the plaintiffs
accepted the defendant's
quotation.  Thereafter it appears that work commenced
on the installation of the roof. That work was attended by delays.  The reason
for those delays is a matter of controversy as between the parties.
Ultimately, and prior to the completion of the roof, the plaintiffs
purported
to terminate the contract.  At the time this was done the roof as installed
comprised a corrugated G300 0.60 thickness
roof supplied by Stramit Industries.

<P>

4	It appears that proceedings were first commenced before the Consumer Claims
Tribunal by the plaintiffs seeking an order relieving
them from having to pay
the second defendant the sum of $15,980 being the price upon which they had
agreed for the installation of
the roof.  Subsequently the plaintiffs withdrew
those proceedings.  Thereafter the second defendant commenced proceedings
before
the Tribunal seeking to recover monies due to it in respect to the
supply and installation of the roof. The claim was brought under
Part 3A of the
<b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act 1987</b> which makes provision for building
claims including claims for the supply of building goods or services. 
<P>

5	Central to the issues before the referee in the subject proceedings was the
contention that the plaintiffs had contracted for
the installation of a roof
made of BHP's custom blue orb factory curved sheeting.  The roof as installed,
namely the G300 corrugated
0.60 sheets, was not factory curved but rather
sprung curved on site.  The plaintiffs considered that the BHP product was
superior
to that produced by Stramit Industries. The original quote was for
"0.60 Colorbond custom orb sheeting curved to radius". The plaintiffs
sought to
establish that this was clearly a reference to sheeting wholly produced by BHP.
They led evidence before the referee to
establish that "custom orb" is a BHP
trademark. The second defendant led evidence from two witnesses to the effect
that "custom orb"
is a generic term used with reference to curved Colorbond
roofs. The roof as installed comprised steel manufactured by BHP but corrugated
by Stramit Industries. A complicating factor was that the description in the
quote did not accurately fit the BHP product in that
BHP 0.60 factory curved
sheets are correctly described as "custom blue orb". BHP's "Custom orb" does
not come in thickness 0.60.

<P>

6	The proceedings appear to have occupied hearing time before the referee at
the Consumer Claims Tribunal on a number of occasions.
 Oral evidence was given
and a number of expert reports were tendered.  The referee invited the parties
to present written submissions.
 In the light of the fact that Mrs Lewis is
legally qualified the referee allowed the second defendant to be represented.
He reserved
his decision.  He had before him both the second defendant's claim
together with what was described as a cross-claim by the plaintiffs.
This is
annexure "T" to the affidavit of Maree Lewis sworn on 25th June 1998.  In this
cross-claim the plaintiffs sought an order
for payment in an amount of $18,500
being the costs of removing the sprung curved Stramit roof and replacing it
with a BHP custom
blue orb factory curved roof together with some associated
costs.  
<P>

7	On 1st June 1998 the referee's determination was handed down. He found that
"custom orb" although a BHP trademark is a generic
term used to describe curved
Colorbond roofs. He accepted the Lewis' evidence that they had wanted only the
BHP product and that,
had they been aware the sheeting was corrugated by
another company, they would have had nothing to do with it. However, he
rejected
any attempt to distinguish the BHP and Stramit products in terms of
quality. He found the product used on the plaintiffs' roof to
be at least equal
to BHP "custom blue orb" sheeting. He rejected the plaintiffs' cross claim. The
second defendant had conceded that
the plaintiffs were entitled to credit for
certain work not done leaving its claim as one for the payment of $12,425. The
referee
allowed the second defendant's claim in the amount of $11,000. He
discounted the total sum claimed to reflect the circumstance that
the second
defendant should have been more careful in its tender and ought to have put the
plaintiffs on notice of its intention
to use a non-BHP corrugated product.
<P>

8	As to the scheme of the Act generally, I note the observations of Simpson J
in <b>Archcom Pty Ltd and Consumer Claims Tribunal and Ors </b>(unreported,
29th September 1995):
<P>

	"At the outset it is worth recalling that the Act `has set up a system for the
speedy and inex"pensive disposal of certain claims,
limited in amount, arising
out of contracts for the supply of goods or the provision of services by a
person carrying on (or holding
himself out as carrying on) the business of
supplying such goods or providing such services'.  (<b>Singer v Statutory
Officers Remuneration Tribunal </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%205%20NSWLR%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 5 NSWLR 633</a> per Hunt J).  Those
remarks were made in the context of the predecessor of the Act, a 1974 Act by
the same title, but they apply
equally to the Act.  Underpinning the Act is a
policy of providing expeditious access to an inexpensive and informal process
for
the resolution of consumer disputes involving relatively small amounts of
money."
<P>

9	Section 34 of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</b> 1987 provides that an
order of a tribunal is final and binding on all parties to a consumer claim
that is heard and determined by
it and no appeal lies in respect of its orders.
Section 12 of the Act immunises the Tribunal from judicial review save for
matters
caught by sub-section (2).  That subsection is as follows:
<P>

	"(2) A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind 
<P>

	referred to in sub-section (1) if, in respect of a consumer claim:
<P>

	(a)	a Tribunal has given a ruling under Section 26 or refused or
<P>

	failed to give such a ruling after the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
<P>

	to hear and determine the claim has been disputed by a party
<P>

	to the claim and the ground on which the relief or remedy is
<P>

	sought is that:
<P>

	(i)	the ruling was erroneous, or
<P>

	
<P>

	(ii)	the Tribunal erred in refusing or failing to give the ruling
<P>

			after its jurisdiction was disputed, or
<P>

	
<P>

	(b)	a Tribunal has made an order under Section 30 and the ground on
<P>

	which the relief or remedy is sought is that:
<P>

	(i)	the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or
<P>

	(ii)	in relation to the hearing or determination of the claim, a
<P>

			party to the claim had been denied natural justice."
<P>

	
<P>

10	The plaintiffs' claim is of a denial of natural justice within the meaning
of s.12(2)(b)(ii).  
<P>

11	Mrs Lewis referred me to a number of decisions of this Court touching on the
scope of the concept of a denial of natural justice
for the purpose of this
provision.  In particular my attention was drawn to <b>Carpet Fashion Pty Ltd v
Consumer Claims Tribunal</b> (unreported, NSWSC Ireland J, 20th October 1992),
<b>Archcom</b> referred to above, <b>Ciciwill Pty Ltd v Consumer Claims
Tribunal &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20737" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 737</a>, <b>Maxwell-Smith v Consumer Claims
Tribunal &amp; Anor</b> (unreported, NSWSC Greg James J, 8th December 1998).

<P>

12	It was the plaintiffs' contention that a denial of natural justice may be
made out by demonstrating that the Tribunal had no
logically probative material
before it on which to base its findings.  In this respect  reliance was placed
on a passage in <b>Introduction to Australian Administrative Law,</b> <b>Dr M
Allars Butterworths (1990)</b> at p.236 where it is suggested that there are
three principles which comprise procedural fairness; the hearing rule, the bias
rule
and the no evidence rule.  The latter Dr Allars observes is of
comparatively recent development. This principle requires that a decision
be
based on logically probative evidence.
<P>

13	Ireland J in <b>Carpet Fashion</b> accepted that the requirements of natural
justice for the purpose of s.12(2)(b)(ii) of the Act do demand that a referee
base his
decision on logically probative evidence. 
<P>

14	Simpson J in <b>Archcom </b>referred to this proposition at pp.27-28 but did
not find it necessary to express a view on whether the "no evidence" rule was a
component
of natural justice for the purpose of the subsection.  In that case
it was sufficient for her Honour to observe that even accepting
that the rules
of natural justice did impose such a requirement there was evidence before the
referee which was logically probative
on the question.  
<P>

15	The decision in <b>Ciciwill</b> turned on the failure of the referee to give
reasons that complied with the requirements of s.34A of the Act. In that case
Hulme
J expressed his general agreement with the view expressed by Simpson J in
<b>Archcom </b>in rejecting the proposition that the obligation to give reasons
is an incident of the obligation to accord natural justice.  His
Honour went on
to note that the Act imposes an obligation to give reasons in s.34A. In that
case the referee's reasons did not deal
"with the substantial issues raised by
the unsuccessful party". His Honour concluded that the obligation imposed by
s.34A of the
Act will, at least normally, extend to reasons why, in the face of
significant evidence to the contrary, a claimant should be believed
(p.752).

<P>

16	In <b>Maxwell-Smith</b>, Greg James J observed that the referee in that case
had complied with what his Honour described as the test in <b>Ciciwill</b>. It
should be noted that his Honour explicitly refrained from deciding whether a
breach of natural justice might be founded on the
lack of adequate reasons;
p.11. 
<P>

17	Mr Newlinds who appeared for the second defendant submitted that the
so-called "no evidence" rule was not a component of natural
justice for the
purpose of s.12(2)(b)(ii) of the Act.  For a tribunal to arrive at a finding on
the basis of material that was not
logically probative may amount to an error
of law but would not be a denial of natural justice. 
<P>

18	The issue of whether the no evidence rule is a component of natural justice
is the subject of some debate (the authorities tending
for and against are
summarised in <b>Judicial Review of Administrative Action, Aronson &amp; Dyer,
LBC, 1996</b> at pp.388-392). In the approach I take to the present matter it
is not necessary to decide the issue. 
<P>

19	The evidence before me on the hearing of this matter comprised an affidavit
of Maree Lewis sworn on 25th June 1998 to which there
were a number of
annexures.  Those annexures included the referee's reasons for decision, the
written submissions prepared by Mrs
Lewis and placed before the referee
comprising 75 typewritten pages, together with various attachments to those
submissions which
are referred to therein.  Expert reports prepared both on
behalf of the plaintiffs and the second defendant were also among the annexures
to Mrs Lewis' affidavit. A further affidavit sworn by Mrs Lewis on 26th October
1998 was read together with the affidavit of her
husband, Michael John Lewis,
sworn on 24th June 1998.  A video tape recording a segment from "The
Investigators" television programme
relating to a complaint about a sprung
curved roof was also in evidence before me.  Mr Newlinds did not object to the
tender of this
material but indicated, in a general way, that it was his
contention that none of the factual material surrounding the dispute was
relevant to the issues for determination.  
<P>

20	Mrs Lewis contended, firstly, that the referee had failed to consider the
contents of expert reports which were in evidence 
before him.  This she
submitted in the circumstances was a denial of natural justice.  Further, she
submitted that the referee had
failed to give reasons as he was required to do
pursuant to s.34A of the Act and, in this respect, she relied on the decision
in
<b>Ciciwill</b>.  Although her principal challenge was said to be on the "no
evidence" point, Mrs Lewis also contended that there had been a denial
of
natural justice arising out of the refusal of an adjournment and because of a
reasonable apprehension that the referee was biased.

<P>

21	I will deal firstly with the natural justice challenge arising out of the
latter two submissions. In the initial proceedings
brought by Mr and Mrs Lewis
the second defendant  sought to obtain an order from the Tribunal directing the
Lewises to allow access
to their premises for the purpose of the preparation of
an expert report.  Mrs Lewis was of the view that the Tribunal lacked power
to
make such an order.  The matter had been listed for hearing on this issue alone
on 13th December 1996.  Prior to that day Mrs
Lewis developed a severe case of
whooping cough.  She wrote to the Tribunal enclosing a medical certificate and
asking that the proceedings
be adjourned.  That application was not granted.
Mr Lewis attended the Tribunal on 13th December 1996 and it appears that the
referee
directed that he and his wife give access to the second defendant and
its building expert to inspect the roof.  Subsequently, by
letter dated 3rd
January 1997 which was annexure "L" to Mrs Lewis' affidavit, Mrs Lewis wrote to
the Registrar of the Consumer Claims
Tribunal.  In that letter, amongst other
things, she challenged the direction given by the referee as being without
power.  She also
addressed a number of evidentiary issues going to the merits
of her claim.  
<P>

22	The Registrar of the Tribunal wrote to Mrs Lewis on 15th January 1997,
annexure "M" to her affidavit, responding to the matters
raised in her letter
of 3rd January.  The Registrar stated that the referee had requested that she
convey to the plaintiffs a number
of matters. These included an assertion that
it had been inappropriate to canvass evidentiary matters in correspondence with
the
Tribunal and that any challenge to a ruling such as the direction
concerning the building inspection should be brought in this court
pursuant to
s.12(2) of the Act. It appears that shortly after the receipt of this letter
the original proceedings were discontinued
by the plaintiffs.
<P>

23	The claim commenced before the Tribunal by the second defendant came on for
hearing before the same referee.  Evidence had already
been given  before him
on the plaintiffs' earlier claim.  His reasons for decision of 1st June 1998
record:
<P>

	"It was agreed at the outset of the hearing of the present claim that all the
evidence taken in the earlier hearing before me would
be evidence in these
proceedings".
<P>

24	The plaintiffs conceded that this was so.  
<P>

25	Before me, Mrs Lewis contended that the refusal of an adjournment in the
earlier (discontinued) proceedings constituted a denial
of natural justice with
respect to the subject proceedings.  She referred to the decision of Rolfe J in
<b>Hutley v Meigan &amp; Ors.</b> (unreported, 19th December 1996) in this
regard.  It was her submission that since the evidence in the initial
proceedings had been
adopted by consent in the later proceedings they, too,
were infected by the original denial of natural justice.  In <b>Hutley v
Meigan</b>, Rolfe J found that a failure to grant an adequate adjournment to
enable a party to consider a cross-claim of which he had not received
notice
prior to the second day of the hearing constituted, in the circumstances of
that case, a denial of natural justice.  The facts
of <b>Hutley v Meigan</b>
are very far removed from the facts in the present case.  In particular, the
refusal of the adjournment complained of related to
proceedings which were
discontinued.  It is difficult to see how that refusal can ground a complaint
as to denial of natural justice
with respect to the subject proceedings.  One
way in which it was sought to do so was to contend that the refusal, when seen
in conjunction
with the referee's comments conveyed to Mrs Lewis in the
Registrar's letter of 15th January 1997, were together such as to give rise
to
a reasonable apprehension of bias.  
<P>

26	No application was made to the referee that he disqualify himself on the
ground of apprehended bias. Mrs Lewis, as noted above,
is a solicitor. She
impressed me as articulate and forthright in the presentation of her case.  Her
failure to invite the referee
to disqualify himself is in the context of the
submission now advanced before me notable. I do not consider that the
circumstances
surrounding the adjournment, together with the letter from the
Tribunal, would give rise to an apprehension in the mind of a fair
minded
person that the referee was biased. 
<P>

27	I do not consider there is any substance to the complaint that the
plaintiffs were denied natural justice arising out of either
the refusal of the
adjournment in the earlier proceedings or the contents of the Tribunal's letter
of 15th January 1997.        
<P>

28	I turn now to the submission that the referee's reasons were so inadequate
as to not constitute reasons for the purposes of s.34A
of the Act.  This ground
was advanced in conjunction with the "no evidence" challenge.  Section 34A is
in these terms:
<P>

	"(1)  There is to be noted on the official record of a tribunal in respect of
a 
<P>

	consumer claim the tribunal's reasons for:
<P>

	 (a)	any ruling given by the tribunal with respect to its jurisdiction to
<P>

	hear and decide the claim, and
<P>

	(b)	any order made by the tribunal in respect of the claim (other than
<P>

	an interim or ancillary order made under s.30).  
<P>

	(2)	The reasons are to be as brief as is reasonably practicable in the 
<P>

	particular case".
<P>

	
<P>

29	In this case, as noted above, the referee took time to consider his
decision.  He handed down his reasons on 1st June 1998. 
They comprised twelve
typewritten pages.  After reciting some introductory matters, the referee
purported to summarise both the claimant's
case and the respondents' case.
Thereafter he set out in some detail the thrust of the written submissions
prepared by Mrs Lewis.
 He then dealt with the claimant's response to the
allegations made by Mr and Mrs Lewis.  He then summarised the evidence of Mr
Austin,
a building expert, who had prepared a report at the request of the
second defendant. Thereafter he noted in point form the evidence
said to
support the second defendant's claim.  Then he canvassed the law as it applied
to his determination and finally he recorded
his findings. 
<P>

30	The attack made by Mrs Lewis is based on the circumstance that the referee
did not refer, in terms, to items of evidence which
were of significance in the
case made by the plaintiffs.  In this regard particular emphasis was placed on
the following matters:
<P>

	*    The finding that although "custom orb" is a BHP trademark, it has become
a generic term in reference to curved Colorbond roofs
(p.11).
<P>

	*    The rejection of the plaintiff's submission that the second defendant
knew, or ought to have known, that the roofing sheets
should have been
mechanically curved to radius at the factory (p.11).
<P>

	*    The finding that, given the sheets had been delivered to the site and
left there prior to installation, if the respondents
had felt aggrieved they
should have voiced their concerns at the time and not waited until the bulk of
the work was completed and
the associated observation that even if the
plaintiffs' concerns as to the inadequacy of the sprung curved sheets were
legitimate
they would be estopped by their conduct from taking that position
now (pp.11/12). 
<P>

31	As to the first matter Mrs Lewis acknowledged that there had been evidence
that "custom orb" is a generic term used to describe
curved Colorbond roofing
sheets. She submitted that the referee should have rejected this evidence since
the Stramit Industries brochure
about their product did not describe it as
"custom orb". 
<P>

32	As to the second matter Mrs Lewis submitted that the referee appeared to
have ignored material tendered on the plaintiffs' behalf
such as the BHP
manual, expert reports from Mr Bateman, structural engineer, and Bradley Trott,
architect. I note, however, that
it is clear that there was expert evidence
before the Tribunal tending the other way.
<P>

33	As to the third matter Mrs Lewis submitted that this overlooked evidence
given before the referee to the effect that she and
her husband had queried a
man by the name of Benecke, who I understand was a sub-contractor retained by
the second defendant, as
to whether the sheets delivered to the site were
"curved to radius".
<P>

34	On the most generous view of the content of natural justice for the purpose
of s.12(2)(b)(ii) the matters agitated by Mrs Lewis
as set out in (1) - (3)
above would not found a successful challenge. It is not that there was no
evidence to support the findings
which were made but rather the complaint is
that the referee ought to have preferred the evidence relied on by the
plaintiffs.  
<P>

35	In general it was Mrs Lewis' contention that the referee's failure to refer
to the reports of Mr. Bateman, the structural engineer
retained by the
plaintiffs, and Mr Trott, the architect who prepared the specifications for the
roof, and the technical material
comprising BHP brochures, standards prepared
by the Australian Standards Association and the Stramit brochure, were
omissions of
such material significance that the referee's reasons failed to
meet the requirements imposed by s.34A of the Act. From this failure,
in
conformity with <b>Ciciwill</b>, it might be inferred that the referee had
failed to give consideration to this important body of evidence and this
constituted a
denial of natural justice. 
<P>

36	In paragraphs numbered 1-12 under the heading "Respondents' Contentions" the
referee summarised each of the matters of substance
which had been agitated
before him on the Lewises behalf. In this respect it might be thought that the
present case differs from
<b>Ciciwill</b>. It was not necessary for him to
refer to each expert report and item of oral evidence and record his findings
with respect to it.
 Section 34A of the Act does not impose such a requirement
nor does the common law; <b>Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10
NSWLR 247</a></b>. 
<P>

37	The true burden of the plaintiffs' complaint seems to me to be more a
submission that the referee's findings were against the
weight of the evidence
rather than that there was no logically probative evidence to support the
findings that he made. I should
perhaps note that on the material before me I
do not suggest that the plaintiffs have established a credible basis for the
latter
conclusion. 
<P>

38	I consider the circumstances of this case fit  within the observations made
by Greg James J in <b>Maxwell-Smith</b> where he said:
<P>

	"The case appears to me, on the material provided, to be one in which
unsuccessful parties formed the view that a decision adverse
to them had to be,
because it was adverse to their interests, wrong, biased or in bad faith".
<P>

39	Assuming, as I am prepared to for the purpose of these proceedings, that a
denial of natural justice for the purposes of s.12(2)
of the Act might be made
