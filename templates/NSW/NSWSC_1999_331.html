<b>4396/96	MURIEL BETTY ELLIOTT - TUTOR FOR STEPHANIE RAE ELLIOTT &amp; ORS
-v-   CLIVE HENRY LONGSTAFF - ESTATE OF JOHN GEORGE ELLIOTT</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   In my reserved decision published on 10
March 1999 I stated that at the conclusion of the hearing Counsel for the
respective parties
requested that I make no order as to costs until I had
published my decision in the matter and the parties had had an opportunity
of
making submissions concerning costs in the light of that decision.  I have
today heard argument as to costs.
<P>

2   	The two areas of dispute between the parties relate,
firstly, to the costs in respect to the claim of the late Stephanie Rae
Elliott, who was one of the plaintiffs when the proceedings were originally
instituted but who died on 14 September 1998 before the
matter came on for
hearing; secondly, to the costs in relation to a mediation which was conducted
on 7 September 1998.
<P>

3   	It is submitted on behalf of the surviving plaintiff,
Muriel Betty Elliott, who was successful in the substantive proceedings,
that
the costs relating to the claim of her daughter Stephanie Rae Elliott should
also be paid out of the estate of the late John
George Elliott (to whom I shall
refer as "the deceased"), and, further, that the costs which will be awarded to
at least the plaintiff
Muriel Betty Elliott and to the defendant Clive Henry
Longstaff should include the costs of the mediation.
<P>

4   	There was no dispute between the parties that Muriel Betty
Elliott should receive out of the estate of the deceased her costs
on the party
and party basis and that the defendant should receive out of the estate his
costs on the indemnity basis.  
<P>

5   	The fact that one of the plaintiffs died before the matter
came on for hearing and that the cause of action died with that
plaintiff does
not, of itself, preclude the estate of that deceased plaintiff from obtaining a
costs order in its favour.
<P>

6   	There has been placed before me in the present application
evidence concerning the mediation, and over the objection made on
behalf of the
defendant, I have admitted evidence of the result of that mediation.  
<P>

7   	The deceased plaintiff was successful in the mediation and
the parties agreed that an order in her favour should be made by
the Court.
The matter was listed for the making of such an order on 17 September 1998.
However, three days earlier, on 14 September
1998, Stephanie Rae Elliott died.
In those circumstances it seems to me that the estate of that deceased
plaintiff is entitled to
have a costs order made in its favour.
<P>

8   	The other area of dispute related to the costs of the
mediation.  I have already referred to the fact that in the mediation
the
deceased plaintiff was successful.  Her mother, Muriel Betty Elliott, as a
result of the mediation would not have received any
benefit greater than that
given to her under the will of the deceased.  However, in the substantive
proceedings, which were heard
by me on 23 November 1998, Mrs Muriel Elliott was
substantially successful. 
<P>

9   	There is no doubt that the defendant executor is entitled
to receive out of the estate his costs of the mediation.  It seems
to me that
the plaintiffs also should appropriately receive out of the estate their costs
of the mediation.
<P>

10   	One further matter should be adverted to.  There appears
to have been some confusion between the parties (a confusion which
may have, at
least, partly had its origin in the records of the Court) concerning the date
which was originally fixed for the hearing
of this matter.  When, on 30 October
1998, I vacated that day's hearing date by consent of the parties, I also by
their consent reserved
the costs of that day and any costs thrown away by
reason of the vacating of that day's hearing date.
<P>

11   	The costs order which I propose to make in favour of the
deceased plaintiff, the surviving plaintiff and the defendant will
also include
the costs reserved on 30 October 1998.  
<P>

12   	I make the following orders:-
<P>

(1)	I order that the costs of the plaintiff Stephanie Rae Elliott, now
deceased, up to and including 14 September 1998 and the costs
of the plaintiff
Muriel Betty Elliott, the costs of each such plaintiff to be on the party and
party basis, and the costs of the
defendant on the indemnity basis - be paid
out of the estate of the late John George Elliott ("the deceased").
<P>

(2)	I order that the foregoing costs of each plaintiff and 	of the defendant
respectively include -
<P>

(a)	the costs of the mediation conducted in September 1998;
<P>

(b)	the costs reserved on 30 October 1998, and
<P>

(c)	the costs of today's application.
