FRIDAY 6 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<b>3182/999	VALDA L. MANCINI v JOHN P. MANCINI</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These are satellite proceedings attendant on
proceedings 2955 of 1999 in which the plaintiff claims declarations
that the
defendant has committed various breaches of duty and misconduct in affairs of
Wesco Industries Pty Ltd, Wesco Quarry Products
Pty Ltd and Wesco Ready Mixed
Concrete Pty Ltd, referred to as the Wesco Group.  The plaintiff and the
defendant were formerly married;
their marriage has been dissolved.  Each of
them owns one of the two issued shares in each of the companies and each of
them is or
was until 29 June 1999 one of the two directors of each company.  In
these proceedings the plaintiff seeks to restrain the defendant
from retaining
to act for him in the principal proceedings Mr Beale of counsel and Messrs
McGrath Dicembre &amp; Co, Solicitors of
Fairfield, each of who acted for one
or all of the companies in the Wesco Group in legal business conducted before
the principal
proceedings were commenced on 1 July 1999. In other satellite
proceedings 3178 of 1999 Mr Mancini sought to restrain Messrs Harrisons
Lawyers, solicitors of Parramatta, from acting for Mrs Mancini.  On 19 July I
embarked on hearing both satellite proceedings together
but proceedings 3178 of
1999 were resolved by consent. 
<P>

2  	It was established by agreement that before 1 July 1999 Messrs
McGrath Dicembre &amp; Co from time to time acted for Mr Mancini,
and acted as
solicitors for and gave advice to companies in the Wesco Group on a number of
occasions for up to four years; the evidence
explicitly deals with business up
to two years earlier.  It was not however admitted and there is no evidence to
show that that firm
ever had a general retainer to conduct business for the
companies in the Wesco Group, or that no other solicitors acted for those
companies during those years.
<P>

3  	Although the solicitors conducted a number of pieces of legal
business for the group and for Mr Mancini, and sometimes received
correspondence and information from Mrs Mancini, and Mr Beale saw her in
conference in some business relating to land development
or some similar poorly
identified business, the evidence does not show that they received from her any
identified information which
has a bearing on the principal litigation.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff did not herself give evidence in these proceedings
and no evidence establishes in a specific way that any confidential
information, or indeed any<u> </u>specific information was furnished to the
lawyers.  Nor was it established that the plaintiff herself was ever their
client.  She
communicated to them on at least one and possibly more occasions,
but did so as a director of the companies and with information
relating to
their affairs rather than to legal business of her own.  The view that some
confidential or other information which it
is appropriate for the court to
protect was communicated to those lawyers is left to inference from the fact
that they acted for
the companies and in some cases for Mr Mancini in various
pieces of legal business, which was listed in the affidavit of her solicitor
Ms
Small, together with the fact that the matters which may be put in issue in the
principal proceedings relating to alleged breaches
and failures of Mr Mancini
range very widely, although they have not been defined by pleadings or in any
other clear way.  It is
also left to inference that it is likely that those
lawyers will be in a position to use some of that information while acting for
Mr Mancini in the proceedings.
<P>

5  	In recent years control by Courts of the retainer of lawyers and
others concerned in conducting litigation on grounds relating
to protection of
confidential information has received much attention: see Chris
Edmonds,"Trusting Lawyers with Confidences"(1998)
16(3) Australian Bar Review
222 and Mr Justice Ipp, "Lawyers Duties to the Court"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20114%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 114 Law Quarterly
Review 63</a> - Aspects of the subject were recently considered by the House of
Lords in <b>Bolkiah v KPMG</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20WLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 WLR 215.</a>
<P>

6  	In this Division two recent cases have made classifications of
the ground on which courts control the conduct of lawyers.  In
<b>Oceanic Life
Ltd v HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSW%20SC%20292" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSW SC 292</a>, Austin J
at p35 referred to the law with respect to the solicitor's duty to the court
and the court's discretion to supervise the
conduct of its officers, and
ethical principles developed and applied by a professional body. In <b>Watson v
Watson</b> (25 May 1998) Santow J referred to Bar Rules 87 and 107 which relate
to acting against a former client and acting while in possession
of information
confidential to another party or another person. Although the Bar Rules are not
directly enforceable at the suit of
a litigant they do illustrate appropriate
professional conduct such as the court may enforce in its supervisory power.
The question
of jurisdiction is not a difficulty where the court is asked to
exercise its supervisory power over professional conduct.  Otherwise
it is
necessary that it should be shown that restraint is required to protect
confidential information.
<P>

7  	It is of importance to observe that information generally is not
protected; the protection available relates to confidential
information, and is
available to the person entitled to the confidence.  No circumstances were put
forward in which Mrs Mancini herself
is entitled to the protection of the law
against the use of any particular information by Mr Mancini or by the lawyers
whom he has
chosen to retain.  It is not possible to address in any clear way
and to come to a decision on protection of any alleged confidential
information
without identifying what the confidential information is in a sufficiently
specific way to enable it to be identified.
 Without doing that it is not
possible to come to a conclusion on whether the information truly is
confidential, to consider and
appraise the circumstances in which it came into
existence and was communicated, to come to any conclusion about whether
protection
is appropriate, or to make any enforceable order.  A case about
confidential information cannot be nebulous.  Confidential information
which
once existed may no longer be confidential; it may no longer be available
although it was communicated in the past; it may
not be material to any use
which might now be proposed to be made of information.  Without specificity a
claim to protection cannot
be defended or decided on any fair procedural basis,
and a general allegation of the kind put forward here to the effect that from
the nature of the past legal business confidential information must have been
communicated should not in my opinion be upheld. 
<P>

8  	The plaintiff's counsel claimed that she is entitled to
protection in right of the companies.  If this were correct, the claim
could
not succeed because of the lack of specificity of evidence relating to any
particular information or any circumstances making
information confidential.
The plaintiff's counsel contended that she was in a position to put forward a
case derivatively on behalf
of or in the interest of the companies on two
bases.  One related to s.1324 of the Corporations Law and one to the so called
fifth
exception to the rule in <b>Foss v Harbottle</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/478.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 478</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%202%20Hare%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 2 Hare 461</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=67%20ER%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">67 ER
189.</a> 
<P>

9  	Subsection 1324(1) of the Corporations Law empowers the court on
the application of a person whose interest would be affected
by conduct in
contravention of the Corporations Law to grant an injunction restraining
another person from engaging in that conduct.
 It was said that for the
defendant to retain the lawyers referred to would be a breach of duties imposed
by s.232 of the Corporations
Law.  The defendant has been (and perhaps still
is) a director and hence an officer of each of the companies; for that reason
he
is subject to the duties of honesty, care and diligence and other duties
imposed by subsections (2), (4), (5) and (6) of s.232. 
Counsel did not refer
me in any clear way to any line of reasoning which would show that for Mr
Mancini to retain the lawyers referred
to would be a contravention of s.232, or
of any other provision of the Corporations Law; and in my opinion there is
none.  Counsel
did not refer me to any reasoning or circumstance which would
show that an injunction under s.1324 would protect the interests of
the
companies, or any circumstances which would show that the interests of the
companies are adversely affected by Mr Mancini's retaining
the lawyers referred
to.  
<P>

10  	The power in subs.1324(1) is discretionary and in the absence of
any sound ground related to the purposes of that subsection
for making an
injunction it would not be appropriate to make one.  Having regard to the
general purposes of the Corporations Law
the relevant discretionary
considerations should relate to the interests of the company affected by the
contravention, and the fact
that the plaintiff is or may be a person whose
interest would be affected by the retainer, while it may give her standing to
make
the application, does not constitute a positive ground for granting the
injunction.
<P>

11  	The view that the exceptions to the rule in <b>Foss v
Harbottle</b> include a fifth or residual exception when justice requires that
a member be allowed to sue for a wrong done to the company is supported
by the
decision of Young J in <b>Mesenberg v Cord Industrial Recruiters Pty Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20128" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 128</a> and by authorities there referred to and discussed by Young
J in <b>Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/413.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] NSWSC 413.</a>  It was
left open in the decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in <b>Link
Agricultural Pty Ltd v Shanahan &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] VSCA 3:</a> see Kenny JA at
para 22.
<P>

12  	Although counsel told me that he relied on the supposed fifth
exception to the rule in <b>Foss v Harbottle</b>, he did not refer me to any
grounds upon which that exception should be invoked; the exception if it exists
relates to circumstances
in which it is just to allow a member or other person
to bring proceedings for a remedy to which a company is entitled without
actually
having the company's authority to do so.  It is not enough that the
exception should exist; there should also be evidence showing
that as a matter
of justice the plaintiff should be allowed to invoke the right of another
person.  The fact that a company having
two directors has its affairs in a
state of deadlock because the directors are in conflict is not in my view
sufficient to show that
the fifth exception applies; if it were it would be a
commonplace for directors or members of a company in the state of deadlock
to
bring claims on behalf of the company without its actual authority. I have
concluded elsewhere that it has not been shown that
any of the companies have a
claim on any clear basis against Mr Mancini to restrain the use of confidential
information, and I will
add, as counsel's submissions invoked breach of
fiduciary duty, to restrain any supposed breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>

13  	In my opinion the plaintiff is not in the position to rely on
rights of the company on either of these grounds.  
<P>

14  	However the court's control over the employment by litigants of
particular lawyers is not limited to circumstances in which
some legal or
equitable claim to protection can be made out.  Control may also be based on
the court's general power to control the
conduct of its own officers, including
solicitors and counsel, and to control their employment by particular
litigants.
<P>

15  	I asked counsel to refer me to any case in which solicitors who
have acted for a company in its general affairs, later act,
when conflict has
emerged, for one director against another. They were unable to do so.  So far
as I am aware there is no established
judicial disfavour of such conduct and I
do not see why there should be, except in cases where some misuse of relevant
confidential
information is established.
<P>

16  	On the evidence there is no basis for a finding that Mr Beale is
in breach of the Bar Rules, or that the solicitors have acted
in any way of
which the court should not approve.
<P>

Order:	The proceedings are dismissed with costs.
