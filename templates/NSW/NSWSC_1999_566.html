<b>13988/95	PHILIP JOHN RAPSON &amp; ANOR v WILLIAM EDWIN WRIGHT &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	On 19 December 1997 I made orders permanently staying
proceedings on two informations that were before the Local Court at Sutherland,
for reasons which I subsequently gave.  Those orders were entered on 13 October
1998.  On the 2 June 1999 I made orders that those
permanent stays be lifted,
insofar as necessary to permit the Local Court, in each case, to dismiss the
information and to hear and
determine an application by the defendant for an
order in respect of the costs of the proceedings in the Local Court:  <b>Rapson
v Wright</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/534.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 534.</a>  I am now asked to stay that order lifting the
permanent stays pro tanto pending the lodgement and determination of an
application
to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from those orders.
Leave to appeal is necessary because the orders lifting the permanent
stays are
interlocutory in nature. 
<P>

2   	This matter first came before me just after noon today and
it is now just after 2pm.  The proceedings upon the informations
were listed
before the learned Magistrate in the Local Court at 2pm, to ask his Worship to
make orders for dismissal of the informations
consequent upon my partial
lifting of the permanent stays.  A request has apparently been made to the
Registrar of the Local Court
for the matter to be stood down till 3pm, but it
is uncertain whether that has occurred, and I do not know whether or not the
Magistrate
is at the present time embarking on consideration of the application
for dismissal.  Furthermore, on this very day there is fixed
for trial in the
District Court at Sydney proceedings for malicious prosecution by the present
plaintiffs against the first and second
defendants in the present proceedings
arising out of the bringing and fate of the informations before the Local
Court.  That matter
has been assigned to her Honour Acting Judge Boland as
trial Judge, and is also scheduled to be called on for trial at 2pm.
<P>

3   	Mr Lakatos, of counsel for the first and second defendants,
has moved for the stay of proceedings on the basis that, if I do
not grant it,
the subject matter of the application for leave to appeal to the Court of
Appeal will be destroyed and any appeal consequential
upon such leave, if
granted, will be rendered nugatory:  see <b>Jennings Construction Ltd v
Burgundy Royale Pty Ltd [No 1]</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/84.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 84</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20681" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 681</a>; <b>Malubel Pty Ltd v
Elder</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2073%20ALJR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 73 ALJR 135.</a>  There is force in what Mr Lakatos says and that
would in many or most circumstances lead to a stay being granted.  However,
this
is a very unusual case.  The gravamen of my findings in my original
judgment was that the informations laid in the Local Court were
an abuse of
process by reason of  the fact that they were laid, not for the proper purpose
of duly enforcing the criminal law, but
for an improper motive. Details of the
conclusions that I came to as to that matter are set out in my original reasons
for judgment.
 That original judgment of mine was not appealed from.
<P>

4   	The application which led to the partial lifting of the
stays was brought by the present plaintiffs because it is to be contended
on
behalf of the first and second defendants in the proceedings in the District
Court that the proceedings on the informations were
not, in the sense required
in the law of malicious prosecution, terminated in favour of the present
plaintiffs by the granting of
a permanent stay by this Court, but would only be
so terminated by a dismissal of the informations in the Local Court.
<P>

5   	The plaintiffs brought the application here for the lifting
of the stay at a very late time.  It was as long ago as last October
that they
first went to the Magistrate to ask him to dismiss the informations and, not
surprisingly, procured the reaction from his
Worship that he was unable to do
so because the proceedings before him were permanently stayed by the Supreme
Court.  Mr Walsh, solicitor
for the plaintiffs, who has in part conducted this
application before me on their behalf (Mr Jacobs of Queen's Counsel being able
to be present for only a part of the argument), frankly and fairly avows that
that delay lies in his court.  He raised the matter
with the previous senior
counsel, Mr Byrne SC, last year after the Magistrate's refusal to dismiss the
informations, but did not
take it up again until comparatively recently, when
it was raised with him by Mr Jacobs QC.  The urgency and the peculiar situation
at this very moment, that the differences between these parties may be being
agitated at the same time in three courts in this city,
namely this Court, the
District Court before her Honour Acting Judge Boland, and the Local Court
before Magistrate Maughan, is in
part produced by this tardiness.  On the other
hand, it must be said that the present application for a stay of proceedings
has not
been brought promptly in the circumstances.  My judgment lifting the
stays was delivered ex tempore on 2 June 1999.  The written
reasons were unable
to be provided to the parties after correction until 4 June 1999.  Mr Lakatos
was asked for written advice on
behalf of his clients and understandably was
not able to give it until this morning, when the decision was taken to apply
for the
stay.  However, the reasons are short and I hope reasonably clear.
They were delivered in full in open court last Wednesday.  Even
before a final
decision was taken to commit to an application for leave to appeal, in the
circumstances that the District Court proceedings
were coming on on the
following Monday, the proper course in my view would have been for an
application to be made immediately or
promptly for a stay, so that there was
more time to move in respect of the District Court matter.  The plaintiffs are
now, I am told,
in a situation where a witness has been brought from Adelaide
for the District Court proceedings, at considerable expense and in
circumstances where it may be difficult to procure the witness's return at a
later time.
<P>

6   	The consequences of either the grant, or the refusal, of
the stay for the proceedings in the District Court are not entirely
clear.  Mr
Jacobs of Queen's Counsel, upon my suggesting that it might be inefficacious at
this time to plead the dismissal of the
informations if procured, since that
would have occurred after the initiation of the proceedings in the District
Court, said it would
be his contention that this was a matter which, under the
District Court Rules, could be proved, although occurring after the
commencement
of the proceedings, and that it was arguable that, whether it was
led in support of the existing cause of action or as the formulation
or
bringing of a new cause of action, it could be pleaded and used at the trial in
the District Court (see DCR Pt 9 r 11, Pt 17 r
4).  Equally it is suggested,
and it may well be so (I have not had time to look into it), that the orders
for permanent stay were
in fact a sufficient termination of the proceedings
before the Magistrate, particularly bearing in mind the ground upon which they
were made, for the plaintiffs to succeed, if their case were otherwise proved
in the District Court.  The situation thus is that
it is far from certain
whether the grant or non-grant of a stay will have an effect upon the result of
the District Court proceedings.
 
<P>

7   	I find the decision as to the stay pending appeal quite a
difficult one.  As I say, the destruction of the subject matter of
a
prospective appeal is a consideration which usually weighs heavily with courts.
However, I bear in mind that, despite the plaintiffs'
contribution to the delay
by their late bringing of the application for lifting of the permanent stays,
the very difficult situation
today, with the matter in three courts
simultaneously, is produced, at least in part, by the first and second
defendants failing
to make it plain, when judgment on the application to lift
the stays was delivered, that an application for leave to appeal would
or might
be made and to make or foreshadow at that time an application for a stay of
proceedings which could have been dealt with
before this 11th, or perhaps it is
the 12th, hour.  I also bear in mind that, in a sense, the defence sought to be
pleaded is not
a highly meritorious one.  It may be that, as a formal matter
upon which the courts may be bound to act, a permanent stay is not
a
termination within the law relating to malicious prosecution.  However, the
merits of the prosecutions were made plain in my unappealed
judgment, in which
I found that the prosecutions were an abuse of process, so that on any basis
the informations in the Local Court
ought not proceed to conviction.  Bearing
in mind all the circumstances of the case, including the factors that I have
mentioned
in this paragraph, the conclusion that I have come to in this
difficult situation is that the stay of proceedings ought be refused.
<P>

8   	The orders that I make are:
<P>

1	I grant to the first and second defendants leave to file in Court the notice
of motion dated today.
<P>

2	 I dismiss the notice of motion.
<P>

3	I order the first and second defendants to pay the plaintiffs' costs of this
motion.
