<P>

<b>3483/98 - KIAMA DEVELOPMENT CO PTY LTD &amp; ORS V WILCOX &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:   </b>This is a dispute between two groups of people who carry
on the business of selling fish and chips in adjoining premises on land near
the Blowhole at Kiama.  They sue each other for breaches of a sublease and also
for false and deceptive conduct under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>.    There are
various ancillary disputes.
<P>

2	The first plaintiff, Kiama Development Co Pty Ltd is a company which is
controlled by Mr and Mrs French, the second and third
plaintiffs, Mr French
being the dominant shareholder.  The defendants and cross claimants are Mr and
Mrs Wilcox and Mr and Mrs Spicer.
<P>

3	The proceedings were heard before me on 27 November and 2 December 1998.  At
the hearing, Mr D Knaggs, solicitor appeared for
the plaintiffs and Mr
McDougall QC and Mr Waugh of counsel appeared for the defendants.  In the
course of the proceedings I read
over 40 affidavits.  It was abundantly clear
from the material that each side considers the other to be unprincipled liars
and deceivers
of the public, people who have no reputation in the community at
all and who have used their best efforts to damage the other's business
in
whatever way possible.  In short, the parties regard each other as the landlord
from hell and the tenants from hell.
<P>

4	At the end of the hearing, I then stood the matter over to the new year so
that submissions could be completed in writing, particularly
on the part of the
plaintiffs' solicitor.  Submissions were made late in January and the matter
was put back in the list on 11 February
1999.  This evoked further written
submissions, the last of which were received on 9 March 1999.
<P>

5	There have been a series of disputes heard in various courts over the
sublease and associated matters between the parties, sometimes
also involving
other people as well.  Over the last two years the parties have litigated in
the Local Court, the District Court,
the Land and Environment Court and, up
until last December, before Hulme J, Cohen J and Windeyer J in this Court and
in the Court
of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal proceedings are reported as
<b>Wilcox v Richardson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2043%20NSWLR%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 43 NSWLR 4.</a>  Since the end of last  term, the
parties have been back before the vacation judges with various aspects of their
dispute, and Levine
J, Hamilton J and Bryson J have all spent some time on the
disputes between these parties. Abadee J was also approached by Mr French
in
person but declined to hear him as he had a solicitor on the record.
<P>

6	The parties have also involved the police and the local council.  The
plaintiffs have employed at least one private investigator
to obtain evidence
against the defendants.  Numerous tourists have been hassled.  The plaintiffs
seem to have no problems with Mr
French collecting the pension whilst
controlling three companies.  The female defendants who claim to be
schoolteachers have no problems
with combining their activities during the week
as role models to the younger generation, with their weekend activities of
vilification.
 Altogether a most unsavoury case, but one in which the parties
are entitled to a decision.
<P>

7	The fee simple of the land in question is vested in the State of New South
Wales.  By Special Lease 1989/1, registered Y836612,
the State granted to John
and Judith Richardson a lease over Lot 276 DP 728098 for 20 years expiring on
31 July 2009.   The Crown
also granted Special Lease 1989/2 to Mr and Mrs
Richardson over Lot 277 DP 728098, which is registered Y836613. 
<P>

8	DP 728098 is in evidence as page 86 of DX01.  The plan shows that there is a
single weatherboard building with verandah occupying
virtually the whole of Lot
276 and spreading over onto Lot 277.  This building is known as "The Cargo
Shed".
<P>

9	On 31 March 1993, a sublease was granted by the Richardsons to Mr John
Richardson's brother Ray Richardson and Mr Ray Richardson's
companion, Miss
Smith.  The sublease was only over part of the land contained in Lot 276 being
identified as Shop 1, Kiama Wharf,
Kiama.  The sublease was for four years from
1 January 1993.
<P>

10	The terms of Special Lease 1989/1 included a term that the use of the site
for a restaurant, bistro or similar undertaking is
not permitted.  It also
provided (clause 12) that the lessee should not sublet.  
<P>

11	The sublease required the lessee to use the premises only for the carrying
on of the purpose referred to in Item 2 of the Reference
Schedule which was
simply "A caf&eacute; for the sale of seafood and soft drink".   A special
condition was that the lessors covenanted
that they would not permit the sale
of cooked seafood, soft drinks, ice creams or takeaway food from Lot 277. 
<P>

12	In December 1994, Mr and Mrs Wilcox and Mr and Mrs Spicer purchased that
sublease.  They say that at the time of the purchase
the head lessor, John
Richardson, ran a fresh fish shop in the middle section of the relevant
building.  
<P>

13	There was litigation between the present defendants and John Richardson
which was unfavourable to the present defendants but
they appealed to the Court
of Appeal where they were successful.  They obtained a declaration that they
were entitled to easements
and ancillary rights over parts of the building
outside the leased area as described in the Court of Appeal's judgment.
<P>

14	In September 1996, following the first instance decision in that case, John
Richardson commenced work on a competing fish and
chip takeaway in the former
fresh fish shop area.  This was opened in February 1997.  
<P>

15	The erection of signs by the competing businesses commenced almost
immediately.  
<P>

16	On 14 May 1997, the first plaintiff completed the purchase of the head lease
1989/1 and also the purchase of lease 1989/2.  Up
until the end of July 1997,
the plaintiffs refitted the premises other than that part which was subleased
to the defendants.
<P>

17	The sublease had contained an option to renew.   The defendants exercised
this option and on 19 December 1997, and after some
litigation, there was a
consent declaration that the option to renew had been duly exercised and a new
sublease expiring on 31 December
2000 was granted.   The new sublease is
registered as 3950222D.  It contains virtually identical provisions to the
earlier sublease,
Item 2 being "A caf&eacute; for the sale of seafood and soft
drink" and there is a special condition as to the non-provision of cooked
seafood etc from the premises comprised in Crown Lease 1989/2 as there was in
the former lease.
<P>

18	The sublease is subject to the terms and conditions in Memorandum 691346A.
Under clause 4 of that Memorandum, the lessee covenanted
with the lessor,  so
far as is relevant, as follows:
<P>

"4(b)	To use the leased premises solely for the carrying on of the purpose
referred to in ITEM 2 of the Reference Schedule and to
keep the demised
premises open for business during ordinary business hours unless prevented by
any circumstances beyond his control;
<P>

4(f)	Not to erect or display any sign notice or advertisement on the premises
or the building without the written consent of the
lessor <u>PROVIDED THAT
</u>the lessor will not unreasonably withhold his consent to a sign notice or
advertisement which he considers to be of reasonable dimensions
appearance and
position in keeping with the general character of the building;
<P>

4(i)	Not to obstruct misuse or damage the common areas or any part thereof;
<P>

4(k)	Not to do or permit to be done anything which may be or grow to be or
cause any nuisance damage or obstruction to the lessor
or the tenants or
occupiers of the building or of any adjoining or neighbouring premises and not
to do or permit to be done any illegal
or immoral act on the premises; ..."
<P>

19	Clause 6(c)(i) of the Memorandum provided that certain covenants "are
essential terms of the lease" and of the covenants that
are relevant in the
present case, clause 4(b) was included amongst the essential covenants.  None
of the other provisions in clause
4 were so designated.
<P>

20	On 8 April 1998, the Minister for Land and Water Conservation gave his
consent to the sublease.  The Minister's letter contained
the following:
<P>

	"It must be noted that although the Minister has granted consent to the new
sub-lease for which the purpose is `a caf&eacute; for
the sale of seafood and
soft drink', the provisions of Special Lease 1989/1, Kiama, as head lease,
which provide that the premises
cannot be used as a restaurant, bistro or
similar undertaking, mean that the premises cannot lawfully be used for the
purposes of
caf&eacute;. ...  In these circumstances the Minister withholds his
consent for the use of the premises as a caf&eacute; and requires
your clients
... as sublessees provide a written undertaking acknowledging the contents of
this letter and agreeing to be bound by
the provisions of this letter  ...".
<P>

21	This letter of consent is attached to affidavit DA18 of Mrs Spicer and I
must infer from that affidavit that those undertakings
were given to the
Minister.
<P>

22	Since about September 1997, the situation has thus been that there is a
building erected known as The Cargo Shed most of which
is on Lot 276 but a
small part is on Lot 277.  There are two businesses being carried on in The
Cargo Shed each of which sells fish
and chips.  The plaintiffs were operating
what has been called in evidence "the Western Shop" whilst the defendants have
been conducting
business in what has been called in evidence "the Southern
Shop".  In addition to cooked fish and chips, the first plaintiff in the
Western Shop also sells fresh fish and prawns.  The evidence is that it obtains
that fish and prawns from wholesalers in Wollongong
and it also obtains fresh
fish from the Shellharbour Fish Market.
<P>

23	The parties have been on each others' nerves since July 1997.  Their
disputes first seem to arise over signage but they have
escalated.  Although
there are a plethora of complaints, one against the other, the principal
complaints concern derogatory signs
about each others' businesses and spruiking
to induce tourists and locals to buy fish and chips from one business rather
than the
other.  However, the technical issues between the parties have to be
dealt with at some length.
<P>

24	In an endeavour to compress these reasons as far as possible, I will deal
with the matters that arise between the parties under
the following heads:
<P>

(A)	Do any matters of res judicata or issue estoppel affect the decision in
this case?
<P>

(B)	Do the principles of illegality affect this case at all?
<P>

(C)	Have the defendants breached:
<P>

(i)	clause 4(b);
<P>

(ii)	clause 4(f);
<P>

(iii)	clause 4(i);
<P>

(iv)	clause 4(k)
<P>

of Memorandum 691346A?
<P>

(D)	Does <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> affect the plaintiffs' claim to
evict the defendants?
<P>

(E)	Has the sublease come to an end by way of repudiation?
<P>

(F)	Is the first plaintiff entitled to re-enter?
<P>

(G)	Is the first plaintiff entitled to an order for possession?
<P>

(H)	Have the defendants been guilty of false and misleading or deceptive
conduct under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> in that they represented to potential
customers that:
<P>

(i)	the second plaintiff does not declare rent received from the defendants as
taxable income;
<P>

(ii)	the second plaintiff had purchased a new Mercedes Benz for $140,000;
<P>

(iii)	the second plaintiff wrongly received pension payments;
<P>

(iv)	the second plaintiff was a perjurer;
<P>

(v)	the second plaintiff deposits rubbish in garbage bins designated for use by
the general public;
<P>

(vi)	the second plaintiff is a director of five companies with assets of $5
million;
<P>

(vii)	the second plaintiff illegally made holes in the carpark adjoining the
Western Shop;
<P>

(viii)	the second plaintiff bought frozen prawns from overseas and sold them
for massive profits;
<P>

(ix)	the second plaintiff erected a sign which was misleading;
<P>

(x)	there had been many complaints about food poisoning by people who ate food
sold at the plaintiffs' business.
<P>

(I)	Are the plaintiffs entitled to a declaration that any of the matters
particularised in (H) constituted an unlawful interference
with the plaintiffs'
business?
<P>

(J)	Are the plaintiffs entitled to injunctions to restrain repetition of any
such acts?
<P>

(K)	Are the plaintiffs entitled to damages under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> or for
breach of the sublease?
<P>

(L)	Are the plaintiffs entitled to costs against the defendants?
<P>

25	The defendants, in their  further amended cross claim also seek relief.  I
will identify these claims by continuing the alphabetical
sequence so that in
due course I can deal with them in a logical order.
<P>

26	(M)	Have the plaintiffs been guilty of false, misleading or deceptive
conduct under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> in that -
<P>

(i)	they have displayed a sign "The Truth";
<P>

		(ii)	they have displayed the sign "The Simple Fact";
<P>

		(iii) 	they have distributed a flyer "A Restaurant at the 
<P>

Harbour";
<P>

		(iv)	they have displayed signs with the words "Main
<P>

			Entrance";
<P>

(N)	Injunctions to prevent recurrence;
<P>

	(O)	A declaration that the plaintiffs have unreasonably withheld 	consent to
erect signs;
<P>

	(P)	An order that the defendants may now erect such signs;
<P>

(Q)	Declarations that the plaintiffs have breached the covenant for quiet
enjoyment in the sublease;
<P>

(R)	If necessary relief against forfeiture.
<P>

27	I will deal with each of these in turn and then state (S), the result of
this case.
<P>

28	(A)	As I have noted above,  there has been much previous litigation between
the parties.  
<P>

29	The litigation that was before Windeyer J in December 1997 followed a notice
to vacate given by the first plaintiff on 21 November
1997 based on a breach
of, inter alia, clauses 4(b), (f) and (k) of the sublease.  Those proceedings
were 5156 of 1997 in which the
plaintiffs were Mr and Mrs Wilcox and Mr and Mrs
Spicer and the defendant, Kiama Development Co Pty Ltd, the first plaintiff in
the
instant proceedings.  The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the notice
to vacate "is unenforceable and of no force or effect".
 On 19 December 1997,
Windeyer J made the following notes of his orders:
<P>

"I give leave to Mr John French, a director of the defendant, to appear for the
defendant.  By consent ... I make orders as sought
in paragraphs 2 ... of the
summons.  I order the defendant to pay the plaintiffs' costs agreed at
$2000".
<P>

30	Mr McDougall QC and Mr Waugh submitted that in these proceedings "By reason
of the consent declaration ... the plaintiffs are
now estopped  from relying
upon any of the matters particularised in it as giving a present entitlement to
possession;  and from
relying on any matters which could have been, but were
not, asserted in November 1997 to support the Notice to Vacate as giving a
current entitlement to possession.  See <b>Chamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 502".</a>
<P>

31	A consent judgment may, in appropriate cases, give rise to a res judicata.
However, as Spencer Bower Turner and Handley remark
in the 3rd ed of <b>Res
Judicata </b>(Butterworths, London, 1996) paras 38-39, it is often difficult to
determine what questions were concluded by the consent judgment.
 As the
learned authors of that book say: 
<P>

"The court will examine the available evidence to ascertain the matters in
dispute:  As in <b>Cloutte v Storey </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%201%20Ch%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 1 Ch 18</a> at 26, 33.  Any issue
which the parties recognised was the subject of the litigation and was
fundamental to the judgment or order
will be conclusively determined.  Where,
however, there are no such materials neither party is estopped from disputing
anything but
the actual judgment or order;  see <b>Goucher v Clayton </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281865%29%2013%20WR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1865)
13 WR 336</a> per Wood VC at 337 ...".
<P>

32	The material before me shows that the prime matter concerning Windeyer J on
12, 18 and 19 December 1997 was an application by
the present defendants for
orders that the first plaintiff was in contempt in not doing the work which the
Court of Appeal ordered
it to do.  It seems that after Windeyer J dealt with
that matter, orders were made in 5156/97 by consent.  I do not know what the
evidence was or what the issues that were tendered were, but I do know that the
suit was to stop the present first plaintiff implementing
its notice to vacate.
I also know that that notice to vacate was based, inter alia, on alleged
breaches of the provisions of the
sublease which I have set out.  
<P>

33	In ejectment, the only question on which the judgment is conclusive, is
whether the claimant was entitled to possession on the
day named in the writ,
see <b>York Motors Pty Ltd v Turner (No 2) </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2071%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 71 WN (NSW) 173</a>, where
Brereton J discussed the matter of estoppels in ejectment proceedings in some
detail.  It is for that reason that res judicata
usually plays little part in
ejectment proceedings because as each claim is made the claim for possession is
made at a different
date.  Issue estoppel is a different matter and the general
rule is in ejectment proceedings that have been established by verdict
or by
default or by consent all issues necessarily involved in the proceedings are
binding on the parties and their privies though
they are free to show that
circumstances have changed thereafter.  (See Lewis and Cassidy on <b>Tenancy
Law</b> (Butterworths, Sydney, 1966) Book 1 p 465).
<P>

34	Although the decision of Brereton J in the <b>York Motors case </b>went on
appeal, see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2055%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20220" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 55 SR (NSW) 220</a>, the learning on estoppel was not affected
by the decision on appeal.
<P>

35	In the instant case, counsel for the defendants point to the cross
examination of Mr French (eg T6) that the breaches referred
to in the notice to
vacate were the same as the breaches relied on in the present case.  This cross
examination continued on for
some pages.  Despite this, it does not appear to
me to be clear what was the issue that could be formulated with complete
precision
that could be said to have been determined in favour of the
defendants.
<P>

36	Accordingly I do not consider that any res judicata or issue estoppel arose
from the consent order made by Windeyer J.
<P>

37	I should note in case it be thought I have overlooked it, that the
proceedings before Windeyer J were not in ejectment but were
declaratory
proceedings.  A declaratory judgment is a judgment which creates a res judicata
even by consent;  see Spencer Bower Turner
and Handley at para 159.  However,
again one has to find what were the issues which the consent declaration
covered.  This brings
about the same problems that have been discussed
earlier.
<P>

38	The submissions by counsel for the defendants also seek to rely on the
Anshun principle.  However in ejectment it is very hard
to do this because each
action tries title as a particular date.  Indeed even if the question is
whether a notice to vacate is sufficient,
a declaration that it is invalid may
be grounded on a large number of possible reasons both substantial and
technical.  The mere
fact that a notice specifies certain grounds in itself is
not enough because it could fail either because one or more of those grounds
was not made out, or for some technical reason.  As far as I know the Anshun
principle has not been applied to make people seek to
raise in the one action
every possible ground on which they could have a notice declared void and to
prevent them from ever litigating
factors which were not raised.  Just as if a
notice given on a certain date is declared void another notice can be given, so
it seems
to me that it is not to be expected within the Anshun principle that
every possible defect must be raised in any attack on a notice.
<P>

39	Accordingly, in whichever form an estoppel is raised I do not consider it
affects the present case.
<P>

40	(B)	Mr Knaggs put particular store on the submission that the sublease was
illegal and void. 
<P>

41	The submission is that the head lease was a special lease granted under the
Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913.  Under s 6(2)
of that Act, Crown lands may
not be leased unless the dealing is authorised by the Act.  Far from being
authorised, the purported
sublease was prohibited by s 226(1)(b) of the Act.
That paragraph provided that no lease, with immaterial exceptions, shall confer
any right to sublet for other than grazing purposes.  
<P>

42	The Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 was repealed as from 1 January 1990
by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act 1989</a>.  Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> of that Act Crown land is not to be
leased or otherwise dealt with unless the sale, lease etc is authorised by the
new Act or the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clta1989325/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands (Continued Tenures) Act 1989</a>.  Under paragraph 3(1)
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clta1989325/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> of Schedule 2 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clta1989325/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands (Continued Tenures) Act</a>, "A special
lease remains subject to the conditions to which it was subject immediately
before the commencement of this clause."
  
<P>

43	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 139</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s140.html" class="autolink_findacts">140</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act 1989</a>, the Minister, on
application by the holder, may revoke conditions attached to a holding of land.
Regulations 38 and 39 of the Crown
Lands Regulation 1995 provide that
applications for revocation are to be in the approved form.
<P>

44	The submission is that because of s 226(1)(b) of the 1913 Act there is a
statutory prohibition on subletting and because of such
prohibition any attempt
to do so is illegal and void.  Mr Knaggs appreciates that the point is raised
late, he says this is unfortunate.
 An argument could be put that it is more
than unfortunate because there is an estoppel as a result of the proceedings
before Windeyer
J, but I suppose the counter argument could be one cannot have
an estoppel in the face of a statute.
<P>

45	In additional written submissions, Mr Waugh put that as the new sublease was
granted in 1997, well after the 1913 Act had ceased
to operate, it was
irrelevant.  However, this submission misses the point that the restriction is
in the head lease which was granted
under the 1913 Act.
<P>

46	Mr Waugh then puts that the defendants have the benefit of the
indefeasibility provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 42</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">43</a>.  This
again is not necessarily an answer as, if the legislation so requires, even a
registered interest can be null and void if
it is against a statutory
provision, <b>Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd v Vlattas </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 1.</a>
<P>

47	However, despite my views on the defendants' submissions referred to in the
previous paragraphs, I reject the submission that
the sublease is void for
illegality.  Section 226(1) of the 1913 Act does not make it illegal for there
to be a subletting, it merely
makes it a condition of the lease between the
Minister and the lessee that there is to be no subletting.  That is a matter
which
the Minister may enforce by means of re-entry or other action for
ejectment.  In the instant case, as the evidence shows, the Minister
has in
fact consented to the sublease and so has waived any right to forfeiture.
Where both sets of parties to the present proceedings
and also the Minister
consent to the sublease and there is no prohibition, there can be no
problem.
<P>

48	To make the point another way and, perhaps more clearly, no offence is
committed under the Crown Lands Consolidation Act if a
person sublets.  No
consequences flow from such a breach except possible action forfeiting the
lease or an action for damages.  Accordingly,
the point on illegality fails.
<P>

49	(C)	I now need to turn and examine each of the provisions noted above which
is said to have been breached by the tenants.  The
list originally also
included an alleged breach of clause 4(s) of the Memorandum, but this was
abandoned in submissions.
<P>

50	(i)	The plaintiffs say that the defendants are in breach of clause 4(b) of
the Memorandum which deals with the use to which the
premises may be put.
<P>

51	Two issues were raised:  (a)  that the defendants were not using the demised
premises for the permitted purpose, namely, a caf&eacute;
for the sale of
seafood and soft drinks;  and (b)  that the defendants were using the premises
for another purpose, namely the business
of attrition and spruiking.
<P>

52	Submissions were directed as to what was a caf&eacute;.  Mr Knaggs points to
the Oxford English Dictionary definition of "caf&eacute;"
which notes that the
word comes from the French word for "coffee house" so that a caf&eacute; is a
"coffee house, a restaurant; 
now a certain class of restaurant."  He also
points to the definition in the Macquarie Dictionary which defines a
caf&eacute; as
a low priced restaurant or a building where light refreshments
are served.
<P>

53	In its ordinary sense, "caf&eacute;" does not connote a place where takeaway
food is sold.  However, one cannot just read words
apart  from their context.
In the instant case, the head lease prohibited the use of the premises as a
restaurant and furthermore,
special condition 1 contains a covenant on the part
of the lessors that they will "not sell or permit the sale of cooked seafood,
soft drinks, ice creams or takeaway food items" from Special Lease 1989/2.
This would be quite an absurd covenant if the sublessee
was not permitted to
use the premises, inter alia, for takeaway food.  Accordingly, in my view, in
this particular lease "caf&eacute;"
denotes a place where takeaway food may be
sold.
<P>

54	As to the other argument put, it certainly can be the case that one can use
premises for the purposes of operating a propaganda
machine.  However, one has
to be very careful in distinguishing between using premises for a purpose and
uses for incidental activities.
 Thus a cornflakes manufacturer who includes
plastic toys in its cornflakes packet would be using its factory for the
production
of cornflakes and solely for the production of cornflakes despite
the fact that it may also be using the premises for buying toys
and inserting
them in the cornflakes packets.  A topless bar which sells alcoholic liquor is
still a bar for the purpose of selling
liquor notwithstanding that it employs
topless waitresses even though many of the clientele may come for the purpose
of ogling the
waitresses rather than drinking the product.  The mere fact that
the defendants go about promoting their business by spruiking does
not, in my
view, detract from them using the demised premises for the purpose set out in
the sublease.  
<P>

55	Accordingly, in my view there is no breach of clause 4(b).
<P>

56	I should note, however, that the defences suggested by the defendants were
not very helpful.  They say that their spruiking activities
took place off the
demised premises.  It is true that some of them did, but the parts of the
building that are available to the defendants
in association with the demised
premises were used for spruiking and I consider Mr Knaggs is correct in his
submissions to say that
even part of the demised premises themselves were so
used when one looks properly at the definition.
<P>

57	Secondly it is said that the spruiking was provoked by the plaintiffs' own
conduct.  Even if this were true it would be irrelevant
except that the court
might consider that it could be grounds for the grant of relief against
forfeiture.
<P>

58	Thirdly it is said that such spruiking promotes competition, which is always
encouraged by the law.  This is just too broad a
statement to be of any
practical utility.  One could just  as easily say the law also permits
reasonable restraints on competition
such as requiring particular tenants only
to conduct certain businesses.
<P>

59	(ii)	The next allegation is that  the defendants are in breach of clause
4(f) of the Memorandum.  Clause 4(f) requires the sublessees
not to erect or
display any sign, notice or advertisement without the landlord's consent.
There is no doubt at all that they displayed
the signs referred to in affidavit
PA03.
<P>

60	One of these signs had a yellow background and read "Kiama Harbour's Famous
Fish &amp; Chips Cooked While `U' Wait".  Although
the defendants' submissions
say that this sign was for part of the time on council land, it is clear that
from at least January 1998
it was on the demised land.  
<P>

61	The only defences to the claim under clause 4(f) are:
<P>

1.	That the signs were permitted because of an agreement between the parties in
interim proceedings before Cohen J on 7 October
1998 which is embodied in
Exhibit DX07; and
<P>

2.	That as request for permission to put up the signs has been sought on many
occasions and refused on specious grounds, there has
been an unreasonable
refusal by the landlord to allow the signs to be displayed with the result that
they may be erected without
its consent. 
<P>

62	The agreement, DX07, does not appear to be one which affects the parties'
rights in the proceedings, it merely sets out a regime
which both of them,
without admissions, would abide by pending the hearing.  One of the matters
agreed upon was "8.  The plaintiffs
give permission to the defendants to erect
a second sign from the verandah".  The sign in question may have been the
yellow sign
to which I have referred, but if it was cl 8 does not excuse the
other two signs which were erected dealing with who could use certain
chairs
and tables.  It may be that, after 8 October 1998, the landlord could not
complain about the yellow sign until the finalisation
of the proceedings, but
there is no reason why the landlord could not rely on the erection of that sign
before 8 October as a breach
of covenant.
<P>

63	Accordingly, the defendants' only real answer to the claim is that because
of the plaintiffs' unreasonable refusal to consent
they may erect reasonable
signs without consent.
<P>

64	Certainly the correspondence shows that there were applications for consent
to signs and that consent was unreasonably withheld.
 The landlord's solicitor
argued that on the proper construction of the sublease only one sign could be
erected by the tenants because
the sublease referred to "any sign" in the
singular.  This was plainly absurd.  Again, there was a refusal to display the
yellow
sign on the basis that it was not in Kiama Council's heritage colours
which the evidence again shows was quite absurd.
<P>

65	In <b>Treloar v Bigge </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%20LR%209%20Exch%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) LR 9 Ex 151</a>, 156, it was laid down as a
rule of construction and has been followed ever since that "The true
interpretation of the words (of
a covenant such as 4(f)) ... is to release the
(tenant) from his covenant not to assign without the plaintiff's assent, if
that assent
is arbitrarily withheld."  However, before the release is given,
the consent must have been applied for and unreasonably withheld:
 <b>Barina
Properties Pty Ltd v Bernard Hastie (Australia) Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20NSWLR%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 NSWLR 480</a>,
493. 
<P>

66	In the case of what I have described as "the yellow sign" there is no doubt
that consent was asked for and unreasonably withheld.
There cannot, accordingly
be a breach of clause 4(f) in respect of that sign.
<P>

67	The other two signs referred to in Mr French's affidavit of 18 November 1998
dealing with seating do not appear to have been
the subject of an application
for consent if one looks at Mr Spicer's affidavit DA24 and the paragraphs of
that affidavit referred
to in 16.3 of the defendants' written submissions.  It
follows that those signs, being the signs referred to in that affidavit of
Mr
French in photographs JDF2 and JDF3 were a breach of clause 4(f) of the
sublease.
<P>

68	(iii)	The next breach alleged is over clause 4(i) of the Memorandum which
prohibits the tenants from obstructing, misusing, or
damaging any part of the
common area.  
<P>

69	The debate on this issue was both as to fact and also what was "the common
area" for the purpose of this clause and also clause
4(k).
<P>

70	As to the facts, Mr French in his affidavit PA04 gives an example of the
typical incidents about which he complains.  He there
says that during the
weekend of October 31/November 1 1998, both Mrs Wilcox and Mrs Spicer, between
noon and 3 pm, continuously intercepted
people as they walked up to the
entrance of the shop operated by the plaintiffs by blocking their path.
<P>

71	Again, on 18 November 1998, Mr French says that Mr and Mrs Wilcox came into
the first plaintiff's shop and started to scream
in the presence of the staff
and customers that they did not have enough room to pass through the shop where
they had a right of
passageway.  Mr French says that he told the Wilcoxes that
they only had right of passage and should move as they were interfering
with
the shop's staff and customers.  Mrs Wilcox refused to move and, when she
finally moved, said to Mr French "Your time has now
come you old man, we'll see
you out of here soon."
<P>

72	Although considerable space was spent in the written submissions in
directing my attention to matters of credit of the various
witnesses, it seems
to me obvious from the whole of the evidence that there was considerable
activity by the defendants, particularly
Mrs Spicer and Mrs Wilcox, in making
nuisances of themselves in the vernacular sense.  They would, without doubt, on
any version
of the evidence, approach potential customers of the plaintiffs, or
tourists merely taking in the beauties of the area and regale
them with their
tales of woe about the plaintiffs and would make derogatory comments of the
plaintiffs, or exhibits signs about the
plaintiffs and would steer the first
plaintiff's potential customers away from its shop.  The exact details of what
they did, when
they did it and where they did it may be the subject of a little
bit of debate, but there is no debate at all about the fact that
they were
doing these things.  The video tape which I saw is a good example.  I will come
back to the detail when dealing with the
complaints made under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act</a>.
<P>

73	I am quite satisfied that the conduct included obstructing the passageways
around the demised premises.
<P>

74	I should however make it clear that not every part of the conduct of the
defendants criticised by Mr Knaggs in his written submissions
was conduct about
which the plaintiffs had a legal basis for complaint.  Unless it fell within
conduct proscribed by the sublease
or contravened the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>, no
matter how distasteful the conduct, it did not give rise to a cause of action.
Likewise if the distasteful conduct occurred in
a place not covered by the
sublease, no relief can be given on a claim for breach of the sublease.  On the
other hand, when one sees
the video tape of the female defendants' activities
and reads the almost uncontradicted evidence, it can clearly be seen that the
female defendants were not at all concerned to confine their distasteful
activities to council land.
<P>

75	Having said that, the key matter of present concern is whether the
obstruction occurred "within the common areas".
<P>

76	Mr Waugh in his additional written submissions put that the Memorandum is a
standard form and that it is not surprising that
it may be difficult to apply
its terminology to a particular lease.  He puts that there is in fact very
little common area or curtilage
in the present case and that the paths etc are
in fact on council land.
<P>

77	As I have indicated earlier, The Cargo Shed and its verandah occupy
virtually the whole of Lot 276.  However, in the Court of
Appeal decision of
<b>Wilcox v Richardson </b>(supra) the principal question was "what were areas
outside the area of Shop 1 which were to be considered to be common areas in
the
sub-demise"?  Handley, JA made it quite clear at page 17 of the report that
the present defendants had the right to use the parts
of the building  he
specified as ancillary to the demised premises.
<P>

78	At least some of the obstructive conduct, in particular the incident of 18
November, took place in passageways in The Cargo Shed
building.  This was to my
mind in a part of the common area.  There was thus at least some breach of
clause 4(i).
<P>

79	I do not consider that in view of my general findings in this case, I need
go further than merely finding some breach or no breach
of the relevant clauses
of the Memorandum.  The reason for this attitude will become clear, I hope, as
these reasons progress.
<P>

80	(iv)	The next complaint is as to a breach of clause 4(k) of the Memorandum
which is aimed at preventing the defendants from being
a nuisance to the lessor
or neighbouring occupiers.
<P>

81	Again, there is copious evidence of the conduct of the defendants,
particularly the female defendants spruiking and accosting
passers by.
<P>

82	The defendants submit that this conduct would not constitute nuisance as a
matter of law within the meaning of the covenant.
 They submit that the word
"nuisance" should be given its technical legal meaning, that the defendants are
not liable for congestion
and crowds which impede competing businesses and
their actions could not be said to be wholly unnecessary for the carrying on of
their business.
<P>

83	There is some support for the proposition that "nuisance" should be given
its technical legal meaning, see the cases referred
to in Bradbrook &amp; Croft
<b>Commercial Tenancy Law in Australia </b>2nd ed (Butterworths, Sydney, 1997)
at [7.14].  However, often courts consider such covenants are "Framed for the
very purpose of
securing a much more adequate protection than that given by the
ordinary law of nuisance":  <b>Ives v Brown </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1919%5d%202%20Ch%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1919] 2 Ch 314</a>, 321.  It is
necessary to look at each individual covenant to see what the word "nuisance"
means in its context.
<P>

84	In the instant case, the word "nuisance" is not conjoined with "annoyance".
However, it is conjoined with actions which may grow
to cause damage or
obstruction to the lessor or adjoining occupants.  Furthermore, there is a
combined term "any nuisance damage
or obstruction" which seems to me to take
the word "nuisance" out of its technical legal meaning of the tort of
nuisance.
<P>

85	The case which comes closest to the present is <b>Thompson-Schwab v Costaki
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%201%20WLR%20335" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] 1 WLR 335.</a>  In that case the defendant was soliciting people outside
the plaintiffs' residential premises in the West End of London for the
purposes
of her business of prostitution.  This was held to be a nuisance to the
plaintiffs and to justify the grant of an injunction.
 In the present case the
defendants are soliciting not for prostitution but for the purposes of getting
more business for their fish
and chip shop.  Although their soliciting might
not have quite the same impact as the defendant in the <b>Thompson-Schwab
case</b>, it still is conduct which could be said not to be reasonable
according to the ordinary usages of people living in society:
<b>Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1940/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%20AC%20880" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] AC 880</a>, 903.  
<P>

86	The evidence in the present case not only includes statements from the
plaintiffs and their customers as to the aggravation the
defendants' spruiking
causes them, but there are also newspaper letters which show that quite a
number of people who come to the
area are disturbed and offended by the
defendants' conduct.  Even discounting some of these for the fact that they may
be promoted
by one side or the other, there is sufficient there to show that
the conduct is disturbing.
<P>

87	In my view breach of the covenant against nuisance has been made out.
<P>

88	(D)	The effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.  This section provides that
apart from non-payment of rent, a landlord cannot exercise its right of
re-entry or forfeiture for breach
of covenant unless and until it has served on
the tenant a notice specifying the breach complained of, requiring the breach
to be
remedied and if need be, specifying compensation.
<P>

89	No notice that exactly complies with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> was given in the instant case.
Counsel for the defendants say that it ineluctably follows that the plaintiffs
cannot succeed in ejectment.
 
<P>

90	Mr Knaggs for the plaintiffs puts up five answers to that proposition,
namely:

of the sublease.
<P>

I will examine these matters briefly in turn.
<P>

91	(a)	It is certainly correct to say that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> by virtue of subsection (6)(a)
does not extend "to any Crown lease".  There is no definition in the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> of the term "Crown Lease".  Mr Knaggs submits that it does not
mean "Crown-Lease" as defined in s 5 of the Crown Lands Consolidation
Act of
1913 because the legislature has deliberately not used the hyphen.  Nor, he
submits, does it mean a lease in which the Crown
is the lessor because if that
were meant the simpler term to use would have been "lease from the Crown".
Thus, s 129 does not apply
to a head lease or any sublease where the subject of
the lease or sublease is land which is Crown lands.
<P>

92	This argument was put up at the heel of the hunt and was not answered by the
defendants whose submissions came earlier.
<P>

93	Section 129 has its genesis in s 1 of the Forfeiture of Leases Act  1901.
Section 1(6)(a) is in virtually identical terms to
the existing paragraph save
that the reference to the Mining Act has been updated.  The section itself came
from the Act 44 &amp;
45 Victoria C  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20Sec%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 Sec 14</a> of the United Kingdom Parliament.
The corresponding English section has never referred to Crown Leases for
obvious reasons.
<P>

94	In 1901, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act</a> in force was that of 1884 which does not appear
to contain any definition of "Crown-Lease".  Accordingly, I am not particularly
impressed
with Mr Knaggs' argument about the hyphen;  indeed, I may not have
been impressed about it even if history did not show it to be
erroneous.
<P>

95	The only line of cases that might appear helpful are those dealing with
rating of subleases of Crown lands but having perused
cases such as <b>Sydney
Grammar School v Sydney City Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%203%20LGRA%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 3 LGRA 68</a>, it does not seem to
me that any assistance can be had in that area.
<P>

96	It seems to me that one needs to go back to the purpose for the exception in
the original Act and in the present Act.  In my
view the reason for the
exemption was that there was a special statutory regime set up for termination
of Crown Leases and it was
not meant to contradict this regime by the
additional safeguards in s 129.  
<P>

97	Accordingly, in my view it is only where the Crown is the lessor so that the
forfeiture of lease provisions under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act 1989</a> applies that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
129(6)(a)</a> exempts the landlord from compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129.</a>  
<P>

98	(b)	Mr Knaggs relies on cases such as <b>Ex parte Dally-Watkins; Re Wilson
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2072%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 72 WN (NSW) 454</a> and <b>Johnson v Senes and Berger </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20NSWR%20566" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] NSWR
566</a> for the proposition that the informal notices given in the present case
were sufficient.  Although those cases make it clear that
a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> notice does
not have to be strictly in the form set out in the 6th Schedule to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, as Wallace J said at p 568 in <b>Johnson's case</b>:  "I do
not understand that an informal notice or one contained in correspondence can
legitimately omit any of the main features
or effect of the form otherwise the
Court would be overriding the Act."
<P>

99	Perhaps the first serious notice requiring rectification of breaches of
covenant was that given on 12 January 1998 which is headed
"Notice requiring
Rectification of Breaches of Covenant".  That notice, however, refers to the
covenants in the expired sublease.
 The new formal sublease was registered on 7
April 1998 and I need to look for notices given after that date.  There were
letters
of 29 April and 27 June 1998, making it clear that the landlord thought
that the tenants were in breach, but neither of these letters
came anywhere
near compliance with the material that has to be put in a statutory notice
under the 6th Schedule.  Accordingly, I
do not consider that this submission
holds up.
<P>

100	(c)	Clause 6(d)(iv) of the Memorandum seems to me only to deal with claims
for damages and does not go to ejectment.  Even if
that were incorrect, the
provision of the sublease could not prevail against s 129.  
<P>

101	(d)	Mr Knaggs says that a valid s 129 notice was given after the
proceedings were commenced and a further amended summons was
subsequently
filed.  As a cause of action can be relied on that has arisen since the
proceedings were commenced the court should
now allow a cause of action based
on the expiry of the new s 129 notice. 
<P>

102	Part 20 r1(3A) of the Supreme Court Rules says that an amendment may be
made to add a cause of action arising after the commencement
of the proceedings
but in such a case the date of the commencement of the proceedings so far as
that cause of action is concerned
shall be the date on which the amendment is
made.
<P>

103	The facts behind this assertion seem to lie in affidavits that are on the
court file which I have not formally read but which
may well have been read
before Bryson J during vacation.  It would seem that a s 129 notice was served
on the defendants about 22
December 1998 which does comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.  Some of the particulars, particularly the breaches of clause
4(k), refer to acts which were allegedly done between 8 and 17 December
1998,
about which I have received no evidence.  The last amended summons that I gave
leave to file was filed on 27 November 1998.
 I cannot see on the file any
further amended summons or an amended summons relying on a cause of action
which arose after the proceedings
commenced.  In any event there would need to
be a re-opening of the case to rely on the evidence that has not been read to
me and
that has not been sought.  The only re-opening that has been sought has
been to allow further submissions.  The attitude I have taken
is that this case
has gone on long enough, that I would publish my reasons with limited leave for
counsel and solicitors to debate
matters which had not been raised in writing.
This present matter goes beyond anything that has been sought or granted.
<P>

104	I should also remark that in perusing the more recent affidavits I saw a
comment by Mr French in an affidavit that I would be
giving judgment in
February or March 1999 by which time he may well be insolvent;  accordingly he
had to move the Vacation Judge.
 There is not a word in that affidavit about
the fact that the prime reason why judgment was not given in December was that
his solicitor
wished to make further submissions, which submissions were only
received about 29 January 1999.
<P>

105	  (e)	Up until recently, it was thought that doctrines of frustration and
repudiation may well not apply to leases because a
lease granted a form of
estate as well as granting contractual rights.  However, recent decisions of
both the High Court and the
Court of Appeal in NSW have made it clear that
ordinary contractual principles apply to leases.  Accordingly, a lease can
terminate
by repudiation and acceptance of the repudiation.  Whether there has
been repudiation in this case will be discussed in the next
section, but the
question here is, does <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> apply where the landlord alleges that there has
been a repudiation so that it cannot accept the repudiation until the notice
has
been given?
<P>

106	I think the answer to this is "No".  However, in saying this the nature of
repudiation must be considered.  Courts do not lightly
infer repudiation and
they will only do so if, (in this case) the subtenants, have evinced a complete
intention not to be bound by
the sublease.  If such a situation arose, then it
would seem to be completely futile to provide for a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> notice.  The section
speaks in terms of a right of re-entry or forfeiture under a stipulation for
breach of covenant.  It would seem
to me that where the complaint is not of
breach of a particular covenant, but a complete repudiation of all the
obligations under
the sublease, the section does not apply.
<P>

107	Accordingly, unless the landlord can establish a repudiation, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> prevents an order being made for possession in these
proceedings.
<P>

108	(E)  Have the subtenants repudiated the lease?  
<P>

Repudiation is not to be lightly inferred.  It involves expressly or impliedly
saying that the subtenants have evinced an intention
not to abide by the terms
of the sublease.  It will not be sufficient merely to show that there has been
a breach of condition, or
even a long term breach of something fundamental such
as consistent non-payment of rent.  The sublessees' failure must go to the
root
of the sublease and make further commercial performance impossible:  <b>Shevill
v The Builders' Licensing Board </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20620" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 620.</a>  
<P>

109	The instant sublease is peculiar in the sense that it, in clause 6(c)(i)
differentiates between covenants which are essential
terms and those which are
not.  The covenant to pay rent and clause 4(b) are essential terms, but the
other matters complained of
in the summons are not.  There has been no
non-payment of rent and I have held there has been no breach of clause 4(b).
Accordingly
all that the landlord has established is some breaches of covenant
of inessential terms.
<P>

110	Furthermore, the payment by the subtenants of their rent and their
continued occupation appear to me to evince an intention
that they will be
bound by the sublease despite breaches from time to time.
<P>

111	Accordingly I find that the subtenants have not repudiated the sublease.
<P>

112	(F)	It follows from what I have said in (D) and (E) that the plaintiffs are
not entitled to re-enter.
<P>

113	(G)	It follows from what I have said in (F) that the plaintiffs are not
entitled to an order for possession.
<P>

114	(H)	I now turn to the issue of whether the defendants were guilty of false
and misleading or deceptive conduct under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> in respect of
each of the 10 classes that I have noted above.
<P>

115	Before dealing with each of the ten heads, I should make some general
findings as to credit.  Both sides submitted that the
other were liars and
unreliable people whose credit was of little worth.  I think to a considerable
extent all those submissions
were correct.  Both sides seem to be motivated by
malice and seek to denigrate each other whenever they possibly can.  I have
borne
those facts in mind when making my assessment of credit in the facts
finding process.  
<P>

116	I will now deal with each of the heads of complaint.
<P>

117	(i)	The second plaintiff does not declare rent received from the defendants
as taxable income.
<P>

118	Mr Barrie Keenahan, a private investigator of Wollongong, called in at the
Kiama Harbour Wharf on Sunday 17 May 1998.  He says
that he was reading some
newspaper reports about the landlord which Mrs Wilcox had told him had been
exhibited out the front of her
shop.  He said that as he was reading Mrs Wilcox
said, "Our landlord is on the pension and he does not declare the $2000 a week
we
pay him rent, he has just purchased a new Mercedes for $140,000.  He is
cheating the Government and system in claiming the pension.
 He is a liar and
cheat.  We have had him in court and he purged [perjured] evidence.  I have
evidence of that."  Mrs Wilcox then
produced photostat copies of the second
plaintiff's 1998 pension card and a copy of a means and assets information
document relating
to him.  She handed those documents to other people as well.
Later Mrs Wilcox said, "We pay our landlord $2000 a week for rent and
he is too
lousy to pay for a garbage bin for his shop,  he walks around and puts his
rubbish into bins around town because he is
too lousy to pay for a bin."
<P>

119	On 27 May Mr Keenahan returned and whilst he was waiting to be served with
fish and chips Mrs Wilcox said, "Our landlord is
the director of five companies
and has assets of $5,000,000.  He does not declare the income from his
companies and he has applied
to the Attorney General's Office to pay off his
fines because he is a pensioner.  I went into Wollongong to the Attorney
General's
Office and gave them information on his assets.  He is a horrible man
...  He has illegally dug holes in the car park to put his
seats and tables and
the Council has got onto him about it.  He buys prawns from overseas which are
frozen and sells them at massive
profits.  I'm going to make it hard for him.
We sell fresh fish and prawns, his fish and prawns are not fresh.  He told me
he will
drive me out of here when my lease runs out and I pay him $2000 a week
rent, but he won't drive me out.  I'm going to ring Ray Martin
next and give
him all the information I have.  He will investigate him and get his pension
taken off him."  By "landlord" Mrs Wilcox
was referring to Mr French.  The
reference to "Ray Martin" was to a television journalist whom Mrs Wilcox
considered would be likely
to publicise such allegations.
<P>

120	There was no cross examination of Mr Keenahan because the parties recognise
that with 42 affidavits and a two day expedited
hearing it was not possible to
test every piece of evidence and that I should assume that where there was a
denial the parties were
at issue.  Whilst this did save money, it does mean
that I am a little hindered in my findings of fact.  
<P>

121	The evidence shows that Mr French is indeed an aged pensioner.  He says
that the rent is $2000 per month but it is paid to the
first plaintiff and not
to him.  Mrs Wilcox agreed that she said to people "We have to pay him $2000
per week rent".  She denies
saying that she ever said he did not declare that
rent for tax purposes.
<P>

122	The rent payable under the current sublease is set out as being $8,666.67
per month to be paid direct to the sublessor, Kiama
Development Co Pty Ltd, so
that it would seem that the $2000 per week of the defendants' evidence rather
than the $2000 per month
of the second plaintiff's evidence is the correct
figure.
<P>

123	How Mr French became an aged pensioner is not clear because the records
from the statutory authorities show that he is a one-half
beneficial
shareholder in the first plaintiff and that he, together with the third
plaintiff, are the sole directors.  Furthermore,
the first plaintiff is also
associated with two other companies, Terralong Estates Pty Ltd and Kiama
Holdings Pty Ltd, of which Mr
French is also the director and the holder of
shares beneficially.  However, there is very little evidence to show what the
assets
are of those companies and there is no evidence to show that the rent
received by the first plaintiff is or is not declared by the
first plaintiff
for taxation purposes. 
<P>

124	The statement that "We pay him $2000 a week rent" is inaccurate in that no
rent is actually paid to Mr French.  There is, accordingly,
no need for Mr
French to declare that rent as taxable income.  The statement is, accordingly,
false even to the extent that it was
admittedly made by Mrs Wilcox.
<P>

125	(ii)	The allegation is that the second plaintiff had purchased a new
Mercedes Benz for $140,000.  If this was said it was false
as the second
plaintiff owns a Toyota Corona and the third plaintiff owns a 1984 Mercedes
which Mr French values at $25,000. 
<P>

126	Mrs Wilcox denies that Mr Keenahan correctly reported what she says, but in
her affidavit DA19, she makes it clear that Mr Keenahan
could well have got
that impression.  She says "I have noticed John and Linda  (sic) French drive
to the Harbour in a white Mercedes
Benz about this time.  Previously they had
arrived in a mid 1980's gold Mercedes Benz or a white Toyota.  A customer said
about this
time that `The new Mercedes probably cost about $130,000'."
<P>

127	In the light of this material which was present in Mrs Wilcox's mind, in
the light of the malice she bears towards Mr French
and in the light of her
other comments about Mr French, it seems to me more likely than not that
despite her denials, she did utter
those words in Mr Keenahan's presence.  They
were false.
<P>

128	(iii)	The allegation is that the second plaintiff was accused of wrongfully
receiving pension payments.  Mrs Wilcox's answer
is "I am not aware if John
French is cheating the Government and system in claiming the pension and I deny
saying this to Mr Keenahan."
 That is a rather milk and water-type denial.  She
does not deny that she may have said it from time to time, it is consistent
with
her general banter that the second plaintiff is a liar, a cheat and a
rogue who is asset rich yet still preys on his subtenants and
the Government.
I believe it is more likely than not that she did say those words.
<P>

129	(iv)	The allegation is that the first and second defendants said that the
second plaintiff was a perjurer.  The second plaintiff
says that he denies that
he ever gave perjured evidence though he did make a mistaken statement to a
court in Wollongong and it is
correct that the magistrate at the time referred
the matter to the Attorney General.  Mr French also swears that he has heard
Mrs
Wilcox say "He has committed perjury".  Mrs Wilcox puts that she has said
"French has been reported for possible perjury".  Her counsel
put that this is
consistent with the newspaper cuttings annexed to her affidavit, but headings
such as "Kiama landlord `lied on oath'
Charge of perjury considered" scarcely
suggest that such charges are only possible.  The second article which is
attached claims
that the second plaintiff "had deliberately lied under oath, a
court heard yesterday".
<P>

130	Having seen the video tape and having cognizance of the way in which the
defendants carried on generally in respect of Mr French,
I cannot accept that
Mrs Wilcox was so mild as to use the word "possible".  Her whole gamut was to
blacken the character of Mr French
and to have customers diverted to her shop.
"Possible perjury" is just too weak to achieve that aim.  Accordingly I find
that those
words were said.
<P>

131	(v)	The next allegation is that the first and second defendants have said
that Mr French deposits rubbish from his business
premises in public garbage
bins.  Mr French denies that he does this though he says that he does clean up
litter left by the public
around his shop and does put some of that in the bin.
Mrs Wilcox denies saying the words, but then says that if she had said them
they would be true.  This is borne out by the evidence of Mr Cross, a former
employee of Mr French who swore an affidavit on behalf
of the defendants. 
<P>

132	Of course, the mere fact that words are literally true does not deprive
them of the capacity to be false and misleading in appropriate
cases. 
<P>

133	The statement of Mr Keenahan was that Mr French was supposed to have walked
around Kiama putting his rubbish into bins around
town.  This was never
established as being true.  I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities
that Mrs Wilcox did say those
words.   It is word against word, the reference
to Kiama generally rather than the public bins near the Blowhole make me a
little
suspicious as does the background of evidence given on this issue such
as that of Mr Cross.  Accordingly, I would not find this alleged
breach
established.
<P>

134	(vi)	The second plaintiff is a director of five companies and has assets of
$5 million.  This seems to me very close to the
allegation in (iii) and the
same considerations apply to it.
<P>

135	In her affidavit Mrs Wilcox says she had investigated Mr French's affairs
and knew he was a director of three companies.  However,
mere fact would not
stop her from exaggerating if she thought it was appropriate to do so.
<P>

136	I should note that when Mrs Wilcox was cross examined, none of the cross
examination went anywhere near the present point. 
However, the "no <b>Browne v
Dunn</b>" arrangement made between counsel would account for some of this.  I
must, however, be careful that this informal arrangement does
not make the
burden of proof shift.  Although I have some suspicion about this, it seems
that it falls just the other side of the
line to (iii) and it is something that
I should not find established.
<P>

137	(vii)	This is an allegation that the second plaintiff illegally made holes
in the car park.  Mr French agrees that he erected
metal posts at the western
end of the car park, but he says that those posts were stolen.  It would seem
that the holes were dug
on Lot 277.  I think the probabilities must be that Mr
Keenahan did not note accurately what Mrs Wilcox said so that I should not
find
this matter established.
<P>

138	(viii)	There is an allegation that the second plaintiff buys frozen prawns
from overseas and sells them for massive profits.
  Mr French agrees that he
does sell frozen prawns, but denies that they are sold at massive profits.
Although the prawns may have
come from overseas, they are in fact purchased
from a wholesaler in Wollongong.
<P>

139	Mrs Wilcox says that Mr French sold cooked prawns for $27.90 per kilogram
when she was selling fresh prawns for $19.90 a kilogram
and she would comment
about this.  It seems to me that whilst it was true that Mr French was selling
frozen prawns, it was an exaggeration
to say "He buys prawns from overseas" and
"sells them at massive profits".  It is more likely than not that those words
were said
in my view and I find (viii) established.
<P>

140	(ix)	This deals with the allegation of a sign which is misleading.  
<P>

141	It seems to me that there is so much discussion in this case about various
signs and whether they were permitted by the council
or the sublease or what
have you, that even if these words were said, it would be very difficult to say
that they were false and
misleading referring to signs generally.
<P>

142	(x)	There is insufficient evidence to establish that words were said about
customers of the plaintiffs' business suffering from
food poisoning.
<P>

143	(I)	In view of what I have said under (H) it is necessary to consider
whether the matters found in (H) together show an unlawful
interference with
the second and third plaintiffs' business or were false and misleading in trade
and commerce.  
<P>

144	Little attention was paid in the submissions of either side to the matter
of unlawful interference with trade or business. 
The tort is dealt with by
<b>Fleming on Torts </b>9th ed  (LBC, Sydney, 1998) pp 765-766.  It does not
seem to me that even if all the allegations under (H) had been proved, that the
tort has been made out.  The defendants' conduct seems to be conduct
predominantly committed in their own interests in an endeavour
to procure
people not to enter into or renew a contract with the plaintiffs.  (This high
faluting language is hardly appropriate
for competing fish and chip shops, but
it is the test I must apply).  The defendants' conduct is thus not actionable
as unlawful
interference of business.
<P>

145	So far as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> is concerned, the matters that I
have found established are false and misleading in trade and commerce.  The
more interesting question
is whether they ground in damages or an injunction, a
question with which I will deal in sections (J) and (K).
<P>

146	(J)	The High Court in respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (the
corresponding section to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>, now being considered)
have found that the statutory power to grant injunctions was an exclusive
charter where there is a contravention
of a provision of the relevant part of
the Act:   <b>Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 150</a>, 162.   Although s 65 may be invoked by a competitor,
the essential thrust of s 65 is that it is a public interest provision and
the
court must bear that in mind when making an order:  <b>ICI Australia Operations
Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/474.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 474</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20110%20ALR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 110 ALR 47.</a>  
<P>

147	Although the court is empowered to grant an injunction in such terms as it
determines to be appropriate and may do so whether
or not it appears that the
defendants intend to engage again in the conduct, the injunction is to protect
against the false and misleading
conduct, not to deal with a wider class of
conduct of which the conduct in contravention of Part 5 of the Act is a
part.
<P>

148	Further, it must always be remembered that, when granting an injunction
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>, the court must, as is the case with
ordinary injunctions in nuisance and other cases, frame the injunction
sufficiently clearly
that the party enjoined  knows "What is expected of him as
a matter of fact":  <b>Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices
Commission </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2012%20ATPR%2041%2d019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 12 ATPR 41-019</a>, 51,351.
<P>

149	I cannot see any real purpose in granting an injunction in the traditional
form because it is not only hard to frame, but also
relatively useless.
Furthermore, the court does not, as a general rule, order an apology for the
reasons that I set out in <b>Summertime Holdings Pty Ltd v Environmental
Defenders' Office Ltd </b>(to be reported in 45 NSWLR).  Mr Knaggs says that
the right of free speech is no defence to a claim under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>.
That is so, but that right does disincline the court to order people to give
apologies.
<P>

150	However, under the corresponding section in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, the
Federal Court has held that it is sometimes appropriate to make an injunction
in the form of an order for corrective advertising;
 see for instance
<b>Janssen Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd </b>(1985) 8 ATPR 40-654.

<P>

151	I believe that such corrective advertising in the form of signs which are
approved by the landlord and by me to be displayed
for a defined period would
be sufficient relief.  It may be that for the sake of future peace the
advertisements should merely be
in the form of a class B apology, but I will
leave the drafting until the time short minutes are brought in.
<P>

152	(K)	Do any damages flow under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> or for the breaches of
the sublease which I have found established?
<P>

153	Damages for breach of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> come under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> which provides
so far as is relevant that "A person who suffers loss or damage <u>by</u>
conduct of another person that is in contravention of Part ... 5 ... may
recover the amount of the loss or damage...".  I have underlined
the word "by"
because the High Court has held in <b>Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a>, 525, that the word "by" indicates the necessity to
prove causation.  
<P>

154	What damage was caused by those statements in (H) which I have found
proved?
<P>

155	Mr Knaggs submits that the answer to that question is $750 per day.  He
gets that by referring to evidence that in one of the
stoushes between the
parties in the Wollongong Local Court the defendants asked for that amount of
witness expenses on the basis
that being in Wollongong Court and not being
about to spruik, they would have lost that amount.  Mr Knaggs concedes that
without
that evidence there would be no evidence to quantify the damages.
<P>

156	I do not consider that this material is sufficient to quantify the damages.
What must be shown is that the damage was caused
by the false and misleading
comments, not the spruiking generally.
<P>

157	Furthermore, there is no evidence that anyone ever believed what Mrs Wilcox
was saying.  The evidence that the defendants' conduct
affected the sales of
the second and third plaintiffs' business is slim.  Indeed, no attempt was made
to produce any trading figures
of the plaintiffs' business or any accountant's
evidence to give some credibility to there being a loss.  This evidence must
have
been within the plaintiffs' camp, and its non-production leads me to infer
that it could not have been produced.
<P>

158	Thus, in my view, damages can only be nominal.  I would assess them at
$1,000.
<P>

159	So far as breach of the lease is concerned, I have found breaches of
clauses 4(f), 4(i) and 4(k).  There is no proof of any
loss caused by these
breaches.  The plaintiffs are entitled to nominal damages which are included in
the $1000 just referred to.
<P>

160	(L)	I now have to consider how the costs of these proceedings (other than
the cross claim) should be paid or borne.  It follows
from what I have said,
that the plaintiffs have succeeded on some minor matters and have failed on the
major matters which they raised.
 They have failed to get ejectment, they have
failed to get substantial damages.  My view is that each side should pay its,
his or
her own costs of the action to date.
<P>

161	(M)	I now pass to the cross claim.  The first question is whether the
plaintiffs have been guilty of false and misleading conduct
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</a> in respect of all or any of the four matters that I outlined in the
opening of this judgment.  I will deal with these seriatim.
<P>

162	(i)	(1)	Did the display of the sign "The Truth" constitute conduct
contravening <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>?
<P>

163	The defendants say that this sign was misleading and deceptive because the
sign contains the statement "As owners of The Cargo
Shed at Kiama" which they
say is false because the plaintiffs are merely lessees from the Crown.  Then it
is said that it is false
to say "We have attempted to negotiate with the
tenants to have a caf&eacute;/restaurant".  The defendants say there have been
very
few negotiations, and in any event, the erection of a restaurant is
contrary to the head lease.   Then it is said that the statement
"They want to
be the only shop on the site" is untrue as is the statement "They will do
anything they can to get rid of us or any
other competition".  
<P>

164	There is no doubt at all that the sign was displayed.  It is also correct
to say that the statements made on the sign were not
completely accurate and
true.  However, the conduct of the defendants generally do show that they will
go to considerable pains to
get rid of competition by the plaintiffs and their
conduct in spruiking is not the ordinary conduct one expects of fellow traders.

<P>

165	In my view the sign was to a slight degree false and misleading.
<P>

166	(ii)	The second complaint is as to the sign "The Simple Fact".  There are
some minor quibbles as to whether the expression "Nothing
Has Changed" is
correct and as to whether "They renewed their lease this April" is correct, but
neither expression read in context
should be given the relatively artificial
construction the defendants put on them.
<P>

167	The main complaint is that the sign implies that the defendants are
preventing the plaintiffs from opening an eat-in restaurant
which is not the
case.  The restaurant cannot be opened because of the terms of the head lease.
I do not consider that the sign makes
that implication.  It merely says "The
front shop people are delaying our plans".  Accordingly I do not find the sign
"The Simple
Fact" false or misleading.
<P>

168	(iii)	The next complaint is about a flyer headed "A Restaurant at the
Harbour" which is annexed BS12 to Mrs Spicer's affidavit
DA18.  This flyer
repeated much of the material in the two signs. It does suggest that the
defendants have successfully delayed the
building of a restaurant on the site
and want to be the only operators on the site and are bent on destroying any
competition.  I
do consider this goes beyond a truthful statement and does
contain false and misleading statements.
<P>

169	(iv)	The most significant matter under this head is that the defendants
complain that the plaintiffs put up a sign "Main Entrance"
which would lead
members of the public to think that the plaintiffs' shop was the principal fish
and chip shop in the building and
thereby direct custom away from the
defendants. 
<P>

170	There is no doubt at all that this sign was erected by the plaintiffs.
<P>

171	The plaintiffs seem to think that their stratagem in registering the words
"Main Entrance" as a business name and pretending
that "Main Entrance" was the
name of their shop excuses the erection of the sign over the entrance to their
premises which conveys
the false and misleading impression that the entrance to
the plaintiffs' shop is the principal entrance to fish and chips purveyors
in
the building.  As I say, there is no denial merely gloating over cleverness.
This, to my mind, is a serious matter of false and
misleading conduct in trade
and commerce.
<P>

172	(N)	What should be done about the breaches set out in (M)?
<P>

173	The defendants do not seek damages but they do seek injunctions.  I believe
that they are entitled to an injunction to restrain
any recurrence of the
conduct involving the sign "Main Entrance".  So far as the other matters are
concerned, I would be prepared
to make a similar order to that which I forecast
in the case of breaches by the defendants requiring corrective advertising so
far
as "The Truth" and the flyer were concerned.
<P>

174	(O)	I have already held under section (C)(ii) that in respect of the signs
for which the defendants have sought consent, such
consent has been
unreasonably withheld.  I would be prepared to make a declaration to that
effect.  However, there has not been an
actual application in respect of each
sign that the defendants wish to erect and, for the reasons already given, in
respect of such
signage for which there has been no application, there can have
been no unreasonable refusal to consent.
<P>

175	(P)	The defendants seek a declaration that they may now erect such signs.
It follows, for the reasons given in (C)(ii) and (O)
that such a declaration
should be made in respect of the signs the subject of the declarations referred
to in (O).
<P>

176	(Q)	The defendants say that if the court finds their conduct in approaching
customers outside the building a breach of clauses
4(i) or 4(k) then the same
conduct by the plaintiffs in approaching potential customers handing out flyers
and distributing samples
must similarly amount to a breach of the covenant for
quiet enjoyment.  Furthermore there has been interference by Mr French with
the
coolroom motors as deposed to by Mr Cross in his affidavit DA32.
<P>

177	There are some difficulties with the first proposition.  The landlord is
the first plaintiff.  The person who was issuing the
flyers was the second
plaintiff.  It does not necessarily follow that what the second plaintiff was
doing was an act authorised by
the first plaintiff especially when it is
remembered that the second plaintiff and the third plaintiff are personally the
operators
of the competing business.
<P>

178	However, the present state of the law is that the landlord is obliged not
only to behave properly towards the subtenant itself
but to make sure that
those persons under its control behave properly.  Mr French was under the
control of the first plaintiff or
vice versa and the first plaintiff is liable
for his conduct.  The conduct in handing out the flyers is as much a breach of
the covenant
for quiet enjoyment by the landlord as is the conduct of the
defendants in their activities with respect to clause 4(k) of the sublease.
<P>

179	As to the allegation that Mr French put paper across the front of the
radiator and compressor of the defendants' business so
as to cause the motors
to overheat, Mr Cross says he was told this by Mr French.  Mr French denied it
under cross examination.  I
cannot be satisfied that the allegation has been
made out.
<P>

180	I do not consider that I should make any injunction in respect of the
breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment but I think I should
find nominal
damages in the sum of $1000 because the conduct is much the same as the conduct
for which I found nominal damages the
other way.
<P>

181	(R)	Relief against forfeiture is sought, but in view of my previous
findings it is unnecessary.
<P>

182	(S)	Before dealing with the result of this case I should make some general
comments.  The first is that although the parties
have a great propensity for
irritating each other, the current litigation has really been a complete waste
of time in that some of
their irritations have been found to sound in nominal
damages and some have not.  At a recent mention of the matter I indicated that
this might be a case where a Supreme Court Judge ought to, in the exercise of
his powers as a Justice of the Peace,  bind all the
natural persons over to
keep the peace for a year on a $100,000 good behaviour bond.  If police time
were to be wasted again in the
future by trivial incidents then the court could
merely call up the bond, have the Sheriff sell both businesses, pay the
proceeds
to the Crown as a fine and the problem would be solved for the people
of Kiama.  I may raise this matter again when short minutes
are brought in.
<P>

183	The case was peculiar in many ways.  Apart from the lack of cross
examination, both sides seemed to keep back any figures as
to their trading.
This gave me the general impression that neither could really say that their
businesses were detrimentally affected
by the other's activities.  However,
there was some material which was of concern such as the declaration by the
second plaintiff
annexed as RW1 to Mrs Wilcox's affidavit DA19, in which Mr
French applied to the Wollongong Local Court for time to pay a fine on
the
basis that he owned no house or land, a car worth $500, furniture worth $4000
and a computer worth $1000 and was a pensioner.
 The "shares or investments"
portion of the form as the declaration of assets was left blank even though Mr
French owns shares in
three companies including the first plaintiff which was
receiving $2000 a week in rent.
<P>

184	Another matter of concern was that it both appeared in the cross
examination of Mr French and also what happened before Abadee
J in vacation,
that although Mr Knaggs was the solicitor on the record and conducted the case
in court, most of the affidavits were
in fact prepared by Mr French himself and
on occasions Mr French would approach the court himself.  Affidavits prepared
by a party,
especially where the case involves very hot feelings between the
litigants is something to be avoided at almost every cost.  Again,
and I am not
saying that this necessarily happened in the instant case, solicitors who have
their name on the record and who have
their names on affidavits do impliedly
acknowledge to the court that they take responsibility for those affidavits and
embarrassment
can be caused to solicitors if they allow clients to use their
name at least without proper supervision.
<P>

185	For the reasons I have already given the result of the case is that the
plaintiffs' claim for possession fails.  The plaintiffs
are entitled to nominal
damages of $1000 plus corrective advertising.  The defendants succeed for
nominal damages for $1000 plus
some corrective advertising.  
<P>

186	I have already indicated there should be no costs on the claim.  So far as
the cross claim is concerned virtually the same matters
were agitated and I do
not consider there should be any order for costs on the cross claim either.
<P>

187	At the last time the matter was mentioned in court, I indicated that I
would just publish my reasons and then stand the matter
over for short minutes
to be brought in.  The main difficulty about those short minutes will probably
be the corrective advertising.
 What I have in mind is one advertisement or
poster containing mutual apologies which might be displayed outside The Cargo
Shed so
that members of the public can be corrected in any false impression
that they may have formed about all or any of the parties as
a result of any
previous activity of any of the parties.
<P>

188	I believe, in view of what has happened in the past that defendants'
counsel should produce the first draft and submit it to
the solicitor for the
plaintiffs in due time for  there to be a meaningful response before the next
appearance in court.
<P>

189	In view of the overly generous provision I have already made for the
tendering of additional submissions and the length of time
that has passed, I
would be loath to permit any further reopening of argument even if someone
alleges that a point dealt with in
these reasons was not addressed in
submissions.
<P>

190	It may be a vain hope, but I trust these reasons, the finding that both
sets of parties were somewhat at fault and the cost
of this litigation will
mean that for the balance of the term of the sublease, the parties will be able
to co-exist.  I realise that
the result is virtually a draw and that there is
no bar on fresh ejectment proceedings, but some estoppels may have been
created.
<P>

191	In view of what has happened in the past, I should remind everyone that it
is a contempt of court to misrepresent the judgment
of the court;  see
<b>Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer
Organisations Inc (No 2) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/83.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 83</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2041%20FCR%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 41 FCR 89</a>, 92 and my extra-judicial
commentary on that case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2067%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 67 ALJ 487-490</a> which I now formally adopt
without repeating what I there said.
<P>

192	Accordingly I will merely stand the matter over for mention on 22 April
1999 at 9.30 am for short minutes to be brought in.
   Should the date I have
chosen be inappropriate, the advocates for the parties may alter it by
arrangement with my Associate, provided
adequate notice is given.
