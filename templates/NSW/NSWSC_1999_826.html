<center><b>JUDGMENT - Quashing plaintiff's subpoena, see p 71 of
transcript</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff seeks a declaration that the
defendant, acting as a Deputy State Coroner in "reopening" an inquest
into the
death of Caroline Theresa Byrne, acted in excess of his jurisdiction.
<P>

2   	For present purposes it is necessary only to state that it
is prima facie established that the defendant did so for the purpose
of
enabling him to exercise the powers under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 44</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</a></i>
to prevent publication of material which had been supplied by the police at a
time following his making of an open finding in relation
to Miss Byrne's
death.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff issued a subpoena directed to the Crown
Solicitor to produce written communications or notes of such communications
between the Deputy State Coroner and the Crown Solicitor.  Mr Abernethy
intimated during the course of the "reopened" proceeding
that he had sought and
obtained such advice in connection with the proceeding and by implication the
order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 44</a> which he proposed to make.
<P>

4   	In the ordinary course such communications would be
privileged.  It has, however, been submitted to me that either by virtue
of the
common law or by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 125</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> (the
Act) the privilege is expunged or does not arise.  For present purposes, if
there is a difference between the common law and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 125</a>, it is immaterial.

<P>

5   	Communications of the kind specified in the subpoena did
occur and have been produced to the Court.  In accordance with the
procedure
enunciated by the High Court of Australia in <i>Alister v R</i> (1984) 154 CLR
404<i>,</i> and with the consent of both parties, I have examined those
documents.  However, I have been able to come to my conclusion without
regard
to their content.  Nevertheless, because of the importance of this matter, I
should observe that nothing in the documents
would assist the plaintiff to
establish any abuse of power.
<P>

6   	The crucial discussion as to the circumstances in which an
abuse of power may remove any prima facie legal professional privilege
is to be
found in the judgments of the High Court of Australia in <i>Attorney-General
for the Northern Territory of Australia v Kearney</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20158%20CLR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 158 CLR 500.</a>  The
documents being considered in that case and for which privilege was claimed
were communications between the officers of the
Northern Territory Government
and the Government's legal officers for the purpose of obtaining and giving
legal advice.  It was submitted
that these communications came into being as
part of a scheme to defeat<i> </i>land claims made under the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/alrta1976444/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal</i>
<i>Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act</a></i> 
<P>

1976.  By procuring the administrator to make certain regulations under
legislation relating to town planning, it was submitted
that the preparation
and drafting of the relevant regulations amounted to an abuse of process.
<P>

7   	In dealing with the submission that the protection of
privilege does not extend to a case of this kind, the Chief Justice considered
that the exception to the privilege in cases of crime and fraud "extended to
include anything that might be described as a fraud
on justice" (158 CLR at
514).  His Honour held that legal professional privilege will be denied to a
communication "made to further
an illegal purpose", adding:
<P>

"It would be contrary to the public interest which the privilege is designed to
secure - the better administration of justice -
to allow it to be used to
protect communications made to further a of statutory power and by that abuse
to prevent others from deliberate
abuse exercising their rights under the law.
It would shake public confidence in the law if there was reasonable ground for
believing
that a regulation had been enacted for an unauthorised purpose <i>and
</i>with the intent of frustrating legitimate claims, and yet the law protected
from disclosure the communications made to seek and give
advice in carrying out
that purpose." (158 CLR at 515.  Emphasis added.)
<P>

8   	This statement of principle appropriately applies in this
case.  It must be read in the light of the distinction made in <i>Bullivant v
Attorney-General (Victoria) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%20AC%20196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] AC 196</a> at 207 by Lord Lindley, between
an intention by a client to escape the consequences of the law, although it
applied to him, on the
one hand, and an attempt to remain outside the
application of the law on the other.  Section 125 (1) (b) of the Act states:
<P>

"125 (1) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of:
<P>

(a)...
<P>

(b) a communication or the contents of a document that the client or lawyer (or
both), or the party, knew or ought reasonably to
have known was made or
prepared in furtherance of a deliberate abuse of a power."
<P>

It is obvious that the words "deliberate abuse" derive from the judgment of
Gibbs CJ to which I have just referred.
<P>

9   	In this case, insofar as any prima facie case is
established, I am satisfied that it demonstrates that the Magistrate wished
to
ascertain what his powers were, not so that he might avoid or evade them but,
on the contrary, that he might appropriately apply
them.  It may well be that
he suspected that the question was a controversial one but this is the reason
that any client might and
indeed should obtain legal advice to ensure, not that
the law can be evaded but rather that it can be obeyed.
<P>

10   	Even if, in the result, and it is not necessary for me to
decide this point at this stage, the defendant erred in law in thinking,
after
receiving legal advice, that he had the power to reopen the inquest despite his
previous open finding, and further to make
the order complained of, this could
not by itself amount to a deliberate abuse of power.  Such a motive requires
consideration, as
seems to me obvious, of intent or purpose.  It follows that
it will never or almost never be capable of determination by the mere
objective
circumstance of illegality.  Of course, the nature and circumstances of the
illegality may enable the improper purpose
or intention to be deduced and
perhaps to the level of prima facie proof, but in this case there is no
evidence which would permit
such a conclusion.
<P>

11   	Accordingly the subpoena is quashed.
<P>

12   	The defendant must have the costs of the notice of motion
of 6 April 1999.  I will reserve on the substantive question.
<P>
