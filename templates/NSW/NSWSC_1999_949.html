<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:   This is an appeal against an order
dismissing two informations, brought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s104.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 104(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices
Act</a></b> 1902 by the informant.  The proceedings were before the Bidura
Children's Court on 21 April 1999.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff seeks an order setting aside the order of the
Magistrate that the visual identification evidence of Anna Brielle
Flinders
(identifying the defendants Karen Rebecca McEntee and Elizabeth Jane Donald)
was inadmissible for the reason that it did
not comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 114(2)</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> 1995.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff further seeks an order in respect of each
defendant that the evidence be admitted;  orders setting aside the
Magistrate's
orders dismissing the informations;  and orders that both matters be remitted
to the Magistrate to be determined according
to law.      
<P>

4   	Ms Flinders was robbed by three young women on or about 12
November 1998.  On 28 November 1998 Ms Flinders was driving her
car when she
saw two young women, the defendants in the present proceedings;  she recognised
those two young women as two of the
three women who had earlier robbed her.
She reported the matter to the police.  The two defendants were subsequently
arrested by
the police.  
<P>

5   	The evidence of Ms Flinders as to her identification of the
two women was held by the Magistrate to be inadmissible, having
regard to the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 114(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.
<P>

6   	The Magistrate found that the police had failed to comply
with the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 114</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> in that no
identification parade had been held following the arrest of the two women.  
<P>

7   	The identification, upon which the prosecution relied, was
the act of identification prior to the arrest of the two defendants.
 It was
not possible for the police to have held an identification parade prior to that
time.  
<P>

8   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 114(2)</a> provides that visual identification evidence
adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless:
<P>

9   	(a) 	an identification parade including the defendant was
held before the 	identification was made or 
<P>

(b) 	it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade or 
<P>

(c) 	that the defendant refused to take part in such a parade, and the
identification was made without the person who made it having
been
intentionally influenced to identify the defendant.
<P>

10   	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 114(2)(a)</a> and subject to sub-paras (b) and (c),
evidence of identification will not be admissible unless an identification
parade was held
"before the identification was made".  The identification upon
which the prosecution relied was made when Mrs Flinders first saw
the
defendants on 28 November.  Having regard to this circumstance it is an
irresistible conclusion that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 114(2)(b)</a> applied and the evidence of Ms
Flinders as to visual identification was not rendered inadmissible for the want
of an identification
parade.
<P>

11   	I consider there is considerable force in the submissions
advanced by Mr Berman, who appears on behalf of the informant, that
had the
police arranged an identification parade following the arrest of the two
defendants any identification made at that parade
by Ms Flinders might be said
to have been contaminated by her earlier identification of the two women: <b>
Alexander v Queen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20145%20CLR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 145 CLR 359</a> at 409;  <b>R v Carusi</b>  (1997) 192
A Crim R 52 at 55;  and <b>R v Clarke (1998)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=97%20A%20Crim%20R%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">97 A Crim R 414.</a>  
<P>

12   	For these reasons I consider that the Magistrate erred in
law in concluding, for the reasons that he did, that the evidence
of
identification of the witness, Anna Brielle Flinders, was inadmissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
114</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.
<P>

13   	I set aside the orders of the Magistrate in respect of
each defendant rejecting the evidence of Anna Brielle Flinders as inadmissible
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s114.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 114(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.  I set aside, in the case of
each defendant, the order of the Magistrate dismissing the information against
her charging her with
armed robbery contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 97(1)</a> of the <b>Crimes
Act</b>.  I order in the case of each defendant that the proceedings be
remitted to the Magistrate to be dealt with in accordance with the
law.  I do
not consider that I have the power or that it would be appropriate to make
orders in terms of para 2 of the Amended Summons,
namely, that the evidence be
admitted in the proceedings before the Magistrate.  I propose remitting the
proceedings to the Magistrate
and he may consider the admission of the visual
identification evidence in the light of any further objection which may be
advanced
to its reception. 
<P>

14   	I order that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs as
assessed.  I order that indemnity certificates in accordance with
s 6 of the
<b>Suitor's Fund Act</b> be granted to each defendant.
