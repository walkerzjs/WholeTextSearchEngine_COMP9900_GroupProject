<b><u>3909/97  -  HELICOPTER FLEET MANAGEMENT PTY LTD &amp; ANOR v GEOFFREY
McNIEL ELLISON &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The question to be decided in this action is whether the
plaintiff, Helicopter Fleet Management Pty Ltd (HFM) or
the first defendant, Mr
Ellison, is entitled to possession of a helicopter engine serial No CAE 835487
which had been placed in a
Hughes 500C helicopter serial No VHFHL (FHL) the
property of a company, Goldwatch Pty Ltd (Goldwatch).
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2	Goldwatch by deed dated 20 November 1995, charged certain property by way of
fixed and floating charge in favour of Paradise Helicopters
(Cairns) Pty
Limited.  By deed dated 30 July 1997, Paradise Helicopters (Cairns) Pty Limited
appointed Mr Ellison receiver and manager
of the property of Goldwatch subject
to the charge.
<P>

3	Mr and Mrs Lanham at the relevant times were the directors and shareholders
of Goldwatch.  At that time they apparently carried
on a helicopter services
business under the name of Paradise Helicopters, which is not shown to be
connected with the company of
that name.  At an earlier time Goldwatch
conducted the business of Paradise Helicopters, but that is of little
importance.  
<P>

4	Goldwatch originally purchased the helicopter FHL in 1991.  It seems to have
suffered various vicissitudes.  It was involved in
a forced landing in 1995
when its engine failed.  A replacement engine was hired or leased from Hawker
de Havilland Pty Limited at
a cost of $180 per flying hour.  During a service,
the compressor from that engine was removed by the maintenance technicians,
Aircraft
Technicians of Australia Pty Ltd (ATA). The compressor was sent for
repair but was apparently beyond repair and thereafter the helicopter
stood
grounded at Caloundra airport from about November 1996 until March 1997.
<P>

5	In early 1997 Mr Castles, the managing director of ATA, was asked by Mr
Lanham to source a new engine for him, presumably meaning
for Goldwatch.  He
made various inquiries and located a number of engines and ultimately located
the engine under litigation here,
which was available through Yunger Aviation
Services in Victoria.  He sent details to Mr Lanham and recommended its
purchase.  At
that time Paradise Helicopters owed his company a considerable
amount and he said that he would only have further dealings if he
was paid the
full amount and would not deliver the engine without full payment.  He or his
company appear to have acted as principal,
purchasing the engine from Yunger
Aviation Services and obtaining delivery of it from that company on a deposit
of $20,000.
<P>

6	The purchase price from ATA was $83,000.  There was a subsequent sum of close
to $4,000 paid for the installation of the engine.
 Those moneys were paid to
ATA as to $40,000 by Mr Green, the second plaintiff and a director of the
plaintiff, and as to the balance
of $43,000, together with the subsequent
installation costs by the second defendant.  
<P>

7	Mr Cunneen, the controlling force of the second defendant, is a man who is
involved in the flight business and who had previous
dealings with Mr Green.
Mr Green had had prior dealings with Mr and Mrs Lanham, having lent them
$150,000 earlier in 1997 to enable
them or their company to purchase another
helicopter.
<P>

8	The plaintiff does not claim beneficial ownership in the engine in question,
but rather claims that it is the legal owner holding
the engine upon trust for
Mr Green and L &amp; C Cunneen &amp; Co Pty Limited, the second defendant.
<P>

9	Upon being appointed receiver, Mr Ellison became aware of a claim by Mr
Green, or the first plaintiff, as to ownership of the
engine.  He asked for
proof of entitlement.  Mr Green's solicitor wrote to him on 13 August 1997
setting out the terms of the agreement
which were, in short, that Mr Green on
behalf of the first plaintiff, which at that time was called Microy Investments
Pty Ltd, and
Mr Lanham on behalf of Goldwatch, agreed that Helicopter Fleet
Management would purchase the engine for $82,000 with an installation
fee of
$1,000;  that Goldwatch would re-finance  both the helicopter and engine and by
that re-financing would purchase from HFM
the engine for $83,000, and that
until such time as that was done, Mr Green would have the right on behalf of
the first plaintiff
to use the helicopter free of hire charges and that
Goldwatch would pay HFM $160 per week for the engine.
<P>

10	Mr Green repeated this in much the same terms in an affidavit he swore on 20
October 1997.  He also said that the plaintiff had
paid the $83,000 and
explained this by saying he regarded the plaintiff as his. When I say "the
plaintiff as his", I mean the plaintiff
Helicopter Fleet Management.  That
hardly helped him because the second defendant had paid more, but nevertheless
that was what was
said in the affidavit.
<P>

11	The invoice for the engine from ATA was dated 26 March 1997.  The customer
is shown as Microy Investments.  Microy Investments
Pty Limited was the
plaintiff's former name.  This is the only document giving evidence of the
plaintiff's title or of transfer of
title.  The payment details are set out on
that document.
<P>

12	On 24 April 1997 Microy Investments wrote to the second defendant as
follows:
<P>

"Engine for VH-FHL
<P>

Reference is made to the following moneys used to purchase the engine serial
number now installed in the above helicopter:  $40,000
provided by Allan Green
and $46,000 provided by your company.
<P>

I hereby acknowledge that until total funds of $86,000 have been fully paid to
the respective providers above, the ownership of
the said engine remains
jointly with Allan Green and L &amp; E Cunneen &amp; Co Pty Limited.  I further
acknowledge that the installation
of the said engine for VH-FHL is on account
of rental only and may be terminated and withdrawn by the owners of the engine
without
notice or reservation."
<P>

13	This letter was signed by Mr Green as director of Microy Investments Pty
Ltd. Whatever else its effect was, it would certainly
show that Microy
Investments (later HFM) was not the beneficial owner of the engine.
<P>

14	Mr Cunneen was acquainted with Mr and Mrs Lanham.  He was aware of the
negotiations for the purchase of the engine.  He said
that he was prepared to
participate in this with Mr Green, provided that Mr Green paid the first
$40,000, that he would then pay
the $46,000, and that Microy Investments Pty
Limited must acknowledge that the engine's ownership remain with him and Mr
Green until
it was fully paid for in any subsequent sale.  He said that the
next steps were to send a fax confirming payment of the deposit,
such a fax to
state that the invoice was in the name of Microy Investments and to obtain
written instructions for the taking of the
purchase moneys and that he would
then bank the remaining funds as directed, which is stated in the deed.  He
said that all these
requirements were attended to.  Mr Lanham said that
Goldwatch held a meeting of directors and shareholders at which it was resolved
as follows:-
<P>

Resolved that Ross Lanham be authorised to negotiate with Microy Investments
Pty Ltd for the installation of an engine for VH-FHL
upon the best terms that
he can.
<P>

Further, that it is understood that the ownership of such engine would remain
with Microy Investments Pty Ltd."
<P>

15	This resolution is said to have been passed at a meeting of shareholders of
Goldwatch at Caloundra airport on 10 March 1997.
<P>

16	It is somewhat strange that the copy of the minutes did not turn up until
1998.  Mrs Lanham explains this by saying it was in
the office of her
solicitors for other litigation.  It is true that there are no other minutes of
meetings of directors or shareholders
in the company documents apart from the
originating documents.  However, I am not able to find that the minutes were
created after
the event to support the claim here, and in the long run that was
not put.
<P>

17	While the agreement was for a payment by Goldwatch of $160 per week, in fact
payment of $366 a month was made to Mr Green and
nothing was paid to the second
defendant.  $160 per week would have been a return of 10 per cent a year on the
invested sum.  $366
per month was somewhat in excess of Mr Green's share as a
beneficial owner in part of the engine so far as income based on $160 per
week
was concerned.
<P>

18	Mr Green said that he did not realise the amount being paid was wrong.  I do
not accept that evidence.  Mr Cunneen's evidence
was to the effect that he did
not really worry.  He was prepared to leave everything to Mr Green and relied
upon him as a business
partner to see that he obtained a proper return on his
investment in due course for his company, the second defendant. To some extent
I think that supports the plaintiff's case of ownership rather than being
entitled to income from loan funds. 
<P>

19	Mrs Lanham said that it was always intended that HFM would purchase the
engine and the helicopter, that is why the resolution
was passed about the
engine, although she has agreed that Mr Cunneen wanted that done in any event.
I am uncertain about that evidence
when it is seen together with the date of
the resolution.  Mrs Lanham said that she did not note the interest of HFM in
the engine
on the insurance policy at the time but would have done that on
renewal.  She said the sum insured covered the engine in any event.
 She said
that she always expected that Mr Green would obtain finance to buy the
helicopter and that there had been some negotiations
for a licence agreement
with him to show to the bank to obtain funds.  Her evidence was clearly given
and clearly supported the plaintiff's
story.  I accept it.  It is quite
apparent that there was little chance of Goldwatch or Mr and Mrs Lanham being
able to raise the
funds to re-finance the helicopter if that was required and
to purchase the engine. 
<P>

20	HFM says it is the legal owner of the engine.  It says that it acquired it
as trustee for Mr Green and the second defendant,
who paid the purchase moneys
to ATA on the invoice which is in evidence.
<P>

21	The defendant's case is:-
<P>

1.	That the true transaction was one of mortgage.
<P>

2.	That the mortgage was not registered.
<P>

3.	That the receiver is entitled to priority under his charge in accordance
with the now Section 280(1)(c) of the Corporations Law.
<P>

23	It is necessary to look at the transaction.  On its face, payment was made
by those parties claiming the equitable interest to
ATA as then owner.  Unless
they did this on behalf of Goldwatch, that company had no interest in the
engine.  It is clear that there
was some arrangement for Goldwatch to obtain
ownership on payment of the sum of $83,000, but there is no evidence to support
any
claim of an assignment by Goldwatch to HFM, subject to an equity of
redemption.  The right to obtain possession on payment of the
$83,000 together
with a monthly payment which would equate to 10 per cent which was, on the
evidence, a low return for the use of
an engine, even taking into account the
rights of Mr Green to free use of the helicopter, does not necessarily mean
that the transaction
was one of loan.
<P>

24	At best, so far as the case of the receiver is concerned, I do not think it
could amount to any absolute assignment by ATA as
agent for Goldwatch to the
plaintiff subject to an agreement for defeasance by HFM in favour of Goldwatch.
The company minutes and
the evidence of Mr Castles is against this.  
<P>

25	Mr Castles, who really is a disinterested party in this case, made it
perfectly clear that he had no interest, and by that I
would take it to mean he
had little interest in dealing with Goldwatch.  Mr Green asked for the invoice
to be made out to Microy,
according to Mr Castles, because he said he was
financing the purchase.  That is not sufficient to show the transaction was one
of
loan, particularly as there is no document of assignment by way of loan.

<P>

26	It is perfectly understandable why the receiver had doubts about the
transaction and it is right to say that I did not find all
the evidence of Mr
Green very convincing, he was at times clearly being very careful in the way he
expressed himself.  But it was
not claimed the transaction was a sham.  What is
said is that in substance it was a security arrangement.  That was not made
out.
 I should add that the parties had been shown to be well acquainted with
security documents.  Had that been the transaction, it is
at least likely that
it would have been documented as such an arrangement.
<P>

27	It would follow from what I have said that HFM is entitled to succeed.
However, I should deal with the claim of the receiver
to possession on the
basis that he has the prior interest pursuant to section 280(1)(c) of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

28	The receiver was appointed under the charge deed.  There is no evidence of
any event of default which would bring into play the
crystallisation of the
floating charge making it a legal charge, but that is really not relevant.  I
proceed on the basis of the
claim of the receiver to a fixed charge
encompassing the interest of Goldwatch in, amongst other things, "engines and
personal property."
 I consider that what would have become subject to the
charge would have been the equity on redemption in the engine and not the
engine itself.  
<P>

29	It is clear that Goldwatch did not have the ability to purchase the engine
with its own funds.  The purchase moneys were, in
fact, provided by those
persons with whom HFM says it holds the engine in trust.  The principle which
has been set out in various
cases which establishes that a purchaser who can
only compete by borrowing money for the security of which he is bound to grant
a
mortgage to the lender immediately upon execution of the conveyance in his
favour can only, in reality, be said to have acquired
an encumbered legal
interest in the property in question, clearly applies in this case.  That
principle is generally thought to have
commenced or been laid down first in the
case of <b><cite>In re Connelly Brothers Ltd</cite></b><cite> <b>(No
2)</b></cite>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%202%20Ch%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] 2 Ch 25.</a>
<P>

30	It has been much more recently approved by the House of Lords in
<b><cite>Abbey National Building Society v Cann</cite></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%201%20AC%2056" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 1 AC 56</a> and
followed in this State in <b><cite>Sogelease Australia Pty Ltd v Boston
Australia Pty Ltd</cite> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2026%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 26 NSWLR 1.</a>  
<P>

31	On the basis that it is the equity of redemption in the engine which was
subject to the charge, if there were a charge, the case
of the receiver for
priority would fail in any event as the engine itself would not be subject to
the charge but the interest of
the chargor in it when it was acquired would be
subject to the charge.  As I have held that this is not necessary to the
decision,
it perhaps is not necessary to go further other than to say that if
it were that the plaintiff held a security interest, no action
would be
required unless HFM were shown to have done something incompatible with such
interest.  That is, however, not a matter which
arises on the pleadings in this
action.
<P>

32	The result of this is that the first plaintiff is entitled to an order for
delivery up of the engine and an inquiry before the
Master as to damages.
<P>

33	This is what I propose to do, unless anyone says otherwise:-
<P>

1	Declare that the plaintiff is the legal owner of the engine CAE 835487.
<P>

2	Order that the first defendant deliver up such engine to the first plaintiff.

<P>

	(Mr Smallbone requested that the engine be delivered to Lamington Avenue,
Eagle Farm, Queensland.
<P>

	Mr Seib opposed the application and submitted that this may require some
further instructions on the question of storage costs.)
<P>

3	The first defendant give up the engine to the first plaintiff at Caloundra
airport within seven days from this date.
<P>

4	I order that the matter be referred to a Master, Equity Division, to inquire
into the damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result
of the detention of the
engine by the first defendant and that the Master enter judgment for the amount
so found.  
<P>

5	I order that the first defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of these
proceeding up to and including the taking out of this order,
excluding costs
covered by any previous order.
<P>

6.	I order the Master to determine the question of costs of the inquiry before
him.
<P>

34	Has anyone anything to say about the form of these orders?
<P>

35	SMALLBONE:  No, your Honour.
<P>

36	SEIB:   The only matter subject to uncertainty at the moment, your Honour
referred in your reasons to the receiver's not unreasonable
position of not
knowing why ownership was asserted.  
<P>

37	In Order 3 there is, I think, implicit in that order a finding that we
wrongfully detained the engine.   I raise it because it
seems to me that there
may be potential scope for debate before the Master which possibly ought to be
cleared up here as to whether
or not, in fact, from 30 July the engine has been
wrongfully detained in light of the information before the Court.
<P>

38	HIS HONOUR:  I think it has been.  You can understand why a person has
doubts, but if he does not have the rights to it he does
not have the rights to
it.  I do not mind cutting that out.  It was intended to show it was not an
abuse, if you like, of the receiver
doing what he has done, but once you lose,
you lose.
<P>

39	SEIB:  I wouldn't seek to remove those passages.
<P>

40	HIS HONOUR:  They are entitled to damages for wrongful detention which means
he should not have it.  The exhibits can be returned
to the parties tendering
them, to be retained by the solicitors and returned to Court if necessary for
the Master's inquiry.
<P>

41	Mr Smallbone, the plaintiff should realise that it is the plaintiff's task
to take out those orders and to take out a motion
before the Master for
directions to proceed on the inquiry.  I hope that that won't be necessary.  If
it is, then it is your task,
for nothing will happen until you do it.
