<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES </b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY, 19 FEBRUARY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>R400006/96   -   ROBIN WARREN BASS  v  </b>
<P>

<b>BUILDING WORKERS' INDUSTRIAL UNION OF AUSTRALIA - NSW BRANCH &amp; 3
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Separate determination on the issues of </b>
<P>

<b> liability and quantum)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 17 December 1998 the plaintiff
seeks a separate determination on the issues of liability and quantum.
 The
defendants oppose this application.  The plaintiff relied on the affidavit of
Michael Solari sworn 16 December 1998 and the
first, second and third
defendants relied on the affidavit of Lachlan Riches sworn 15 February 1999.
<P>

2	I have set out the brief alleged facts in my earlier judgment dated 21
September 1998.  They are that the plaintiff was the principal
of R W Bass Pty
Limited.  The first and second defendants were industrial organisations of
employees and Mr Higgins the third defendant
was an officer of the Building
Workers' Industrial Union of Australia, New South Wales branch (the first
defendant).  Mr Zeltner
the fourth defendant was an officer of the
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (the second defendant).  R W
Bass (the
company) agreed to perform building work on the building site known
as "the Chevron site" situated in Macleay Street Kings Cross
in Sydney.  For
the performance of work and supply of materials, CC (NSW) Pty Limited agreed to
pay the company a lump sum of approximately
1.4 million dollars.  This
agreement was executed on 16 November 1988.
<P>

3	The plaintiff alleges that on 18 January 1990, at the direction of an
officer, servant or agent of either the first or second
defendants or both,
employees of the company engaged on the building site, refused in breach of
their contracts, to carry out all
the duties at the lawful direction of the
company and continued to refuse to do so until about 14 February 1990.  On 14
February
1990 R W Bass Pty Limited was given notice that the contract was
terminated by reason of non-performance of the company.
<P>

4	The plaintiff pleads in his further amended statement of claim that in
contravention of s 45D of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> 1974, the defendants
wrongfully and maliciously conspired, and combined amongst themselves to injure
the company and attempted to
intimidate the plaintiff.  It is also pleaded that
the defendants interfered with the contract.  It pleads that the defendants
wrongfully
and maliciously induced and procured employees not to carry out the
lawful duties for the company and for CC (NSW) Pty Limited. 

<P>

5	In relation to damages the plaintiff pleads that the actions of the
defendants greatly injured his trade and therefore forced
him to suffer loss
and damage.  The particulars of loss and damage are given as loss of 
<P>

customers, loss of good will, loss of opportunity, mental distress, loss of
business opportunity and loss of future business opportunity.
 The plaintiff
claims both damages and aggravated damages.
<P>

6	The plaintiff submitted that a separate trial on liability should be granted
because firstly the issues relating to liability,
although complex questions of
law, are clearly distinct from issues relating to quantum;  secondly that if
the hearing was to proceed
on the issue of liability only it would take 4 to 5
days and the issue of quantum would take another 2 to 3 days in hearing;
thirdly
that to prepare the case on the issue of quantum would incur
substantial additional costs such as those incurred in discovery, inspection,
subpoenaing documents, the preparation of reports by an accountant and medical
reports;  and finally if the plaintiff is unsuccessful
on the issue of
liability there would not need to be a trial on quantum.  
<P>

7	The first, second and third defendants oppose the application and submitted
that firstly the plaintiff has been the cause of the
delay over the last 8
years and is now seeking to gain a procedural advantage;  secondly that the
case has not been pleaded properly
and it is premature for such an order to be
made and thirdly they have not been served with any documents such as medical
reports.
 
<P>

8	The fourth defendant submitted firstly that in a cause of action under s 45A
damages are an essential element, and secondly that
the matter involves a
complex industrial tort which has far reaching effects in industrial law,
thirdly that by separating the liability
and quantum, the potential for two
hearings and two appeals is raised and fourthly if the matters do go to appeal
the delay would
be longer than if both liability and quantum were heard
together.
<P>

9	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> r 2(a) of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> provides:
<P>

	<b>"2.	The Court may make orders for -</b>
<P>

<b>	 (a)	the decision of any question separately from any 	other question,
whether before, at or after any 	trial or further trial in
the
proceedings."</b>
<P>

10	The plaintiff referred me to a decision of Nyland J in <b><u>Treloar v
Foresight Pty Limited</u></b> (Supreme Court of South Australia, unreported, 28
February 1994).  The first to third defendants referred me to <b><u>Aitkenhead
v Voss</u></b> (unreported, Slicer J, Supreme Court of Tasmania, 9 September
1996) and <b><u>Coenen v Payne &amp; Anor</u></b>;  <b><u>Payne v
Coenen</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%202%20All%20ER%201109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 2 All ER 1109</a> and <b><u>Gaye (No 1) v Allan Rowlands
Holdings Pty Limited</u></b> (Kearney J, unreported, Supreme Court Northern
Territory, 11 August 1987.
<P>

11	In <b><u>Coenen</u></b>, Dr Coenen's and Mr Payne's motor vehicles collided
with each other on a road and both drivers sued each other for negligence.  Dr
Coenen then alleged that he was about to engage in lucrative remuneration as a
vet in Germany.  In those circumstances the court
thought that it was
appropriate to order separate trials on liability and quantum.  The court
referred to the normal practice as
being that liability and damages should be
tried together.  However, it was stated that the court should be ready to order
separate
trials where ever it is just and convenient to do so.  (This test
appears in Part 26 r 1 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> relating to
directions)
<P>

12	The later Australian decisions cited above refer to the courts being more
willing to order separate trials in accordance with
current case management
principles.  In this regard see para 29.1 in Part 8 of Practice Note 88.  Para
29.2(c) refers to one of the
objectives of a status conference is to consider
whether there should be a separate trial on liability held before the trial of
issues
as to quantum and if it appears to the judicial officer who conducts the
status conference, that the case is suitable for such a
separate trial the
parties would be invited to consent to such an order and if consent is not
given the party may apply to a judge
or master for an order.
<P>

13	In <b><u>CBS Productions v O'Neill</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 601</a> at 606 Kirby P
referred to separate determination of liability and stated:  
<P>

	<b>"Care must also be taken in utilising the procedures now available for the
determination of preliminary points to avoid such determination
in cases which
are not ripe for this treatment.  A matter is "ripe" for separate and
preliminary determination where it is a central
issue in contention between the
parties, the resolution of which will either obviate the necessity of
litigation altogether or substantially
narrow the field of controversy."</b>
<P>

<b>	.....</b>
<P>

<b>	"It is my view that the court should be facultative in the matter of
separate decisions on questions arising in the course of the
trial.  The rules
now provide for it.  Where the exceptional circumstances exist that make it
sensible to do so (and no reason exists
to suggest the contrary) the procedure
can be beneficial.  It can contribute not only to the prompt disposal of
crucial issues in
the litigation (sometimes resulting in disposal of the whole
action and even judgment for a party).  It can also contribute to the
saving of
time and costs where an authoritative decision narrows the issues for trial
substantially, excluding the necessity to explore
factual matters which, on one
determination of the preliminary question, are entirely unnecessary."</b>
<P>

14	Kirby P also says that the resolution of a central issue may assist the
parties involved in the litigation to reach a settlement.
<P>

15	In this case the parties and witnesses will be asked to give evidence of
conversations which took place in January and February
1990, ie., over 8 years
ago.  In <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996)
186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a> at 8 McHugh J refers to the whole quality of justice
deteriorating where there is delay.  McHugh J stated that sometimes the
deterioration
in quality is palpable and in the case where a crucial witness is
dead or an important document has been destroyed.  But sometimes,
perhaps more
often than we realise the deterioration in the quality is not recognisable even
by the parties.  This is one reason
why there should be no further delay in the
matter being made ready and listed for trial.
<P>

16	In relation to written documents the situation is somewhat better.  Holland
J conducted a special inquiry in relation to the
events that give rise to the
statement of claim.  These documents form part of the documents tendered to the
Royal Commission into
Productivity of the Building Industry in New South Wales.

<P>

17	This matter is currently listed for trial in Wagga Wagga and the plaintiff
wishes it to remain there..  Although the plaintiff
estimates that it will take
4 to 5 days on liability and three days on quantum, it is my view that this
substantially underestimates
the time that this case will actually take.  It is
my view that this case will be categorised as a long matter and will take 2
weeks
plus.  In these circumstances it is either appropriate that the matter be
transferred to Sydney and listed as a long matter, or it
be listed as a special
fixture in Wagga Wagga.  
<P>

18	On one hand it is possible that liability may be determined in favour of the
defendants and in those circumstances both parties
would be saved the expense
of preparing for a trial on quantum.  Likewise, if a determination is made in
favour of the plaintiff,
the parties may agree on quantum but to do so some
medical and accounting reports would be required.  In relation to the gathering
of reports on quantum the plaintiff should have already obtained some medical
reports relating to the plaintiff's medical condition
since 1990.
<P>

19	On the other hand this matter is unusual.  It cannot be considered a typical
personal injury matter.  It appears to be an essential
ingredient to establish
a cause of action pursuant s 45D of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> that the
conduct of the defendants was likely to have the effect of causing substantial
loss and damage to the business of the plaintiff.
 However an essential
ingredient of the tort of negligence is damage yet in those types of actions
liability and quantum are severed.
 There are additional causes of action
pleaded in this case namely intimidation and conspiracy.  The plaintiff has
claimed aggravated
damages.  He is seeking compensation because the alleged
wrongful act was aggravated by the manner in which the act was done.  In
these
circumstances, liability and damages should not be severed as the some of the
acts done may be directly relevant to the amount
awarded ( if any ) for
aggravated damages.  There would be a longer delay in finalising this matter if
two trials which are both
considered long matters had to be listed and
determined.  There would be less delay if it was listed as the one long matter.
It is
also not clear whether the court would require the same witnesses both at
the hearing on liability and on quantum, and overlap of
some of the witnesses
cannot be discounted (bearing in mind the issue of aggravated damages).  This
case has not been sufficiently
prepared by the parties to enable them to
formulate agreed issues in dispute.  Taking all of this into account, it is my
view, on
balance, that it is not just and convenient to sever the trials in
relation to liability and quantum in this matter.  Accordingly
the plaintiff's
notice of motion should be dismissed.  
<P>

20	In relation to costs, the defendants had previously indicated that they did
not consent to a separate determination on the issue
of liability.  The
plaintiff elected to pursue this notice of motion not withstanding their
objection.  In these circumstances the
plaintiff should bear the costs of the
motion.
<P>

21	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff's notice of motion filed 17 December 1998 is 	dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
