<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>15 April 1999</b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION -- The question to be determined.</b>
<P>

1	This separate question turns on whether a composite application by the
Plaintiffs collectively, to set aside the Defendant's three
statutory demands,
is fatally deficient in failing to satisfy mandatory requirements of s459G of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. This is on the basis that, in responding to each
statutory demand in relation to a partnership debt jointly owed by three
partnership
companies -- if owed at all -- the three partnership companies
sought to set aside the statutory demand in the one composite application
doing
so by way of a single summons, rather than by way of multiple applications, one
for each alleged debtor company. If that contention
were correct, there never
has been an application as required by s459G within twenty-one days after the
demand was served.
<P>

2	It is not disputed that each partner company would be liable, jointly and
severally, in the event that the debt the subject of
the statutory demand were
payable. Likewise it is not in dispute that each of the Plaintiffs, proceeding
under the one application
by way of summons with a supporting affidavit, do so
on the same legal grounds and factual basis.
<P>

3	Accordingly, the separate questions which I have resolved should be
determined under Pt 31 of the Supreme Court Rules are as follows:
<P>

"1.	Whether the summons filed on 26 February 1999 with the three supporting
affidavits constituted an application made by each of
the Plaintiffs
individually in respect of the three statutory demands served upon them.
<P>

2.	Whether an application so made conforms to the requirements of s459G(1), (2)
and (3) of the <i>Corporations</i> <i>Law</i>.
<P>

3.	In the event that such application fails to conform to the requirements of
s459G(1), (2) and (3) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> or in the event that the
answer to question 1 is no, is nonetheless the Plaintiffs' application not
invalidated by reason of s467A
and s1322(2) of the <i>Corporations</i>
<i>Law</i> and/or is capable of being rendered not invalid by reason of an
order under s1322(4)(a) of the <i>Corporations</i> <i>Law</i> and in the latter
case should such an order be made?"
<P>

<b>SALIENT FACTS AND PRINCIPAL CONTENTIONS</b>
<P>

4	Taken from the Outline of Plaintiffs' Submissions of 20 March 1999, para 1,
the following can be taken to be common ground:
<P>

"(i)	on 11 November 1998 the Defendant entered into a contract with a
partnership known as the ARQ Sydney Partnership.
<P>

(ii)	the parties of ARQ were and are the three Plaintiffs.
<P>

(iii)	following discussions and correspondence between the Defendant and ARQ
the position emerged whereby the Defendant was asserting
that ARQ was indebted
to it in the sum of $80,000.00
<P>

(iv)	on 2 February, 1999 the Defendant executed three separate statutory
demands one directed to each Plaintiff. Each of those demands
claimed a debt of
$80,000.00 and is based on monies due pursuant to the 11 November contract.
<P>

(v)	the three demands were served on the Plaintiffs on either 8, 9 or 11
February 1999.
<P>

(vi)	the $80,000.00 claimed was clearly a partnership debt of the ARQ
Partnership and as such a debt for which each of the partners
would be jointly
and severally liable.
<P>

(vii)	prior to the commencement of these proceedings, the solicitors for the
Plaintiffs wrote to the solicitors for the Defendant
and enquired as to whether
any point would be taken as to seeking to set aside the three statutory demands
in the one proceedings.
The solicitors for the Plaintiff responded indicating
that no such point would be taken.
<P>

(viii)	thereafter on 26 February, 1999 the summons was filed on behalf of each
of the Plaintiffs seeking orders to set aside the
three statutory demands."
<P>

5	In relation to (vii) I do not consider that the correspondence there referred
to, more particularly set out as paragraphs (d)
and (e) of the affidavit of
Wendy Jacobs of 29 March 1999, provides a sufficient basis for my declining to
deal with the point that
has now been taken by the Defendant. If the argument
be correct that there needed to be three separate applications, one for each
alleged debtor company in relation to the relevant statutory demand applicable
to that company, then the absence of three separate
applications goes to
jurisdiction. The Defendant submits that a single application by way of one
summons, fails to satisfy mandatory
requirements of s459G of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>; see <i>David Grant &amp; Co Pty Limited v Westpac
Banking Corporation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20184%20CLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 184 CLR 265.</a>
<P>

6	The Plaintiffs for their part contend that s459G applies in its absolute
stringency only as a time requirement. Second, they contend
that the composite
application to set aside by way of a single summons from the three partner
companies in relation to their joint
alleged debt does comply with the
description in s459G(1) of what must be done within time. There is either
complete compliance,
or at least compliance within that degree of latitude
allowed by s459G for the content of the application, having regard to s467A's
direction to disregard any irregularity or defect in expression, for an
application "under" Pt 5.4 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, where no substantial
injustice results, there being none such here. The position is thus analogous
to that applicable to the supporting
affidavit which is valid if it contains
what is essentially required to state the grounds for setting aside.
<P>

7	I quote s459G(1) and (2) below, for convenience: 
<P>

"<b>459G(1)  [Company may apply]</b>  A company may apply to the Court for an
order setting aside a statutory demand served on the company.
<P>

<b>459G(2)  [Time limit]</b>  An application may only be made within 21days
after the demand is so served."
<P>

<b>RESOLUTION OF SEPARATE QUESTION</b>
<P>

8	The Defendant contends that the decision of Young J in <i>Help Desk Institute
Limited v Adams</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/586.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 586</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2017%20ACLC%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 17 ACLC 18</a> is determinative of the issue and should
be followed unless the Court is convinced that it is plainly wrong:  see
<i>Marr v Australian Telecommunications Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20ALD%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 ALD 473</a> per
Hill J at 475; <i>Upperedge v Bailey</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1142.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1142</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13 ACSR 541</a> per Jenkinson J at
543; <i>Bank of Western Australian v The Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20125%20ALR%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 125 ALR 605</a> per Lindgren J at 627, and the extra-judicial comments of
Lockhart J in <i>The Doctrine of Precedent -- Today and Tomorrow</i> (1987) 3
AVR 1 at 10.
<P>

9	The Defendant submits that the decision is not plainly wrong; indeed that it
is correct and should be followed.
<P>

10	The Defendant states in its written submissions that <i>Help Desk</i>
(supra) decides that:
<P>

(a)	Section 459G(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> limits the way an
application can be made (judgment at page 20); and
<P>

(b)	Section 459G(2) on its proper construction requires only one summons
dealing with one demand (judgment at page 21).
<P>

11	It is then said that the proposition referred to in (a) above follows from
<i>David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation</i> (supra).
Essentially, the proposition that the Defendant puts is that s459G(1), in
referring to "an application for <b>an</b> order setting aside <b>a</b>
statutory demand", precludes the <i>Acts Interpretation Act</i> 1901 (NSW) and
in particular s23(b) from being called in aid in treating the singular as
including the plural. The Defendant finds
further support by reference to the
terms of s459E, s459F and s459G(2), contending that these provisions depend for
their operation
on a separate application by each company in relation to each
demand. Thus in relation to s459G(2) Young J in <i>Help Desk</i>, at 20, says:

<P>

"But the real difficulty comes from subs (2) of s459G. The legislature has made
it clear, and the High Court in <b>Grant's</b> case (supra) has underscored
this, that the section itself limits the way in which applications can be made
and the section talks
about a strict time limit `after the demand is so
served'.
<P>

If more than one demand was contemplated, one would have expected the
legislature to have said `after the demand is so served, or
if more than one
demand is served, by 21 days after the first of such demands is so served'."
<P>

12	The Defendant then submits that "if an application of the kind required by
s459G(2) has not been made in time, then <i>Grant's</i> case is authority for
the proposition that no relief can be granted in respect of that failure".
<P>

13	To this the Plaintiff responds that either Young J was plainly wrong or, if
not plainly wrong, that at any rate <i>Help Desk</i> is distinguishable from
the facts before me. The distinction sought to be relied upon by the Plaintiff
is that <i>Help Desk</i> should be understood as applying only where the debts
are separate and distinct and not where, as here, the debts in question are
the
one debt jointly owed by all three partner companies, assuming for present
purposes that such debt were not in dispute. 
<P>

14	I consider that <i>Help Desk</i> can properly be distinguished from the
facts before me, though it is necessary to do so with some care. I certainly do
not think
that Young J's conclusion in relation to the circumstances before him
was plainly wrong. There is, in addition, some force in the
contention that
the scheme of Pt 5.4 could not work as intended if, in relation to non-jointly
owed debts, each company with its
separate indebtedness were in the one
application with the one accompanying affidavit to attempt to set aside the
statutory demand
applicable to it, on varying grounds as between each company.
Grounds for setting aside each statutory demand for each alleged debtor
company
need to be separately identified, where there are non-joint debts; how could
this be done with the one composite affidavit
and one composite application?
Even if for separate and distinct debts such gymnastics could be achieved, at
least as a matter of
drafting, Pt 5.4 would fail to achieve expeditious
resolution of disputes as to such alleged debts as Parliament intended. Thus
the
Explanatory Memorandum states: "The provisions in this Part allow disputes
in relation to the existence or amount of a debt to be
dealt with quickly and
in a way that will not impede the resolution of an application for the
winding-up of a company in insolvency."
See para 665 of the Explanatory
Memorandum to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clrb1992235/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992</a> introducing, inter alia, the
changes to the statutory demand regime recommended by the Law Reform
Commission's Report No. 45 on general
insolvency ("the Harmer Report").
<P>

15	With a joint debt such as a partnership debt, these difficulties fall away
because the same grounds to set aside will apply uniformly
to each alleged
debtor company. Thus if the debt be a joint debt, the one application would
rely on precisely the same matters in
seeking to set aside the applicable
statutory demand, even though it be a separate statutory demand for each
company.
<P>

16	It should be remembered that a demand does not institute proceedings; it is
merely the means of providing presumptive evidence
of insolvency: see <i>Bartex
Fabrics Pty Ltd v Phillips Fox</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 462</a> at 466. That prompts the
question, would a single statutory demand in respect of the one joint debt owed
by a partnership comply
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clrb1992235/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> and in particular s459E? If it did, that
would lend further support to the argument that such a composite demand could
be met by
a composite application to set aside. Indeed if the demand were
broken out -- optionally -- into multiple demands, that should not
alter the
efficacy of a composite application to set aside, merely because that option
was taken.
<P>

17	Significantly, s459T, in dealing with an <i>application</i> to institute
winding-up proceedings, does expressly provide that "a single application may
be made for two or more companies to be
wound up in insolvency if they are
joint debtors, whether partners or not". That provision is assisted by the
provisions of s459T(2).
Section 459T(2) provides that a joint debtor
application may be split by the court if the court so orders, even if it
dismisses the
application insofar as it relates to other joint debtors. No such
provision would be needed in relation to a composite statutory
demand for a
joint debt, as the presumption of insolvency could hardly apply to some joint
debtors and not others.
<P>

18	Those provisions find their origin in the Harmer Report (at 160), to achieve
consistency with existing bankruptcy legislation
thus avoiding "the present
necessity in company winding-up proceedings for multiple applications". The
relevant counterpart provision
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</i> 1966</a> (Cth) is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">s46</a>
and overcomes the decisions in <i>Re Myers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%205%20ABC%20128" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 5 ABC 128</a> and <i>Re
Meiklejohn; Ex parte Barnard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20QdR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] QdR 70.</a> In the former case, Macrossan
SPJ stated that he was "not satisfied that two or more joint debtors may be
included in the one petition",
adding "there appears to be no authority which
permits the petitioning creditor to include joint debtors in the one petition".
The
decision did not deal, however, with the question of joint debtors who were
such by reason of being in partnership. It was held under
the English
bankruptcy act of 1869 that an act of bankruptcy must be a personal act of
default, and could not be committed by a firm
as such: <i>Ex parte Blain; re
Sawers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%2012%20ChD%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 12 ChD 522</a> at 529. Neither that Act nor the 1914 English Act,
however, contain a provision corresponding to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">s45</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</i>
1966</a> (Cth) which provides that: "A creditor of a partnership may present a
petition against the partnership if he is entitled to present
a petition
against any one of the members of the partnership in respect of a partnership
debt."
<P>

19	Could therefore the Defendant have proceeded with a composite statutory
demand for all the partner companies, on the basis that
their alleged debt is a
joint one? Section 459T of the <i>Corporations Law</i> may, by an <i>expressio
unius</i> argument, point to the need for a parallel <i>express</i> provision
permitting such a composite statutory demand to be utilised for a plurality of
joint debtors, whether partners or not.
Or alternatively, and as I prefer,
s459T may rather carry no implication of that sort, because the statutory
demand is but a step
towards winding up, in providing presumptive evidence of
insolvency. The demand is thus ancillary to an application to wind up, and
should likewise be capable of being effected by a composite notice of demand,
always provided the debt grounding it is a joint one.
I prefer that view,
though I do not need to resolve that question. I observe in that regard that
the related provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a>, insofar as they had to deal with a composite
statutory demand in respect of a joint debt, would be capable of operating
without
practical difficulty. If then it be the case that a composite statutory
demand were an option open to the creditor who seeks to utilise
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> in
relation to a joint debt, it should follow that an application which sought to
set aside such a composite statutory demand would
likewise comply with s459G of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. Accordingly, if the Defendant instead opts to use
a separate statutory demand for each partnership company, that should still not
prevent a composite application in response.
<P>

20	However, I consider that whatever be the position regarding the availability
of a single statutory demand, a clear enough answer
in the present case is to
be found in the words of s459G of the <i>Corporations Law</i> read in context
with the operative provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a>, in identifying what is required for an
application complying with s459G(1) and (2). Put shortly, there is nothing in
those provisions
which prevent a composite application operating as intended in
relation to a joint alleged debt, even if there be a separate statutory
demand
for each alleged joint debtor, so long as the application is expressed so it
can be read distributively, along with the accompanying
affidavit. Section 467A
directs, not merely allows, latitude for any defect or irregularity in that
expression, absent substantial
injustice, and provided the application remains
"under" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a>; that is, in complying with any mandatory time limits or methods
which have been directed with the emphasis of "may only" in s459G;
<i>David
Grant &amp; Co Pty Limited</i> at 278-9 and compare <i>Dolvelle Pty Limited v
Australian Macfarms Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20717" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 717</a> at 725-6. Indeed even
without aid of s467A, a non-technical approach to construing such an
application is appropriate; that is by
adopting parity of reasoning as applies
to the affidavit supporting the application. There the courts apply a
benevolent construction
in requiring an affidavit that contains the material
facts relied on but which may read like a pleading without setting out in
admissible
form all of the evidence which supports the argument of the

<P>

21	In the present case, a composite application has been made, in accordance
with the Supreme Court Rules, by summons. It purports
to be by all three
alleged debtor companies who, if indebted, can only be so by reason of a joint
debt incurred by them as partners.
The Plaintiffs seek to read their composite
application distributively, that is to say so as to match the relevant
Plaintiff to the
applicable statutory demand for that Plaintiff. Each Plaintiff
who so applied contends that this composite application satisfies
the
description of what a company must do to apply in accordance with s459G(1) and
thus to conform to the time period of twenty-one
days in s459G(2). Provided
there is to be found an application "under Pt 5.4" in these terms, s467A
provides that the application
must not be dismissed "merely because of a defect
or irregularity in connection with the application". This is "unless the court
is satisfied that substantial injustice has been caused that cannot otherwise
be remedied (for example, by an adjournment or an order
for costs)". Such
defect or irregularity may be found in the reference in the application (para
1) to "the creditor's Statutory Demand
for Payment of Debt served by the
defendant on the plaintiff on 2 February 1999". It is common ground that each
of the three statutory
demands was <i>executed</i> rather than served on that
day. Any defect or irregularity therefore lies in the fact that the service was
not as stated on 2 February
1999 but, so far as Taylor Lea Pty Limited and
Kehoe Pty Limited are concerned, was on 9 February 1999, while service on
Femley Pty
Limited was on 11 February 1999. Nonetheless it is readily apparent
to which statutory demand reference is made. Certainly the Defendant
could be
under no misapprehension as the correspondence earlier referred to confirms.
There could be no substantial injustice in
declining to dismiss the Plaintiffs'
composite application on that ground. Then it is said that the collective
reference to "plaintiffs",
which appears twice on page 2, somehow constitutes a
defect or irregularity. However, it is difficult to see how that even rises
to
the level of a defect or irregularity. Clearly enough the reference is to the
Plaintiffs collectively whose names appear immediately
after the first
reference. In any event this would again constitute the kind of defect or
irregularity, if it be one, where no substantial
injustice would be caused by
declining to dismiss on that ground.
<P>

22	The application by way of summons has obviously to be read in conjunction
with any affidavit in support. It is clear enough and
undisputed that the
grounds reflected in the affidavit are common to all three Plaintiffs. Each of
the Plaintiffs therefore seeks
to set aside on common grounds, the particular
demand that had been served on them in relation to the joint debt alleged.
Naturally
they would do so in that way, for the debt, if it be a debt, is a
joint debt of partners in a partnership.
<P>

23	The simple reference to "may apply" in s459G and the absence of any detailed
prescription of the form of that application, presupposes
that, provided the
application is in terms -- as this is -- for an order setting aside a statutory
demand served on the company,
it derives its formal content from the relevant
rules of court. In relation to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Pt 80A r3
provides
that such "applications" be commenced by way of summons, though Pt 4
r2A would not preclude a statement of claim. In the Federal
Court of Australia,
Order 71 r36B provides that such an application must be in accordance with Form
5 of the Federal Court forms.
This requires a document entitled "Application".
Other Supreme Courts have made their own rules in relation to such
applications.
The content requirements in this Court for such an application do
not bear on the present issue before me.
<P>

24	To sum up.  Here, where the debt in question is a joint debt, rendered such
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s9</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/" class="autolink_findacts">Partnership Act</i> 1892</a> (NSW) (as affected by s97 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a> (NSW)), I can find nothing in s459G(1) or (2)
which would preclude such a composite application being made on behalf of each
of the
joint debtors in sufficient conformity therewith, provided the
application is expressed so as to be capable of being read distributively
as
applicable to the relevant statutory demand applicable to the relevant
Plaintiff. I am satisfied that it can and should be so
read; further, that
s467A directs that any irregularity or defect in expression be ignored in
reaching that conclusion. Section 459G
does impose a strict <i>time</i>
requirement on the filing of an application. That presupposes only that there
is an application meeting the general description in
s459G(1) for s459G(1) does
not lay down any detailed mandatory description as to content. This application
does meet that general
description, allowing as regards its formal expression
similar latitude as applies to affidavits in support. The mandatory directive
in s467A can be called in aid to disregard any irregularity or defect that does
not rise to the level where the application is no
longer "under" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a>, in
circumstances where, as here, no substantial injustice results. If it be the
case that separate and distinct debts require a
separate and distinct
application such that a single application could not be utilised (see <i>Help
Desk</i>), that conclusion does not entail that a joint debt must be treated in
the same way. Section 23(b) of the <i>Acts Interpretation Act</i> 1901 (NSW),
rendered applicable by s10(1) of the <i>Corporations (NSW) Act</i> 1990 to the
<i>Corporations Law</i> applies "unless the context otherwise provides". Here
the context does not otherwise provide, as the debts, if they exist, are joint
debts. There are in the case of joint debts none of the difficulties to which I
have earlier referred in the application of various
provisions of Pt 5.4 to
separate and distinct debts.
<P>

25	I should add that I have considered the Defendant's submission that <i>Re
Pepper</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%2014%20FLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 14 FLR 282</a> involved a similar point which, in its reasoning
in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</i> 1966</a> (Cth), supports the
Defendant's contentions. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</i> 1966</a>
provides that: 
<P>

	"Subject to this section, a debtor may present to the Registrar a petition
against himself accompanied by a statement of his affairs
verified by
affidavit."
<P>

26	Gibbs J thought the prima facie rule of construction of the singular
including the plural laid down by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23(b)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/" class="autolink_findacts">Acts Interpretation Act</a></i>
was displaced by the context, saying: 
<P>

"If the word `debtor' in section 55 were construed as including the plural, the
section would enable any two or more debtors to
petition whether they were
joint debtors or not. The section so construed would permit two debtors to join
in a petition, even though
they had no joint liabilities or joint assets. This
result would be obviously inconvenient. It might be suggested that the
presentation
of a joint petition by two debtors who were not partners and had
no joint assets or liabilities could be held to be an abuse of the
procedure
provided by the section (cf. <b>In re Bond</b>). However, the application to
section 55 of the rule laid down by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(b)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/" class="autolink_findacts">Acts Interpretation
Act</a></b> will give an undesirable width to the provisions of section 55. This
provides some ground for holding that the rule does not apply.
<P>

Moreover, the provisions of s55 are applied in relation to a petition against a
partnership, so that the majority of those members
of the partnership who are
resident in Australia may present a petition (section 56), but they are not
similarly applied to the case
of joint debtors who are not partners. On the
other hand, express provision is made for the presentation of a creditor's
petition,
not only against a partnership (section 45), but also against two or
more joint debtors whether partners or not <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 46).</a> The present <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46</a>
may be explained by an intention on the part of the legislature to overrule
<b>Re Myers; ex parte Mulholland</b>, in which it had been held that a
petitioning creditor might not on one petition obtain a sequestration order
against two or more
joint debtors who are not partners. Nevertheless, a
comparison with ss45 and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">46</a> with ss55 and 56 on the other strengthens the view
that the intention of the legislature was that although a creditor's petition
may be presented against two or more debtors who are not partners, such debtors
may not present a joint petition against themselves."
<P>

27	However, it will be observed that Gibbs J was dealing with a situation where
the joint petition by two debtors was not by partners
and did not involve joint
assets or liabilities. Indeed he makes express mention of that in his judgment.
I do not consider that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i> or the reasoning based
on it, bears upon the construction of s459G of the <i>Corporations Law</i> in
the present context.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

28	The separate questions to which I have earlier made reference should be
answered as follows: 
<P>

1.	Yes
<P>

2.	Yes
<P>

3.	Not necessary to answer, though to the extent that there is any defect or
irregularity, s467A of the <i>Corporations Law</i> precludes the dismissal of
each Plaintiff's application by way of the summons on behalf of the three
Plaintiffs.
<P>

<b>COSTS</b>
<P>

29	As I presently see matters, costs in relation to the present matter before
me should follow the event and thus be awarded to
the Plaintiffs.
