<P>

	<b>SIMPSON J:</b>
<P>

1	The applicant was tried before a jury on an indictment containing three
counts, of which the second was relied upon only as alternative
to the first,
and the third was independent.
<P>

2	The first count alleged that, on or about 26 January 1995, the applicant
caused grievous bodily harm to Ram Lingam with intent
to murder him; the
second, alternative, charge alleged that he maliciously inflicted grievous
bodily harm upon Mr Lingam with intent
to cause such harm; and the third, a
charge of arson/fraud, alleged that she caused damage by fire to a house with a
view  to making
a gain dishonestly from the proceeds of an insurance policy.
The applicant was acquitted on all charges.  She now applies for a certificate
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/" class="autolink_findacts">Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967</a>. </i>
<P>

3	All charges arose out of a fire on 26 January 1995 that destroyed a house at
21 Manuka Street, Wentworthville owned by the applicant.
  Conviction on each
charge depended upon proof that the applicant was responsible for the fire.
<P>

4	Some facts alleged in the Crown case were uncontroversial.  The applicant and
her young son were present in the house at the time
of the fire which occurred
in the middle of the night of 25 January or the early hours of the following
morning.   The only other
person present in the house was Mr Lingam.   He
suffered serious burns in the fire.
<P>

5	There was never any dispute that the fire was deliberately lit.  There was
unmistakable and undisputed evidence that petrol, from
a tin ordinarily stored
in the garage of the house, had been scattered through two rooms of the house.
There was evidence also that
some of the burns suffered by Mr Lingam had been
caused by petrol applied to his body.
<P>

6	Also undisputed was the conclusion that the fire could only have been caused
by either the applicant or Mr Lingam.
<P>

7	Mr Lingam was hospitalised for some weeks.   He was interviewed on 17
February 1995 in the hospital by an investigator for the
insurance company with
which the applicant held a policy covering her against fire damage to the
property.  Mr Lingam said that he
had been asleep on the floor of the living
room when he was awakened by flames, and he gave a description of his
observations.  He
denied responsibility for lighting the fire.   He was
subsequently interviewed by police on 28 March, and this interview was
electronically
recorded.  He again denied responsibility.  On 9 October 1995 he
gave evidence at a coronial inquest into the fire.   He adhered
to his earlier
accounts.
<P>

8	The applicant was interviewed twice by police, on 27 January 1995 and 11
April 1995.   She, too, denied responsibility for the
fire.
<P>

9	On 26 February 1996 the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the applicant
that he intended to prefer the charges.
<P>

10	On 11 April 1997 Mr Lingam was again interviewed by police.   This interview
also was electronically recorded. Mr Lingam was
accompanied by his solicitor,
and it is clear that the interview took place at his instigation.   On this
occasion he told police
that he was responsible for the fire, and that he had
lit it in an attempt to commit suicide.   On 20 October 1997, in yet another
electronically recorded interview, he maintained these assertions.
<P>

11	Notwithstanding Mr Lingam's claims, the DPP proceeded with the prosecution.
The case he advanced was circumstantial, and depended
upon damaging the
credibility of Mr Lingam, his principal witness.   The DPP sought to achieve
this by cross-examining Mr Lingam,
by adducing expert evidence challenging the
description he gave of the fire, and establishing that, by reason of the
relationships
between the applicant and Mr Lingam, and events that had recently
occurred, the applicant had a motive to attempt to kill him.
<P>

12	The jury rejected the Crown case.   It is relevant, however, to note that,
while the evidence, addresses and summing-up in the
trial were completed within
a fraction over six days, the jury did not reach its verdicts until after three
and a half days of deliberation.
  The prosecution, although it faced a
formidable hurdle in relation to the evidence of its principal witness, had a
good deal of
material on which to argue that Mr Lingam's later account of
events ought not be accepted.   If his evidence were rejected, the
circumstantial
case was relatively strong.  
<P>

13	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Ss 2</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">3</a> of the Act authorise this court, where a defendant is acquitted
after a hearing on the merits, to certify that:
<P>

	"(a)	if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in
possession of evidence of all the relevant facts,
it would not have been
reasonable to institute the proceedings;  and
<P>

	(b)	that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have
contributed, to the institution or continuation of
the proceedings was
reasonable in the circumstances."
<P>

14	Such a certificate entitles its recipient to apply for the Director General
of the Attorney General's Department for payment
of costs incurred in the
proceedings <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 4(1)).</a>
<P>

15	It was common ground that the proceedings should be taken to have been
instituted on 26 February 1996, when the DPP notified
the applicant of his
intention to bring the charges.   On that date, the relevant information
actually in the possession of the DPP,
so far as Mr Lingam's anticipated
evidence was concerned, was that he denied responsibility for the fire.   That
denial, having regard
to his injuries, must then properly have been assessed as
very credible.   Given that only two people could have lit the fire, that
meant
that the Crown case looked strong at that time.   However, that is not the
test.   The test is whether, had the DPP had in
his possession knowledge of
what subsequently transpired in relation to Mr Lingam, it would not have been
reasonable for him to have
brought the proceedings.  The DPP is, in effect,
deemed to have had knowledge of Mr Lingam's subsequent recantation and
admissions,
as at the date of the notification.
<P>

16	It must be acknowledged that there was a basis on which the DPP could
properly argue that Mr Lingam's recantation should not
be accepted and that
other evidence pointed to his innocence and the applicant's guilt.   However,
in an unusual situation like this,
the DPP must realistically assess the
prospects, not only that a jury would find the applicant guilty, but that a
conviction based
on the evidence as it then stood would survive the inevitable
appeal on the ground that any conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory
(or, to
use the current correct terminology, was unreasonable, and could not be
supported having regard to the evidence, or otherwise
represented a miscarriage
of justice:   <i>Criminal Appeal Act, </i>s 6(12);  <b>Fleming  v  The Queen
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1998%20HCA%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998} HCA 68</a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20158%20ALR%20379" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 158 ALR 379</a>, at [12]);  <b>R  v
Giam </b>(unreported, NSWCCA 53 10 March 1999, per Spigelman CJ [44]).
<P>

17	The simple fact is that, had he known of Mr Lingam's subsequent position, it
would not have been reasonable for the DPP to bring
the prosecution.
<P>

18	There is a second limb that must be satisfied before a certificate can be
granted.   It must be shown that, to the extent that
any act or omission of the
accused contributed or might have contributed to the institution <u>or
continuation</u> of proceedings, that act or omission was reasonable in the
circumstances.   The sub-paragraph is intended to operate against the
issue of
the certificate in circumstances, for example, where an accused person
unreasonably withholds from the prosecution information
that would or might
influence the prosecution in relation to the institution or continuation of the
proceedings.  No relevant act
or omission is, in the present case, attributed
to the applicant.   The prosecution in fact had, since 1997, been in possession
of
Mr Lingam's statements and admissions.
<P>

19	I therefore certify, in relation to the proceedings relating to the three
offences charged against the applicant:
<P>

(a)	if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in
possession of all the relevant facts, it would not have
been reasonable to
institute the proceedings;  and
<P>

(b)	that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have
contributed, to the institution or continuation of
the proceedings, was
reasonable in the circumstances.
