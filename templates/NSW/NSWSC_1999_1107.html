<b><u>CASTLE CONSTRUCTIONS PTY. LTD. v. THE OWNERS - STRATA PLAN 53342 and 17
OTHERS</u></b>
<P>

1   	Castle Constructions Pty. Limited ("Castle") seeks an order
that the decisions and orders of 16 August 1999 of Mr. G. Cochrane
sitting as
the Strata Schemes Board be set aside and that the application of some 15
owners of strata lots that a strata managing
agent be appointed pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s162.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.162</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act 1996</a> to exercise all of the
functions of the owners corporation, chairperson, secretary, treasurer and
executive committee of Strata Scheme
No. SP53342 be dismissed.
<P>

2   	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s200.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.200</a> of the Act an appeal lies to the Supreme Court
against an order made by the Board under Chapter 5 in the same cases and in the
same
way as it would lie under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> if the order
were a determination that a Justice or Justices made, at the time the order
took effect, in the exercise of summary
jurisdiction on an information or
complaint.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s104.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 104(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> permits a defendant against whom
an order has been made to appeal on any of the following grounds
<P>

(a)	a ground that involves a question of law alone,
<P>

(b)	a ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact, but only with the
leave of the Supreme Court,
<P>

(c)	the ground that the ... order ... cannot be supported having regard to the
evidence.
<P>

3   	Castle's statement of grounds raises a large number of
complaints, some of which seem to involve alleged errors of fact.  There
is a
complaint of a denial of natural justice in the way in which Mr. Alan John
Donald was appointed as the Strata Managing Agent.
<P>

4   	At the hearing before the Strata Board on 19 and 20 April
1999, the 2nd to 16th defendants (the 15 lot owners) sought to establish
that
the management of the strata scheme was not working satisfactorily primarily
because of the dysfunctional relationship between
Castle and its associates and
the majority of other lot owners in the strata scheme.  In its detailed and
lengthy reasons the Board
found that this complaint was established and made
the appointment mentioned.
<P>

5   	The builder, developer and original owner of the strata
scheme in respect of premises at 134-145 Sailors Bay Road, Northbridge,
being a
five storey commercial and residential development with above basement parking
was Castle, whose principal is Mr. V. Lahoud.
 Over half of the lots were sold.
Castle retained the ownership of about fifteen lots which held about 40% of the
unit entitlement.
 The Board found that with the help of a few other lot owners
who supported Castle, it and Mr. Lahoud were able to retain control
of the
affairs of the owners corporation.
<P>

6   	The Board made a series of rather strong adverse findings
against Castle and Mr. Lahoud including a wrongful expropriation
of some common
property.  Mr. Lahoud was not regarded as a witness of truth in important
respects.  Some of his explanations for
what appeared to be dubious or wrongful
conduct were not accepted.  The Board did not regard Mr. Hunt, Castle's leading
opponent
as without fault and wholly reliable but it held that he was more
reliable than Mr. Lahoud.  It noted that Mr. Lahoud was anxious
to control the
affairs of the owners corporation.  The Board's findings were that he acted
accordingly and wrongfully.  Castle and
Mr. Lahoud were in a difficult
position.  There were complaints about defective work involving the common
property and about Castle
and Mr. Lahoud advancing their own interests rather
than the interests of the owners corporation as a whole.
<P>

7   	According to the documents issued by the Board on 16 August
1999 incorporating its orders and reasons the applicants were some
15 named
persons (being lot owners) and the respondent was The Owners, Strata Plan No.
53342.  At the start of the hearing on 19
April 1999, counsel (Mr. Harper)
announced that he appeared for Castle.  A study of the transcript reveals a
contest between the
15 applicants and Castle with the applicant relying on the
evidence of Mr. Hunt and documentary materials and Castle relying on the
evidence of Mr. Lahoud and documentary materials.  Various witness statements
were tendered.  The owners corporation appeared to
take no part, and certainly
no active part in the proceedings before the Board.
<P>

8   	In this Court the appellant is Castle.  The owners
corporation has filed an appearance and it has sought to uphold the Orders
made
by the Board.  The owners corporation is the 1st defendant, the fifteen lot
owners being the 2nd to 16th defendants have filed
an appearance stating "For
so long as the First Defendant opposes the appeal [they] appear and submit to
such orders as the Court
may make, save as to costs."  Both the 17th defendant
(Mr. Donald) and the 18th defendant [the Board] have filed submitting
appearances
(save as to costs).  The same solicitor entered appearances for the
owners corporation and the 15 lot owners.  The 17th and 18th
defendants were
separately represented.  Mr. Donald, who exercises the powers of the owners
corporation instructed Mr. Le Page, to
enter the appearance (which was in
effecting a disputing appearance) on its behalf.  Mr. Le Page acted for the 2nd
to 16th defendants
before the Board and in this Court.
<P>

9   	Castle has challenged the right of Mr. Le Page to act for
both the owners corporation and the 15 lot owners.  It has submitted
that Mr.
Le Page should not act for the owners corporation.  There is the further
question of a stay of execution of the Board's
orders.  I will deal with the
latter point first.
<P>

10   	Castle submitted that by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s200.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.200</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata
Schemes Management Act 1996</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.107</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> there was an
automatic stay of execution pending the determination of the appeal.
Alternatively, Castle contended that a stay of
execution should be granted by
this Court.  The owners corporation submitted that there was no automatic stay
and alternatively,
if there were, it should be discharged.  In support of its
contentions Castle relied on an alleged denial of natural justice.
<P>

11   	At the end of the hearing on 20 April 1999 Castle
contended that if, contrary to its submissions, the Board concluded that
a
strata managing agent should be appointed, Mr. Donald should not be so
appointed as Castle had substantial objections to him. 
Castle stated that it
could not live with him and that it would wish to call evidence on that point.
After some further discussion
the Board member stated that if the Board though
that a strata managing agent should be appointed the parties would be written
to.
 In response the parties were "to nominate nominees for appointment".
<P>

12   	By and under cover of letters of Castle's solicitors of 31
May 1999, 16 July 1999 and 21 July 1999 the solicitors made complaints
about
Mr. Donald's administration of the strata scheme.  Objection was taken by the
solicitor for the 15 lot owners on the basis
that the evidence had closed.
<P>

13   	By Amended Notice of Hearing of 27 July 1999 the Board
advised that it would give its decision on 16 August 1999 and that
at the time
of the decision being delivered so much of that material which was admissible
and/or relevant may be addressed.  The
Board directed that a copy of the
material be sent to Mr. Donald and advised that the Board anticipated that Mr.
Donald would attend
before it on 30 July 1999.
<P>

14   	On 16 August 1999 the Board member delivered his reasons
orally.  The Board member concluded that it was the "crossover of
interests in
which Castle is involved that is the primary cause of the problem".  Castle had
been the builder and developer as well
as the holder of 40% of the unit
entitlements.  The repair of defective work in the common property areas was a
major bone of contention.
 Castle also attempted to appropriate some of the
common property.  The Board found, in effect, that Castle had the owners
corporation
do its bidding.  The Board member stated that he did not accept
that the appointment of an agent with full powers was punitive, that
he was
providing the scheme with 12 months time out to settle down and that during
that time Mr. Donald was to do all he could to
ensure that the owners
corporation was ready and able to resume its duties and functions at the
expiration of the appointment.  The
Board member said:
<P>

<i>"The orders are:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Orders 3 to 5 inclusive made on 30 November are revoked.  That revocation
takes effect on 16 August.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Mr. Alan John Donald of Strata Partners, being a managing agent licensed,
is hereby appointed for a period of 12 months commencing
on 16 August.  Mr.
Donald is to have and may exercise all the functions of the Owners Corporation,
chairperson, secretary, treasurer
and executive committee and is to be
remunerated in accordance with the management fee of $5,00 per annum.  This fee
covers three
meetings.  Additional meetings are $85 per hour plus disbursements
as set out in the order.</i>
<P>

<i>That is the end of that.  Anything flowing from that?"</i>
<P>

The formal orders in writing notified on 30 August 1999 were to the same effect
but set out a little differently.
<P>

15   	Counsel for Castle then said:
<P>

<i>"The note that we received about listing this for hearing also says that at
the time of the decision being delivered so much of the
material that had been
received which is admissible or relevant may be addressed by the parties.  We
wish to make some submissions
about the appropriateness of Donald continuing in
the event, if the Board were disposed to make an order under section
162."</i>
<P>

Counsel for Castle raised the further point that the application had not been
referred to mediation and for that reason should be
dismissed.  This submission
was rejected.
<P>

16   	Counsel for Castle stated that it had no confidence in Mr.
Donald and that that factor alone made it appropriate to appoint
someone else.
Castle submitted  that Mr. Donald had a very unsatisfactory track record.  In
response to counsel's submission that
Mr. Donald had not consented in writing,
the Board member replied that Mr. Donald had given his consent on the previous
Friday and
pointed out that orders appointing a strata managing agent were
usually made by an adjudicator without a hearing.  He doubted if
an adjudicator
had power to hold an inquiry into the fitness of a nominee.  He also pointed
out that on the previous occasion (November
1998) Mr. Donald was the only
eligible agent on the panel, within a reasonable distance from the property, to
consent to act as the
strata managing agent.
<P>

17   	Counsel for Castle submitted that anyone but Mr. Donald
would be preferable, even if the person was quite unknown.  Castle
applied to
the Board to vary the order which it had just made to appoint someone else as
the strata managing agent.  Castle conceded
that it did not have any particular
nominee in mind.  Castle contended that the problem arose because the 15 lot
owners had not proposed
a nominee.  The Board member replied that there were
many applications for the appointment of a strata managing agent where the
applicants
did not propose a nominee.
<P>

18   	The 15 lot owners submitted that Mr. Donald had been doing
a perfectly satisfactory job and that there was the advantage of
familiarity
and continuity with no need to change the books and financial records to
another agent.
<P>

19   	Castle then took the Board to the letters of Castle's
solicitors of 31 May 1999 and 16 July 1999 and the complaints therein
made
against Mr. Donald.
<P>

20   	The Board member was correct when he held that he would
require some substantial material to appoint another strata managing
agent when
Mr. Donald had been acting for 8&#189; months.  It was not a sufficient reason
that Castle did not want him or that it
made allegations.  Castle and Mr.
Lahoud obviously did not appreciate losing control of the owners corporation
and part of Mr. Donald's
task may well involve denying Castle's requests or
urgings.
<P>

21   	The Board held that it was not satisfied that it had
jurisdiction to entertain Castle's request.  However, even if it did,
there was
nothing in what had been put to vary the order.  The request failed.
<P>

22   	Castle's real complaint was that the Board said at the
conclusion of the hearing on 20 April 1999 that if it thought that
a strata
managing agent should be appointed the parties would be written to and given
the opportunity to nominate proposed appointees
but that this did not happen.
Instead, the Amended Notice of Hearing of 27 July 1999 was in the terms
summarised earlier.  Castle
complained that the Board made its orders without
hearing it and that it was then forced to apply for a variation.  Castle
contended
that it was placed in a position of disadvantage.
<P>

23   	An adjudicator and the Board are not bound by the rules of
evidence and have wide investigative powers.  They also proceed
informally and
often without oral evidence.  Matters are often dealt with on the papers
without a hearing.  The system established
is designed to deal with matters
quickly and cheaply.
<P>

24   	However, when an issue is raised and the Board states that
it is going to take a particular course if it decides that a strata
managing
agent should be appointed it should follow that course.  If it changes its
mind, it should advise the parties and given
them an adequate opportunity to
deal with the issue having regard to the changes made.  It was incorrect to
make the orders first
and then hear the parties on the particular issue.  This
is particularly so where there are doubts about the jurisdiction to vary
orders
so made upon the request of the party affected.
<P>

25   	During argument I indicated that the question of the grant
and refusal of a stay would be much influenced by there having
been a breach of
the rules of natural justice and of fairness.  While the 15 lot owners did not
concede that there had been such
a breach, they acceded to the view that if the
Court took this view and was therefore going to refuse a stay or discharge any
stay
which existed it would be better for the order appointing Mr. Donald to be
set aside so that the matter of which strata managing
agent should be appointed
could be resolved quickly.
<P>

26   	Given the Board's findings it could not reasonably be
disputed that a strata managing agent should be appointed.  The only
question
is who should be appointed.  I do not preclude the appointment of Mr. Donald.
There are substantial practical reasons to
continue that appointment.
Essentially, the rules of procedural fairness must be followed.  In practical
terms Castle will have to
nominate other qualified strata managing agents who
are willing and competent and establish substantial reasons why Mr. Donald is
unsatisfactory.  These are questions of fact for the Board member.  He may well
appoint Mr. Donald.  Costs of this point are reserved.
 If Mr. Donald is
re-appointed the exercise may prove to have been a barren one.
<P>

27   	Apart from this point I would not have regarded a stay as
appropriate.  It is necessary in view of the Board's findings to
have a strata
managing agent running the affairs of the owners corporation and discharging
the other functions.
<P>

28   	I turn now to the representation point.  Can Mr. Le Page
represent the owners corporation as well as the 15 lot owners.  Castle
objects
to the 15 lot owners not having a direct personal liability for costs and the
owners corporation's liability for costs possibly
resulting in lot owners other
than the 15 lot owners sharing the costs burden.
<P>

29   	SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p66" class="autolink_findacts">Part 66</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 2</a> provides:
<P>

<i>"2.	Where a solicitor or a partner of the solicitor acts as solicitor for
any party to any proceedings ... that solicitor shall not,
without the leave of
the Court, act for any other party to the proceedings not in the same
interest."</i>
<P>

30   	Castle contended correctly that the owners corporation was
bound to act in the interests of the lot owners as a whole.  In
the present
case there was a marked division of opinion as to such interests amongst the
lot owners.  Mr. Donald's task, inter alia,
is to try to keep the various
interests in balance and to act in the interests of the owners corporation as a
whole.  Under the Board's
order Mr. Donald exercises all of the functions of
the owners corporation and it is obliged to remunerate him as specified in the
Board's orders.  The owners corporation has a direct interest in the Board's
orders and the appeal or application for leave to appeal.
 So do the 15 lot
owners who do not want Castle and Mr. Lahoud controlling the affairs of the
owners corporation having regard to
their previous conduct.
<P>

31   	Counsel for the owners corporation submitted that both the
15 lot owners and the owners corporation wished to uphold the orders
made by
the Board and that accordingly they were in the same interest.  If any dispute
arose as to costs then, at that stage, the
owners corporation and the 15 lot
owners could be separately represented.  I was referred to s.229 of the Act
which enables the court
to make special orders as to costs and levies and s.230
which provides that an owners corporation cannot in respect of its costs
and
expenses in proceedings brought under Chapter 5 levy a contribution on another
party who is successful in the proceedings.
<P>

32   	In <b><i>Nangus Pty. Ltd &amp; Anor v. Charles Donovan
Pty. Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20VR%20184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] VR 184</a> Young CJ said at 185:
<P>

<i>"The general rule undoubtedly is that counsel ought not to appear for two
clients whose interests may conflic."</i>
<P>

and at 186:
<P>

<i>"Every case must depend on its own circumstances but it is important to
notice ... that the court is concerned that it shall have
the assistance of
independent counsel for parties whose interests are not identical in the case
before it ..."</i>
<P>

33   	I was also referred to in the decision of <b><i>Oceanic
Life Ltd v. HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd</i></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/292.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 292</a>
(1 April 1999) where Austin J undertook an extensive review of the cases and an
analysis of the relevant legal principles.  That
was a commercial case of some
complexity and a very different one from the present.  It concerned amongst
other things, information
which had been gathered previously while acting for
another client.
<P>

34   	The grounds of appeal in the present case, apart from
raising what appear to be some questions of fact involve canvassing
the
question whether the 15 lot owners other than R.J. Hunt did not support the
application and were not in conflict with Castle
and the adverse findings
against Castle and Mr. Lahoud.  The 15 lot owners have their own interests to
advance.  They are not identical
with those of the owners corporation which has
to protect the interest of the lot owners as a whole.  Its focus and approach
will
necessarily be different.  While it is entitled to uphold the orders made
by the Board it must do so from the perspective of the
best interests of the
lot owners as a whole.  It is not sufficient to say that both the 15 owners and
the owners corporation want
the appeal dismissed.
<P>

35   	In the circumstances of the present cases the interests of
the 15 lot owners and those of the owners corporation are not identical.
 The
same solicitor should not act for these parties.  Mr. Le Page having previously
acted for the 15 lot owners before the Board
should not act for the owners
corporation in this Court.  This does not mean that the 2nd to 16th defendants
need change their submitting
appearance nor that the owners corporation should
cease to uphold the Board's orders.  I uphold the challenge to Mr. Le Page
continuing
to act as the solicitor for the owners corporation in this Court or
before the Board.  I reserve the question of costs.
<P>

36   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	The Order of 16 August 1999 naming Alan John Donald is quashed, such
quashing to take effect seven (7) days from today.
<P>

2.	The question of who should be the strata managing agent is referred back to
the Board for consideration and appointment in accordance
with these
reasons.
<P>

3.	All questions of costs reserved to the final hearing.
<P>

Subject to any later ruling of this Court there should be no stay of
execution.
