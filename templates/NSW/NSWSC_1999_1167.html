TUESDAY 14 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>4450/98	VICKI LYNNE HAWES &amp; ORS v CUZENO PTY LTD &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiffs are the purchasers, in four separate
but very similar contracts, of four home units in a development
of 52
residential home units with garages in Willock Avenue, Miranda, New South
Wales.  The purchasers agreed to buy the home units
from the vendors "off the
plan", before construction of the building began and, of course, before the
strata plan had been registered
or certificates of title for strata lots had
been issued.
<P>

2  	Mr Li, the fourth plaintiff, agreed to buy Unit 19 for $200,000
on 29 May 1996.  Mr and Mrs Turnell the third plaintiffs agreed
to buy Unit 44
for $207,500 on 30 May 1996.  Osboom Pty Ltd the second plaintiff as trustee
for the Cleary Family Trust agreed to
buy Unit 34 for $200,000 on 4 June 1996.
Mrs Hawes the first plaintiff agreed to buy Unit 33 for $200,000 on 11 June
1996.
<P>

3  	Exhibit B is Mr Li's contract and its provisions which bear
directly on the issues are the same in each plaintiff's contract.
 The
provision establishing the completion date is Special Condition 28 which is in
these terms:
<P>

<i>"28.	That completion of this Agreement shall take place within six (6) weeks
from the date hereof or within four (4) weeks from the
date of notification to
the Purchaser of registration of the Strata Plan (whichever be the later)
(hereinafter called the `Due Date'
and further if completion has not been
effected within that time then either party may by notice in writing to the
other to be given
at any time after that date require completion and it is
agreed that fourteen (14) days' notice shall be sufficient to require
completion
and to make time of the essence."</i>
<P>

4  	The agreement was made conditional on registration of the strata
plan by Special Condition 24 as follows:
<P>

<i>"24.	This Agreement and completion thereof is subject to and conditional
upon the registration by the Registrar General of a Strata
Plan pursuant to the
Strata Titles Act, as amended, not later than twenty-four (24) months from the
date hereof and in the event
of such registration not being effected before or
on the date then either party hereto shall have that right to rescind this
Agreement
by notice in writing to the other."</i>
<P>

5  	Special Condition 25 deals at length with the process of
registering the Strata Plan and problems which may arise out of variations.
Its provisions include:- "The Vendor will, as soon as possible, take steps to
have the plan registered by the Land Titles Office."
<P>

6  	These conditions operated with Printed Condition A6 which
contains subcll.A6.1 and A6.2:
<P>

<i>"A6	Unregistered plan</i>
<P>

<i>	If any of the property is described as  a lot in an unregistered plan
-</i>
<P>

<i>A6.1	the vendor must do everything reasonably necessary to have the plan
registered within the plan registration time, with or without
any minor
alteration to the plan or any document to be lodged with the plan validly
required or made by a statutory authority or
the Registrar-General;</i>
<P>

<i>A6.2	normally, either party can rescind if the plan is not so
registered;"</i>
<P>

7  	The definitions in Printed Clause 1 include:
<P>

<i>"rescind' rescind this contract from the beginning;"</i>
<P>

8  	The particulars on the first printed page say:- "The plan
registration time is 24 months after the date of this contract".
<P>

9  	In cl.A6.2 "normally" refers to what the vendor may do if the
vendor complies with A.6.1; the normal course is that contractual
obligations
are complied with. The right to rescind is conferred by Printed Condition A6.
The reference in Special Condition 24 to
"that right to rescind" is a
cross-reference to the right to rescind in Printed Condition A6.  If the
contract meant that the vendor
could commit a breach of cl.A.6.1 and then
rescind there would be an absurdity because there would be no remedy for breach
of A6.1.
In the plain and ordinary meaning of these provisions, the right to
rescind can only be exercised by the vendor in normal circumstances
where the
vendor has complied with cl.A6.1.
<P>

10  	If this result is not reached by the processes of construction
or implication it is reached by application of a principle of
law referred to
in <u>Suttor v. Gundowda Pty Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1950/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2081%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 81 CLR 418</a> at 441: see too
<u>Alghussein Establishment v. Eton College</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 WLR 587.</a>
<P>

11  	The same result is reached by considering whether the terms of
the contract impliedly make compliance by the vendor with Printed
Condition
A6.1 a condition of exercise of the right of rescission.  If the tests for
implication of a term referred to in <i>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State
Rail Authority (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a> at 351-352, 404 are applied this
implication should be made, as the contract would lack business efficacy if the
vendor could escape
from it by delaying.
<P>

12  	In my view Printed Clause A6 has both the character which
appears from its express terms of a promise the breach of which would
give rise
to a liability for damages and also the character of a condition for the
exercise of the vendor's right of rescission;
breach of the promise is also the
failure of the condition in which the vendor can rescind.  
<P>

13  	The plaintiffs' counsel referred me to observations of McLelland
CJ in Eq in <i>Plumor Pty Ltd v Handley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 30</a> at 34 C-E.  The
operation of Printed Clause A6 as a condition makes inapplicable to the present
case his Honour's observations which
relate to the need to show a causal
relationship.  In any event there is in this case a causal relationship.  
<P>

14  	A vendor acting recklessly may lose a right to rescind:
<i>Woodcock v. Parlby Investments Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) NSW Conv.R 55-454.</a>  In
that case there does not seem to have been any contractual provision
corresponding with Printed Clause A6 or any express contractual
condition for
rescission.  At 58,297 Young J noted ".. there is no promise by the vendor to
build a building within a certain time
in accordance with the particular
standard of construction."  When dealing with cl.8 Young J cited earlier
authorities which established,
in cases where there was no condition like
Printed Condition A6, that there are limits on the availability of the right of
rescission.
 The limits appear from passages in <i>Gardiner v. Orchard</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2010%20CLR%20772" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 10 CLR 772</a> there cited and from the judgment of Gibbs J in <i>Pierce
Bell Sales Pty Ltd v. Frazer &amp; Anor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20130%20CLR%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 130 CLR 575</a> at 590.
Disabling circumstances referred to include the necessity for bona fides, that
the cancellation must be reasonable, and that
the vendor must not be guilty of
recklessness in entering into the contract.  The plaintiffs' case does not rest
on this principle,
but on the terms of their contracts.  
<P>

15  	If the defendants' case had been fully upheld, and they had
truly needed until December 1998 to complete the building, the
defendants would
not have been able to rely on rescission, as it would have been reckless to
make a wrong estimate six months more
than the necessary time, and unreasonable
to rely on the rights apparently resulting.  The first defendant and Mr
Jabbour, with their
building and development experience, could not point to
access difficulties and delays of weather to excuse so long a period, as
they
are difficulties of kinds which are foreseeable and obvious.
<P>

16  	In the Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiffs claim: (a) a
declaration that the purported rescission of the contracts on
25 June 1998 was
invalid; (b) a declaration that it would be unconscionable for the defendants
to rely upon that rescission; (c)
an order that the defendants specifically
perform the contract; (d) a declaration that the defendants were in breach of
contract
when they did not obtain registration of the strata plan by December
1997. There are also claims for damages and other relief.  
<P>

17  	The site of the development was formerly four different house
properties in four different ownerships.  Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4
in Deposited Plan
380248 were numbers 29, 27, 25 and 23 Willock Avenue.  These together form a
rectangle between Willock Avenue and
Seymour Shaw Park, bounded on the west by
Central Road.  Sutherland Shire Council gave development consent dated 19
October 1995
for development described as "Residential flat building consisting
of 52 dwelling units (amended plan)".  The applicant was the architects'
firm
Huntington &amp; MacGillivray which made the application with the authority of
the then owners of the four houses.  In his evidence
Mr George Jabbour, the
principal of the first defendant, says that the development application was
lodged by Shalala Developments
Pty Ltd in July 1995; and he also said in
evidence that Shalala Developments abandoned the development or "walked away
from it".
 Shalala Pty Ltd must have had some arrangement with the owners of
the properties when the development application was made, but
there is no
evidence establishing what it was, and as far as I can understand his evidence,
Mr Jabbour and his company had no contractual
arrangement with Shalala
Developments Pty Ltd.  He did not obtain the copyright in the architectural
plans and the copyright still
belonged to Mr MacGillivray.
<P>

18  	Mr Jabbour interested himself and his company in the development
in March 1996 when the defendants as purchasers made an agreement
with Mr and
Mrs O'Riordan who then owned 25 Willock Avenue to buy their property for
$530,000.  Under the terms of the contract (Exhibit
2) the completion date was
9 calendar months from contract but could be earlier, and the vendors were not
obliged to vacate before
15 January 1997.  On 27 March 1996 (Exhibit 3) the
defendants agreed with Mr Jones to buy 27 Willock Avenue for $535,000 and the
date for settlement was 9 months from contract.  These two contracts were
interdependent.
<P>

19  	On 10 April 1996 (Exhibit 1) the defendants agreed with Mr Baker
to buy 23 Willock Avenue for $510,000, settlement to take
place on 9 May 1996
with time of the essence; and settlement did take place on that day.  On 23 May
1996 the defendants obtained
an option (Exhibit 5) from Mr Hill to purchase 29
Willock Avenue; the option was to be exercised between 31 October 1996 and 23
December
1996 and was in fact exercised on 23 December 1996. (Exhibit 4).
<P>

20  	The defendants completed the purchase on No. 27 Willock Avenue
on 23 December 1986, No. 25 Willock Avenue on 23 January 1997
and No. 29
Willock Avenue on 3 February 1997.
<P>

21  	It will be seen that when the defendants agreed to sell home
units to the plaintiffs the defendants owned one of the four properties,
had
interdependent contracts to buy the other two with completion postponed until
December 1996 and January 1997, and had an unexercised
option to buy the
fourth; and did not exercise that until December.
<P>

22  	The defendants commissioned Mr MacGillivray the architect to
prepare the Building Application before they entered into contracts
with the
plaintiffs.  Mr McGillivray says this was in May: Mr Jabbour says it was about
March, but relates it to the Baker purchase
which was in April.  Neither
supports the time with any record or note.  Probably all of May was available
for Mr McGillivray to
work on the Building Application.  Mr MacGillivray had
prepared the development application and had been the applicant, so he was
well
familiar with the project, and with the conditions of the Development Consent,
which meant that  there had to be some redrafting
of plans which had been
submitted with the Development Application.  He had also worked for Cuzeno Pty
Ltd in many projects over
about 15 years.  He prepared the Building Application
and it was lodged on 13 December 1996.
<P>

23  	There were some complexities about preparing the Building
Application as the terms of the development application required
departures in
some significant respects from the architect's plans which had accompanied the
development application.  Mr MacGillivray
said in evidence that he was
instructed to seek building approval in May 1996, that he then commenced
preparation of the plans and
that the work was delayed for a couple of months
because of pressure of other work.  Re-drawn plans were substantially different
from the original plans and he says "the changes to the plan included a
splitting of the whole block down the middle making it split
level and
consequently a redrawing of all the stairs in the development." 
<P>

24  	The plaintiffs called the evidence of Mr Wood, who is a valuer
by profession but has experience as a developer, not in the
Sutherland Shire
and not with developments as large as 52 home units, but with significant
experience in managing developments extending
over a number of years.  It was
his evidence that in his experience a Building Application for a block of home
units like this one
can be prepared in four weeks by vendors who are keen to
obtain a building approval as soon as possible and who use their best
endeavours
to do so.
<P>

25  	I accept Mr Wood's evidence as establishing the scale of time
which is usually required for preparing a building approval;
his time scale of
four weeks is, in my finding, much closer to business realities and the
practicalities of  conducting development
business than the period of over
seven months which elapsed from May 1996 until the development and the
application of building approval
was actually lodged on 13 December 1996.
There were complexities arising from Council's requirements and the need to
redesign the
levels and stairs and otherwise adapt the existing Council plans,
and as Mr Wood was not involved in that work I give greater weight
to Mr
McGillivray's assessment of the practicalities and the time required.  Even
doing so, the difficulties spoken of by Mr MacGillivray
and Mr Jabbour in their
affidavits and also in their oral evidence do not reasonably explain the time
which was taken and the delay.
<P>

26  	Important elements in the context of facts in which this must be
appraised are that Mr MacGillivray was familiar with the project
and had
prepared the development application, and was also used to working with Mr
Jabbour after many years of experience, and that
the terms of Council's
approval had become known in October 1995, so the difficulties raised cannot
have been new to Mr MacGillivray
when he was commissioned in May 1996, and they
were difficulties of a kind with which he was professionally equipped to deal.
It
is clear even on Mr MacGillivray's own concession that he delayed work on
this project for a couple of months because of the pressure
of other work in
his office.   As I understand his evidence attending to other commissions also
contributed to delay after that.

<P>

27  	Although there were complexities in preparing the plans for the
building application, all the complexities were established
by conditions of
the development consent which had been given  in October 1995 after
consideration since the previous July, and all
the complexities were known to
Mr MacGillivray, and should have been known to the defendants, long before
contracts were exchanged
with the plaintiffs.  No detailed explanation was
given in evidence of how the time from commissioning Mr MacGillivray to 13
December
1996 was used and it is plain that there were delays of some months
and the progress was impeded by Mr MacGillivray giving his attention
to other
work, while Mr Jabbour left Mr Macgillivray to take his own course.  
<P>

28  	It is important for appraising the events that the defendants
were under a very strongly worded contractual obligation in Printed
Clause A6.1
- "The Vendor must do everything reasonably necessary to have the plan
registered within the plan registration time".
 Doing everything reasonably
necessary included preparing the Building Application, and doing it within a
time scale within which
the plan registration time could be complied with;
preparing the Building Application was necessary to achieve this outcome and it
was a contractual obligation of the vendors to do it.  Their contractual
obligation was not to commission some suitable person to
do it; it was a direct
obligation to do it and I do not regard it as open to them to point to pressure
of other work in their architect's
office, as the words used in Printed Clause
A6 do not admit of any concession for inattention or attending to other
business.  
<P>

29  	When testing contractual compliance it is not relevant whether
the defendants' relationship with their architect was an independent
contractor
relationship: their contractual obligations are the same irrespective of whose
agency they act through. There is a test
of reasonableness, but it does not
relate to the time at which things are done; it relates to identifying which
things have to be
done; making a Building Application obviously is one of them,
and the vendors had an unqualified contractual obligation to do every
such
thing so as to have the plan registered within the plan registration time.
Young J's observations in <i>Woodcock v. Parlby Investments</i> about the
architect as an independent contractor relate to the operation of the
recklessness principle and were not directed to a
clause such as cl.A6.
<P>

30  	Mr McGillivray in cross-examination gave 12 to 16 weeks as a
reasonable time to prepare the building application: on a whole
view of his
evidence he acknowledged that more time than was necessary was taken from May
to December.  My finding is that the building
application should have been
completed by the end of August: this finding is largely influenced by Mr
McGillivray's evidence in cross-examination.
 About four weeks had passed since
he was commissioned about the beginning of May when the defendants came under
their contractual
obligation to Mr Li on 29 May.  Over thirteen more weeks
passed before the end of August and although the nature of the subject does
not
allow precision I find that that was reasonably sufficient.
<P>

31  	By August 1996 the defendants were already in breach of the time
provisions of their contracts and this disabled them from
exercising their
right of rescission. However I am of the view that there were further breaches.
When the Building Application was
lodged on 13 December 1996 communications
between the defendants and their architect and the Shire Council took place and
the application
was granted on 5 May 1997, that is after about 4 months and
three weeks, or 20 weeks and 3 days.  This was influenced, probably only
slightly by a lowering in the pace of work in the Shire office associated with
Christmas and New Year.  
<P>

32  	Mr Wood gave in evidence the view that a Building Application
prepared in a competent and comprehensive manner where the applicant
responds
promptly to any queries made by the Council after lodgment should be approved
within four months of lodgment even where
as in this case the Christmas period
intervened.  He refers to the fact that Council's Building Application file
shows a very significant
number of queries.  He also gave in evidence the dates
of significant events in the communications between the defendants and their
architect and Council officers. 
<P>

33  	I am not satisfied however that there was any breach with
respect to the length of time which it took to obtain Building Approval.
However that time should have started by the end of August.  If it had,
approval would have been available in January 1997.    
<P>

34  	It was contended that there was a breach with respect to the
period of about one month which intervened between the building
permit on 5 May
1997 and the commencement of work in June 1997.  I do not regard this interval
as showing any breach having regard
to the practical problems of assembling
contractors and initiating work.  My view then is that if the Building
Application had been
prepared and lodged and the application had been conducted
in conformity with cl.A6.1 the building work would and should have started
about 20 February 1997.  
<P>

35  	To my mind it is significant that in March and April 1996 the
defendants made their contractual arrangements with their vendors
on a basis
which would bring them possession of the property in December or January 1997;
and these arrangements were actually completed
by early February 1997.  These
arrangements are an indication of what the defendants then expected would
happen and when they would
need possession.  Some emphasis is given to this by
the defendants' having leased out No. 23 Willock Avenue for six months from May
1996.  The fact that possession was not available until completion in January
and February 1997 had no delaying effect on the outcome.
<P>

36  	On a reasonable basis then the defendants had the rest of 1997
and the first five months of the year 1998 to complete construction,
obtain
Council's certificates on completion, complete the strata plan, obtain
Council's certificate on it and register it.  From
20 February 1997 to 29 May
1998 was 465 days or 66 weeks and 3 days.  In fact the work was begun in June
1997 and completed by 23
December 1998, and the plan was registered in February
1999.  The time required from practical completion for certificates and
registration
of the Strata Plan is two months, so effectively 58 weeks were
available for building work.
<P>

37  	Mr Jabbour gave practically no detail of difficulties
encountered in construction, whether related to weather or otherwise.
 He did
not give any evidence until his affidavit was lodged at a very late stage, long
after the time limit fixed by the court's
direction.  This is surprising, as he
is a very experienced builder and was in charge of the operation, and he is
plainly in a good
position to give evidence in detail of any difficulties which
were encountered, and to show in detail the progress of the job and
the actual
influence of weather and of any other causes of delays.  The means of proof of
practical difficulties in the course of
construction are in the defendants'
hands and not in the plaintiffs'.  Mr Jabbour spoke in general terms of
difficulties of access,
but his evidence did not satisfy me that access to the
site created any real difficulty out of the ordinary in building construction.
There were complications arising from competing use of the roads and other
competing activities.  The narrowness of Willock Avenue
was a factor.  The
Development Consent required the developer to widen Willock Avenue by 2.5m.
Conditions of the Building Approval
allowed access at 2 points at the west on
Central Road and disallowed one another access point on Willock Avenue.  In my
finding
access was reasonably adequate, although it was subject to difficulties
which are common and encountered in many building sites;
a large home unit
building is likely to be built in a place where there is much other activity.
Mr Jabbour was also in a position
to give evidence of time lost through rain
and of the circumstances in which there were delays associated with the
Christmas close-down
at the end of 1997.  In fact he gave no significant
evidence carrying these matters to detail and it proved difficult when he was
cross-examined to elicit any matter of detail from him.  My view is that I
should understand that the defendants gave the best evidence
that they were
able to muster explaining any causes of delay which they encountered.  The
evidence they did produce was very unimpressive
because of its lack of
detail.
<P>

38  	It is very difficult to discern what effect rain had; the
information available to the plaintiffs given by Mr Wood and based
on
meteorological statistics, and these do not really indicate whether work was
impeded, because the impact of rain varies with the
time at which rain falls
and also with the stage at which the work is; at some stages, work can proceed
under protection.
<P>

39  	Mr Jabbour obtained finance approval from the Arab Bank dated 17
April 1997 to assist in the construction.  In support of the
application Mr
Jabbour relied on the pre-sales, including those to the plaintiffs: the bank in
turn relied on them.  The pre-sales
gave assurance to Mr Jabbour in assessing
his own position, so he must then have expected that he could enforce them and
that the
buyers would not become able to rescind them.  In connection with the
application to the bank Mr Jabbour supplied some calculations
(Exhibit C) on
the feasibility and expected profit which are difficult to follow but which
appear to allow for a period of one year
until sales can commence.  A one year
period implies 10 months for construction and 2 months for registration. If
this is what his
notes mean, they are consistent with an estimate of 10 months
for construction.  Mr Jabbour would not accept that this was so, but
to my
reading the notes probably have that meaning.  A pre-construction Quantity
Surveyor's Report was obtained by the bank in May
1997 which said "We expect
the project to be completed in 10 months from the commencement of the
excavation, subject to good management
practice and average weather conditions
prevailing."  The Report also said "We believe Mr Jabbour have the ability to
complete this
project within time and budget constraints".
<P>

40  	Mr Jabbour's evidence was to the effect that when he undertook
the project he believed that the Building Application could
be prepared and
approved within about 9 months. When this is applied to my finding that Mr
MacGillivray was commissioned by the beginning
of May, this means approval was
expected by the end of January 1997. In evidence Mr Jabbour said to the effect
that when the project
began he expected completion within 24 months, although
it was very difficult to establish any detail underlying this expectation.
 He
gave me the impression of evading detail.  It should be understood from Mr
Jabbour's treatment of the application for finance
that he expected the
building work to take 10 months.  As things turned out the building work and
registration took over 20 months.
 However on what he must be understood to
have expected, it was quite feasible to complete the building process and
register the
plan well within the contractual period of two years.  The
defendants are under the difficulty that if they show there was a serious
miscalculation by Mr Jabbour they might encounter the other legal principle
under which they are disabled from relying on the time
commitment if they gave
the commitment recklessly.
<P>

41  	Plainly the defendants expected to be able to complete within 24
months; Mr Jabbour's evidence shows that this is so, and they
undertook a
contractual commitment to do so.  They incurred a forensic or evidential burden
of explaining why the process took much
longer, and they have not discharged
this burden.  In the circumstances I feel entitled to be bold in drawing
inferences on the relatively
limited material which the plaintiffs were able to
bring forward.  The onus of proof remains on the plaintiffs throughout.
<P>

42  	The defendants had apparent motivation to escape from their
contracts with the plaintiffs, as the market was rising throughout
the whole
period. Mr Jabbour acknowledged in his evidence that he knew that the market
was rising.  I do not suppose that the time
taken to complete construction is
wholly explained by an endeavour to manoeuvre into a position where an apparent
right of rescission
could be relied on, but it is significant in understanding
the defendants' conduct, and also in understanding Mr Jabbour's evidence
and
the case he presented, to see that the defendants had strong economic
motivations moving them against proceeding with expedition,
and these probably
weighed in their behaviour against any perceived need for compliance with their
contractual obligations.  The
defendants' communications with the Arab bank
relating to finance clearly showed awareness of the market movement.  
<P>

43  	The defendants called the evidence of Mr Anthony Brown, a
Quantity Surveyor with much experience.  Mr Brown was not involved
in the
project but inspected it once on 22 October 1999 and saw the plans and
consents.  He pointed to access difficulties, and to
difficulties relating to
the site arising from the large extent of detailed steel work and other
complexities of steel work, to there
being a number of different home unit
layouts and to the need for shoring, which requires time, and the general size
and complexity
of the building.  He gave the opinion that there would be
approximately 54 days between May 1997 and October 1998 during which building
works could not have taken place because of wet weather.  However this opinion
was not carried to any detail related to amount or
time of rainfall and impact
of rainfall on work at different stages.  He expressed the view that taking
into account wet weather
and difficult access the reasonable time for
completing the development would be 71 working weeks.  In oral evidence he
added a further
allowance for holidays and rostered days off.
<P>

44  	I do not accept Mr Brown's figure of 71 working weeks because
there was no sufficient exposition of its basis.  The impact
of rain on the
work time required was not clearly shown.  Mr Brown's rainfall statistics
included rainfall of the period from June
to October 1998 which is outside the
period which could be relevant.  Mr Brown's assessment of the impact of rain,
made in and after
October 1999 without earlier knowledge of the job, does not
appear to me to be an appropriate basis on which to establish what the
impact
was; Mr Jabbour from his control of the job ought to be in a position to show
how rainfall actually impacted on the job day
to day, and did not do so.  I
also regard Mr Brown's assessment of the impact of access as giving that factor
more weight than was
appropriate.  
<P>

45  	The most significant ground on which I find Mr Brown's evidence
unsatisfactory is that he did not address the impact of the
contractual
requirement of Printed Condition A6 on what the builder could do.  There is no
indication in his evidence that he considered
the feasibility of unusual
measures such as working on Saturdays, or engaging additional staff or
programming work to proceed with
greater intensity.  Although Mr Brown was not
explicit as to what he contemplated I understood him to be dealing with a
general concept
of ordinary and reasonable working methods uninfluenced by any
special contractual obligation, and in particular he did not address
an
obligation under which the builder must do everything reasonably necessary to
have a strata plan registered within a prescribed
time.  Notwithstanding Mr
Brown's evidence I regard it as clear that if that provision had been complied
with, the building work
should have been commenced late in February 1997 and
completed before the end of March 1998, leaving sufficient time to obtain
certificates
and register the plan.  Within that time about 57 weeks were
available, and in my finding the work could have been done in that time
or
less.
<P>

46  	In my view the plaintiffs have established that the time spent
on construction was far longer than the time which would have
been spent on
construction if the provisions of cl.A6.1 had been complied with.  A precise
finding is not required, and in my view
it is clear that the building work
should, if cl.A.6 had been complied with, have been completed by the end of
March 1998.  I conclude
that at the time when the purported notices of
rescission were given the defendants were in breach of the provisions of the
contracts
of sale relating to time in that they had failed to do everything
reasonably necessary to have the plan registered within the plan
registration
time.  For that reason the defendants were not entitled to rescind, and the
plaintiffs are entitled to proceed with
their contracts in a regular way
towards completion.  
<P>

47  	I propose to make a declaration establishing the plaintiffs'
entitlement, and an order that the contracts be specifically performed
under
the control of the court.
<P>

48  	Orders:
<P>

(1)	Declarations as in claims 15(a) and (d) of the Amended Statement of
Claim.
<P>

(2)	Order that the contracts of sale be specifically performed and carried into
execution under the direction of the Court.
<P>

(3)	Liberty to apply for directions under Order (2).
<P>

(4)	Give judgment for the plaintiffs for damages to be assessed: and order that
the assessment of damages be referred to a Master.
<P>

(5)	Order that the defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.
<P>

(6)	On the Cross-claim, give judgment for the Cross-defendants with costs.
