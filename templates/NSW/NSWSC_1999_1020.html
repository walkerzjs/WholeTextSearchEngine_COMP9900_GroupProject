<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  According to folio identifier 4/557887, the
property, Lot 4 Maguires Road, Maraylya, is owned by the defendants
John Asimus
and Colleen Asimus as joint tenants in a one half share, and the plaintiffs
Peter Asimus and Virginia Russell as joint
tenants in a one half share, as
tenants in common.  Despite the reference to "half shares" in the title deed,
it is common ground
that the defendants, in fact, have a 60 per cent interest
in the property, and that the plaintiffs have a 40 per cent interest, subject
to an agreement as to recompensing each of them from the proceeds of any sale
for the amount by which any improvements made by the
plaintiffs and the
defendants respectively have increased the value of the property.
<P>

2  	In these proceedings, the plaintiffs seek the appointment of
Guardian Trust Australia Limited as trustee for sale of the property
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.
<P>

3  	This application is resisted by the defendants, on the basis of
an agreement dated 15 May 1994 entered into by the parties at
the time of the
purchase of the property, and also on grounds related to the hardship which
will be caused to them from the forced
sale of their home.
<P>

4  	I will commence by briefly outlining the main facts in the
case.
<P>

5  	The property was purchased by the parties by a contract which was
completed in May 1994.  There were and are two dwellings on
the property.
There is a timber house which is occupied by the defendants, and a brick house
occupied by the plaintiffs.
<P>

6  	As I mentioned earlier, at the time of the purchase, the parties
entered into an agreement, the body of which was in the following
terms:
<P>

<cite>NOW THIS DEED WITNESSETH</cite><b><i> should the property be sold in its
entirety by the parties that the First Purchasers are to receive sixty per cent
(60%) of the proceeds
and the Second Purchasers forty per cent (40%) provided
that if either party spends money on improvements that party is to be
reimbursed
for the amount by which the improvements increased the value of the
property.  Such amounts to be determined, in the absence of a
mutual agreement
of the parties, by a registered valuer.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Should the property become capable of subdivision the land is to be
divided equally between the parties, the First Purchasers to keep
the timber
house and the Second Purchasers to receive the brick house.  This agreement is
to be revised each three (3) years and
both parties are to give to each other
the right of first option to purchase should they decide to sell their interest
in the property.
 Rates are to be drawn equally between the parties.</i></b>
<P>

7  	Since May 1994, the plaintiffs have operated a horse training
business on the property.  The first defendant has earned income
as a motor
dealer and a beef cattle producer.
<P>

8  	There is a mortgage over the property to the ANZ Banking group
securing amounts owing by the parties.  As at August 1999, it
appears that this
mortgage secured about $70,000 owing by the plaintiffs and about $140,000 owing
by the defendants.
<P>

9  	On 29 May 1997, that is three years and two weeks after  the date
of the agreement, the first defendant, Mr Asimus, entered
into an agreement
with one Robyn Margaret O'Brien to agist over 500 head of cattle on her
property from 1 June 1997 to 30 May 2000.
<P>

10  	According to the first defendant, before entering into that
agreement, he told the second plaintiff, Ms Russell, that he was
thinking about
entering into an agreement of that kind, and she raised no objection to it.  Ms
Russell does not absolutely deny such
a conversation, but says that she did not
signify agreement to that proposal.
<P>

11  	According to the plaintiffs, there was a meeting between the
plaintiffs and the defendants on 9 June 1997, at which the plaintiffs
told the
defendants that they wanted to finish the arrangement between them.  The
defendants denied that such a meeting took place.
<P>

12  	It is common ground that a meeting did take place between the
plaintiffs and the defendants on 14 May 1998.  It seems clear
that on that day,
the plaintiffs told the defendants that they wanted to finish the arrangement,
and that there was discussion of
either side buying the other out.
<P>

13  	There is in evidence a notice dated 19 August 1998 from the
plaintiffs to the defendants, to the effect that the plaintiffs
wished to end
what they called the "partnership" and that they wished it not to continue
beyond December 1998.  This document set
out a number of options, namely one
side buying the other out; an auction; and legal action.  The notice suggested
a meeting on the
following day.  It would appear that such a meeting took
place, but no agreement was reached.
<P>

14  	By letter from the defendants to the plaintiffs dated 29 August
1998, the defendants expressed a wish to buy out the plaintiffs'
interest but
made no particular offer.
<P>

15  	On 6 September 1998, the plaintiffs made an offer to buy out the
defendants for $390,000.  A letter dated 10 September 1998
from the defendants
to the plaintiffs indicated that the defendants did not accept the offer.  The
letter went on to request that
the parties "Continue as we are or under some
new agreement suitable to both of us".  It set out as other options that the
defendants
buy out the plaintiffs, or an auction in September/October 1999.
<P>

16  	In September 1998, a valuation was obtained of the property,
which gave a value of $690,000 on the basis that both houses had
council
approval, and $610,000 on the basis that only one house had council
approval.
<P>

17  	The plaintiffs wrote a further letter to the defendants on 21
September 1998 again asserting that they wanted to finish the
"partnership".
In this letter, the plaintiffs offered to sell their interest to the defendants
for $320,000.
<P>

18  	In a telephone conversation on 22 November 1998, the plaintiffs
offered $420,000 for the defendants' share.  In a further telephone
conversation a week later, the defendants indicated that they would not accept
that offer, but that they would buy out the plaintiffs
for $300,000.
<P>

19  	It appears that this offer was accepted in principle, and on 8
December 1998 solicitors acting for the plaintiffs recorded
that matter and
requested that contracts be signed and exchanged within 21 days.  In this
letter, the solicitors suggested that there
should be a 10 per cent deposit and
completion by 15 April 1999.
<P>

20  	It seems that in a telephone conversation a few days later, the
first defendant, Mr Asimus, told Ms Russell that he would not
sign a contract
on those terms, but that he was considering a contract with a one per cent
deposit and completion in June 1999.
<P>

21  	There followed correspondence between solicitors concerning this
proposed contract.  It appears that the plaintiffs indicated
that they would
agree to a contract containing a one per cent deposit and provided for
completion in June 1999, but on the basis
that if the matter was not settled by
the end of July 1999, they would have an option to buy out the defendants for
$420,000.  No
formal contract has been signed.
<P>

22  	In May 1999, the defendants advertised their cattle for sale.
Apparently no cattle was sold at around that time.  I am told
by the defendants
that the value of their cattle is of the order of $300,000.
<P>

23  	The summons in these proceedings was filed on 26 May 1999.
There was some discussion of mediation.  There is in evidence a
letter dated 17
August 1999 from the proposed trustee for sale, pointing out the expenses and
delays involved in taking Court proceedings
and ultimately engaging a real
estate agent to sell the property, and suggesting a mediation conference.
<P>

24  	There is also in evidence an exchange of letters on 4 September
1999, in which the plaintiffs proposed a mediation meeting
in the office of the
proposed trustee on 14 September, and in which the defendants proposed "A
completely independent mediation such
as the Law Society's mediation system".
It appears, unfortunately, that the proposal for mediation did not advance
further than that.
 
<P>

25  	This matter was before Registrar Howe on 17 September; and on
that day it was put in the short notice list and from that list
it has come on
for hearing before me today.  At the commencement of the hearing, there was an
application for adjournment which I
dealt with in an earlier judgment today.
<P>

26  	The main issues that have been debated before me concern the
effect of the agreement of 15 May 1994; the question whether the
plaintiffs
gave notice in June 1997 that they wished to end the agreement; the effect of
the entry into the agistment agreement for
a period of three years ending in
May next year; and, finally, questions relating generally to the exercise of
discretion by the
Court as to the granting of the relief and the terms on which
it is granted, including the possibility of a stay of the orders.
<P>

27  	I will deal first with the effect of the agreement of 15 May
1994.  The general principle in relation to properties held in
joint ownership
or ownership in common is that any part-owner is prima facie entitled to obtain
a Court order for the sale of the
property, so that the part-owner is not,
against his or her will, locked into a situation of having an asset which
cannot be dealt
with in any way.  That right can be cut down by agreement, and
the question is whether the agreement of May 1994 relevantly cuts
down the
right of the plaintiffs to realise their interest in this property.
<P>

28  	The agreement does not, in terms, prevent the making of an
application to the Court for the sale of the property; indeed, it
deals in
terms with how the proceeds of any sale are to be dealt with.  I am inclined to
think that even within the first three years,
the agreement does not prevent
any of the part-owners applying to the Court for an order that the property be
sold.
<P>

29  	The agreement states that it is to be revised each three years;
and the first defendant, John Asimus, has submitted that that
plainly implies
that the agreement is to continue in three year stages automatically, with only
the possibility of revision of terms
between one three year stage and the
next.
<P>

30  	In my opinion, that is not the correct interpretation of the
agreement.  I think, rather, it contemplates consideration after
three years
whether and on what terms the agreement is to continue; and, even if it did
have the effect of cutting down any of the
parties' rights to approach the
Court for the first three years, in my opinion, it does not cut down the right
of any of the parties
to approach the Court after the end of the first three
years.
<P>

31  	The next question is the main factual dispute in the case;
namely, whether the plaintiffs gave notice in June 1997 that they
wished the
arrangement to end.
<P>

32  	Although the evidence of the plaintiffs on the one hand and of
John Asimus on the other is directly opposed, I am not satisfied
that either
party is deliberately giving false evidence.  I think all parties have given
true evidence to the best of their ability
and recollection.  In my opinion,
the diary entry produced by Ms Russell does strongly support the view that a
meeting did take place
on 9 June, and I think it is probable that at that
meeting, the plaintiffs at least indicated dissatisfaction with the continuance
of the arrangement.  I am not satisfied, however, that an express agreement was
entered into between the parties on that day that
the arrangement should
continue for 12 months and no more.
<P>

33  	Turning to the effect of the agistment agreement, the fact of
entry into that agreement has some bearing on the probabilities
of what
happened on 9 June, and I have taken that into account in reaching the finding
I have indicated upon that matter.  I think
that agreement has some bearing on
the exercise of the Court's discretion, but I do not think that agreement or
the circumstances
of its making gives any basis for precluding the plaintiffs'
making and succeeding on this application.
<P>

34  	Although I accept that it was mentioned to Ms Russell that an
agreement of this kind was being entered into, I am certainly
not satisfied
that it was brought home to her attention that the defendants saw this as an
important change in their position which
would make it necessary for them to
hold onto the property for a further three years, and I am  certainly not
satisfied that the
plaintiffs had any view of that kind.
<P>

35  	One further matter relevant to the effect of the agistment
agreement is that it seems clear from oral evidence given today
by John Asimus
that he can, in all probability, bring it to an end earlier than May next year
and, indeed, bring it to an end almost
immediately so that he could commence
retrieving and selling his cattle quite soon.  John Asimus gave evidence that
Margaret O'Brien
was in breach of the agreement and, in any event, did not
object to the agreement being ended early.  There was a dispute between
him and
Margaret O'Brien being dealt with apparently by mediation; but, as I understood
his evidence, that did not really affect
his ability to regain control of his
cattle, if he wished to do so.
<P>

36  	Coming to the matters relevant to the exercise of discretion, I
think it is of some significance that the property is regarded
by the
defendants as their home and that they have lived there, or on an adjoining
property, for many years.  A further matter relevant
to the exercise of
discretion is the defendants' wish, if possible, to buy out the plaintiffs; and
they say they need time to raise
money which would enable them to do so.
<P>

37  	The final matter of some relevance to discretion is that the
defendants still wish, if possible, to investigate the possibility
of
subdivision, which, if it could be achieved, would enable them to retain their
home and enable the plaintiffs to realise their
interest in the property by
selling a subdivided part of the property.  However, on the material before me,
I have to say that the
possibility of subdivision seems fairly remote, and it
really is very late in the day for the defendants to be seeking to raise that
matter now.
<P>

38  	For those reasons, in my opinion, the plaintiffs are, in
substance, entitled to the orders that they seek.   However, I think
it would
be appropriate to stay those orders for a period of four months, to give the
defendants an opportunity to raise money to
either buy out the plaintiffs'
interest, or at least to be in a position to bid at any auction by which the
property is sold by the
trustee.
<P>

39  	In the course of argument, I adverted to the possibility of an
application for extension of that period in certain eventualities.
 One of the
eventualities discussed was that the defendants may, within that period, be
able to raise some, but not all, of $300,000,
which is the amount that the
plaintiffs have been requiring to be bought out of their interest.  However, I
would have to say that
unless the plaintiffs agreed to such an extension, I do
not believe that could be a ground for applying for an extension of the stay,
because the plaintiffs cannot be compelled to accept $300,000, or any
particular amount, for their interest.  They are entitled to
insist, if they so
choose, that an auction or other sale of the whole property proceed.
<P>

40  	The other possible ground mentioned in argument for an
application for a stay was that, if the Court could be satisfied that
subdivision was a probability and only  required limited additional time, the
Court might be prepared to grant a stay on that basis.
 That still seems to me
to be a possible ground for extending the stay, but it would be a matter for
the Judge hearing any such application
to determine whether such an extension
is appropriate.
<P>

41  	The plaintiffs have indicated in general terms that, for a
limited period at least, they would still be prepared to accept
$300,000 in
payment out of their interest; and I think that is a reasonable basis as well
as the subdivision question to grant the
stay which I have indicated.
<P>

42  	For those reasons, I propose to make the orders substantially as
sought in the summons, although I will alter a little the
provision concerning
the shares payable to each party.
<P>

43  	I will make a declaration establishing the interests of the
parties in the property, as indicated earlier in my judgment, and
I would
propose to stay the operation of the orders until 7 February 2000, or such
further time as may be agreed in writing between
the parties.  That will put it
in the parties' power to extend the stay, if they wish to do it, but it would
only be effected by
agreement in writing by all parties.
<P>

44  	The orders that I make are these.
<P>

45  	I declare that the property comprised in folio identifier
4/557887 is owned as to 60 per cent by the defendants and 40 per
cent by the
plaintiffs, subject to the right of the defendants and plaintiffs respectively
to be reimbursed from the proceeds of
any sale of that property for the amount
by which any improvements effected by the defendants and plaintiffs
respectively have increased
the value of the property.
<P>

46  	I make order one in the summons filed 26 May 1999.
<P>

47  	I order that the net proceeds of sale be applied as follows:
<P>

(a) in paying the costs of the plaintiffs of these proceedings assessed at
$2,890.27;
<P>

(b) an amount of $50,000 should be set aside to be dealt with as stated in the
following order;
<P>

(c) to the defendants, 60 per cent of the balance plus the total debt to the
ANZ Bank, less the whole of the defendants' share of
the debt to the ANZ
Bank;
<P>

(d) to the plaintiffs, 40 per cent of the balance plus the total debt to the
ANZ Bank, less the whole of the plaintiffs' share of
the debt to the ANZ
Bank.
<P>

48  	From the sum of $50,000 referred to in the previous order, there
should be paid to the defendants the amount by which the value
of the property
was increased by improvements effected by the defendants, and to the plaintiffs
the amount by which the value of
the property was increased by improvements
effected by the plaintiffs, with any balance going as to 60 per cent to the
defendants
and 40 per cent to  the plaintiffs.  In default of agreement, such
values are to be determined by a valuer agreed by the parties,
or in default of
agreement appointed by the President of the Real Estate Institute.
<P>

49  	I reserve liberty to apply in case any problems arise with
giving effect to the orders I have made.
<P>

50  	I make orders 3 and 4 in the summons.
<P>

51  	Apart from the provision for the plaintiffs' costs in a previous
order, I make no further order as to costs.
<P>

52  	I stay the foregoing orders until and including 7 February 2000,
or such further time as may be agreed in writing between the
parties.
