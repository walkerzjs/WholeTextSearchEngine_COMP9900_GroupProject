EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Friday, 20 August 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1123/97	ERKAN ERGUN   -v-   MARION FUSIPALA ALE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These proceedings were instituted by summons
filed by the plaintiff Erkan Ergun on 20 January 1997. By that summons the
plaintiff
sought relief pursuant to Division 6 of Part IV of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act </i>1919</a> and, in particular, sought the appointment of
statutory trustees for sale of a certain house property situate at and known as
58
Ostend Street, Lidcombe, of which he and the defendant Marion Fusipala Ale
are the registered proprietors as joint tenants.
<P>

2   	The defendant filed a cross-claim to that summons on 16
April 1997, by which she sought relief pursuant to section 20 of the
<i>De
Facto Relationships Act</i> 1984, adjusting the interests of the parties in
certain items of property, including the aforesaid house property, and sought
other
and consequential relief. 
<P>

3   	The plaintiff filed a statement of claim on 28 October 1998
(the heading to that document bearing a reference to the <i>De Facto
Relationships Act</i>). No defence or other pleading has been filed by the
defendant in response to that statement of claim. The attitude adopted by the
defendant through her present legal advisers was that the cross-claim filed in
response to the summons stood as an assertion by her
of the relief which she
presently claimed, and that the affidavits which had been filed raised the
matters which were essentially
in dispute between the parties.
<P>

4   	Although the foregoing course did not strictly comply with
the requirement of the Supreme Court Rules that proceedings for
relief under
the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i> should be instituted by statement of
claim (Part 77 rule 76A), with the consequential operation of the provisions of
the Rules relating
to pleadings (Part 15), the plaintiff through his legal
advisers did not raise any opposition to the matter proceeding to a hearing
upon the documents to which I have already referred and the affidavits which
were filed on behalf of each party. 
<P>

5   	The plaintiff was born on 14 September 1967, and is
presently aged 31. He and the defendant (who was born on 14 September 1963
and
is presently aged 35) entered into a de facto relationship in August or
September of 1987, when the plaintiff was aged about
19 or 20, and they
separated in September 1996. Of that relationship was born one child, Izra
(born 9 April 1993, who is presently
six years of age). In addition, the
defendant had a child from a former relationship, James Easthope (who is now
known as Jemal Ergun),
who was born on 19 September 1984, and who is presently
aged 14. He lived with his mother and the plaintiff throughout the period
of
the relationship, and was (and continues to be) treated by the plaintiff as if
he were the plaintiff's own child. The defendant
did not receive any child
support from James's father. Since the termination of the de facto relationship
both the children have
remained in the custody of the defendant. The plaintiff
pays to the defendant child support for Izra in an amount assessed by the
Child
Support Agency, currently $261 a month.
<P>

6   	At the time of the commencement of the relationship the
plaintiff was the proprietor of a caf&eacute; known as the Caf&eacute;
Enigma,
situate at 177 King Street, Newtown. That business had been acquired by the
plaintiff when he was aged no more than 18 (he
may have been aged only 17 at
the time), with the benefit of an advance from his mother in the sum of $
40,000 (that sum coming from
his parents' savings and from an award received by
his mother as a result of a motor vehicle accident). The plaintiff and his
parents
were residing in the residential accommodation above the
caf&eacute;.
<P>

7   	At the commencement of the relationship the assets of the
plaintiff consisted of his interest in the caf&eacute; business,
and an
unencumbered Datsun motor vehicle (to which a value of $5,000 was ascribed).
That motor vehicle was subsequently traded in
on another motor vehicle.
<P>

8   	At the commencement of the de facto relationship the
defendant and her son, James, entered into residence with the plaintiff
in the
residential premises located above the caf&eacute;. Shortly thereafter the
plaintiff's parents left those premises, and moved
into a house they owned at
70 Thomas Street, Croydon, which they had purchased in about 1987. The entirety
of the premises at 177
King Street, Newtown, being both the caf&eacute;
premises and the residential premises above it, were the subject of a lease to
the
plaintiff. Throughout the period whilst the parties were residing in that
accommodation the plaintiff paid the entirety of the rent,
and all outgoings
for electricity, telephone, gas and the like. 
<P>

9   	At the time of the commencement of the relationship the
defendant had no assets. She was employed as nurse's aide. She remained
in that
employment for a period of only about three weeks after the relationship with
the plaintiff commenced. The defendant was
also in receipt of a sole parent
pension during at least some part of the de facto relationship.
<P>

10   	Whilst the defendant was working in the nursing home
full-time either the plaintiff or his mother (who was also working in
the
caf&eacute;) cared for James. It was asserted by the defendant the she worked,
without pay, in the caf&eacute; of an evening
(her hours at the nursing home
being from 6:30am to 2:30pm). The frequency and extent of any such assistance
given by the defendant
in the caf&eacute; was disputed by the plaintiff. In any
event, any such assistance cannot have subsisted for more than eight months,
since the Caf&eacute; Enigma was sold in April 1988 for $48,000. The entirety
of the proceeds of sale were paid to the plaintiff's
mother (representing her
original advance of $40,000, together with interest thereon). 
<P>

11   	Thereafter the plaintiff, the defendant and James resided
rent-free for some months with the plaintiff's parents at 70 Thomas
Street,
Croydon, before moving into rented accommodation. The plaintiff was working as
a labourer throughout that period until September
or October 1988, when he
commenced work as a dock hand for Jetspress Air Couriers. In about August or
September 1988 the defendant
worked as a data operator for a short period; and
then was employed in office work at John Kaldor Fabrics.
<P>

12   	In November 1988 the plaintiff purchased, as an
investment, a home unit at 28/412 Horsley Drive, Fairfield, for $105,000.
That
purchase was financed by an advance of $50,000 from the plaintiff's parents
(who encouraged him in that investment), the balance
being provided by the St.
George Building Society (later called the St. George Bank). That advance of
$50,000 from the plaintiff's
parents was secured by a mortgage dated 16
December 1988. The unit was rented, and the shortfall in the mortgage payments
and outgoings
was paid entirely by the plaintiff from his earnings. Throughout
the period of his ownership of the Fairfield unit the plaintiff
made no
repayments to his mother.
<P>

13   	In September or October of 1989 the plaintiff commenced
work as a courier. Although nominally an independent contractor, the
plaintiff
had only one client, Jetspress Air Couriers. In his work as a courier it was
necessary for the plaintiff to have a van.
He acquired such a van on lease, and
for that purpose the plaintiff's mother advanced the sum of $5,000, being the
required amount
of the deposit. Although at first the plaintiff's income from
that work was low, after about a year he began to earn about $1,500
a week. For
the 1995-1996 year the business returned a net income (before tax) of
$83,000.
<P>

14   	The defendant asserted that she assisted the plaintiff in
his courier work, in early mornings, when he was driving her to
her employment
(both the courier depot and the defendant's employment being each located at
Alexandria). The extent of any such assistance
was disputed by the plaintiff.
But even if there were such assistance to the extent asserted by the defendant
(but disputed by the
plaintiff), the opportunity for such assistance on any
regular basis did not continue beyond July 1991, when the defendant was
retrenched
from her employment (indeed, she had been overseas during the period
immediately before that retrenchment), and there was no evidence
to suggest
that any such assistance increased the earnings of the plaintiff from his
courier business. 
<P>

15   	In July 1991 the defendant was retrenched from her
employment at John Kaldor Fabrics. Thereafter, with the exception of some
part-time acting work (for which she earned a total of $2,500) the defendant
was not in receipt of any income throughout the remainder
of the relationship,
extending over slightly more than five years. 
<P>

16   	The Fairfield unit was sold on 16 August 1991 for
$105,000. From the proceeds of sale an amount of $65,748 was repaid to the
St.
George Building Society. The plaintiff's mother agreed to (what was described
as) "roll-over" the advance which she had made
on the Fairfield unit for the
purpose of the purchase of another property. The plaintiff used the balance of
the proceeds of sale,
being $34,007 to purchase a house property at 58 Ostend
Street, Lidcombe. That property was acquired in the names of the plaintiff
and
the defendant as joint tenants. The purchase, for the sum of $172,000, was
financed by an advance of $140,000 from the St. George
Bank, secured by
mortgage, with the balance being met from the proceeds of sale of the Fairfield
unit. 
<P>

17   	Since the plaintiff's mother had not been repaid the
amount of $50,000 which she had advanced towards the purchase of the
Fairfield
unit, and which had been secured by a mortgage over that property, the
plaintiff executed a mortgage over 58 Ostend Street,
Lidcombe (to which I shall
refer as "the Lidcombe property") to secure a loan of $50,000 from his mother.
That mortgage was executed
by the plaintiff alone, and not by the defendant. It
was dated 16 August 1991. It was asserted by the defendant that she was not
aware of the existence of that mortgage until after the institution of the
present proceedings. That mortgage provided for an interest
free period until 1
June 1993, and provided for interest to be payable thereafter at bank rates.

<P>

18   	I would here observe that both the 1991 mortgage over the
Lidcombe property and the earlier, 1988, mortgage over the Fairfield
unit name
both the plaintiff's parents as mortgagees, although the evidence (especially
the oral evidence of the plaintiff and of
his mother) suggests that the moneys
were advanced by the plaintiff's mother alone.
<P>

19   	Although stamp duty has been paid on the 1991 mortgage, it
has not been registered against the title to the Lidcombe property.
<P>

20   	From the time of its acquisition by them the Lidcombe
property was the residence of the plaintiff and the defendant and James
and,
after her birth on 9 April 1993, Izra, the daughter of the parties. 
<P>

21   	The plaintiff's earnings were deposited in his bank
account with the St. George Bank. From that account were automatically
deducted
all mortgage payments owing to the St. George Bank and were paid all other
expenses relating to the house property and to
the household of the plaintiff,
the defendant and their children. Upon the plaintiff's earnings the family
appears to have maintained
quite a comfortable lifestyle. The plaintiff paid
for all entertainment and for holidays, to Queensland, New Zealand, and on one
occasion a holiday for the family to Vanuatu (upon which they were accompanied,
at the plaintiff's expense, by the defendant's father,
who was residing with
them at the time). For months at a time (in one instance for about a year) the
defendant's brothers resided
with the parties in the Lidcombe property.
Apparently they were not working during those periods, throughout which they
were supported
by the plaintiff, who was the only person in the household then
earning an income. By the same token, it should be stated that the
plaintiff's
teenage brother also stayed with the parties for about a year. 
<P>

22   	In 1993 there was incorporated a company, Ergun Pty
Limited, which was used as a vehicle for the conduct of the plaintiff's
courier
business. The plaintiff and the defendant were the sole shareholders and sole
directors of that company. In 1995 the plaintiff
ceased to operate Ergun Pty
Limited, and that company no longer trades. The plaintiff then performed his
courier work under the business
name, Black Magic Carrier until mid-1996. Since
then he has conducted the business under the name Ergun Trust. 
<P>

23   	Also in 1993, or thereabouts, the plaintiff purchased a
boat. For that purpose he borrowed an amount of $5,000 from his mother.
That
boat was sold on 28 April 1995. The plaintiff did not, however, repay his
mother the advance of $5,000 which she had made to
enable him to purchase the
boat. He applied the net proceeds of the sale of the boat, in an amount of
$3,650, in reduction of the
amount outstanding on the mortgage over the
Lidcombe property. 
<P>

24   	On 10 April 1995 the plaintiff sold his motor vehicle and
applied the amount of $11,200, representing the net proceeds of
sale thereof,
also in reduction of the amount outstanding on the mortgage over the Lidcombe
property.
<P>

25   	The parties separated in September 1996 and the de facto
relationship thereupon terminated. The plaintiff left the Lidcombe
property. At
the time of separation the amount outstanding under the mortgage to St. George
Bank was $101,734. 
<P>

26   	At the termination of the relationship, apart from their
joint interest in the Lidcombe property, the only asset held by either
of the
parties was the plaintiff's courier business. The liabilities of the parties
were their joint liabilities in respect to the
Lidcombe property.
<P>

27   	The payments which the plaintiff had made in reduction of
the amount outstanding under the mortgage (the payments made in
April 1995
totalled almost $15,000) were well in advance of what was required by the terms
of the mortgage. No payments were made
from 19 October 1996, shortly after the
plaintiff left the Lidcombe property, until 27 May 1999. There were then made
two payments,
in May and in July 1999 (each being in an amount of $991), which
were each made by the defendant. It was agreed between the parties
that the
mortgage is presently in arrears to an amount of $179.27, and that the balance
presently outstanding under the mortgage
is $122,405.45. 
<P>

28   	Since the date of the termination of the de facto
relationship the defendant and her two children have remained in residence
at
the Lidcombe property. The defendant's father (who had resided with the parties
since 1992) also remained in residence in that
property for a period. 
<P>

29   	The plaintiff did not dispute that throughout the
relationship the defendant had the primary responsibility as homemaker and
mother to the family constituted by the plaintiff, the defendant, the
defendant's son James and, after her birth, the daughter of
the parties Izra.
That contribution was a significant one.
<P>

30   	It must also, however, be appreciated that throughout the
relationship the plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of the family.
Although
for quite legitimate taxation purposes the income of the plaintiff's courier
business was notionally split between himself
and the defendant, and income tax
was assessed separately in respect of each of those parties upon that notional
division of income,
nevertheless, that income was generated exclusively by the
efforts of the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid the entirety of the income
tax of
himself and of the defendant. 
<P>

31   	The parties were both in agreement that it was inevitable
that the house property must be sold, and that from the proceeds
of sale the
amount outstanding on the mortgage to the St. George Bank must be paid. 
<P>

32   	It was agreed between the parties that present value of
the Lidcombe property was $350,000.
<P>

33   	Essentially, however, the dispute between the parties
concerned the question of whether the advance of $50,000 originally
made by the
plaintiff's mother on the Fairfield unit, which she had allowed to be "rolled
over" upon the sale of that property and
the purchase of the Lidcombe property,
and which was secured by the mortgage granted to her and her husband by the
plaintiff should
be repaid from the proceeds of sale of the Lidcombe property
before the balance then remaining be divided equally between the parties
(as
was the submission of the plaintiff); or whether, after the discharge of the
mortgage to the St. George Bank the proceeds be
equally divided between the
parties, and the responsibility for any repayment to the plaintiff's mother
rest upon the plaintiff alone,
with the consequence that if the plaintiff's
mother is to be repaid, then the amount which the defendant would receive would
not
be reduced by the proportional share of her payment to the plaintiff's
mother (as was the submission of the defendant). 
<P>

34   	Whether or not the defendant was aware of the existence of
the mortgage which the plaintiff had granted to his mother, and
whether or not
the plaintiff's mother (or both his parents) has a legal entitlement consequent
upon the existence of that unregistered
mortgage to secure her funds of $50,000
against the property itself; or whether or not that advance was a loan (as was
submitted
by the plaintiff), or was a gift (as was submitted by the defendant),
does not seem to me to be in any way determinative of the rights
of the parties
to the Lidcombe property and the distribution of the proceeds of sale thereof
under the provisions of the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>. 
<P>

35   	It is abundantly obvious that the purchase of the Lidcombe
property was made possible as a result of the net proceeds of sale
from the
Fairfield unit being applied to the purchase of the Lidcombe property. Had the
plaintiff's mother not advanced $50,000 towards
the purchase of the Fairfield
unit, then there would not have been available the amount of $34,000 which the
plaintiff from the proceeds
of sale of that property was able to advance to the
acquisition of the Lidcombe property. Similarly, had the plaintiff's mother
required
repayment of the $50,000 from the proceeds of sale of the Fairfield
unit, then there would have been no part of those proceeds available
to
purchase the Lidcombe property. If, without the benefit of that contribution by
the plaintiff's mother, the Lidcombe property
had been purchased, then, of
course, the mortgage to the St. George Bank would have been for the entirety of
the purchase price,
and the amount necessary to discharge that mortgage would
now be appreciably higher.
<P>

36   	There was no suggestion on the part of the defendant that
the balance of the purchase price of the Lidcombe property, being
that part not
advanced by the St. George Bank, came otherwise than from the plaintiff (being
the net proceeds of sale of his Fairfield
unit). It seems to me to be totally
immaterial to a consideration of the legal rights and entitlements between the
plaintiff and
the defendant whether the plaintiff generated that amount through
his own efforts, or whether he acquired it through the beneficence
of his
mother. Similarly, it seems to me to be totally immaterial whether the advance
which had originally been made by his mother,
and which was the ultimate source
of that part of the purchase price not advanced by the St. George Bank, was an
amount which the
plaintiff was legally obligated to repay to his mother.
<P>

37   	Upon the assumption that the Lidcombe property when sold
will realise $350,000, after the amount presently outstanding on
the mortgage
and the arrears have been repaid there will be about $227,000 remaining. It is
likely that estate agent's fees and associated
legal costs upon the sale will
reduce that amount to something not exceeding $220,000. Upon the plaintiff's
submission, that amount
should then be reduced further by the repayment to the
plaintiff's mother of $50,000, leaving an amount of about $170,000 to be
divided
equally between the plaintiff and the defendant. That would give to
each of them an amount of about $85,000. The defendant, on the
other hand,
submits that the amount of about $220,000 should be divided equally between the
plaintiff and the defendant, thus giving
to each of them an amount of about
$110,000, and that, if the plaintiff's mother is to be repaid her advance, that
repayment should
come out of the plaintiff's share, so that the plaintiff would
ultimately receive about $60,000.
<P>

38   	In my view the parties equally had the benefit of the
advance made by the plaintiff's mother. I can see no reason, on legal
grounds,
why, if the plaintiff's mother requires repayment of that amount (as she stated
in her evidence that she does), that amount
should not be regarded as being an
amount to be repaid before the balance of the proceeds of sale are divided
equally between the
parties. It should be appreciated, however, that (although
the plaintiff might be under a legal obligation to repay to his mother
the sum
of $50,000), the amount of her money which was advanced for the purchase of the
Lidcombe property was only $34,007, being
the net proceeds of sale of the
Fairfield unit.
<P>

39   	In any event, it seems to me that the direct financial
contributions of the plaintiff to the relationship, in meeting the
totality of
the mortgage payments, in substantially reducing the amount owing on the
mortgage by contributing the proceeds of sale
of a motor vehicle and of a boat,
and by being the principal breadwinner of the family throughout the entirety of
the relationship
and being the sole breadwinner for most of the relationship
more than equal the significant contributions of the defendant as homemaker
and
mother.
<P>

40   	If the approach which I have earlier outlined, of treating
the advance of $34,007 from the plaintiff's mother as being an
indirect
financial contribution by the plaintiff to the relationship --- since it is
abundantly obvious that the plaintiff's mother
would not have made such an
advance towards the purchase of the Lidcombe property if it had not been her
son who was one of the persons
purchasing that property --- then, in my
conclusion, the contributions of the plaintiff as principal breadwinner
significantly exceed
the contributions of the defendant as homemaker and
mother, to the extent that the plaintiff is entitled to receive from the
proceeds
of sale of the Lidcombe property an amount which exceeds by $34,007
the amount to be received by the defendant from such proceeds
of sale. 
<P>

41   	In consequence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is
entitled to relief essentially of the nature sought by him in his statement
of
claim. However, I do not consider that the plaintiff has established an
entitlement to have the $10,000 (representing the two
loans of $5,000 each from
the plaintiff's parents) also to be deducted from the net proceeds of sale
before the division between
the parties. It seems to me that those two advances
by the plaintiff's mother (and any liability resulting from those advances)
were
essentially private arrangements between him and his mother, unconnected
with his relationship with the defendant. It will be appreciated
that when he
had the opportunity to do so he did not repay those amounts, but chose rather
to reduce the amount of the indebtedness
to the St. George Bank under the
mortgage. Further, the boat, which was acquired and used by the plaintiff
purely for recreational
purposes, could not be regarded as in any way necessary
for the generation of income. If the plaintiff was liable to repay his mother
the loan for the motor vehicle, then he had the opportunity to do so upon the
sale of that vehicle and his mother has had ample opportunity
to request such
repayment since that sale. 
<P>

42   	Accordingly, I propose to make an order of the nature of
the relief sought in prayer 1 in the statement of claim, substituting
in
paragraph (a) $34,007 for $50,000, and omitting therefrom paragraph (b). As I
understand it, there is no opposition by the defendant
to the relief sought in
prayers 2, 3 and 4 of the statement of claim. 
<P>

43   	Upon the matter which was essentially in dispute between
the parties --- whether the $50,000 claimed by the plaintiff's mother
should be
repaid before the equal division of the net proceeds of sale of the Lidcombe
property, or whether that amount should be
repaid exclusively from the share of
the plaintiff of the net proceeds --- the plaintiff has been largely successful
and the defendant
has been unsuccessful. In those circumstances, therefore, I
consider that the plaintiff has established an entitlement to an order
that the
defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff. However, since the defendant has not
had an opportunity to make submissions concerning
costs in the light of my
ultimate conclusions, I will give to the defendant such an opportunity, if she
so desires.
<P>

44   	Accordingly, unless either party within seven days of the
date hereof arranges with my Associate to have the matter listed
for argument
as to costs, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I make orders as in prayer 1 (substituting in paragraph (a) $34,007 for
$50,000 and omitting therefrom paragraph (b)), and prayers
2, 3, and 4 in the
statement of claim.
<P>

2.	I order that the cross-claim be dismissed.
<P>

3.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of the
proceedings.
<P>

4.	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
