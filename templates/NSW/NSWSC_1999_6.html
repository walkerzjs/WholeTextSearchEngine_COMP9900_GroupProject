<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  By summons dated 21 December 1998, the plaintiff sought orders
claiming relief in various alternative ways appropriate
to relief which would
be ordered in oppression proceedings if successful.
<P>

2	No affidavit evidence was filed with the summons. Affidavits have now been
filed proving service of the summons on the three defendants:
 the first
defendant being the company in which the plaintiff holds a 45 per cent
interest; the second defendant being the father
of the plaintiff who also holds
a 45 per cent shareholding in the first defendant; and the third defendant
being the holder of the
remaining 10 per cent of these shares.
<P>

3	By Notice of Motion filed in court this afternoon and which I allowed to be
returnable immediately, the plaintiff seeks orders
in the nature of Mareva
injunctions restraining the defendants, but presumably meaning the second and
third defendants, from operating
on the bank accounts of the first defendant,
subject to certain provisions enabling particular payments to be made.
<P>

4	These orders are sought ex parte so that the Notice of Motion has not been
served and no notice of it has been given to the defendants.
<P>

5	In an affidavit sworn today, the plaintiff has stated that the arrangement he
made with his father in 1993 was that he would take
a 50 per cent share of the
business that when Mr Roney, the third defendant, came into it both he and his
father give up a 5 per
cent interest;  that Mr Roney was to bring or arrange to
be brought to the company certain funds but this did not occur;  that the
company obtained funds by reason of some fraudulent claims on the Export Market
Development Grants Authority;  that he has been removed
as a director of the
company;  that there is an impasse in the conduct of its affairs in that he,
with a 45 per cent interest, has
no way of obtaining any control over the
conduct of the company's affairs as the second and third defendants are taking
no account
of his wishes.
<P>

6	All these matters may be relevant to the question of whether or not the
company should be wound up, or whether some compulsory
buy out orders ought to
be made, or other relief obtained by the plaintiff.  The question, however, on
this Notice of Motion is whether
or not the orders sought should be made.
<P>

7	For them to be made without notice, the court would need to be satisfied,
first, that the plaintiff's claim had at least a reasonable
chance of success,
and secondly that there was some danger of the assets of the first defendant
being dealt with not in the interests
of the shareholders or those assets taken
beyond the jurisdiction or in some way outside the control of the court.
<P>

8	As I understand it, the basis on which it is said that there is this risk is
that the second and third defendants are said to
have engaged in this
fraudulent conduct.  It is important to point out that they have not been given
any opportunity to respond to
the allegations made against them, and that the
offences if made out would be serious and would make the second and third
defendants
liable to severe penalties including imprisonment.  It follows it is
said that they may therefore attempt to abscond from the jurisdiction
taking
the moneys of the first defendant with them, making the plaintiff's claim to
secure his interest in the company useless.
<P>

9	In my view, the grounds on which a Mareva injunction would be granted have
not been made out.  It is just speculation at this
stage that two persons whose
roots are apparently in Australia will attempt to leave Australia if they
become aware of the enquiry
which has been put in place by the plaintiff or put
in place as a result of information given by the plaintiff to the relevant
authorities.
  In the same way it is just speculation that they would endeavour
to take from the company the company's moneys if they are informed
of the
actions taken by the plaintiff.
<P>

10	The effect of the injunctions could be serious so far as the first defendant
is concerned, but in any event, in my view the grounds
on which the orders
sought might possibly be made have not been made out and therefore the Notice
of Motion should be dismissed.
<P>

11	The plaintiff may wish to give consideration to seeking the appointment of a
receiver or a provisional liquidator for the company
but that is entirely a
matter for him and I am not to be taken as suggesting that this is necessarily
the appropriate course.
<P>

12	If the plaintiff wishes, then I am prepared to stand the Notice of Motion
over for hearing on notice, but the application for
the orders in the Notice of
Motion to be made ex parte is dismissed.
<P>

13	Order the return date of the summons be amended to 8 February 1999.
<P>
