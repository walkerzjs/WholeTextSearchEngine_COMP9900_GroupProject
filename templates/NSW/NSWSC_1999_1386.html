<u>REGINA   v  David Paul ROSS</u><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>60190/96<p>
Monday 7 April 1997<p>
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL<p>
SIMPSON J, HIDDEN J<p>
<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u>HIDDEN J:</b>   This is an application for leave to appeal against
sentences imposed on the applicant after he pleaded guilty in the District
Court
in March 1996 to four charges of breaking, entering and stealing, one
charge of break and enter with intent to steal, and one charge
of attempt break
and enter with intent to steal.  The applicant asked his Honour to take into
account on a Form 2 five further charges
of break enter and steal, and charges
of goods in custody and failing to appear.<p>
	<p>
	On each count, and taking into account the Form 2 matters, his Honour
sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for five years
and four months,
comprising a minimum term of four years to date from 28 August 1996, that is at
the expiration of a minimum term
which the applicant was then serving, and an
additional term of one year and four months.<p>
	<p>
	It is unnecessary to detail the facts of the offences.  The significant
offences were the breaking and entering matters which involved
private homes.
On most occasions property of quite considerable value was taken.  The offences
in the indictment took place over
a period of days in August 1995, but the Form
2 offences range between November 1994 and January 1995. <p>
	<p>
	The applicant co-operated with the police and made full admissions of his
involvement.  In most cases those admissions were the
only evidence against
him.  He gave evidence before his Honour in which he expressed remorse, which
his Honour accepted as genuine.
 The applicant has a bad record, mainly for
offences of dishonesty, and has been sentenced to a number of prior prison
terms.<p>
	<p>
	The applicant gave evidence of his background from which it appears that he is
now thirty-two years old.  He has had an unfortunate
upbringing which properly
elicits some sympathy for him.  His parents divorced when he was two and he and
his brother were taken
into foster care.  Both parents remarried, but it
appears that neither of them set about regaining custody of the boys.  He was
educated
to school certificate standard and in his later teens had unskilled
jobs.  <p>
	<p>
	For a period of years he lived in northern Queensland in a relationship with a
woman, and whilst there conducted a business as a
gardener.  When that
relationship ended he returned to Sydney where he had some brief contact with
his family.   He started using
heroin, which led to his involvement in a
robbery for which he received his first prison sentence.  He has been sentenced
to prison
on a number of subsequent occasions, and it does appear that his
criminality has been related to his drug affected lifestyle.<p>
	<p>
	After his release on parole in 1994 he sought drug rehabilitation at Wisteria
House, where he completed a three week course.  Thereafter
it appears he spent
a brief period at Cumberland Hospital.  Subsequently he was unable to get work
and he became addicted to heroin
again.  In 1995 he made further attempts at
drug rehabilitation in Odyssey House and the Langton Clinic, but these also
were unsuccessful.
  He sold the property stolen as a result of the present
offences and used the proceeds to buy heroin.  Since being back in custody
he
has been on a methadone program and it seems in recent times has not used
heroin, a matter which the learned sentencing judge
regarded as of some
significance.<p>
	<p>
	Mr Strickland of counsel, who appears for the applicant before us but who did
not appear in the Court below, has presented no argument
against the five and a
half year prison term.  His only submission is that the learned sentencing
judge should have found special
circumstances so as to have specified a lesser
minimum term and a greater additional term.<p>
	<p>
	We have had available to us a transcript of the address of counsel who
appeared for the applicant in the Court below.  Counsel made
no reference to
special circumstances, or indeed to any provision of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>.  On
the other hand, he did urge his Honour to deal with the applicant in such a way
as to foster his drug rehabilitation.  The learned
sentencing judge made no
reference to special circumstances in the course of his remarks on sentence
and, before us, Mr Strickland
has argued that his Honour thereby fell into
error as there was abundant material amounting to special circumstances.<p>
	<p>
	I must say that that appears to me to be the case, and I shall turn to that
material in a moment.  The learned sentencing judge
is most experienced in the
criminal law and, even if his Honour had considered special circumstances and
rejected them, it is a little
surprising that no reference at all was made to
the issue.  The explanation may well be that counsel then appearing for the
applicant
made no reference to it in submissions.<p>
	<p>
	The material referred to by Mr Strickland, said to be capable of amounting to
special circumstances, is the combination of the following
matters.  Firstly,
the sentences imposed by his Honour were made cumulative upon an existing
minimum term imposed at Waverley Local
Court in August 1995.  That of itself is
not a matter of great significance.  By the time his Honour came to sentence
the applicant
there was but five months of that minimum term to run, and the
additional term thereafter was for only four months.  Nonetheless
it was a
matter properly to be regarded within the principles expressed by the Court in
<b><i>Simpson</i></b> (1992) 61 A Crim R at 58.<p>
	<p>
	Secondly, and more importantly, there was the evidence of the applicant's
recent steps towards rehabilitation against the background
of his unfortunate
upbringing and drug-affected lifestyle.  Those steps embraced the efforts made
outside the prison system to which
I have referred, together with his
submitting himself to the methadone program since being back in custody. There
is every reason
to accept the genuineness of those efforts, particularly in the
light of his full admissions of his criminality to the police, and
a rather
telling statement in the course of his recorded interview with the police in
which he said of the matters he had admitted:<p>
"I am just glad that they are sorted out today and they can't - don't come back
to haunt me."<p>
<p>
	Allied to the need to foster his rehabilitation is the fact that his criminal
record shows that, since the later 1980s, a very large
proportion of his time
has been spent in custody.  For that reason alone, it does appear that he would
need a longer than usual period
of supervision upon his release; see<i>
<b>Phelan</b></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2066%20A%20Crim%20R%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 66 A Crim R 446</a> at 449.  <p>
	<p>
	As I have said, I, for my part, find the totality of this material compelling,
such that in my view a proper exercise of discretion
required a departure from
the usual proportion between minimum and additional terms, so as to provide a
longer than usual additional
term.<p>
	<p>
	In the event that this Court decided to intervene, we have received in
evidence some additional material by way of certificates,
from which it appears
that the applicant has continued to involve himself in drug rehabilitation by
his participation in a drug and
alcohol program and has worked within the
prison system in such a way as to earn commendation.  Reference was also made
from the
Bar table to the fact that the applicant may be looking forward to a
period on protection, for reasons which I need not elaborate.<p>
<p>
	Taking all those matters into account, the orders I would propose are as
follows:  that leave be granted and the appeal allowed;
 that the sentence
imposed in the District Court be quashed;  that in respect of each of the
matters on the indictment, and taking
into account the matters on the Form 2
document, the applicant be sentenced to concurrent terms of five years and four
months penal
servitude, comprising a minimum term of three years to date from
28 August 1996 and to expire on 27 August 1999, and an additional
term of two
years and four months to commence on 28 August 1999 and to expire on 27
December 2001. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SIMPSON J:</b>  I agree.  The orders of the Court will be as proposed by
Hidden J.<p>
