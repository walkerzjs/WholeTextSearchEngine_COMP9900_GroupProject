<P>

<b><u>ON SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<P>

1  	Before the Court for sentence this morning are two prisoners,
Benjamin Bruce Andrew and Peter Clive Basil Kane. Both have been
found guilty,
the former of manslaughter and the latter of murder, in connection with the
death of one, Wayne George Tonks ["the
victim"].
<P>

2  	The prisoner Andrew was brought to trial on 19 April 1999. He was
presented for trial upon an indictment charging that he had
murdered, on 19 May
1990 and at Artarmon, the victim. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to that
charge and he was put, accordingly,
upon trial by jury. The trial continued
until 30 April 1999, on which day the jury returned a verdict finding the
prisoner not guilty
of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The jury appended to
that verdict a recommendation for leniency. The prisoner was remanded,
thereupon, in custody until 4 June last, on which day evidence and submissions
in connection with sentence were heard. The prisoner
was further remanded
thereafter until this morning for sentence.
<P>

3  	The prisoner Kane was brought to trial on 3 May 1999. He, too,
was presented for trial upon an indictment charging him with
having murdered,
on 19 May 1990 and at Artarmon, the victim. He, too, pleaded not guilty and was
put, accordingly, upon trial by
jury. That trial continued until 18 May, on
which day the jury returned a verdict finding the prisoner guilty of murder as
charged
in the indictment. The prisoner was remanded, thereupon, until 4 June,
and in the expectation that any evidence and submissions in
connection with his
sentencing could be entertained simultaneously with those of the prisoner
Andrew. As it happened, the prisoner's
case on sentence was not ready to
proceed on 4 June; and he was remanded until 25 June on the basis that all
necessary evidence and
submissions as to sentence would be received by the
Court on that occasion, and so as to allow of his being sentenced this morning
in company with the prisoner Andrew.
<P>

4  	Whatever else can be said about the death of the victim, it can
be said at once that the death was the ultimate outcome of a
joint enterprise
to which each of the two prisoners was a party. That being the case, the Crown
had originally intended to bring
the two prisoners jointly to trial. The
prisoner Andrew made, however, an application for a separate trial; and, in
circumstances
of which it will be necessary to say presently something more
extended, an order was made for the separate trial of each of the two
prisoners.
<P>

5  	The separation of the two trials, whatever might be said about it
in terms of bare legal theory, has resulted in a succession
of serious
practical problems. For reasons which will become apparent later herein, the
Crown sought to call each prisoner in the
trial of the other. This gave rise to
some very difficult practical problems, of which it is not necessary to say now
anything more
than is said in the various interlocutory judgments dealing with
those problems at the times at which they variously arose.
<P>

6  	As is obvious from what has already been said, the separation of
the two trials has resulted in fact in the return by two different
juries of
two different verdicts which, if not inconsistent in a narrow and pedantic
legal sense, are certainly incompatible in a
broad and practical sense; and
nowhere more so than in connection with the present sentencing exercises. 
<P>

7  	The practical consequences of the separation of the trials of the
two prisoners have been, and continue to be for present purposes,
such as to
justify some further comment this morning.
<P>

<b><u>The Separation of the Trials of the Prisoners</u></b>
<P>

8  	On 26 March last the joint trial, then pending, of the two
prisoners was listed for mention. Mr. Thompson of Queen's Counsel
appeared for
the Crown, as he continued to do throughout the two subsequent trials. The
prisoner Andrew was represented by his solicitor.
The prisoner Kane appeared in
person and unrepresented, he then being in the course of negotiating with the
Legal Aid Commission
for the grant to him of legal aid in connection with his
own representation at trial. The expected joint trial was re-listed, therefore,
for further mention on 29 March. 
<P>

9  	On 29 March, the prisoner Andrew was represented, once again, by
his solicitor; and the prisoner Kane appeared, once again,
in person. The Court
was informed that legal aid for the trial of the prisoner Kane had been
approved; and that a particular solicitor
and a particular senior counsel had
been assigned to the matter. The proposed joint trial of the two prisoners was
then set for 12
April, subject to the completion on or before 9 April of the
trial then in progress in the Court.
<P>

10  	On 9 April, the pending joint trial was again mentioned, and an
application was made by the prisoner Andrew for a separate
trial. In addition
to the Crown Prosecutor, there were present on that occasion Mr. Byrne of
Senior Counsel representing the prisoner
Andrew; and Mr. Barnett of Counsel
representing the prisoner Kane. The Court was informed that there was agreement
between the Crown
and the prisoners that there should be separate trials. An
order was made  accordingly, and without any further and extended inquiry
by
the Court into the appropriateness or otherwise of there being separate
trials.
<P>

11  	It is, of course, trite that there is no vision quite like the
vision of hindsight; but I have to say that, with the benefit
of hindsight, I
think that these trials ought not to have been separated. I acknowledge the
wisdom of the proverbial advice that
there is no useful purpose to be served in
crying over spilled milk; but I am mindful, also, of the wisdom of the well
known observation
of Oliver Wendell Holmes J of the United States Supreme Court
that: <i>"The life of the law has not been logic. The life of the law has been
experience"</i>. It is in the spirit of that latter observation that I make the
further observations that follow.
<P>

12  	The basic principles governing the separation of the trial of
two or more co-accused are well established. They are stated
succinctly and as
follows in the judgment of Hunt J (as he then was) in <b>Regina v Middis</b>
(unreported: Court of Criminal Appeal; 27 March 1991):
<P>

	"Briefly, the relevant principles are that:
<P>

	1.	Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is
significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against
another or
the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and
<P>

	2.	Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly
prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible
against him; and
<P>

	3.	Where there is real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant
will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the
prejudicial material;
<P>

 a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against
the applicant. The applicant must show that positive
injustice would be caused
to him in a joint trial."
<P>

13  	The principles thus stated have been expressly approved and
followed in two recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal:
<b>Regina v
Fernando and anor.</b> (unreported: Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 April 1999);
and <b>Regina v Georgiou</b> (unreported: Court of Criminal Appeal, 25 May
1999). The joint judgment in <b>Fernando and anor.</b> contains, at pages
99-104 inclusive, a most helpful resum&eacute; and analysis of the principal
authorities on the topic. One of
the authorities to which reference is made in
<b>Fernando and anor.</b> is <b>Regina v Beavan</b> 69WN (NSW) 141. There, the
Court of Criminal Appeal takes up, with evident approval, the following excerpt
from the judgment of Herron
J (as he then was); which excerpt I now reproduce
because it has a particular practical relevance to the events that have
happened
in the separate trials of the present prisoners:
<P>

"If separate trials were had, very often only one half of the picture could be
presented to the jury. In order to do complete justice,
juries are entitled to
see and hear all those who are alleged to have acted in common purpose, and it
is neither a rule of law nor
of practice that where an essential part of one
accused's defence amounts to an attack on a co-accused, there must be separate
trials.
Cases have occurred and will no doubt continue to occur in which one
accused says that he or she was persuaded by the superior intellect
of the
other accused to take some part in the enterprise, or that he or she was
intimidated by the relationship or threats of that
other. It is essential to
the proper appreciation of such cases that the jury should see and hear all
parties. It is true that statements
not on oath can be prejudicial to the one
referred to in them, but as they are not statements on oath the jury can be
warned by the
trial judge to reject those references to the co-accused, and
there is no reason to think that a common sense jury will refuse to
follow such
advice."
<P>

14  	It is true that the particular observations made in the closing
sentence of the foregoing excerpt must be understood in the
context of the law
of evidence as it stood at the time at which Herron J was speaking; that law
then permitting an accused person
to make an unsworn statement from the dock, a
procedure no longer available under the law of this State. It remains the case,
in
my opinion, that the logical thrust of what was said by Herron J remains as
valid now as it was then. I read to that same effect
the relevant passages in
the joint judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>Fernando and
anor.</b>.
<P>

15  	As will be seen presently, the versions given at their
respective trials by the two prisoners of what had actually been the
sequence
of events leading up to the killing of the victim were as different as the
proverbial chalk and cheese. It is possible that
both such versions are, at
least in part, untruthful. What is beyond any rational dispute is that both of
those versions cannot possibly
be truthful. Had the Court been aware, when
dealing with the application for separate trials, that such was the case, then,
hindsight
or no hindsight, I very much doubt whether it could have been
demonstrated that the proper application of the principles to which
I have
earlier referred made it appropriate to order separate trials.
<P>

16  	I do not make that observation in the sense of accusing, of
criticising or of recriminating. I speak, rather, in the interest
of ensuring
that other trial Judges are aware of, and are put upon their proper guard by,
the experience of this Court in the present
two matters. What has happened in
the present cases teaches that an order separating trials should rarely, if
ever, be made upon
the basis of the consent of all interested parties and
nothing more; but should be made, if at all, only after any particular
applicant
for a separate trial has shown cause, in a precise and positive
fashion, for the making of such an order.
<P>

<b><u>Facts Common to the Cases of the Two Prisoners</u></b>
<P>

17  	The victim was, at the time of his death, a school teacher in
the State service. He was attached to the staff of Cleveland
Street High
School, where he was an assistant teacher in the Social Science Department. He
seems to have been in good standing, personally
and professionally, with his
peers. 
<P>

18  	On Monday 21 May 1990 the victim did not appear for duty at
school. This was uncharacteristic; and, in due course, his superiors
reported
the fact to the police and asked for inquiries to be made by the police. Those
inquiries took the police to the home of
the victim which was a home unit
numbered 1 in premises at 17 Hampden Road, Artarmon. The unit was a fairly
conventional 2-bedroom
suburban home unit in a fairly conventional suburban
home unit block. The investigating police officers, unable to rouse anybody
in
the unit, gained entry to it. They found the victim lying face-down on the
floor of the lounge-dining area of the unit. He was
lightly dressed in casual
clothing. His ankles and knees had been lashed tightly together with lengths of
industrial-strength masking
tape, which was a vivid green in colour. His hands
had been secured behind his back. They were not so much bound as encased in the
same kind of masking tape. Fitted over his head was a white, opaque, plastic
shopping bag. The bag had been pulled down over the
head so that the sealed
bottom of the bag was at the top of the head, and the mouth of the bag was at
the victim's throat. Further
lengths of the masking tape had been used so as to
seal off the mouth of the bag. A preliminary inspection of the unit showed that
it was in a state of disarray such as might have been caused by the ransacking
of the unit by some burglar or burglars.
<P>

19  	When the bag was removed from the victim's head, it was found to
contain an accumulated quantity of blood. I am satisfied beyond
reasonable
doubt that such accumulated blood came from a wound which had been inflicted to
the rear of the victim's head. The wound
was curvilinear in shape; it was 47 mm
in length. It was a blunt force injury; and the blow which caused it had been
struck with
a force sufficient to cause a small area of bruising on the
under-surface of the brain on the left side and on the right side. There
was
not, however, any fracturing of the victim's skull.
<P>

20  	The removal of the shopping bag from the victim's head
disclosed, also, that the victim's eyes had been tightly blind-folded
with
further lengths of the green industrial-strength masking tape; and that his
mouth had been tightly gagged in the same way. The
gagging had not been done in
such a fashion as to obstruct the victim's nostrils. The lengths of masking
tape which had been used
to seal the mouth of the shopping bag had been applied
tightly, but not with such a tightness as to cause any kind of strangulation.
The undisputed medical evidence was that the primary cause of death was
suffocation.
<P>

21  	Fingerprints, not those of the dead man, were found on a
drinking glass which was standing on an occasional table not far from
the body;
and on the surface of some of the masking tape. The investigating police were
unable to match the fingerprints with any
known fingerprints stored in the
relevant police records. There were no other clues to the identity of any
assailant; and in due
course the police investigation was terminated without
the identification of any assailant having been made. 
<P>

22  	Some time during 1992 the prisoner Kane met, and developed a
relationship with, a young woman named Bedelia Unger. They began
to live
together; and eventually, and in January 1994, they married. The prisoner
Andrew was best man at the wedding; he and the
prisoner Kane having been close
personal friends since their secondary-school days. 
<P>

23  	The prisoner Kane told his wife, - (who prefers to be known as
Bedelia Dali, by which name I shall hereafter refer to her),
- that he and the
prisoner Andrew had been involved in the death of the late Mr. Tonks. Bedelia
Dali made no use of that information
until 1997, and at a time when her
marriage with the prisoner Kane had broken down in circumstances of great and
mutual animosity.
<P>

24  	In 1997 Bedelia Dali disclosed to the police what she had been
told by her husband. The police investigation into the death
of the late Mr.
Tonks was thereupon re-opened; and it led, in due course, to the arrest and
charging of the two prisoners.
<P>

25  	During each of the separated trials, evidence was given by Mr.
Malcolm Smith. Mr. Smith was formerly a Detective Sergeant of
Police in the New
South Wales Police Service; and he was, as such, the officer in effective
charge of the investigations, both original
and resumed, into the death of the
late Mr. Tonks. In connection with the original investigations into that death,
Mr. Smith was
instrumental in preparing a detailed brief of evidence for
presentation to the Coroner at an inquest conducted, eventually, in October
1993. That brief of evidence encompassed, among other things, the results of
extensive inquiries which Mr. Smith had made into the
personal background and
lifestyle of the dead man. Extensive use was made of this material in the
cross-examination of Mr. Smith
at the trial of the prisoner Andrew; and a
broadly similar, although much less detailed, use was made of the material in
Mr. Smith's
cross-examination in the separate trial of the prisoner Kane.
<P>

26  	This material established that the late Mr. Tonks pursued a
clandestine but active homosexual lifestyle. He had a particular
homosexual
attraction towards teen-aged boys and young men. He actively sought out
homosexual encounters with such partners, doing
so by a number of methods of
which one was to solicit, in effect, by leaving appropriate invitations and
personal details inscribed
on the walls of public toilets. The evidence did not
suggest that the late Mr. Tonks was a man given to gratuitous, or indeed any,
physical violence; or that his normal method of operation involved his acting
jointly with other persons in connection with the setting
up of homosexual
encounters. 
<P>

27  	In connection with this material respecting the dead man's
personal sexuality and lifestyle, it is appropriate, I think, to
make some
observations common to both of the present cases. 
<P>

28  	Mr. Smith was, in my opinion, a very impressive witness. For my
own part, I would not hesitate to accept the evidence that
he gave in each
trial. That entails that I would not hesitate to accept that his investigations
did in fact yield information of
the kind to which his evidence referred; that
the information came from people who identified themselves as close personal
friends
of the dead man; and that the information was such as might reasonably
be accepted as generally reliable. It is, however, important
to understand that
the whole of this body of material, extremely damaging as it inevitably was in
its illumination of the character
and lifestyle of the dead man, was hearsay
evidence. The Court had, of course, no way at all of having any idea of what
the late
Mr. Tonks himself might have wished to say about the information thus
provided about him by others. More importantly, the relevant
operation of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</b> made Mr. Smith's evidence of that hearsay
information admissible, notwithstanding that none of the informants was tested
by cross-examination,
either in the presence of the jury or at all. 
<P>

29  	These considerations seem to me to have a real significance in
connection with the question of the objective criminality of
the killing of the
late Mr. Tonks. It could scarcely be doubted that there are many people, - and,
more probably than not, a clear
majority, of people, - in contemporary
Australian society for whom the kind of lifestyle that the late Mr. Tonks is
shown to have
followed would be morally reprehensible, physically repellent and
socially subversive. All the more reason to emphasise in the strongest
and most
uncompromising terms that a person who follows that lifestyle, even if that
lifestyle entails the committing of serious
criminal offences, does not become
on that account an outlaw whose life is simply forfeit to anybody who feels
strongly enough to
take it in fact. The paramount purpose of the rule of law is
to uphold in principle and to shield in practice the absolute and fundamental
sanctity of human life: all human life.
<P>

30  	There are some further things to be said about the objective
criminality of the killing of the late Mr. Tonks; and it is appropriate
to say
them now because they are equally significant in each of the two present cases.

<P>

31  	Because of the starkness of the contrast between the versions of
relevant facts given respectively by the two prisoners, it
is not possible to
make a positive finding of fact, reached beyond reasonable doubt, as to exactly
which of the prisoners did exactly
what at each and every stage of the events
that took place in the dead man's unit on the evening of 19 May 1990. I am,
however, satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that the following findings, at
least, can properly be made:
<P>

(1)	That the two prisoners went in company to the unit on the evening in
question; were in every effective sense in company throughout
the events that
thereafter took place; and left the unit together at the end of those
events.
<P>

(2)	That they went to the unit looking for trouble. It is true that there is a
stark contrast between the kind of trouble that they
say, in their respective
versions, they were expecting. The prisoner Andrew says that he went to the
unit for the purpose of verbally
abusing the victim in connection with a sexual
assault previously committed by the victim upon the prisoner; a version of
events
of which it will be necessary to say something more in due course. The
prisoner Kane's version is that his objective in going to
the unit had a
similar genesis, but had the rather different purpose of, in his own words,
<i>"kicking the shit out of"</i> the victim. Be all that as it may, I have, as
I have said, not the slightest doubt that both of the prisoners went to the
unit spoiling
for a fight. The proposition advanced by the prisoner Andrew, the
effect of which is that he intended to have a civilized conversational
exchange
with a man who had previously committed a serious, unprovoked and unwelcome
sexual assault upon him a short time previously,
and then simply go on his way
without further ado, is not, in my opinion, a reasonable possibility, and I
reject it.
<P>

(3)	That both prisoners went to the unit armed with a mini-baseball bat and a
quantity of masking tape previously herein described.
They carried the baseball
bat in the white opaque plastic shopping bag that was later found secured over
the head of the dead man.
<P>

(4)	That the first violence actually done to the victim involved the striking
of his head with the mini-baseball bat, and so as
to inflict the head wound
earlier described. The prisoner Kane says that he struck the blow. The prisoner
Andrew says that he struck
the blow. It does not seem to me to matter which of
them it was who actually did the deed. One of them certainly struck the blow.
The other was, equally certainly in my opinion, present when the blow was
struck and concurring in that assault. At the trial of
the prisoner Andrew, it
was argued that he struck the blow partially in self-defence, and partially as
a result of provocation offered
to him by the conduct of the victim. I shall
say something about these matters at the appropriate later time in the present
remarks
on sentence; but I can indicate at once that I reject, as the jury
clearly did reject, any suggestion of self-defence; and I reject
as readily any
suggested provocation justifying this particular assault.
<P>

(5)	That, although it is not clear whether the blow to the victim's head
actually rendered him unconscious; it is clear beyond any
reasonable doubt that
it so affected him that he fell, effectively stunned, to the floor. Thereafter
he was bound hand and foot,
and was gagged and blind-folded, with lengths of
the masking tape which I have earlier described. Once again, there is
contradiction
between the respective versions of the two prisoners as to
exactly who did exactly what in connection with this handling of the victim.
Once again, it does not seem to me to matter greatly which of them it was who
actually applied this or that length of the restraining
tape. What is, in my
opinion, clear beyond any reasonable doubt is that one or other of them, if not
indeed in some instances both
of them, applied the bindings; and that, insofar
as one only of them did the actual binding, the other was in every requisite
legal
sense present and assenting to what was being done. 
<P>

(6)	That the condition of the victim, prior to the placing of the plastic bag
over his head, was such that he was, in every practical
sense, absolutely
helpless. He could not move; he could not cry out for help; he could not see
anything that was thereafter happening
to or around him. More importantly, he
could breathe only through his nose. It is true that the prisoners were at the
time aged a
little more than 16 years; but they were not mere children, and
they were certainly not so uninformed as not to understand, as a
matter of
elementary common sense to put the point no higher, that to bag the victim's
head in the way that was done would necessarily
entail that, unless somebody
chanced upon him very quickly thereafter and removed the bag, he could easily
suffocate to death. 
<P>

(7)	That the plastic shopping bag must have been fitted over the dead man's
head by, at the very least, one or other of the two
prisoners. The lengths of
masking tape by means of which the mouth of the bag was thereafter tightly
secured, also must have been
put in place, to say the very least, by one or
other of the two prisoners. The prisoner Andrew says that he saw the prisoner
Kane
in the act of drawing the bag over the dead man's head; but that he did
not ever see the masking tape, either while it was being
wound around the mouth
of the bag and the neck of the victim, or after that action had been completed.
The prisoner Kane says that
he did not have anything to do with the positioning
of the bag over the head of the dead man, or with its subsequent sealing by the
use of the masking tape. He says that he does not know who did either of those
things.
<P>

	So far as concerns the prisoner Andrew, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
that, if it be the case that he is telling the truth
when he says that he saw
the prisoner Kane put the bag in position on the head, then he knew when he
left the unit in company with
the prisoner Kane that the bag was then in
position, fitted over the victim's head. On his own admission he left the unit
through
the front door. The front door was no great distance from the position
in which the victim had been finally left. That final condition
of the victim
is graphically illustrated in the photograph numbered 17 and forming part of
Exhibit E in the trial of the prisoner
Kane. Even if it be the case that the
prisoner Andrew did not notice the vivid green masking tape in position around
the mouth of
the bag, - a matter that I regard as highly improbable but am not
prepared to reject as a reasonable possibility, - he cannot have
failed, in my
opinion, to have noticed the bag itself closely fitted over the victim's head.
I have no doubt that he did see it,
and that he was simply content to leave the
bag in place. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, even if the bag had
not been
taped into position, its having been fitted over the head of the
victim in his then condition brought into being a state of affairs
that was, to
say the very least, seriously life-threatening, and obviously so even to a 16
year old boy who had the then nerve, determination
and intelligence of the
prisoner Andrew.
<P>

	So far as concerns the prisoner Kane, I simply do not believe him in his
assertion that he does not know how the bag came to be
positioned over the dead
man's head and to be thereafter taped with the masking tape. I am satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that
either he did it himself; or that he was in every
requisite legal sense present and assenting when it was done.
<P>

(8)	That, having dealt with the victim in the way previously described, and
having vandalised his unit, the prisoners then went
on their way. They did
absolutely nothing to give any warning of any kind to anybody of the then
condition of their victim. In that
regard it is not necessary to postulate
anything that is in any way extravagant or inculpatory. A simple and anonymous
"000" phone
call from a public telephone box would have done all that was
necessary in order to have ensured that some help got to the victim
before he
suffocated to death. The best view of their behaviour is that they simply went
on their way uncaring about what might be
the fate of the victim whom they had
left in so parlous a condition.
<P>

32  	It has been submitted on behalf of both prisoners that the
crimes of which they have been respectively found guilty cannot
properly be
characterised as being in the respective worst case category. Once again, the
basic principles are not in doubt. They
are expounded conveniently in the
judgment of Badgery-Parker J speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in
<b>Regina v Twala</b> (unreported) 4 November 1994. His Honour says:
<P>

"However, in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case
category, it must be possible to point to particular features
which are of very
great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts
mitigating the seriousness of the crime
(as distinct from subjective features
mitigating the penalty to be imposed)."
<P>

33  	I have no doubt that the common objective facts as I have
previously been discussing them are, without more, sufficient to
establish
<i>"particular features which are of very great heinousness"</i>. Everything
that was done to the victim was done deliberately. Everything that was done
with that deliberation involved either violence
or cruelty or both. To have
left the victim even as he was before the bag was put over his head had about
it, as I am satisfied,
more than just a touch of a savagely vengeful pleasure.
To have gone on thereafter to put the plastic bag over the victim's head
even
without the taping, - and <i>a fortiori</i> with the taping, - was, in my
opinion, to have acted either with a brutally vengeful deliberation, or with a
callously vengeful indifference.

<P>

34  	As to whether it is <i>"possible to postulate the absence of
facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime",</i> much depends on what
further findings as to the relevant objective facts can properly be made in the
individual case of each prisoner
when the facts particular to that prisoner's
case are considered in addition to the facts common to both cases. It is to
that differentiated
examination that I next turn.
<P>

<b><u>Facts Particular to the Case of the Prisoner Andrew</u></b>
<P>

35  	The prisoner gave extensive sworn evidence at his trial. His
version of relevant events, as thus put forward, was broadly as
follows.
<P>

36  	In May 1990 he was aged 16 years and some 2 months. He was
enrolled as a boarder at St. Gregory's College, Campbelltown. His
family life
was unsettled, his parents having separated when he was about 9 years of age,
and having subsequently divorced. His mother
had re-married and was living with
her husband and their young children at Castlecrag, where the prisoner used to
visit regularly
for his school holidays; and where he was in fact visiting on
holiday at the times now material. He had at Castlecrag self-contained
accommodation of a kind that enabled him to come and go with as much
independence and privacy as he wished. He was not happy in his
boarding school
environment.
<P>

37  	That unhappiness was due, in no small part, to the taunting of
his peers at school. The taunting was to the effect that the
prisoner was
homosexual. He himself was unsure at that time of his sexual orientation;
although he had feelings and attractions which
had caused him to think that he
might be, indeed, homosexual.
<P>

38  	According to the prisoner, he felt that there was nobody in his
immediate family or circle of friends in whom he could confide
about such a
personal matter. He cast about, therefore, for some way of meeting a homosexual
man to whom he might explain, and from
whom he might get some useful counsel
concerning, his sexuality. To that end, and while using a public toilet outside
the Stanton
Library at North Sydney, which library he had been visiting, the
prisoner saw and noted a message written on the internal wall of
the toilet.
The message was, in effect, an open solicitation of homosexual encounters. The
message had been put there by the late
Mr. Tonks.
<P>

39  	By a process of reasoning which is not clear to me from the
available evidence, the prisoner apparently decided that this was
the contact
for which he had been looking. To that end he telephoned the number written on
the wall and found himself speaking to
Mr. Tonks. The telephone call was made
at about 2.15 a.m. and from a public telephone box situated not far from the
prisoner's home
at Castlecrag. The telephone call resulted in an arrangement
that the two of them would meet, there and then, at Artarmon. The prisoner
travelled, accordingly, to Artarmon; made the arranged contact with Mr. Tonks;
and accompanied him back to his unit at 17 Hampden
Road, Artarmon. At the unit
the two of them began to engage in conversation; Mr. Tonks offering, and the
prisoner accepting and consuming,
a number of strong alcoholic drinks. As I
have followed the prisoner's evidence, the cumulative effect of the drinks did
not completely
stupefy him, but did retard to some extent his responses and
reactions.
<P>

40  	After a time Mr. Tonks suggested that the two of them watch a
video, and they did so. The video in question was an explicitly
pornographic
homosexual video. As the video played, and time passed, Mr. Tonks began to
touch the prisoner in a sexually suggestive
kind of way, the prisoner
resisting, according to his version, all such advances.
<P>

41  	After a further time had passed, Mr. Tonks suggested to the
prisoner that he, Tonks, give the prisoner a massage. The prisoner
agreed; and
what followed, according to the prisoner's version, was a sequence of events
moving from the removal of portion of his
clothing and the massaging of his
back; to the removal of most of the remainder of his clothing and an extension,
with palpable sexual
overtones, of the massaging; and, finally, to the removal
of what remained of his clothing and the rapid escalation of the massaging
into
a fully blown sexual assault entailing in rapid succession two acts of actual
or attempted, (the evidence on the point is not
entirely clear), anal
penetration. The prisoner asserts that he protested against these culminating
sexual acts; but that he was,
effectively, powerless to prevent them. 
<P>

42  	According to the prisoner, he was revolted by this unexpected
and unwelcome course of events. He said that he remembered being:
<i>"cold -
icy towards him, as I got dressed, and no I don't remember saying anything to
him, really .......... </i>(and)<i>.......... I don't think he did say anything
to me as I was leaving"</i>. The prisoner expressed as follows his feelings at
the conclusion of this particular encounter with Mr. Tonks:
<P>

"I was just devastated that he had treated me the way he did and that I - I
really wanted to talk to another gay person about the
struggle that it was to
be a young gay man in the first place and I just felt - I couldn't believe that
I had allowed myself to be
put in a situation where this could happen to
me."
<P>

43  	In the immediate aftermath of these events, the prisoner noticed
some rectal bleeding; and somewhat later, and after he had
returned to school,
he noticed periodic penile discharges of what looked like contaminated
material. The prisoner described his reaction
in these terms: <i>"I was furious
and I wanted to confront Mr. Tonks about what he had done to me"</i>. The
confrontation that he thus envisaged he described in these words: <i>"I wanted
to have it out with Mr. Tonks and let him know that what he had done to my body
was not acceptable"</i>. This description was further expanded in these
immediately following questions and answers:
<P>

"Q.	At this stage did you feel any anger towards Mr. Tonks?
<P>

A.	Yes I did.
<P>

Q.	When you say you wanted to have it out with him, what did you envisage that
would involve?
<P>

A.	I wanted to let Mr. Tonks know that what he had done to me was not
acceptable and that he had betrayed, you know, the trust that
I had in going to
this gay man to discuss my sexuality with him.
<P>

Q.	Did you talk to Peter Kane about what you would do when you got there?
<P>

A.	We spoke about what we would do when we went there and that was that I would
verbally abuse the man and, if necessary, I would
hit him.
<P>

Q.	When you say if necessary you would hit him what would make it necessary for
you to hit him?
<P>

A.	Well, if he tried what he did on the first occasion, I was prepared to
protect myself against him.
<P>

Q.	Did you take anything with you?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	When you went to the unit?
<P>

A.	Yes we did.
<P>

Q.	What was that?
<P>

A.	We took a small baseball bat, like a mini baseball bat, and some industrial
tape.
<P>

Q.	Why did you take those things?
<P>

A.	We took those things in case Mr. Tonks was going to try what he did the
first time and they would prevent him from doing so."
<P>

44  	And so, in company with Peter Kane, the prisoner did in fact
return on the evening of 19 May 1999 to the unit at Hampden Road,
Artarmon. He
spoke, initially, to Mr. Tonks via the intercom connection. He told Mr. Tonks
that he wanted to see him, and that he
was accompanied by a friend. Mr. Tonks
initially demurred about admitting the two of them; but was persuaded by the
prisoner that
it was safe for him to do so.
<P>

45  	What then ensued is described as follows by the accused in his
evidence:
<P>

"Q.	Sorry, you said you remember having to bargain with him I think you
said?
<P>

A.	Yes. I said `I've got a friend with me. I want to chat' And eventually he
did let us in and we arrived in - we walked into the
unit and sat down on the
lounge and he offered us a drink straight away and sat, and then he sat down
with us and ........
<P>

Q.	....... Before you go on, what sort of drink was it?
<P>

A.	I think it was Scotch and Coke or bourbon and Coke.
<P>

Q.	Did you have a drink?
<P>

A.	I didn't consume what he poured for me and nor did Peter. But he had a
drink. And I said to him `Wayne, I want to talk to you
about what happened when
I was here'. And he got up and said `Oh, don't worry about that, let's watch a
movie'. He brushed it off.
He didn't want to discuss it.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
<P>

Q.	When you said to him: `I want to talk about what's happened', did you say
that in a particular tone of voice or in a certain
way?
<P>

A.	Yeah. I said it in a firm way. He knew - he knew what I meant. 
<P>

Q.	You say that you took it as being brushed off when he said `Don't worry
about that'. In what way did he say that?
<P>

A.	He said, ` Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it'.
<P>

Q.	What happened then?
<P>

A.	Then, he said, `Let's watch a movie'. And he was standing up when he said
`Don't worry about that, don't worry about that', and
he got up and put on a
porno. And I just stood up and said `I can't believe you. I can't believe you',
and I started to hit him.
<P>

Q.	What did you hit him with?
<P>

A.	I hit him with the mini baseball bat.
<P>

Q.	Whereabouts?
<P>

A.	On the head. 
<P>

Q.	Did you see what happened to him as a result of you hitting him?
<P>

A.	He was shocked. He was stunned.
<P>

Q.	Was he injured in any way?
<P>

A.	Yes; I think he started bleeding.
<P>

Q.	Why did you hit him the way you did?
<P>

A.	Because I was there for a serious reason and he had brushed me off and
decided that it was all okay; that it was all okay not
to be discussed, and he
had the audacity to get up and put on a porno.
<P>

Q.	What did you think, when he put on the pornographic movie, was going to
happen?
<P>

A.	Well, that he was playing his game of, you know, trying to - trying to get
sex to happen again."
<P>

46  	The prisoner then went on, in his evidence, to describe how he
had at once fallen upon the stunned and prostrate Mr. Tonks
and bound him up in
the way previously described. The prisoner was careful in his evidence to make
the point that he had left the
nasal passages unobstructed so that his victim
could breathe. He went on to explain how he and the prisoner Kane had
thereafter gone
around the unit <i>"and messed it up"</i>. He gave as his
reason for that vandalism that he was <i>"venting my anger"</i>. 
<P>

47  	His attention was drawn to the plastic bag over the head of the
victim; and in that connection he gave the following evidence:
<P>

Q.	"Did you put that bag over his head?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	Do you know who did?
<P>

A.	Peter placed the bag over his head.
<P>

Q.	Did you see him do that?
<P>

A.	I saw Peter pull the bag on to Mr. Tonks' head.
<P>

Q.	Did you do anything when you saw Peter Kane do that?
<P>

A.	No I didn't.
<P>

Q.	Did you see whether Peter Kane did anything after he pulled the bag over Mr.
Tonks' head?
<P>

A.	No I didn't. I saw Peter pull the bag over his head.
<P>

Q.	Did you leave the unit after that?
<P>

A.	A short time after we did, yes.
<P>

Q.	Did you say anything to Peter Kane?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	What did you think when you saw the bag placed on Mr. Tonks' head?
<P>

A.	I thought Peter was just giving him the fright of his life.
<P>

Q.	Do you know that there was tape placed around Mr. Tonks' neck?
<P>

A.	I didn't. I didn't know that at the time.
<P>

Q.	Was there anything else that you did in the unit before you left the unit
that you remember?
<P>

A.	We couldn't get out of the unit. It was deadlocked and I took some time to
locate the keys to that deadlock, and when I did,
we left.
<P>

Q.	When you left the unit, did you think about Mr. Tonks?
<P>

A.	Yes I did.
<P>

Q.	What did you think?
<P>

A.	I thought that Mr. Tonks would wiggle his way out of the bag that I saw
placed on his head and I knew that if he did so, that
he would have been able
to survive.
<P>

Q.	Did you talk to anybody about the fact that he was left there in that state
as you knew it to be?
<P>

A.	No I didn't."
<P>

48  	It is obvious that a great deal turns for present purposes on
the view that the Court now takes of the foregoing version of
the prisoner.
This is no easy task: <i>first</i>, because, in the events that have happened,
the Court cannot but be conscious of the starkly different version given by the
prisoner
Kane in his separate trial; but the Court is required, nevertheless,
carefully and completely to set aside that knowledge, and to
deal with the
prisoner Andrew only upon the basis of the evidence available in his separate
case; <i>secondly</i>, because the assessment now to be made of the prisoner's
version of what took place on the second occasion is very much intertwined
with
the assessment now to be made of the prisoner's version of what occurred on the
first occasion; and <i>thirdly</i>, because an assessment of the prisoner's
version of what took place on that first occasion stands, in every effective
sense, alone.
The victim, who would presumably have had not a little to say
about both of his encounters with the prisoner, is forever silenced;
and there
is, as I see the fact, no evidence capable, on any realistic view, of
strengthening in a real and substantive way the version
given by the prisoner
about either of his two encounters with the victim. 
<P>

49  	The most useful starting point is, perhaps, to say that I am not
prepared to accept, simply and comprehensively, the version
given by the
prisoner in his evidence. That is so for the following reasons:
<P>

(1)	On 21 November 1990, or some six months after the fatal encounter in the
victim's unit, the prisoner went, in company with the
prisoner Kane, to the
Albion Street Centre in Sydney and there had himself tested for HIV. The
official of the Centre who dealt with
the prisoner gave evidence at the
prisoner's trial. I see no reason not to accept that evidence, and I do in fact
accept it.  According
to that evidence, the prisoner presented with signs of
depression. He was <i>"economical"</i> in what answers he gave to the questions
asked of him at the Centre. He did give, however, a version of what he said had
happened
to him, and had caused him to be apprehensive of having become
infected with the HIV virus. Conflating the relevant answers, that
version was
as follows:
<P>

"He told me that he had been taken to a unit somewhere and subjected to anal
penetration by two males. Two males took him blind-folded
to a unit where he
was raped, no condoms used. He indicated that they forced him to get drunk
first and also forced him to give them
oral sex which they also gave to
him."
<P>

	It is, of course, obvious that this version does not square at all with the
corresponding version given by the prisoner in his
evidence. So far as I can
see, there is no explanation given by the prisoner for that discrepancy. Once
the prisoner had decided
to give any kind of narrative explanation at all of
the relevant background, he could have given an abbreviated version of the
narrative
given by him in his evidence; and he could have done that, as it
seems to me, without any greater embarrassment, or invasion of his
privacy, or
disadvantage otherwise, than by giving the inconsistent version that he did in
fact give.
<P>

	No doubt, one swallow does not make a summer. I must say, however, that I find
this inconsistency inexplicable, and therefore troubling,
on the question of
credibility that I have now to resolve.
<P>

(2)	On 16 May 1997 the prisoner was arrested in Port Macquarie by two police
officers, Det.-Sgt. Yeomans and Det.-Snr. Constable
Powell. He was told that he
was under arrest in connection with the murder of the late Mr. Tonks. He was
properly cautioned. He responded
to the caution by saying that he understood
what he had been told; and that he would, voluntarily, talk to the police. He
told the
police that he did not wish his parents or anyone else to be present
with him at that time. He was told that he might use a telephone
at any time
and he indicated that he understood that advice. The prisoner was then taken to
the Port Macquarie Police Station and
interviewed by the two police officers,
principally by Det.-Sgt. Yeomans. The record of interview was not tendered at
the trial;
but there was produced and marked for identification 5 a transcript
embodying portions of the record of interview. It was agreed
that those
portions should be read to the jury; and that was in fact done.
<P>

	During the course of the interview, the prisoner falsely stated that he had no
knowledge of, or prior acquaintance with, Mr. Tonks;
that he had never been to
the premises at Artarmon; that he had never been sexually assaulted. He was
asked, thereafter, but still
during the course of the interview with the two
police officers, whether he would make available a set of fingerprints for
comparison
purposes. He was properly cautioned that he had no obligation to do
so. He agreed, nevertheless, to make his prints available; and
a set of
comparison prints was thereupon taken from him. The prints having been found to
match prints discovered on various items
at the victim's unit, the prisoner was
so informed and asked whether he could give any explanation of that fact. He
said, simply
<i>"No". </i>Normal and proper practice in connection with
ensuring the authenticity and the voluntariness of the interview was duly
completed,
eliciting no complaint of any kind from the prisoner in connection
with the way in which the interview had been conducted by the
investigating
police officers.
<P>

	The prisoner gave in chief the following evidence about these matters: 
<P>

"Q.	How did you feel at that stage, when the police had announced their
presence and the reasons they were there?
<P>

A.	Well it was a shock and I was scared but I wanted to talk to them about - I
wanted to cooperate with them.
<P>

Q.	You said, when you were interviewed by them, certain things that were
clearly not true - about your knowledge of that matter.
<P>

A.	That is right. 
<P>

Q.	Why did you say those things to them?
<P>

A.	Well I was scared - I was scared of them locking me up - sending me to gaol
right then."
<P>

	These answers were expanded somewhat, and as follows, in cross-examination"
<P>

"Q.	When the police came to speak to you many years later you said you would
talk with them and you would cooperate with them.
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	Indeed that is what you didn't do, isn't it?
<P>

A.	Well, I went with them and I gave them my fingerprints and was interviewed
by them but I felt really intimidated by the interview
and I answered `no' to
about 90 percent of the questions - no - meaning I didn't want to answer, and
eventually I had a lawyer come
down to the station and arranged my situation,
but I did go with the police and give them fingerprints and tried to cooperate
as
best I could on my own, feeling the way I did.
<P>

Q.	I suppose it was quite a shock to you that you left fingerprints behind -
the police told you on that day you were arrested?
<P>

A.	Not particularly.
<P>

Q.	You still did not confess to the police that you had been involved?
<P>

A.	Well -
<P>

Q.	With the killing of Mr. Tonks?
<P>

A.	Yes - when the police had my fingerprints they knew that my fingerprints
were found there and they matched them, so."
<P>

	No suggestion was made in the cross-examination of Det.-Sgt. Yeomans that the
prisoner had appeared to be intimidated; or that
it was plain from his answers
that whenever he responded in the negative to a particular question, he was
signifying, at least on
most of such occasions, that he did not wish to answer
the particular question; or that he did not wish to answer the question in
the
absence of his solicitor. There is not, so far as I can see, a scintilla of
evidence that supports the propositions of the prisoner
that: <i>"I felt really
intimidated by the interview and I answered no to about 90 percent of the
questions - no - meaning I didn't want to
answer"</i>. One could be forgiven
for thinking that those assertions were bare-faced and self-serving lies; but,
at the very least, they are,
in my opinion, intentionally misleading glosses of
the truth.
<P>

(3)	The Crown called at trial a Mr. Mario Ghezzi, who had been a school teacher
of the prisoner in 1990 and 1991. Mr. Ghezzi gave
evidence that in about
February of 1991 a group of boys from St. Gregory's, including the prisoner,
had gone with him to a retreat
in Bowral. Mr. Ghezzi agreed with a description,
put to him by the Crown Prosecutor, of such a retreat as being <i>"an occasion
for self-reflection and spiritual development"</i>. 
<P>

Mr. Ghezzi said that he had had occasion during the course of the retreat, to
reprimand the prisoner for some misbehaviour or other
and that the prisoner had
responded in a way best described by referring, as follows, to the actual
evidence:
<P>

"Q.	What did he say?
<P>

A.	Well I wasn't ready for this, I wasn't looking for this. I was chipping him
on his behaviour on the retreat and, as I recollect,
he turned around and said
something to the effect of `Well, if you think that's bad, I can tell you worse
things', and he began to
tell me the story. And I think it began with something
like `What if I told you that I had killed a man?', to which I think I said
something like `What do you mean? You have got to be kidding.', and this story
came out.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................
`It began when I was out on a boarder's free week-end, I met a man who took me
back to his place and did some things to me'. I can't
recall him being explicit
about the things done to him, but I gather that they were not pleasant. And he
said, `After that on another
week-end, I went back to his place with a
friend.'. Names were never mentioned. And he said that `We went back and
somehow met up
with the man again. Went back to his place. We had some drinks,
and then we did it'. And I think I said, `Well, what do you mean,
did it?'. He
said `Well, we got him for what he did to me', and, I mean, I wasn't asking for
details at this stage, but what I can
recollect is that in the conversation
about what happened, I think it was like strangulation or asphyxiation. I
remember somewhere
in that conversation `plastic bags' being mentioned; `tying
him up' and somewhere along the line, I don't know, a piggy bank smashed.
And
after this conversation - I mean, basically I was fairly stunned and I said
`Well, what would you do?' - I remember saying to
him `What would you do if I
went to the police with this story?', and he said `I would deny this
conversation had ever happened'.
And after that, I said `What do you want me to
do with that?', and he said `Nothing. It's just a story', and left it at
that."
<P>

	There was no challenge to the essential accuracy of Mr. Ghezzi's evidence. The
evidence is important, I think, in that it is related
to a time not very far
removed from the time of the killing; and it gives, therefore, a more reliable
impression than one might draw
from assessments made of his behaviour in 1997
and later years, of what he was actually like at and about the time of the
killing.
In that respect two things strike me as significant about the
prisoner's behaviour as described by Mr. Ghezzi: <i>first</i>, that the
prisoner was capable of displaying towards Mr. Ghezzi what I would describe as
a cool effrontery; and <i>secondly</i>, that the prisoner showed an equally
cool amorality about telling convenient lies. 
<P>

(4)	The accused was extensively cross-examined by the learned Crown Prosecutor.
Part of that cross-examination, - it is recorded
at pages 216-218 of the trial
transcript, - put successively to the prisoner the various stages, as he had
described them, of his
first encounter with the victim; and suggested, as to
each such stage, that the prisoner could have left at any time had he desired
to do so. The prisoner agreed that such had been the case, at least until the
stage was reached at which, as the prisoner described
the fact, he had first
been anally penetrated.
<P>

	This evidence was not, so far as I can see, altered by re-examination. The
importance of the evidence is, as I see it, that it
tends to cast a rather
different light than that suggested by the prisoner in his version in-chief,
upon what I might describe as
the momentum and atmosphere of the unfolding
events that took place on the occasion of the first encounter. I think that
this evidence
weakens, at least to some extent, the impression which the
prisoner sought to convey throughout the trial, namely, that the entire
first
encounter between him and Mr. Tonks had been, so to speak, entirely black and
white: on one hand, the young, naive school-boy
not seeing himself as having
any real choice about things going on around him, and which he did not really
understand; and on the
other hand, the experienced child molester riding
rough-shod over the obvious reticence and vulnerability of that school-boy.
<P>

50  	For those reasons, and as I have earlier said, I do not accept,
simply and comprehensively, the prisoner's version of the material
events. It
does not follow, however, that I simply and comprehensively reject them. The
findings of fact that are available to be
made now and beyond reasonable doubt
cannot be reached, as I see this case, upon so conveniently simplistic a
basis.
<P>

51  	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of, at least, the
following matters:
<P>

(1)	That there were in fact two encounters between the prisoner and the victim,
they being separated by a period in the order of
two or three weeks.
<P>

(2)	That the first encounter did involve gross sexual impropriety of some kind
or kinds on the part of the victim, who was after
all a man aged 40 or
thereabouts, towards the prisoner, then aged 16 years and 2 months.
<P>

(3)	That the encounter was the result of an initiative of the prisoner; and
that the prisoner chose to continue the encounter through
the whole of its
course and, at least, up until the first actual or attempted anal
penetration.
<P>

(4)	That the prisoner did in fact feel deeply aggrieved by the conduct of the
victim towards him on that first occasion.
<P>

(5)	That such sense of grievance festered in the mind of the prisoner for the
period, earlier mentioned, in the order of two or
three weeks, giving rise
eventually to a fixed determination on his part deliberately to seek out the
victim and, in some real and
substantial way, to avenge himself on the
victim.
<P>

(6)	That the intent of the prisoner when he returned on the second occasion, in
concert with the prisoner Kane, and as part of a
deliberate act worked out
between the two of them, did not so return with no intent other than verbally
to abuse the victim and then
to walk quietly away, satisfied that he had, so to
speak, evened the score.
<P>

(7)	That the intent of the prisoner when he returned on the second occasion was
to inflict some form of grievous bodily harm upon
the victim. I would not be
prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that there was a positive intent to
kill. Nor would I be prepared
to find beyond reasonable doubt that there was
any particularly formed intent as to the kind of grievous bodily harm that
might be
inflicted. What I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt to have been
the fact is that the prisoner's intent was, in a real and active
sense, to
avenge himself on the victim by inflicting upon the victim bodily injury
serious enough to expunge what the prisoner says
was his firm conviction that
he had been subjected to vile and degrading conduct wholly unprovoked by, and
wholly unwelcome to, him.
<P>

(8)	That the prisoner, when he saw his friend pull the plastic bag over the
victim's head, thought, as he himself said in his evidence,
that if the victim
could "<i>wiggle"</i> his head out of the bag, he would be unlikely to
suffocate. The prisoner did not say, of course, but I am satisfied beyond
reasonable
doubt that it followed from that appreciation of affairs that it was
present to the mind of the prisoner that the victim, if perchance
he could not
<i>"wiggle"</i> his head out of the bag, was very much at risk of suffocating;
and the prisoner was content, to say the very least, that the victim
should
remain exposed to that chance. And I am satisfied further, and beyond
reasonable doubt, that it was well present to the prisoner's
mind that the
victim's prospects of managing to <i>"wiggle"</i> his head out of the plastic
bag before he suffocated were, to say the very least, sharply and dangerously
reduced by the fact that
the victim was then lying face down, effectively
unable to move at all because of the way in which he had been trussed up, and
was
as well partially conscious at best because of the effects of the head
wound which the prisoner says he himself had inflicted.
<P>

52  	It is necessary, next, to come to a view as to how effect should
be given to those findings of fact. In that connection, it
is necessary to
consider with some care the implications of the verdict returned by the
jury.
<P>

53  	The central plank of the prisoner's case at trial was an
assertion that everything he had done to and towards the victim was
done in
self-defence. It is, I think, indisputable that the verdict of the jury entails
that the jury rejected that defence. In my
opinion, it was properly rejected;
and in so far as it is necessary for me to make a discrete finding of fact upon
the point, I too
would unhesitatingly reject it. I fail to see that the victim
did anything on the second occasion, - and bearing always in mind that
the
second occasion was some two to three weeks later than the first occasion, -
that could possibly cloak in self-defence the ugly
continuum of escalating
violence that was done to the victim, either by the prisoner himself, or by the
prisoner Kane with the requisite
presence and assent of the prisoner.
<P>

54  	Rejection of self-defence entails, in its turn, that the verdict
of manslaughter is explicable only upon either of two bases.
The first possible
basis is that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had
established all the material ingredients
of the crime of murder, but had not
established beyond reasonable doubt that the intended and relevant act or acts
of the prisoner
had not been done as a result of provocation.
<P>

55  	The second possible basis is that the jury was not satisfied
that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt the intent necessary
to
establish the crime of murder, but was satisfied that the Crown had proved
beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was guilty
of manslaughter by an
unlawful and dangerous act.
<P>

56  	The findings of fact that I have made, implemented in accordance
with the principles laid down by the decision of the Court
of Criminal Appeal
in <b>Regina v Isaacs </b> (1997) ACrimR 587, entail that I should treat the
verdict of manslaughter returned against this prisoner as having been so
returned
by reason of a finding by the jury that the Crown had not rebutted
beyond reasonable doubt suggested provocation; so that an offence
that would
have been, otherwise, culpable as murder, should be treated as an offence
reduced in level of culpability to the offence
of manslaughter.
<P>

57  	If that be a correct approach in the present particular case,
then I think that I should say frankly that, unconstrained by
the implications,
as I see them, of the verdict of the jury, I would myself have been satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that the
Crown had well and truly rebutted any
suggested provocation. The fact is, however, - and as the decision in <b>Isaacs
</b>explains in detail, - that I am constrained by the verdict of the jury. For
the reasons previously given, I consider myself constrained,
therefore, to
treat the present case as one of murder reduced by suggested and unrebutted
provocation to manslaughter. 
<P>

58  	The end result of what I have hitherto said is, in my opinion,
that it is not, to recapitulate Badgery-Parker J in <b>Twala</b>, <i>"possible
to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as
distinct from subjective features mitigating
the penalty to be imposed)"</i>.
In other words, I do not think that the manslaughter for which the prisoner
Andrew is now to be sentenced is in the worst case category
in the sense that
it would be appropriate to impose the maximum statutory penalty or a penalty at
the top of the available statutory
range. It must be made clear, however, that
it does not at all follow that the manslaughter of which the prisoner has been
found
guilty is in any sense a trifling or an inconsequential crime in terms of
its objective criminality. I regard the prisoner's crime
as being, in terms of
its objective criminality, a serious one meriting a serious level of
punishment.
<P>

59  	That point having been reached, it is then necessary to assess
the relevant subjective features of this particular prisoner's
case. Before
doing that, it is appropriate to consider the objective criminality of the
crime of which the prisoner Kane has been
found guilty by the jury. 
<P>

<b><u>Facts Particular to the Case of the Prisoner Kane</u></b>
<P>

It is convenient to begin by noting briefly some evidence given by the former
Deg.-Sgt. Smith concerning the nature and characteristics
of the tape, various
lengths of which were used to bind up the victim. This evidence established
that the tape was manufactured in
the United States; imported into New South
Wales by a particular importer; and distributed to various hardware chains
throughout
Australia. The evidence continued:
<P>

"It's called Stylus 398 duct tape. Also commonly referred to as gaffer tape. I
understand it's generally described as a cloth-backed
tape. It has general
applications but it's also used in industrial applications as well. It is fully
water-proof and it has extremely
vigorous adhesion qualities."
<P>

60  	The prisoner Kane did not give evidence at his trial. There were
tendered as part of the Crown case against him video cassette
tapes of two
lengthy interviews held between the former Det.-Sgt. Smith and a colleague, and
the prisoner, at the Surry Hills Police
Station on 16 May 1997. Each of those
video tapes was accompanied by an agreed transcript. The prisoner's case was
put to the jury
upon the basis that the version of events given by the prisoner
in the second of the two interviews was his truthful version of the
relevant
facts and circumstances having to do with the death of the late Mr. Tonks.
<P>

61  	The former Det.-Sgt. Smith gave evidence that he had arrested
the prisoner at the home of the latter's parents at about 8 a.m.
on the morning
of 16 May 1997. Det. Smith asked the prisoner whether he had any knowledge of
Mr. Tonks, and the prisoner replied
simply and falsely that he did not. He was
asked whether he had any knowledge of the death of Mr. Tonks; and, again, he
simply and
falsely answered that he did not. He was formally arrested and taken
to the Surry Hills Police Station.
<P>

62  	There, and at about 9.10 a.m., the first of the two formal
interviews commenced. Throughout both of those interviews, the prisoner's
father, Mr. Nicholas Kane, was present; and he intervened from time to time,
either to give some particular advice to his son, or
to give more generally
support and encouragement.
<P>

63  	The transcript of the first formal interview runs to some 60
typewritten pages. The structure of the questioning is careful
and methodical.
The questioning deals, first, with the obvious formal matters; confirms the
particulars, as I have earlier summarised
them, of the arrest; and then moves
to the death of Mr. Tonks. Once again, the prisoner denies, simply and falsely,
any knowledge
whatsoever of the death; of the details of the death; of the
location of the killing; or of the victim. The questioning then turns
to the
allegations that had been made by the prisoner's estranged wife, Bedelia, as to
a confession, said to have been made to her
by the prisoner, of his involvement
in the murder of Mr. Tonks; and to other inculpatory exchanges said to have
taken place between
the two of them at various subsequent times. The
questioning then follows the same method in connection with allegations made by
the prisoner's mother-in-law to the police concerning inculpatory statements
said to have been made to her by the prisoner. The portions
of the interview to
which I have referred extended to about 9.46 a.m., at which time a break was
taken in order to change the audio
tapes. During the few moments that it takes
to make that change, the prisoner's father is seen on the video tape to say
something
to the prisoner, and the latter thereupon asks whether he will get a
"<i>right of response"</i> to various of the allegations that have been made to
the police by his wife and mother-in-law. He is told that he will have that
opportunity at a later and more convenient time; and the interview re-commences
at about 9.48 a.m. The interviewer completes his
questioning about the
allegations made to the police by the prisoner's mother-in-law; and then
informs the prisoner that fingerprints,
as yet unidentified, have been found at
the scene of the killing. He asks the prisoner whether the latter will make a
set of comparison
prints available; the prisoner agrees to do so; and the
interview is, accordingly, suspended from about 9.51 a.m. to about 10.13
a.m.
in order that the fingerprints may be taken.
<P>

64  	Upon the resumption of the interview, the prisoner confirms that
he has had the opportunity, during the break, to speak to
his father; that he
has discussed certain things with his father; and that he would like to raise
those things himself in the context
of the current interview. He is given an
open-ended invitation to say whatever it is that he wants to say; and he
launches, thereupon,
into a scathing attack upon his wife and his
mother-in-law. From time to time his father intervenes with suggestions as to
things
that he might wish to cover in what he is saying. This episode occupies,
in transcript form, some 10 A4 pages of material, extending
from pages 43 to 53
both inclusive of the transcript forming part of Exhibit M at the trial. Those
10 pages of material can be summarised
sufficiently for present purposes by
saying that they assert, in strong and powerful language, that the prisoner's
wife and mother-in-law
have concocted their allegations to the police in order
to discredit the prisoner in connection with then current proceedings in
the
Family Court concerning the custody of the two children of the prisoner and his
wife.
<P>

65  	At the conclusion of this episode, the interview is again
suspended for a short while and, upon its resumption at about 10.36
a.m., the
prisoner is informed that the prisoner Andrew is currently being investigated
by the police and that two fingerprints of
the prisoner Andrew have been
identified among the fingerprints found at the scene of the killing. The
prisoner Kane says that there
is nothing he wants to say in connection with
those fingerprints. He is told during the course of this particular exchange
with the
police that a fingerprint of his own has been found at the scene of
the killing. As to that, his only response is: <i>"I don't know how it could be
there."</i> Shortly thereafter, and at about 10.39 a.m., the interview is
concluded, and the usual post-interview formalities are duly attended
to.
<P>

66  	Thereafter, and at about 12.05 p.m. on the same day, the second
formal interview commences. It follows the same carefully structured
pattern as
the first interview. It establishes that, during the time elapsing between the
conclusion of the first interview and the
commencement of the second interview,
the interviewing police have spoken briefly with the prisoner's father; and
that thereafter
the prisoner has himself spoken in confidence with his father;
and has then indicated a wish to be re-interviewed. There ensues a
lengthy
interview which concluded at about 1.47 p.m., and which runs to some 61 pages
of typescript. During the course of this second
interview, the prisoner gives a
version as follows:
<P>

67  	On a day about two weeks or so prior to the date of the killing,
the prisoner and his friend Andrew were approached in a street
somewhere in
North Sydney and were invited to a party. They were so invited by two men, one
of whom was the late Mr. Tonks, and the
other of whom is wholly unidentified
except as being in appearance about the same sort of age as Mr. Tonks. The time
of the initial
encounter could not be established any more precisely than to
say that it was during daylight hours. The two prisoners accepted the
invitation and went in company with the other two men to Mr. Tonks' unit at
Artarmon. They were given some drinks. The prisoner was
offered, and drank, he
thought, about <i>"a couple of drinks"</i>. The drinks did not make him drunk,
but they did make him feel <i>"groggy"</i>. The two adult men then put on a
pornographic video. When that happened, the prisoner said that he was going to
leave, and made to
do so, in company with the prisoner Andrew. Thereupon, both
the prisoners were overpowered by the other two men and bound. The prisoner
was
bound hand and foot. Thereafter at least Mr. Tonks, but perhaps the other man
also, had anal intercourse with the prisoner; and
one of them forced the
prisoner to fellate him. The prisoner was conscious, while these assaults were
continuing, of back-ground
flashes that suggested to him that these activities
were being photographed in some way or other.
<P>

68  	After these assaults had concluded, the two boys were untied and
allowed to leave. 
<P>

69  	The two prisoners thereafter discussed what had happened to
them; and eventually they agreed to go back to the unit and to
confront Mr.
Tonks. They took with them a mini baseball bat and some masking tape taken from
the garage of the prisoner Kane's home.
The prisoner Andrew made contact with
Mr. Tonks on the security intercom, giving the impression that he was alone,
and saying that
he wanted a good time. The two prisoners were thereupon
admitted into the building and went to the front door of Mr. Tonks' unit.
He
<i>".........opened the door and we just walked in"</i>. The prisoner demanded
the film or the photographs that had been taken on the earlier occasion. When
asked by the interviewing police
whether Mr. Tonks had complied with that
request, the prisoner answered: <i>"We both hit him."</i>. According to the
prisoner Kane, it was he not the prisoner Andrew, who struck the other victim
with the mini baseball bat; but the
prisoner Andrew, also, struck blows to the
victim, although the prisoner Kane could not remember with what particular
object. Thereafter,
the two prisoners bound up their victim with the tape and,
according to the prisoner Kane, commenced to search through the unit,
not in
order simply to vandalise it, but for the very particular purpose of locating
the films or photographs which the prisoner
Kane was convinced had been taken
on the earlier occasion. No such photographs or film could be found.
<P>

70  	As to the binding of the victim, the prisoner Kane's
recollection was that he had tied, or helped in tying, the hands and feet;
but
that he had no recollection of tying the knees; and that he did not remember
anything about the taping of the eyes and mouth
of the victim. He did remember,
however, having told the victim at some point during the assaults <i>"to shut
up"</i>.
<P>

71  	As to the bagging of the head of the victim, and as to the
subsequent taping of the open end of the bag around the neck of
the victim, the
prisoner said this: 
<P>

"That's what I can't remember, out of this ............. I don't remember
being, I don't remember putting a bag over his head. That's
not what I, that's
not what I went there to do. I don't, don't know how .........."
<P>

72  	The prisoner was asked whether he could remember his friend
having placed the bag over the head of the victim, and he replied
that he could
not recall that having happened. He could only say that, as of the time of the
interview, he had no recollection of
having himself placed the bag over the
head.
<P>

73  	The prisoner said that he and the prisoner Andrew had left the
unit, he realising that the victim was in fact injured and bleeding.
Shortly
thereafter the prisoner disposed of the mini baseball bat by throwing it
away.
<P>

74  	The questioning then moved to the topics of the inculpatory
admissions said to have been made by the prisoner to his wife and
mother-in-law. It suffices to say that he maintained that he had never made any
such statement to his mother-in-law; but he agreed
that he had in fact made
such statements to his wife. 
<P>

75  	It remains, in connection with this second formal interview,
only to note some things said by the prisoner Kane during the
course of the
interview as to his disposition when he returned to the unit on what he says
was the second occasion. At page 8 of
the transcript, that is to say at a
fairly early stage during the course of the second interview, the prisoner,
explaining how he
and his friend came to return to the unit, says this:
<P>

"............ We talked about it and we knew that there were photos. I hated
him. I'd never kill another person in my life. I hated
him."
<P>

76  	And later, - see page 25 of the transcript, - and in connection
with that same topic:
<P>

"Ben and I talked about it, and I don't know what I wanted to do, but I know I
wanted that, I wanted to find out if there was film
or photos, I knew they were
taken. And I didn't like him very much either. And I was going to go there and
give him a hiding."
<P>

77  	In connection with the making of such a return visit to the
unit, the prisoner said, at the same point in the interview:
<P>

"I'd been thinking about it for a while."
<P>

78  	Later, and at pages 36 and 37 of the transcript, the following
exchanges are recorded:
<P>

"Q.	What did, why did you go there, what was your intention when you first went
there with Ben and when you went there with Ben?
<P>

A.	To kick the shit out of him and to get the film. I thought maybe we might
have had his friend too.
<P>

Q.	And how is it, how is it that. You appreciate that, that your actions that
day caused his death?
<P>

A.	Answered by nodding his head to the affirmative. `Saw it on the news.'
<P>

MR. KANE.	It may have.
<P>

DETECTIVE SERGEANT SMITH		
<P>

Q.	I'm sorry?
<P>

A.	I saw, I saw it on the news.
<P>

Q.	Right. You saw it on the news, was it that night or - ?
<P>

A.	I can't remember.
<P>

Q.	Right. Was, was it shortly after that that you saw something on the news?
<P>

A.	Answers by nodding his head to the affirmative.
<P>

Q.	Do you appreciate, I'll just (ask) you that question again, because it was a
bit, not really clarified, in regards to Mr. Tonks'
death, do you appreciate
that your actions and/or Ben's actions that day resulted in Mr. Tonks'
death?
<P>

MR. KANE	Could I just advise him on that, I -----
<P>

DET. SGT. SMITH	Sure
<P>

MR. KANE	From what I am hearing at the moment, no, ..... I'd advise you against
saying that your actions directly caused the death,
because you don't know.
<P>

SUSPECT	I don't, you said he suffocated and I don't, I didn't suffocate
him."
<P>

79  	Towards the very end of the interview, - see page 59 of the
transcript, - the prisoner was invited, in a general way, to raise
anything
else that had not been covered, and he responded as follows:
<P>

"It's all well and good to say sorry now, but it doesn't count for much. I've
been sorry for a long time. Can't think of any other
information, I'm
sorry."
<P>

80  	In the case of the prisoner Kane, as in that of the prisoner
Andrew, a great deal turns for present purposes upon the extent
to which the
prisoner's version of relevant events can be accepted. That assessment is, in
the case of the present prisoner, even
more difficult than in the case of his
co-offender. In the case of the prisoner Andrew, the Court had, at least, some
opportunity
of seeing and of hearing the prisoner himself. In the case of the
present prisoner, the Court has not had that advantage, except,
of course, in
so far as the Court has been able to observe the demeanour of the prisoner as
he sat in the dock throughout his trial.
All of that entails, therefore, that
the Court must do the best it can to form an assessment of the credibility of
the present prisoner
by having regard to what can be seen and heard of him on
the video tapes of the two interviews of which I have been speaking. In
that
connection I make the following observations.
<P>

81  	It is trite that the responses made by the prisoner during the
course of the lengthy first interview of which I have earlier
spoken were,
essentially, a tissue of lies. What is interesting about that whole exercise
is, however, the way in which the prisoner
carried off the telling of those
lies. It is to be remembered that he was aged, at the time, a little more than
23 years and 4 months.
He had been arrested at his parents' home without, as I
infer from the available evidence, significant, if indeed any, advance warning.
I should think that Det.-Sgt. Smith, as he was then, presented then much as he
presented in Court; that is to say, as an experienced
police officer in
possession of a large amount of potentially very damaging information
concerning a killing in which the prisoner
certainly knew that he was, to
whatsoever particular extent, directly involved. And yet, he sat up in front of
a video camera, and
in the presence of two police officers and of his own
father, and told, simply and comprehensively and without, in my observation,
a
flicker of discomfort or disquiet, lie after lie. So complete was his self
assurance that, as has been previously noted, he exploited
to the full every
opportunity that he thought he could see for disparaging his wife and
mother-in-law, thereby creating deliberately
an impression, not at all
inherently implausible given the poisonous relationship that then existed
between him and his estranged
wife, that he was, in truth, the innocent victim
of concocted allegations having the improper collateral purpose of destroying
his
case in the then current Family Court proceedings concerning the custody of
his children. Even when it was made plain to him that
the police were even then
interviewing his co-offender; and that his own fingerprint had been identified
among the fingerprints found
at the scene of the killing, he did not lose his
composure or his capacity to tell coolly a deliberate lie.
<P>

82  	I have to say that the prisoner's performance throughout that
first recorded interview is, from first to last, a remarkable
accomplishment as
an exercise in mendacity. Not only does it show a cool effrontery; it shows,
also and more importantly for present
purposes, a cool amorality about the
telling of the truth concerning really serious matters. It surely needs no
extended emphasis
that such a state of affairs raises, to say the very least, a
serious question mark over anything subsequently said by the prisoner
as to the
facts and circumstances now relevant.
<P>

83  	That entails, in turn, no small difficulty in making a fair
assessment of the credibility of the version given by the prisoner
during the
second of the two extended interviews of which I have spoken. Throughout that
second interview the prisoner's composure
and general demeanour are completely
different. At a very early stage in the second interview, the prisoner appears
to break down
in great emotional distress. Thereafter, from point to point
throughout the interview the prisoner continues to show great apparent
emotional hurt and distress. I believe that, had I seen only the second
interview, I could have been readily persuaded that what
I was seeing was
genuine distress flowing out of a truthful and horribly painful narrative. I
believe that, had I seen only the first
of the two interviews, I could have
been as readily persuaded that it was, at least, a reasonable possibility that
the prisoner was
giving a truthful account; and that his expressed indignation
was, on that account, both genuine and understandable.
<P>

84  	The fact is, however, that I have seen both of the interview
video tapes. It is very difficult to isolate any consideration
of the second
interview from the impressions, necessarily unfavourable to the prisoner, that
are made by the first interview. I have
come, ultimately, to the conclusion
that it would not be right simply to brush aside the second interview as being
hopelessly contaminated
by the obvious deficiencies of the first interview.
There are, it seems to me, admissions made by the prisoner in the second
interview
which admissions do not make sense unless they are related to an
antecedent incident that did in fact occur, whatever might be thought
to have
been the detailed particulars of the earlier incident. 
<P>

85  	Doing the best I can with such unpromising material, I am
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of, at least, the following matters:
<P>

(1)	That there were in fact two encounters between the prisoner and the victim,
they being separated by a period in the order of
two or three weeks.
<P>

(2)	That the first encounter did involve gross sexual impropriety of some kind
or kinds on the part of the victim, who was after
all a man aged 40 or
thereabouts, towards the prisoner, then aged 16 years and a little more than 4
months. I am not able to make
beyond reasonable doubt any finding as to the
particular nature of the impropriety or improprieties.
<P>

(3)	That the prisoner did in fact feel deeply aggrieved by the conduct of the
victim towards him on that first occasion. 
<P>

(4)	That such sense of grievance festered in the mind of the prisoner for the
period, earlier mentioned, in the order of two or
three weeks, giving rise
eventually to a fixed determination on his part deliberately to seek out the
victim and, in some real and
substantial way, to avenge himself on the
victim.
<P>

(5)	That the intent of the prisoner when he returned on the second occasion to
the victim's home was to inflict some form of grievous
bodily harm upon the
victim. I am not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that there was then a
positive intent to kill.
<P>

(6)	That the prisoner was actively involved, with his co-offender the prisoner
Andrew, in each and every step of the ugly and unbroken
continuum of violence
that began with the striking of the victim with the mini baseball bat, and
concluded with the fitting of the
plastic bag over the victim's head and the
subsequent taping of the open end of the bag so as to make the bag, in effect,
an air-lock.
As I have previously said, it is neither possible nor necessary to
make findings reached beyond reasonable doubt as to precisely
which of the two
offenders did precisely what to the victim and in what precise order. It
suffices to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt, as I certainly am, that each
and every stage in that continuum of assault was the work either of the two
offenders acting
together; or of one of them, the other being in the requisite
legal sense present and assenting.
<P>

86  	The defence of the prisoner Kane was not conducted upon the
basis of alleged self defence. There was, in any event and in my
opinion, not
adduced in the trial of the prisoner Kane any evidence which was capable, on a
rational view, of supporting a case of
self defence. 
<P>

87  	Provocation, such as would reduce murder to manslaughter, was
relied upon in the defence case. The verdict of the jury clearly
entails  that
the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had rebutted any
suggested provocation. In so far as
it is necessary for me to make a discrete
finding of fact upon the issue of provocation, I too am satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt
that provocation as suggested in the defence case is rebutted
upon the whole of the evidence at trial. The conclusion to which I
have come as
to the objective criminality, overall, of the murder of which the prisoner has
been found guilty is similar to my conclusion,
as earlier herein noted, as to
the objective criminality of the manslaughter of which the prisoner Andrew has
been found guilty.
That is to say, I do not think that the murder for which the
prisoner Kane is now to be sentenced is in the worst case category in
the sense
that it would be appropriate to impose the maximum statutory penalty or a
penalty at the top of the available statutory
range. It remains, however, the
clear fact, in my opinion, that the murder in question was a most serious
criminal act; and one meriting,
in terms of its objective criminality, a
serious level of punishment.
<P>

<b><u>Subjective Matters Respecting the Prisoner Andrew</u></b>
<P>

88  	The prisoner was born on 9 March 1974. He was aged, therefore,
16 years and some 2 months at the time of this offence; and
he is now aged 25
years and some 4 months. He is unmarried. 
<P>

89  	The prisoner has criminal antecedents in the form of one
conviction for a comparatively minor offence of dishonesty. At trial,
this was
accepted on all sides as not disentitling him to the benefit of being
considered on the basis that he was a person of prior
good character in the
requisite legal sense. It is proper that he be so regarded for the purpose of
sentencing.
<P>

90  	The relevant personal, familial and social backgrounds of the
prisoner are detailed in a report dated 1 June 1999 and furnished
by Dr.
William Lucas, a forensic psychiatrist. I accept the relevant material as thus
set out in Dr. Lucas' report.
<P>

91  	As to the considerations of remorse, of personal deterrence and
of prospects of rehabilitation, it is convenient to quote the
following
opinions expressed by Dr. Lucas:
<P>

"Mr. Andrew has been convicted of a serious crime which arose out of special
circumstances, ones which are unlikely to recur. I
think it quite unlikely that
Mr. Andrew will again be charged with a serious offence of violence. He regrets
what has occurred, the
trial has enabled him to clear the books as it were and
he believes he has benefited from the experience. He is intelligent, is in
a
position to complete his BA and he intends to go on to other studies. His plans
for the future are realistic and he has good support
from friends and
family.
<P>

Mr. Andrew does not require psychiatric treatment. As he has abused marijuana
and alcohol, not for too many years, he would be wise
to seek some counselling
while in prison. When he returns to the community supervision would assist him
in establishing himself but
this should not be too difficult given the support
he will have from his family. 
<P>

Mr. Andrew has been through a difficult few years but he appears to have dealt
with a number of important issues. I believe his
psychiatric prognosis and
long-term outlook in general is good."
<P>

92  	Subject to one qualification, to which I shall come presently, I
am in general agreement with the views thus expressed.
<P>

93  	The qualification has to do with the aspect of remorse, in the
sense here relevant. During the proceedings on sentence there
was a lengthy
exchange between the Court and learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner on this
topic of remorse. During the course
of that exchange I expressed in some detail
reservations which I then felt in connection with that matter. They are
recorded in all
necessary detail and I need not now repeat them. I am still not
wholly free of those doubts, the more so having regard to the findings
that I
have previously herein made concerning matters affecting the credit of the
prisoner. The prisoner made, obviously, a favourable
impression on the jury;
and he seems to have made a comparably favourable impression on Dr. Lucas. I
can only say for my own part
that, based upon my own observations of the
prisoner throughout the trial, and especially while he was in the witness box,
I continue
to have real doubts as to whether he does truly give an
intelligently informed assent to the proposition that he is in a real way
responsible, and both morally and legally, for the death of the late Mr. Tonks.
So far as concerns the present discussion of the
subjective features of his
case, I think it is fair to give him the benefit of those doubts. 
<P>

94  	The matter of general deterrence, also, is a difficult aspect of
the prisoner's case. This, too, was a topic discussed extensively
during the
course of the submissions on sentence. I cannot accept in the present case that
general deterrence does not have a real
role to play. Perhaps I best develop
that point by making two brief citations of authority. The first is from the
judgment of Gleeson
CJ in <b>Regina v Chaouk</b>, Court of Criminal Appeal,
unreported, 17 August 1993; the second is the closing passage in the speech of
Lord Templeman in <b>Regina v Brown and ors. </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20AC%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 AC 212</a> at 237.
<P>

95  	Gleeson CJ put, as follows, the point that I am wishing now to
make:
<P>

"The unlawful taking of another person's life is a very grave matter. Whilst
the prisoner acted under provocation and a loss of
self-control, and whilst his
responsibility for his actions was diminished, his responsibility for those
actions was not eliminated.
Even allowing for the pressures under which he was
acting and which reduced what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter, his
actions
involved taking the law into his own hands and to a degree consciously
inflicting punishment upon the person who had wronged him.
<i>There is no place
in our society for such acts of vengeance, and when they result in loss of
human life, they are to be treated very
seriously.</i>" [emphasis added]
<P>

96  	Lord Templeman put the point in this way:
<P>

"Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence.
Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an
evil thing. Cruelty is
uncivilised."
<P>

97  	The next subjective matter concerns what was described in the
submissions on sentence as the staleness of the offence here
in question. The
attention of the Court was directed to comments made by Street CJ in <b>Regina
v Todd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 517</a> at 519E - 520A. It needs to be remembered that
<b>Todd</b> was dealing with the case of a prisoner sentenced in Queensland to
imprisonment in that State for offences committed in that State;
and who faced
the prospect of being sentenced again, and at the completion of his Queensland
imprisonment, in New South Wales, to
a term of imprisonment to be served in
that State for offences committed in that State. In that rather special
context, Street CJ
said this:
<P>

"Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an
inter-state sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner
requires weight to
be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier
sentence, to the circumstance that
he has been left in a state of uncertain
suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for
sentence on the
subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a
stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a
considerable
measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of
time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead
to
considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a
dominant role in the determination of what should
be done in the matter of
sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue
degree of leniency being extended
to the prisoner."
<P>

98  	Accepting, as of course I respectfully do, the guidance as to
principle thus given by the Court of Criminal Appeal, it remains,
nevertheless,
my task to apply those principles in a level-headed sort of way to the
particular facts of the present individual case.
In that connection there are,
I think, two points to be made.
<P>

99  	The first point is that the reason why it took 7 years for the
police to track the prisoner down was that the police did not
have a clue that
they could follow up, save only for fingerprints which they were unable to
match with any of the prints held in
the relevant police data base. Had it not
been for the sheer chance of the disclosures made through Bedelia Dali to the
police, the
odds are, at least so far as the evidence at present available to
this Court extends, that the prisoner would have continued to escape
detection
for an even longer period than the 7 years. I do not see why those
considerations entitle the prisoner to any leniency.
<P>

100  	The second point to be made is, however, that something of
substance does indeed turn upon what the prisoner has made of his
personal and
social development throughout the period that has elapsed since the date on
which he carried out the unlawful killing
of which he has been found guilty. As
I have earlier said, I accept that the prisoner has developed, both personally
and socially,
in ways that are properly to be given favourable consideration. A
reflection of this development has been that the prisoner was on
pre-trial bail
throughout, effectively, the whole of the time between his arrest and his
arraignment. The conditions of that bail
were onerous; and the prisoner appears
to have complied strictly with all of the requirements of his bail conditions.
I have, accordingly,
taken those matters into account.
<P>

101  	It is necessary to consider, next, the recommendation of the
jury for leniency.
<P>

102  	I take the law in that connection to be as stated by Isaacs J
in <b>Whittaker v R</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2041%20CLR%20230" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 41 CLR 230</a> at 240:
<P>

"The recommendation of a jury for leniency should always be treated with
respect and careful attention. It is a recognized feature
of our legal system.
But a recommendation <i>simpliciter</i> is, after all, a recommendation only,
and the Judge, on whom falls the sole responsibility of measuring the
punishment within the
limits assigned, must consider for himself how far it is
consistent with the demands of justice that he should accede to the
recommendation."
<P>

103  	The foregoing statement of principle has been repeatedly
affirmed and followed: see <b>R v Harris</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1961/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] VicRp 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20VR%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] VR 236</a> at 237 (per Lowe,

Lowe, Gavan Dulffy and O'Brien JJ); <b>R v Meares</b>, NSWCCA, 3 October 1997,

R v Mihailovic &amp; ors.</b> NSWSC, Badgery-Parker J, 15 April 1991,
unreported, at 4041. I propose to act in accordance with the principles thus
stated. I will
not treat the present matter in a way that simply disregards the
jury recommendation; for I would not think it fair to give the recommendation
absolutely no weight at all. By the same token, I make it clear that I do not
think that it would accord with the requirements of
justice to treat the
recommendation, in the context of the present particular case, as though it
were, simply and comprehensively,
determinative of the way in which the Court
should now deal with the prisoner.
<P>

104  	It should be noted that the prisoner has been in custody since
28 April last. He has no other experience of such full-time
custody in the
prison system. The circumstances of his case are likely to make any future
imprisonment more difficult for him than
might otherwise have been the case. I
have kept all of these things in mind in coming to my ultimate decision.
<P>

<b><u>Subjective Matters Respecting the Prisoner Kane</u></b>
<P>

105  	The prisoner was born on 7 January 1974. He was aged,
therefore, 16 years and a little more than 4 months at the time of his
offence;
and he is now aged 25 years and almost 6 months. He is married; although, as
earlier herein noted, the marriage is effectively
at an end. There are two
children of the marriage, a girl aged about 5 and a boy aged about 3.
<P>

106  	The prisoner has criminal antecedents, the relevant details of
which are set out in Exhibit A on sentence. It is not, I think,
necessary to
discuss at length the details of the offences. It is sufficient to say that
they are, when compared to the crime of
murder for which the prisoner is now to
be sentenced, of minor significance. They play no part of substance in the
course that I
have decided to take in respect of the present sentencing of the
prisoner.
<P>

107  	Two expert psychiatric reports were tendered in the prisoner's
case on sentence. The first of them is dated 27 June 1999 and
is the report of
Dr. Olav Nielssen. The other is dated 24 June 1999 and is the report of
Katherine Barrier. I have read and considered
the contents of both reports. I
accept the substance of the opinions therein expressed.
<P>

108  	Both reports establish that the prisoner has no underlying
psychiatric or psychological disorder; and that he is not in any
way
anti-social in his fundamental personality. Their reports support the view,
being the view to which I would have come in any
event on the basis of the
whole of the evidence otherwise available, that the killing of the victim was,
so far as concerns the present
prisoner, a wholly uncharacteristic act.
<P>

109  	I have at no time seen the prisoner Kane in the witness box and
tested by proper cross-examination. This makes it very difficult
to come to a
view about the question of remorse. There are, in the two psychiatric reports,
fleeting references to the topic; and
they suggest that the reporting
psychiatrists accepted that, at least to some extent, the prisoner is, in a
proper sense, remorseful
for what he did to the victim. There being no evidence
to the contrary, I think I should accept those expressions of opinion. I would
not regard personal deterrence as being a significant feature of the prisoner's
case, in the sense that I would not expect, all things
being equal, that he
would murder again. I think that personal deterrence is a factor in the sense
that what is now done in the matter
of sentence needs to be sufficient to bring
home to the prisoner in a very real way the enormity of his offence, and his
proper moral
and legal responsibility for what he did. 
<P>

110  	As to general deterrence, I need not repeat what I have said in
the matter of the prisoner Andrew.
<P>

111  	In the prisoner's case on sentence, no particular submission
was put concerning any suggested staleness of the original offence.
In the case
of the present prisoner, there was no jury recommendation for leniency.
<P>

112  	It should be noted that the prisoner has been in custody since
18 May 1999; and that he was previously in custody between
16 May 1997 and 18
July 1997. I will allow in the ultimate sentence for these periods of
pre-sentence custody. 
<P>

<b><u>Considerations as to Parity of Sentence</u></b>
<P>

113  	Because the prisoner Kane is to be sentenced for the crime of
murder, and the prisoner Andrew is to be sentenced for the lesser
crime of
manslaughter, there is no avoiding an outcome where there is a marked
discrepancy between the sentences imposed, respectively,
upon the two
prisoners. It is practically certain that such an outcome will give rise, in
the prisoner Kane himself, and among the
members of his family and other
supporters, to a sense of grievance. I do not think that justice would be seen
to have been done
were the Court simply to show no proper awareness of that
reality. It is in that spirit, and for the proper information of those
concerned, that I make the following brief observations.
<P>

114  	It is convenient to begin by citing the opening words of the
judgment of Mason J, as he then was, in <b>Lowe v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR
606</a> at 610-611:
<P>

"Just as consistency in punishment - a reflection of the notion of equal
justice - is a fundamental element in any rational and
fair system of criminal
justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of
unfairness and unequal treatment
under the law, is calculated to lead to an
erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice.
It is
for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable
discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of  abiding importance
to the
administration of justice and to the community."
<P>

115  	It will be observed that Mason J speaks of <i>"unjustifiable"
</i>discrepancy. When, as is the case with the present two prisoners,
co-offenders have been tried separately rather than jointly, there
will always
be a risk that two separate juries will take two different views concerning the
objective culpability of the co-offenders.
When, as is the case with the
present two prisoners, one co-offender is found guilty by one jury of murder,
and the other co-offender
is found guilty by a different jury of the lesser
crime of manslaughter, the stance taken by the law is that, provided that each
of the two trials has been conducted fairly and in accordance with law, it will
necessarily follow that there will be a discrepancy,
and sometimes a marked
discrepancy, between the sentence imposed in respect of the finding of murder,
and that imposed in respect
of the finding of manslaughter;  and that a
discrepancy arising in that particular way is not unjustifiable in the sense of
which
Mason J was speaking in the passage to which I have earlier referred.
<P>

116  	The point just now made is illustrated and examined, so far as
is at present useful, by a recent decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeal:
<b>Regina v Damon Ashley Cooper</b>, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 24
February 1998. In that matter the appellant and his co-accused had been put
upon to commit
arson and murder by the co-accused's domineering father. They
burned down a house and shot and killed a man outside his house. The
appellant
was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility; in a
separate trial, his co-accused was acquitted
altogether on the basis of
involuntariness. The co-accused had given evidence of serious life-long abuse
and domination by his father.
Gleeson CJ made the following observations, (at
14 and 19-20 respectively):
<P>

"It is not for this Court to comment upon the outcome of the trial of .....[the
co-accused].....even if we were in a position to
do so. ....[The
co-accused]..... is legally entitled to the full benefit of his acquittal. The
appellant's case must be considered
on its own merits. When alleged
co-offenders are tried separately, or when one person is subjected to separate
trials in relation
to a number of alleged offences, the risk of results that
are, or that might appear to be, inconsistent, is obvious. That risk is
inherent in a system which permits, and not infrequently requires, such
separate trials.....
<P>

The fact that the appellant..... was convicted of arson and manslaughter,
whereas.....[the co-accused].....was acquitted, does not
mean that the
appellant was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. In <i>Hui Chi Ming v The
Queen </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20AC%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 AC 34</a>, a principal offender and a secondary offender were
tried separately. The principal offender was convicted of manslaughter and
sentenced
to six years' imprisonment. The secondary offender, who had merely
aided and abetted the principal offender, was convicted of murder
and sentenced
to death. The Privy Council said that the outcomes simply reflected the
different views of the facts taken by two different
juries. The case of <i>R. v
Howard</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 242</a> also provides a striking example of the way in
which alleged co-offenders, all given due process of law, may be treated
differently."
<P>

117  	I propose to give full effect to the principles thus
established. That is to say, I do not propose to increase, within the
appropriate range of sentence, the sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner
Andrew; nor do I propose to reduce within the appropriate
range of sentence,
the sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner Kane; so as to contrive an
appearance, however artificial, of comparability,
or of proportionality, or of
relationship of any other kind between the two sentences ultimately imposed.
Both prisoners had legal
representation at the time of the making of the order
for separate trials. Both acquiesced in the making of the order. Both took
every available forensic advantage deriving from the separation of their
respective trials. The end result has been to leave the
Court in the position
of having now to deal, justly according to law, but with that same distinct
separateness, with each prisoner.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusions as to Sentence - the Prisoner Andrew</u></b>
<P>

118  	It was contended strenuously for this prisoner that there
should be imposed upon him a sentence not involving any further
full-time
imprisonment. I have considered carefully whether what I would regard as a just
balancing overall of the relevant objective
and subjective matters which I have
examined in previous sections of these remarks, would justify such an approach.
I have no doubt
that the answer is: no. When everything that can be said in the
prisoner's favour has been weighed fairly in the balance, it remains
the
inescapable fact that a jury, manifestly sympathetic to the prisoner, has found
that he bears, in a real and substantive sense,
legal responsibility for an
unlawful killing. Accepting, as I do and for reasons earlier herein explained,
that there are bases upon
which it would be proper to mitigate the full
severity of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence, I have a clear and
comfortable
conviction that to impose a sentence that did not entail at least
some period of full-time imprisonment would not conduce to the
maintenance of
that proper public confidence in the administration of justice, to which Mason
J referred in the passage earlier herein
cited from his Honour's judgment in
<b>Lowe</b>. 
<P>

119  	I have come to the conclusion that a proper aggregate sentence
would be one of penal servitude 6 years, apportioned between
a minimum term of
4 years and an additional term of 2 years. The minimum term will commence on 28
April 1999 and expire on 27 April
2003. The additional term will commence on 28
April 2003. I have considered the matter of "special circumstances" as
contemplated
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> (NSW)</b>. A
sentence of 6 years could be apportioned between a minimum term of 4-1/2 years
and an additional term of 1-1/2 years without the
need to find "special
circumstances". The variations that I propose are not very substantial; but
they reflect my view that this
particular prisoner, having served the minimum
term of 4 years, should have thereafter, and if released to parole as I would
expect
will be the case, the support and the assistance of the Parole
authorities for a period of not less than 2 years.
<P>

120  	<b><i>Benjamin Bruce Andrew:</i></b> You are formally convicted
of the manslaughter of Wayne George Tonks, of which manslaughter you were found
guilty by the verdict
of the jury. You are sentenced to penal servitude for a
period of 6 years apportioned between a minimum term of 4 years and an
additional
term of 2 years. The minimum term will commence on 28 April 1999 and
expire on 27 April 2003. The additional term will commence on
28 April 2003.
<P>

121  	I make the following recommendations and direct the Registrar
to being them to the urgent attention of the Commissioner of
Corrective
Services:
<P>

(1)	That the prisoner's classification within the Corrective Services system be
carried out as a matter of urgency and to the end
of minimising any extended
exposure of the prisoner to the influence of hardened criminals.
<P>

(2)	That to the maximum extent compatible with proper prison administration and
discipline, the prisoner be encouraged to continue,
and be afforded the
necessary facilities to continue, and to complete his current tertiary studies;
and such further tertiary and
other vocational courses as he may wish to
undertake.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusions as to Sentence - the Prisoner Kane</u></b>
<P>

122  	The submissions on sentence put for the prisoner included a
reference to a very recent decision of Simpson J of this Court
in the related
matters of <b>Sefo</b> and <b>Soriano</b>: unreported  13 May 1998. The former
pleaded guilty to the murder of a 23 year old tourist who had done nothing to
bring about his
own death. The latter pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the
same victim. <b>Sefo</b> was sentenced by her Honour to penal servitude for 11
years comprising a minimum term of 7 years and an additional term of 4 years.
It was submitted, as I followed the arguments based upon this decision, that
such a measure of punishment might be thought of some
general indicative value
in the present case, given that <b>Sefo</b> was, like the present prisoner, a
young boy at the time he committed the murder for which he was sentenced. 
<P>

123  	I have read the decision, and I think that it is clearly
distinguishable on its facts from the facts of the present case.
<b>Sefo</b>
was aged about 13-1/2 years of age when he committed the murder; and he was
aged about 15-1/2 when he stood for sentence. The subjective
features of his
case included the fact that he was suffering from a degree of intellectual
impairment; was very poorly educated;
and had what her Honour described as
<i>"a personal history of social and familial dislocation"</i>, which her
Honour accepted as having an obvious bearing upon the pattern of his behaviour
leading up to the killing in question.
The case of the present prisoner is, I
think, very far removed on its facts from that kind of subjective context. 
<P>

124  	There was, in addition, the very important consideration that
<b>Sefo</b> pleaded guilty; and thus received, by reason of that plea, a
significant discount in what would have been otherwise the sentence
imposed
upon him. In saying that, I must make it clear that the present prisoner is not
liable, merely because he exercised his undoubted
right to plead not guilty, to
be punished more severely than would otherwise be appropriate.
<P>

125  	In doing my best to bring into a fair overall balance the
objective and subjective features of which I have earlier spoken,
I have tried
to allow, also, for the fact that the prisoner is a comparatively young man who
could have looked forward, had he not
been in his present predicament, to a
good and useful life in the general community. I have tried to find a fair
point of balance
between what I think the justice and merits of the present
matter require and the need to avoid a crushing sentence.
<P>

126  	I have found difficult in the extreme everything to do with the
sentencing of the present prisoner; but I have come to the
conclusion that a
fair result would be the imposition of a sentence of penal servitude of 13
years divided between a minimum term
of 10 years and an additional term of 3
years. That sentence takes account of the two months served in custody by the
prisoner in
1997; and it will be back-dated to 18 May 1999, the date upon which
he entered his present custody. I have considered the question
of "special
circumstances" as contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a>
(NSW)</b>; but I do not see that the subjective features of the prisoner's case
require, in connection with his future rehabilitation back
into the general
community, an additional term greater than 3 years.
<P>

127  	<b><i>Peter Clive Basil Kane</i></b>: You are convicted
formally of the murder of Wayne George Tonks, of which murder you were found
guilty by the jury. You are sentenced
to penal servitude for a period of 13
years to comprise a minimum term of 10 years and an additional term of 3 years.
The minimum
term will commence on 18 May 1999 and will expire on 17 May 2009.
The additional term will commence on 18 May 2009.
<P>

128  	I make the following recommendations and direct the Registrar
to bring them to the urgent attention of the Commissioner of
Corrective
Services:
<P>

(1)	That the prisoner's classification within the Corrective Services system be
carried out as a matter of urgency.
<P>

(2)	That thereafter, and to the maximum extent compatible with proper prison
administration and discipline, the prisoner's place
of detention from time to
time be arranged in such a fashion as will permit of his maximum continuing
contact with his children.
<P>

(3)	That to the maximum extent compatible with proper prison administration and
discipline the prisoner be detained in such circumstances
as will minimise any
extended exposure of the prisoner to the influence of hardened criminals.
<P>
