<b>Friday 2 July 1999</b>
<P>

<b>4635/97 PUBLIC TRUSTEE v DOUGLAS SOLAH AND OTHERS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>  This is the hearing of an enquiry into the
identity of the next of kin of Francis Solah (the deceased) late of Mittagong
in the
State of New South Wales retired market gardener.  The deceased died on
the 27 November 1989 at the age of 85 years.  On 19 January
1929 the deceased
married a Doris Graham.  He and his wife appear on the evidence to have
cohabited for a short period of time before
she left him.  She has not been
located.  The evidence proves that the deceased had no defacto wife and no
issue.  His parents, his
brothers and sisters predeceased him.  
<P>

2   	In the event that the deceased's wife is not alive the
deceased's estate is held in statutory trust for the brothers and sisters
of
the whole blood.  The deceased's mother, Sophia Solah (herein called Sophia),
had ten children.  The deceased was the second youngest
and was born during the
currency of her marriage to the deceased's father, Norman Kallil Solah (herein
called "Kallil").  There were
two other children born during the currency of
that marriage, George Solah who is the father of the second and third
defendants and
John Michael Solah.  Of the seven children born prior to the
deceased's mother's marriage to Kallil the first six were registered
as the
children of a marriage to a Henry Brookfield.  No registration of this marriage
has been uncovered but these six children
could only be brothers and sisters of
the half blood.  The seventh child born prior to the marriage to Kallil was
named "Norman".
 His birth was registered under the surnames Brookfield and
Drummond (his mother's maiden name).  That registration shows no details
of his
father.  Norman was the father of the first defendant, Donald Douglas Solah and
the persons represented by him.  Their claim
is that Kallil was Norman's father
which would make Norman a brother to the deceased of the whole blood.  
<P>

3   	The deceased's younger brother John Michael Solah was
clearly a brother of the full blood.  The issue in relation to his part
of the
family is whether he was the father of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
defendants.  Those defendants all have the same
mother.  However, they were all
born during the currency of their mother's marriage to a man named Thomas
Chisnall and their birth
certificates all show this man Chisnall as their
father.  They contend, however, that John Michael Solah was in fact their
father.
 
<P>

4   	On 26 November 1996 orders were made, first for the
appointment of the first defendant, Donald Douglas Solah, to represent
all the
issue of the deceased's late brother Norman Solah in the proceedings and,
second, that the second and third defendants represent
all the issue of the
deceased's late brother, George Essel Solah, in the proceedings.
<P>

5   	There are in effect three disputed areas that need
consideration in this enquiry to determine the next of kin of the deceased.
They are:-
<P>

1.	Should there be a distribution of the estate on the basis that the
deceased's wife is excluded?
<P>

2.	Was the deceased's late brother, John Michael Solah, the father of any of
the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants?
<P>

3.	Was the deceased's late brother, Norman Solah, of the full or half blood to
the deceased?
<P>

6   	Attached as an appendix to these reasons for judgment are
five Family Trees.  The first Family Tree is that of the relationship
between
Kallil and Sophia.  The second Family Tree gives details of the family of
Norman.  The third gives details of the family
of George.  The fourth gives
details of the family of John Michael Solah and the fifth gives the details of
the children of Sophia
Drummond and Henry Brookfield.
<P>

<b>1.	Should there be a distribution of the estate on the basis that the
deceased's wife is excluded?</b>
<P>

7   	The present proceedings are brought pursuant to Part 68 of
the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> which allows me to make an order for relief
without general administration.  In the present proceedings it is necessary to
make a
finding that the next of kin who are entitled on the intestacy of the
deceased consists of those persons who have come in and proved
their claim.
The proper approach in respect of such an enquiry was referred to in <b>Walsh v
Weigall</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1887/88.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1887] VicLawRp 88</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2013%20VLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 13 VLR 449</a> at 453.
<P>

"The object of an administration decree is to enable the estate to be
distributed with safety to the executor or administrator who,
acting under the
direction of the Court, is protected even if other claimants may afterwards
come forward and establish their claims.
 But such distribution, whilst it
protects the executor or administrator, in no way precludes the rights of
subsequent claimants,
who may at any time institute proceedings against the
persons amongst whom the estate has been distributed to compel them to refund
in whole or in part, as the case may be, what they have received.  If the view
of the Chief Clerk be correct, then in many cases
it would be impossible ever
to distribute the estate at all.  The mistake into which he has fallen, I
think, is that he regards the
decree as imposing a duty upon him to report all
the possible next-of-kin, and to forbear reporting until it has be demonstrated
that there are and can be no others than those he reports; whereas his duty is
to take all necessary steps by advertisement or to
otherwise to invite
claimants, and then to report only such as have proved their claims before
him.
<P>

. . .  the rights of persons shown by evidence to occupy a certain relationship
to the testator or intestate cannot be ignored on
the mere surmise that there
may possibly be in existence and unheard of, other persons of equal kin or
nearer of kin than they. 
The practice I have stated was that which prevailed
before the Judicature Act, and the practice under that Act has not been altered
in this respect, . . ."
<P>

8   	The evidence before me establishes the entitlement of the
issue of the deceased's later brother, George Solah.  These persons
are
represented in the proceedings by the second and third defendants.
Accordingly, it is necessary for the others to prove their
claim which might
either share with the claim of the brother, George Solah, or oust that
claim.
<P>

9   	The evidence before me establishes that the deceased
married a Doris Graham nee Jones at Mittagong, New South Wales on 19 January
1929.  The marriage certificate indicates the deceased's wife was aged 25 years
at that stage giving a birth date of approximately
1904.  She was described as
a widow having been born in Wakefield, England.  Her parents were Wilmott
Gilbert Jones and Doris Jones
nee Talbot.  
<P>

10   	The plaintiff has carried out extensive searches in an
effort to trace the deceased's wife.  These included the following:-
<P>

1.	Searches for any record of the divorce in all of the State and Territory
Supreme Courts, the Family Court of Australia and the
Family Court of Western
Australia.  There is no record of any divorce.
<P>

2.	Searches for any record of the death of Doris Solah in all States and
Territories.  There is no record of any death.
<P>

3.	Searches for issue in New South Wales under the names of Doris Graham, Doris
Jones and Doris Solah.  No record of any issue was
ascertained.
<P>

4.	Searches of the New South Wales Electoral Roll on 20 February 1995 and the
Australian Electoral Roll on 28 August 1997 showed
no result.
<P>

5.	Enquiries were made of the Commonwealth Department of Social Security
seeking any records which they might have to no avail.
<P>

6.	Searches were made in the United Kingdom for any record of the death of
Doris Solah, Graham or Jones.  This resulted in six persons
with the name of
Doris Graham as deceased.  However, the death certificates do not correlate
with what is known of the deceased's
wife.  
<P>

11   	There has been extensive advertising calling on persons to
bring in claims pursuant to s 92 of the <b>Wills, Probate and Administration
Act</b>.  The advertising included the Southern Highland News, a newspaper,
which is circulated in the district where the deceased resided
and in capital
city newspapers.  There was also advertising in the United Kingdom.  No
response has been received from any of that
advertising.
<P>

12   	The only evidence which touches upon the marriage appears
to be that given by Donald Douglas Solah who was a son of Norman
Solah.  He was
born on 24 September 1929 and at the time of giving his evidence was 65 years
of age.  He gave evidence that his mother
kept a close relationship with the
deceased throughout their joint lives.  Donald heard the deceased describe
himself as a married
man on more than one occasion but he had never met his
wife.  Donald, of course, was born in the same year that the deceased married.
His mother gave him information about the marriage of the deceased in the
following terms:-
<P>

"Frank married this Doris Graham.  She had two children and she married Frank
because she thought he had money.  When they got married
Frank took her out
rabbit trapping and it only lasted about six weeks.  When he came back one day,
she had gone taking everything
with her.  All he had left was his tent and
rabbit traps.  She was never seen again."
<P>

13   	Donald's mother married Norman in 1923 some years prior to
the marriage between the deceased and his wife.  Accordingly, she
would be in a
position to speak of what happened to that marriage given the contact of which
she has given evidence.  In these circumstances
this evidence should be
accepted.
<P>

14   	The question was raised as to whether the court could
presume the death of the wife given the evidence.  This unfortunately
would not
assist as the presumption does not authorise the finding that she died at or
before a given date.  It is limited to a presumptive
conclusion that at the
time of the proceedings the person no longer lives.  See <b>Axon v Axon
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 80</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2059%20CLR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 59 CLR 395</a> at 405.
<P>

15   	I am satisfied that the deceased's wife left him some six
weeks after the marriage and that she cannot be traced.  I am satisfied
that
there has been appropriate advertising to enable the deceased's wife to bring
in her claim but she has not done so.  In these
circumstances given that there
are others who have proved their entitlement the distribution should proceed
without having regard
to the claim of the deceased's wife.  An appropriate form
of order may be to the effect of that in <b>Re Benjamin, Neville v Benjamin
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281902%29%201%20Ch%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1902) 1 Ch 723</a> and the parties may wish to address on that aspect.
<P>

<b>2.	Was the deceased's late brother, John Michael Solah, the father of any of
the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants?</b>
<P>

16   	The deceased's brother, John Michael Solah, I am satisfied
is the brother of the full blood.  Any children of his would be
entitled to
share in the estate of the deceased on intestacy.  John Michael Solah
predeceased the deceased having died on 24 August
1962.  He married Mavoura
Everald Maxted Chisnall nee Mann (herein called Mavoura) on 19 June 1940.  She
had married Thomas H.R.
Chisnall on 7 April 1924.  The third defendant, a child
of Mavoura, was born on 3 October 1930.  The fourth defendant was born on
16
February 1932, the fifth defendant on 13 September 1933 and the sixth defendant
on 27 May 1935.  In each case the father on the
birth certificate is recorded
as Thomas Henry Reuben Chisnall, Seaman.  Mavoura also had an earlier child but
there is no suggestion
that that child's father was John Michael Solah.  That
child, Margaret H., was born in 1926 and she appears on the evidence to be
the
child of Mavoura and Thomas Chisnall.  
<P>

17   	The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/" class="autolink_findacts">Status of Children Act</a> </b>1996 contains a number
of presumptions of parentage which are relevant to the present question.  Under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(1)</a> a person is presumed to be a child's parent if the person's name is
entered as the child's parent in the Register.  In this case
the application of
the presumption would mean that in respect of the third, fourth, fifth and
sixth defendants their father was Thomas
Chisnall and that therefore they are
not issue of the full blood.
<P>

18   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act contains a presumption that a
child born to a woman during a marriage to which she is a party is presumed to
be a child
of the woman and her husband.  That presumption would apply in this
case.
<P>

19   	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> there is a presumption that a child born to a
woman is presumed to be a man's child if, at any time during the period
beginning not
earlier than 44 weeks and ending not less than 20 weeks before
the birth, the man and the woman cohabit but are not married.
<P>

20   	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15(1)</a> it is provided that a presumption arising
under this Division, or a parentage presumption arising under any other Act or
rule of
law, that is rebuttable, is rebuttable by proof on the balance of
probabilities.
<P>

21   	Subsection (2) provides that the presumptions under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> are rebuttable presumptions.
<P>

22   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> of the Act provides that if two or more
rebuttable presumptions referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15</a> conflict with each other and
are not rebutted in any proceedings, the presumption that appears to the court
to be more or most likely
to be correct prevails.
<P>

23   	There is both documentary evidence and a body of affidavit
evidence dealing with the circumstances surrounding the paternity
of the
fourth, fifth and six defendants.  The documentary evidence consists of records
relating to the marriage and divorce of the
mother of the fourth, fifth and
sixth defendants, Mavoura.  It is apparent that Thomas and Mavoura Chisnall
were married on 7 April
1924 as I have recounted and that a decree nisi of the
dissolution of that marriage was pronounced on 25 January 1938.  That decree
found established as facts the marriage and the ground for the divorce which
was that the respondent, Mavoura, had without just cause
or excuse wilfully
deserted the petitioner and without any such cause or excuse left him
continuously so deserted during three years
and upwards.  The affidavit in
support of the petition was sworn by the petitioner, Thomas Chisnall, which
affidavit was made on
29 April 1936.  
<P>

24   	In paragraph 5 of that affidavit he swore, "My said wife
has without just cause or excuse wilfully deserted me and without
such cause or
excuse has left me continuously so deserted during three years and upwards."
<P>

25   	The affidavit evidence addressed the cohabitation of John
Michael Solah and Mavoura from 1929 until separation many years
after the
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants were born.   
<P>

26   	Evidence was given by Esmeralda Powe who was a sister of
Mavoura.  She was born in 1912 and, accordingly, was 86 years of
age when she
swore her affidavit.  She said that her memory was good for a person of her
age.  Apparently her family lived at Mittagong
near Kallil's family where she
was born.  When the deponent was about 16 or 17 years of age she was living at
South Hurstville. 
On an occasion at that time Jack Solah (John Michael Solah)
brought his mother to see the deponent's mother.  At that time Jack asked
the
deponent to go out with her but she refused as she was already going out with
another young man.  Jack apparently continued to
make approaches but these were
rebuffed by the deponent who arranged for her sister, Mavoura, who was then
living opposite her with
her daughter, Margaret, to go and meet Jack.  She gave
evidence of her sister and Jack going out together for a short period and
then
deciding to get married.  She recounts that her sister's husband, Tom Chisnall,
would not give her sister a divorce and she
recalls her sister and Jack having
four children, Norma, John, Joan and Don while living together as man and wife.
Her sister worked
for a family called Silva and she recalls her sister and Jack
purchasing the hamburger shop from this family under the old Palais
in
Parramatta Road, Leichhardt.  She also gave evidence of the separation of
Thomas Chisnall and her sister after the birth of their
child, Margaret, and
that she had not seen Thomas Chisnall since that separation.  The child,
Margaret Hill, gave evidence and her
evidence was to the effect that her
earliest recollections were of living in a family with her mother, Mavoura, and
John Michael
Solah.  She recalls when Norma was born in October 1930 going to
the Royal Hospital for Women at Paddington to see her newly born
sister.  She
was also living with her mother Mavoura and John Michael Solah when the
children, John, Joan and Donald were born. 
She moved to live with her maternal
grandparents when she was 13 years old and after that time she discovered that
her actual father
was Thomas Chisnall who was a seaman who apparently visited
Sydney on an irregular basis.  
<P>

27   	The fourth defendant, Norma Everald Bless gave evidence.
As I have mentioned, she was born on 3 October 1930 and at the time
of swearing
her affidavit was 67 years of age.  She had suffered a stroke in 1988 but had
recovered sufficiently to be able to make
her affidavit.  She gave evidence of
her early family life when she lived with John Michael Solah and her mother,
Mavoura.  She addressed
them as "dad" and "mum".  Similarly her parents
referred to each other as either "Mavoura" and "John" or "Jack" respectively.
She
remembers them living together at the time of birth of her youngest
brother, Donald and continuing until they separated a year or
two prior to her
mother's death.  She recounts how her father introduced her as, "my daughter,
Norma" and the fact that from about
14 years of age she used to work in her
parents' hamburger shop underneath the old Palais in Parramatta Road,
Leichhardt.  She recalls
an incident when an American serviceman asked her out
in the shop in her father's presence.  Her father responded by refusing and
asking, "Do you know how old she is?  This is my daughter.  She's too young to
go out."  She gave evidence of a normal family relationship
as she grew up and
had her children.  This involved John Michael Solah being addressed by her
children as "grandfather".  She also
spoke of her elder sister, Margaret, who
was known as "Peggy".  She apparently lived with her mother's mother although
she did come
and stay for a short time with the deponent's family.
<P>

28   	The seventh defendant, Donald Barry Solah, also gave
evidence.  He was born on 27 May 1935.  He gives similar evidence to
that of
his sister, Norma, as to the family situation.  He remained with the family
until his parents separated when he went to stay
for a while with an aunt in
Queensland.  In due course he returned and lived with John Michael Solah and
his sister Joan and brother
John.  He like his sister, Norma, did not find out
that their birth certificates showed their father as Thomas Chisnall until
after
John Michael Solah had died.  
<P>

29   	All the above evidence is consistent with there having
been cohabitation between John Michael Solah and Mavoura Chisnall from
1929
until separation many years after the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
defendants were born.  There is one piece of evidence
to the contrary and that
is a declaration made by Sylvia Brittania Roberts.  She lives in Cootamundra
and she recalled that in February
1944 she went to stay for about three weeks
at Parramatta Road, Stanmore with Mrs Chisnall and Jack Solah.  She said, 
<P>

"I recall when I met Mrs Chisnall that she told me she had four children and I
recall her introducing them to me.  I remember that
the youngest was a boy
named Donald who was then about nine years of age.  To my certain recollection
all of those children were
introduced to me as Chisnalls."
<P>

30   	The form of this evidence is not very satisfactory as it
does not elaborate on how the children were introduced as Chisnalls.
 In
addition it is inaccurate in that Mrs Chisnall did in fact have five children,
not four.  
<P>

31   	Further evidence of this event was given by Donald Douglas
Solah whose other evidence I will deal with in relation to the
next question.
He was born in 1929 and he recalls that in February 1944 he was on holiday
staying with Jack Solah and his wife Maury
at their home in Sydney  The
children there were Margaret (known as "Peggy"), Norma, John, Joan and Donald.
At that stage Donald
was 14 years of age.  He recalls Mrs Roberts coming to
stay and was introduced to her.  Jack Solah introduced all the children except
Joan who was not there at the time, to Mrs Roberts, and according to Donald, he
said, "These are my children.  Of course, Peggy is
not mine, but I've raised
her as my own".  Given this more specific evidence, I would prefer it to that
of Mrs Roberts.  
<P>

32   	The only other evidence to which I should refer on this
aspect is the death certificate of John Solah.  That showed his issue
in order
of birth as Norma 31, John 30, Joan 28 and Donald 29, none deceased.  
<P>

33   	Having regard to the evidence to which I have referred I
am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that John Michael Solah
cohabited
with Mavoura Chisnall from 1929 until they married on 19 June 1940 and
thereafter they continued to cohabit until they
separated some time after 1944.
I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities, notwithstanding the
presumptions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a>, that the father of the fourth, fifth, sixth and
seventh defendants was John Michael Solah a brother of the full blood of the
deceased.
<P>

<b>3.	Was the deceased's late brother, Norman Solah, of the </b>
<P>

<b>full or half blood to the deceased?</b>
<P>

34   	On 2 September 1901 Sophia Brookfield registered the birth
of her son Norman which birth occurred on 8 July 1901 at Cootamundra.
 The
birth certificate showed that her son, Norman, was illegitimate and present at
registration.  The mother was shown initially
as Sophia Brookfield (Married
woman not living with husband) aged 34 years having been born in Melbourne,
Victoria.  On 24 December
1901 there was an amendment to the entry in column 7
giving information on the informant.  It was amended "For Sophia Brookfield
should read Sophia formerly Drummond now Brookfield".  No father is shown but
that is not surprising given the absence from the legislation
of provisions
inserted in 1934 which allowed the father of an illegitimate child to be shown
with his consent.
<P>

35   	It is necessary to determine whether or not Sophia was
married to Mr Brookfield and thus whether the presumption in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> of the Act
applies.  According to the birth certificates of two of the children of Sophia,
Alexander Charles Brookfield and Joseph
Brookfield, Sophia Drummond married a
Henry Brookfield at Fitzroy, Victoria on 25 August 1887.  However, a search of
the marriage
records in Victoria can find no trace of that marriage.  On 19
April 1903 the marriage certificate of Norman Kallil Solah and Sophia
Drummond
describes Sophia as being a spinster aged 36 years.  Sophia's death certificate
records that she had two marriages and issue
from each.  The first marriage is
said to have taken place at Cootamundra.  Its length is not known and was to
Charles Brookfield.
 The second is also shown as being at Cootamundra for 31
years and was to Kallil Solah.  For the children of the marriage in respect
of
the first marriage there are shown six children who are what are acknowledged
to be children of the half blood of the deceased.
 In respect of the second
marriage the children are shown as George, 36, Frank 35, John 33 and one male
deceased.  
<P>

36   	On this evidence which I have just recounted there are
indications that Sophia may not have gone through a ceremony of marriage
in
that she described herself as a spinster.  There is also evidence, to which I
will shortly refer, that could support a presumption
of marriage by
cohabitation and reputation.  Such a presumption is a presumption of law which
is only rebuttable by clear and cogent
evidence.  See <b>Jacombe v Jacombe
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20105%20CLR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 105 CLR 355</a> at 360.  The absence of a marriage certificate is not
fatal to such a conclusion.  See <b>Re Lynn </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20WAR%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) W.A.R. 17.</a>  The
presumption in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> can arise from a marriage which is established by the
operation of the common law presumption of marriage.  Accordingly, it is
necessary
to look at the evidence to see whether it supports a presumption of
marriage and also whether the evidence would also support any
cohabitation
between Sophia and Kahill for the period of 44 to 20 weeks before the birth of
Norman.  
<P>

37   	It is evident from a perusal of birth certificates of
Sophia Brookfield's children that there were six children registered
as
Brookfield, namely, in descending order of age, Alice, Janet, Henry, Clarice,
Alexander and Joseph.  Alexander is shown as having
been born at Parker Street,
Cootamundra on 29 June 1896 and Joseph was born 29 August 1898 at Cootamundra.
Evidence has been given
before me by Joan Lucas, a daughter of Clarice and also
by Donald Douglas Solah, a son of Norman, the son in question.  This evidence
principally relates to statements made by Clarice about the circumstances
concerning the birth of Norman.  That evidence has to be
viewed with some care
because at the date of birth of Norman, Clarice was at the most seven years of
age and perhaps eight years
of age when she first saw him.  Joan Lucas gave
evidence that during her childhood her mother, Clarice, said:-
<P>

"When I was about eight years old Mum put my sisters Alice, Janet and I into
the convent to be looked after whilst she travelled
around with old Sol helping
him with his occupation as a hawker.  After they came back Alice and I went to
live with them at Picton
and Norman was born about this time."
<P>

38   	She recounted statements made by her mother that Sophie
had four boys to Norman Solah and had six children to Henry Brookfield.
 She
also recalls her mother referring to Norman as her half brother.  Apparently
she referred to Norman, George, Frank and Jack
as half brothers.  Apparently
Alice was close to Norman in that when Uncle Norman was ill in 1939 she nursed
him before he died and
there were many visits between the families.
<P>

39   	Donald Douglas Solah, the son of Norman, gave evidence of
discussions that he had with Aunty Clarice.  In paragraph 6 he sets
out the
following conversations or statements made by Aunty Clarice.  
<P>

"When my mother (Sophie Drummond) was pregnant with Joseph (born 29 August
1898) my father (Henry Brookfield) went to South Africa
to win his fortune in
gold.
<P>

My mother went to Cootamundra to work with Mrs Michaels who ran a boarding
house and she did the housework.
<P>

Brookfield was a builder who went to Cootamundra and Sophie Drummond followed
him there and then he took off to South Africa.
<P>

She went to work with Mrs Michaels doing housework.
<P>

Mum put the three Brookfield girls (Alice, Janet and Clarice) into a home.
<P>

Old man Solah (Norman Kallil Solah) was a hawker on the road.
<P>

Mum met old man Solah at Mrs Michaels where he used to come.
<P>

Mum and old man Solah went on the road taking Alex and Jospeh with them.  They
put the three girls in a Catholic Convent at Cootamundra.
<P>

When they returned they had baby Norman with them.  Baby Norman was a small
baby at the time when they got back to Cootamundra.
<P>

I never forgave my mother for going off with that foreign man (Norman Kallil
Solah)." 
<P>

40   	In paragraph 4 he recounts the following:-
<P>

"My Aunty Clarice used to tell me that when she was a child she recalled that a
gentlemen would visit her mother (Sophie) and that
the children would have to
be respectful to this man and they called him "Mr Brookfield".  Aunt Clarice
told me that "My mother would
say to us children: "Say hello to Mr
Brookfield."
<P>

"Say goodbye to Mr Brookfield."
<P>

Aunty Clarice said to me that:
<P>

"We didn't know that he was our father."
<P>

Aunty Clarice told me that:
<P>

"This gentleman by the name of Mr Brookfield came and visited and there were
styles over the fence and he would lift us up and my
mother would say "Say
thanks to Mr Brookfield".
<P>

Aunty Clarice related one particular incident to me where she said:
<P>

"I remember one time this man said "Brookfield today, Smith tomorrow and Jones
the next day". That was the last time we ever saw
him."
<P>

41   	In general measure the recounting of statements of Aunty
Clarice by Donald are consistent with some of the statements recounted
by Joan
Lucas and if they are accepted then, clearly, Norman would appear to be the son
of Kallil and Sophie.
<P>

42   	Sophia died on 7 December 1939 shortly after Norman had
died.  The obituary in the Mittagong Star of 15 December 1939 recorded
the
following:-
<P>

"She was a native of Melbourne, Victoria, and lived at Barmedman before coming
to reside in Mittagong 27 years ago and was widely
known for her kindly
disposition, although, she did not take an active part in district
organisation.  
<P>

The late Mrs Solah's first marriage with Brookfield resulted in a family of
three daughters and three sons, all of whom are living.
 The daughters are
Alice (Mrs J Lodge), Clarice (Mrs F Lodge), and Jean (Mrs J Roberts) and three
sons are Harry, Alexander and Joseph.
<P>

Messrs George, Frank, Jack and Norman (deceased) were of the second union.
<P>

The sympathy of the whole district is extended to the husband, Mr K Solah, who
is totally blind and unable to get about without
assistance."
<P>

43   	This clearly corroborates the claim that Norman was the
son of Kallil.  
<P>

44   	There were tendered a number of photographs including
those of Norman and his father Kallil.  Leaving aside the fact that
there was a
dispute as to who were correctly depicted in the photographs I found them of
little assistance in deciding any likenesses.
<P>

45   	Exhibit 5 was a prayer book.  It has two inscriptions in
the front the top of which is, "To Sophie from Norman 29.4.1901.
 Then follow
the words, " Mrs N Kallil Solah Cootamundra".  Unfortunately, given the state
of the date, the inscription is not helpful.
 Evidently there has been rubbings
out and the date has been over-written.  Accordingly, there is nothing that I
would conclude from
that exhibit. 
<P>

46   	More important on the documentary side is the evidence in
the Collector's Book for the 1901 Census at Cootamundra.  The relevant
date was
Sunday March 31, 1901 and the certificate of the collector was made on 10 April
1901.  The relevant entry showed a Mrs Brookfield
of Murray Street, Cootamundra
and the total number of persons in the household being shown at that stage as
three males and four
females.  Norman was not born at this stage and,
accordingly, those numbers are perfectly consistent with Sophia residing in
Cootamundra
with her three daughters and her three sons.  This strongly
supports the absence of Mr Brookfield from the household.  It also indicates
that Kallil was not part of the household on census night but that may be
explained by his occupation which clearly took him away
from home.
<P>

47   	The other documentary evidence of note concerns a time in
May 1910 by which time the family had moved to Barmedman.  There
is an entry in
the Register of Admissions for the Barmedman Public School on 16 May 1910
showing the entry of Norman Brookfield being
a Roman Catholic and Joseph
Brookfield being a Roman Catholic.  The parent, or guardian, in each case is
shown as Norman Solah of
Barmedman, labourer.  There is no evidence of what
Norman was called at school but clearly he was registered as a Brookfield.  How
this came about does not appear.  There does not seem to be any doubt that
during his lifetime Norman was known as Norman Solah.
 His marriage certificate
shows in 1923 that he describes himself as Norman Solah, an orchardist of
Mittagong.  His death certificate
which shows his death as 1 September 1939
showed him as Norman Solah, labourer, that his father was Kallil Solah and his
mother,
Sophia Drummond.  The informant in this case was his brother, George.

<P>

48   	One document which causes difficulty is the death
certificate of Norman Kallil Solah.  He died on 22 March 1944 being then
a
resident of the Little Sisters of the Poor Home, Randwick.  His children were
shown as George 49, Frank  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=45%20James%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">45, James 46</a> living with none deceased.  This is
inconsistent with the death of Norman in 1939.  However, the informant is one
of the sisters
of the Little Sisters the Poor and an explanation for the
misinformation may be as deposed to by Mr Donald Douglas Solah.  That was,
that
at the date of his death, Norman Kallil Solah was blind and was being looked
after by a worker who worked in his market garden.
 That person may have given
information for the death certificate.  Although this is supposition there are
some other errors in the
death certificate.  These are that Frank's age was
incorrect since he was not aged 48 but 40 and reference to the marriage in New
South Wales to Sylvia Brumer,    which is clearly also incorrect.  
<P>

49   	There was one other piece of evidence given by Donald
Douglas Solah which concerned the situation after his father died in
1939.  The
family was destitute and his mother and the children went to live with Kallil
at Mittagong.  He recalls Kallil who was
blind calling him over and asking him
to stand next to him.  Kallil felt him all over with his hands from the top of
his head down
to his feet and felt his facial features.  He then said, "You are
going to be tall like me and your father, not short like these
others".  He did
the same apparently to George.  In this statement was a recognition of the
blood line. 
<P>

50   	If one stands back and looks at the evidence it is
apparent that the records of the Census would support the fact that Mr
Brookfield was no longer living with Sophia prior to the birth of Norman.  The
evidence given of the statements by Aunty Clarice
clearly explains the absence
of Mr Brookfield from a time prior to the birth of Joseph, ie, before 1898.
The question is whether
that evidence is sufficiently reliable.  There are
reasons that would incline me to accept that the recollection could be correct
given that Aunty Clarice was only eight at the time.  The reasons for this are
that the separation which placed her and her two sisters
in a convent for some
years are events which might be likely to stay in her memory.  Similarly the
cessation of that residence and
living with the family which included the new
child, are also such that they might remain in her recollection.  It is not as
though
Clarice had little contact with that child thereafter as it is apparent
on the evidence that she was close to him and, indeed, for
some years, was
involved in raising him to manhood.
<P>

51   	The major documentary evidence to the contrary are the
records of the Barmedman public school and the death certificate of
Kallil.
The latter has a number of inaccuracies and I would not place great store on
the information about the family in that certificate.
 The school records may
well be explained by the fact that the birth of Norman was prior to the
marriage of Sophie to Kallil.
<P>

52   	In the circumstances I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that any cohabitation between Sophia and Mr Brookfield
ceased on
or before 29 August 1898.  However, the evidence of the six children being born
to Sophia and Mr Brookfield together with
the history of living in Victoria,
followed by a move to Cootamundra, is probably sufficient to establish the
marriage between Sophia
and Mr Brookfield.  Accordingly, the presumption in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a>
arises.  
<P>

53   	Counsel for the first defendant did not rely on the
presumption in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> of the Act no doubt due to the difficulty in establishing
cohabitation in the relevant weeks before the birth of Norman.  However,
given
the explained absence of Mr Brookfield and, accepting as I do the statements
attributed to Aunty Clarice, the true situation
is clear.
<P>

54   	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities,
notwithstanding the presumption that arises under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soca199/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a>, that the father of
Norman Solah born on 8 July 1901 at Cootamundra was Norman Kallil Solah.  It is
not without significance that
he was named Norman as his father's first born
son.  Accordingly, I find that Norman Solah was a brother of the full blood of
the
deceased.  His issue who are entitled to take his share of the estate of
the deceased under the statutory trust for sale are:-
<P>

Roma Daphne Begsma
<P>

Norman Kevin Solah
<P>

Donald Douglas Solah
<P>

George Stanley Solah
<P>

Kathleen Annette Jacobsen 
<P>

Raymond Peter Solah
<P>

55   	The parties have indicated that they would like the
opportunity to formulate orders once I have made the appropriate findings
of
fact.
<P>

56   	Accordingly, I direct the parties to bring in short
minutes.
