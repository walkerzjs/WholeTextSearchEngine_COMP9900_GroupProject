<u>REGINA v. T.R</u><p>
60606/95<p>
Friday, 1 November 1996<p>
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL<p>
HUNT CJ AT CL, SMART, IRELAND JJ<p>
CATCHWORDS:	SUPPLY OF LARGE COMMERCIAL QUANTITY OF COCAINE-PLEA OF
GUILTY-ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY APPLICANT TO AUTHORITIES - SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES OF
APPLICANT<p>
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED:	Reserved<p>
ALLOWED/DISMISSED:		Allowed.<p>
<p>
<center><b>HEADNOTE</b><p>
<b></center></b><u></u><p>
<u><center></u>The applicant applied for an extension of time and leave to
appeal against the severity of a sentence of 6 years, comprising a minimum
term
of 3 years 9 months and an additional term of 2 years 3 months, for the offence
of supplying not less than a large commercial
quantity of cocaine.<p>
<p>
<b>Held:</b><p>
<b></b>1. 	Having regard to the valuable assistance provided as to the subject
offence and those involved, the assistance provided in relation
to other
matters of much importance, the full significance and use of that latter
assistance now being revealed and the statement
made to the applicant as to how
he would be treated and confined, this is a very rare case where a greater
discount should be given
than that allowed by the judge.<p>
<p>
2. 	This case also involved special circumstances. These include the fact that
this is the applicant's first custodial sentence,
that he is a young man and
will need considerable support, supervision and protection on his release, that
he will have to be alert
to maintain his own security and that of his family
and that this is likely to place restrictions on his movements after release.<p>
<p>
<b>Orders:</b><p>
<b></center></b>1.	Extend the time within which the applicant may apply for
leave to appeal against sentence.<p>
2.	Leave to appeal granted.<p>
3.	Appeal allowed.<p>
4.	In lieu of the sentence imposed, the applicant is sentenced to five years
imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 2 years 8
months starting on 29 July
1994 and ending on 28 March 1997 when the applicant will be eligible for
release on parole and an additional
term of 2 years 4 months commencing on 29
March 1997 and ending on 28 July 1999.<p>
5.	Order that the Supplementary Reasons be placed in a sealed envelope within
the court file not to be opened save with the leave
of a judge of the Court of
Criminal Appeal and that the envelope be endorsed accordingly.  A copy of the
Supplementary Reasons is
to be made available to the sentencing judge and to
each of the Director of Public Prosecutions for perusal by him and his
nominated
officers and the solicitor for the applicant for perusal by the
applicant's legal advisers and the applicant.  They are not to be
otherwise
published or distributed except with the leave of a judge of the Court of
Criminal Appeal. <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u>HUNT CJ at CL:</b>  I agree with the orders proposed by Smart J, for
the reasons which he has given.<p>
									<p>
<b>SMART J:</b>  TR has applied for an extension of time and leave to appeal
against the severity of a sentence imposed by the District Court following
his
plea of guilty to a charge of between 9 February and 29 July 1994 supplying not
less than a large commercial quantity of cocaine
and the Court taking into
account three matters relating to the possession of a firearm, ammunition and
an ampoule of steroid.  TR
received a total sentence of 6 years comprising a
minimum term of 3 years 9 months and an additional term of 2 years 3 months.
The
maximum penalty is life imprisonment.<p>
<p>
At the sentence hearing the estimated quantity of 2000 grams was acknowledged
not to be precise but the applicant's approach was
that even assuming the
quantity should be somewhat less it would nonetheless come within the
definition of a large commercial quantity.<p>
<p>
The applicant had been under telephone surveillance from February 1994 until
his arrest on 29 July 1994.  Gradually the picture emerged.
 The judge has
described in some detail the applicant's method of operation.  In summary, the
applicant purchased supplies of cocaine
and then caused small quantities to be
sold to street level drug users.  He operated through two low cost hotels.  The
customer attended
at the reception desk and indicated his requirements.  After
payment of the nominated amount the customer was directed to a part
of the
premises where the quantity of the drug was handed over together with a clean
syringe, swabs, plastic spoons and an ampoule
of saline solution.  If desired,
a room could be obtained in which to administer the drug.  This cost a further
$5.00.  A lot of
sales were made.<p>
<p>
Cash had been transferred by the applicant or his family to another country.
Substantial assets have been seized from the prisoner
and his family who have
co-operated with the authorities.  Indeed, the prisoner's co-operation has
resulted in $380,000 being recovered
and forfeited to the State.  A solicitor
with the Crime Commission described the level of co-operation as being of the
highest order.<p>
<p>
The applicant was aged about 21 at the time of the offences.  He was a
principal if not the principal in a highly organised and quite
sophisticated
drug selling operation.  He controlled and directed it.  There was a strong
case against the applicant but his plea
of guilty saved considerable court and
police time and much public expense.  As a result of his assistance seven or
eight other persons
were arrested and charged in connection with the offence of
supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine.  The applicant undertook
to
give evidence in all proceedings against his co-accused.<p>
<p>
The judge recorded that the applicant had offered other assistance of an
unusually high level to the authorities.  The judge found
that this and the
applicant's admissions at an early stage demonstrated substantial contrition on
his part.  The judge was satisfied
that, as a result of the assistance given
and to be given, the applicant's life was in danger and members of his family
were also
at risk.  The threats made to his safety had been taken very
seriously as had the threats to his family.<p>
<p>
The subjective features found by the judge included that the applicant,
although born in Australia, spent four years of his boyhood
in a war torn
country.  The family were driven out by the bombing and eventually returned to
Australia where they lived in uncomfortable
conditions for some time.  He left
school at the age of 16.  He was intelligent and had marked natural skills.
The judge thought
that given his contrition and that his drug activities had
been stopped at an early age there were significant prospects of
rehabilitation.
 Further, other criminals are unlikely to want to work with
him.  The applicant's prior record comprised two minor offences unrelated
to
drugs.  They were dealt with by a small fine and a recognizance respectively.<p>
<p>
The judge took into account that the applicant would serve his sentence in
considerable isolation and that his family, for security
reasons may have to
live at some distance from him thereby reducing the frequency of family
contact.<p>
<p>
Correctly, much emphasis was placed on the gravity of the offence and the
harmful consequences to others.  The judge thought that
an appropriate total
sentence was eleven years.  That sentence, was reduced firstly by twelve months
for the substantial co-operation
in the recovery of the crime proceeds and
secondly by a further four years for the substantial assistance provided and to
be provided
to the authorities.  The remaining six years were apportioned as
earlier mentioned.<p>
<p>
There was no challenge to the starting point of eleven years by the applicant
or the Crown and it was one which was well within the
sound exercise of the
court's discretion.  On the material before the judge the sentence imposed was
not open to attack.<p>
<p>
For compelling security reasons the authorities could not in their advice to
the sentencing court indicate fully the significance
of the assistance which
the applicant had given in areas other than that related to the particular
offence.  The authorities considered
that it was not prudent even to indicate
that an operation of considerable public importance was on foot given the
applicant's identity.
 Neither party could be told that an adjournment should
be sought.  This necessarily meant that the judge was not told.  Subsequent
to
the hearing before the judge and after the operation became a matter of public
knowledge the full significance became apparent.
 The assistance was of much
value and helped to expose a wide range of criminal conduct and the many
involved.  It also provided
some solid and truthful evidence.  The assistance
has continued.  It suffices to say of the assistance that its extent and
importance
rank it amongst the most valuable assistance provided to the
authorities.  In furtherance of the protection of the applicant and
his family
and the proceedings in train and to be instituted and the further
investigations by the authorities I have included the
details in supplementary
reasons to be given to the parties and the sentencing judge but otherwise to be
placed in a sealed envelope
not to be opened or otherwise published except with
the leave of the court.  There is one further matter.  Initially, a broad
statement
was made to the applicant as to how he would be treated and confined.
It was so broad that it was understood in a sense different
from that which may
have been intended.  That statement has not been able to be met according to
its terms as understood.  His present
incarceration is somewhat more severe.<p>
<p>
Having regard to the valuable assistance provided as to the subject offence and
those involved, the assistance provided in relation
to other matters of much
importance, the full significance and use of that latter assistance now being
revealed, and the statement
mentioned, this is that very rare case where a
greater discount should be given than that allowed by the judge.  The term
"very rare"
is used advisedly.<p>
<p>
The appropriate starting point remains a total sentence of 11 years.  The
reduction of one year allowed by the judge for the assistance
to recover the
crime proceeds is sound.  The discount for the matters referred to in the
preceding paragraph should be five years,
resulting in a total sentence of five
years.  There are special circumstances.  This is the applicant's first
custodial sentence.
 He is a young man and he will need considerable support,
supervision and protection on his release.  He will have to re-train. 
With his
obvious intelligence that may involve considerable study to obtain
qualifications that will enable him to undertake satisfying
work.  He will have
to be alert to maintain his own security and that of his family.  That is
likely to result in restrictions on
his movements even after release.  The
sentence should comprise a minimum term of 2 years 8 months and an additional
term of 2 years
4 months.  I have taken into account the offences mentioned on
Form 2 to which reference has previously been made.<p>
<p>
I propose the following orders:<p>
1.	Extend the time within which the applicant may apply for leave to appeal
against 	sentence.<p>
2.	Leave to appeal granted.<p>
3.	Appeal allowed.<p>
4.	In lieu of the sentence imposed, the applicant is sentenced to five years
imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 2 years 8
months starting on 29 July
1994 and ending on 28 March 1997 when the applicant will be eligible for
release on parole and an additional
term of 2 years 4 months commencing on 29
March 1997 and ending on 28 July 1999.<p>
5.	Order that the Supplementary Reasons be placed in a sealed envelope within
the court file not to be opened save with the leave
of a judge of the Court of
Criminal Appeal and that the envelope be endorsed accordingly.  A copy of the
Supplementary Reasons is
to be made available to the sentencing judge and to
each of the Director of Public Prosecutions for perusal by him and his
nominated
officers and the solicitor for the applicant for perusal by the
applicant's legal advisers and the applicant.  They are not to be
otherwise
published or distributed except with the leave of a judge of the Court of
Criminal Appeal.<p>
