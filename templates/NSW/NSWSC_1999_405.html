<P>

<b>PROSECUTIONS v. FRANK ROBERT WEBB &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	This is an application pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s30a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30A(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/" class="autolink_findacts">Proceeds of Crime Act 1987</a>
(Cth) seeking an extension of the waiting period for an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a>
of the Act with respect to certain property the subject of a restraining order
made under that Act, which order was varied by Barr,
J. on 8 December 1997 to
include under the effect of that order, the relevant property.
<P>

2	Putting aside for the moment the detail of the statutory scheme, in the event
that the extension is not granted, on the submissions
of the applicants - that
is the first and second defendants - property which they claim to be theirs
would, in consequence of the
operation of the forfeiture provision of the Act,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a>, be forfeited to the Commonwealth on or about 19 May 1999, in consequence
of the expiry of six months from the conviction of the
third defendant.
<P>

3	It is contended on behalf of the applicants that the conviction of the third
defendant, which is the relevant conviction for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a>, occurred
on or about 19 November 1998.
<P>

4	It is contended however, by the Director of Public Prosecutions for the
Commonwealth, that the conviction had long occurred by
that date, and that, by
reason of the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a>, the relevant property is already forfeited to
the Commonwealth.
<P>

5	The Director concedes that there is available in certain circumstances
statutory provision to enable the applicants to seek to
recover the property,
notwithstanding forfeiture.  Nonetheless, the question of whether the
forfeiture has or has not occurred is
a question of considerable importance
under the statute.  That question turns upon when the conviction occurred.
<P>

6	In that regard I have been provided with the material in the affidavit of
Graham Marshall sworn 29 April 1999, to which is annexed
a copy of the
indictment in relation to the third defendant; the transcript of proceedings
before Solomon DCJ on that indictment,
which is marked Exhibit B; a further
indictment presented against that defendant on 17 July 1998, which is marked
Exhibit C, and
to which indictment - as he had to the former indictment - the
third defendant had pleaded guilty;  the transcript of the proceedings
on that
second indictment on 17 July 1998; and  subsequently the transcript of the
proceedings on 19 November 1998, which included
the continuation of the
proceedings on sentence;  the addresses on penalty and the sentence.
<P>

7	There have also been tendered on this application certain extracts from the
District Court file, including the notes of proceedings:
 of 28 November 1997;
23 January 1998;  20 February 1998;  the callover dates;  the notes of 11 May
1998 and subsequent occasions;
but most notably the note of 17 July 1998 signed
by the judge reading relevantly,  "Plea:  Guilty to all three counts. ...
Stood
over to 7/8/98 for sentence before me.  B/R.  Signed:  Judge."  (B/R
apparently means "bail refused"); 	the note of 7 August 1998
in which it is
noted that the matter is stood over to 13 August 1998, part heard;  the note of
13 August 1998, which is noted and
initialled by the associate and contains the
following, "Sentence S/0P/HVO 9/11/98 remand in custody.  Bail refused, (P/H)";
and
relevantly the notes of 19 November 1998,  "See indictment for sentence
imposed";  and the copy of the back sheets of the two indictments
setting out
the entries signed by the judge for 19 November.
<P>

8	All of this material was tendered without objection or challenge.  Both
parties provided to me written submissions.  Those submissions,
with the
amendment of those of Mr. Aitken to show the correct date he there refers to,
will be attached to the file copy of this
judgment.  The evidentiary material
is conveniently set out in the submissions of the Director.
<P>

9	As to the submissions by Mr. Aitken for the applicant, he informs me that he
does not raise any constitutional question, as might
have been foreshadowed in
paragraph 13 of those submissions, nor is there presently before me any
application under paragraph 14
of the submissions.
<P>

10	Although other orders were sought by the motion in addition to the extension
of the waiting period, it has been agreed that any
questions raised by the
seeking of those other orders, should await the determination of whether or not
the extension sought in the
present matter be granted.  Consequently, there
remains before me, as the parties agreed, the sole question of the
identification
of the date of conviction for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.30</a> of the Act.
                                   
<P>

11	Counsel's extensive researches, I am informed, disclose no statutory
provision or rule of court that might be applicable or of
assistance in
ascertaining when conviction occurred for the purposes of the section.  
<P>

12	I am informed that if I concluded in favour of the applicants on the issue
of when the conviction occurred and that I was satisfied
the applicants had
diligently prosecuted without undue delay their application, the Director would
not oppose the making of the extension
order.  In that event, the applicants
are to provide to the Director a memorandum showing the diligence of
prosecutions and the Director
is to raise any asserted inadequacy in that
material by this afternoon or before 10.00 am tomorrow morning, so that if
adequate material
is provided, if there is no opposition from the Director and
in the event that I rule otherwise in favour of the application, a formal
order
might then be pronounced.
<P>

13	On the other hand, if I am not in favour of the applicants' submissions and
hold that a forfeiture has occurred, it would only
be necessary for me to have
that material if it is sought to leave the matter in a condition where only one
issue remains should
there be an appeal since time, on any view of it, is
short.  
<P>

14	The submissions for both parties accept that conviction in the law of New
South Wales, which here is the law applicable, it would
seem, and caught up by
the provisions of the Judiciary Act and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/" class="autolink_findacts">Proceeds of Crime Act</a>, means
different things for different purposes.  
<P>

15	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/" class="autolink_findacts">Proceeds of Crime Act</a> provides that in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5(1):</a>-
<P>

	"For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be taken to be convicted of an
offence if ..."
<P>

16	Thereafter are set out certain circumstances, the first of which
provides:-
<P>

	"(a)	The person is convicted, whether summarily or on indictment, of the
offence."
<P>

17	This provision appears to relate to the concept as employed in the relevant
court.
<P>

18	The other circumstances later referred to appear to relate to extensions of
the concept.
<P>

19	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5(3)</a> provides that:-
<P>

	"For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be taken to have been convicted
of an offence in a particular State or Territory:
-
<P>

	(a)	 where the person is taken to have been convicted of the offence by reason
of paragraph (1)(a) - the person was convicted of
the offence in a court in
that State or Territory."
<P>

20	Thus, the relevant State or Territory meaning of the term is caught up.
<P>

21	In New South Wales, that meaning has been considered by the Court of Appeal
in <b>Della Patrona v. Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) No 2</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR 257</a> in the context of the very legislative provision here
applicable and particularly for the purposes of ascertaining from when the
period runs.  At p.266 in the judgment of Kirby, P, with whom Priestley and
Meagher, JJA. agreed, his Honour dealt with the submissions
discussed,
initially at p.265B, as to when a conviction occurs.  Kirby, P. concluded, in
accordance with authority, that conviction
occurred when the trial judge
indicated that he accepted and proposed to act upon the jury's verdict of
guilty.  The order of remand
was said to have sufficiently indicated acceptance
of the verdict of the jury (at p.266G).
<P>

22	In passing I note Meagher, JA's comments concerning the raising of
constitutional questions which no doubt have contributed to
the view taken on
behalf of the applicant that no constitutional question should not be raised
before me.
<P>

23	It is common ground that I am bound by <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra) if it is
not to be distinguished here.
<P>

24	My attention has been drawn to what is said in <b>Maxwell v. The Queen</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20135%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 135 ALR 1</a> by the High Court of Australia.  Both parties have contended
that various of the observations therein contained are in their favour.
 Both
parties accept that those observations are made in a different context and
without reference to the construction of the term
"conviction" as it appears in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/" class="autolink_findacts">Proceeds of Crime Act</a> and thus, those observations, although powerful, are
obita.  Both arguments accept that unless I conclude I am not bound by the
decision
of the Court of Appeal in <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra), I will not
need to consider further those observations.
<P>

25	Indeed, Mr. Aitken has gone so far as to accept that unless the decision in
<b>Della Patrona</b> (supra) is to be distinguished from the present situation,
then I would have to conclude that the convictions occurred, as submitted
by
the Director, at least by 7 August. 
<P>

26	The relevant matters of fact in this matter, referred to in the written
submissions of the Director commencing at paragraph 3
and concluding at
paragraph 10, are conceded by the applicants and established by the written
material tendered in evidence I have
already referred to.  Those facts are very
similar to those in <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra).
<P>

27	The bases on which it is said that I should distinguish <b>Della Patrona</b>
(supra) include firstly, that that case concerned the acceptance by a trial
judge of the verdict of a jury rather than the formal
confession of guilt by
the prisoner, involved in a plea of guilty;  secondly, that that decision
involved an application for forfeiture
of the property of the convicted accused
herself;  and thirdly, unlike in that case, in the present case the trial
judge, on 19 November,
as is set out in paragraph 10 of the Director's
submissions, said,  "No, I haven't sentenced him.  So he hasn't been
convicted."
 Subsequently in his remarks on sentence he said that the accused
was convicted and the record for that day had inserted in it the
words
"convicted" and "sentenced".
<P>

28	As to the first two matters they do not, in my view, amount to matters which
would sufficiently operate to displace what was
said by Kirby, P. and accepted
by the court in <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra).
<P>

29	In my view, the word "conviction" is used in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/" class="autolink_findacts">Proceeds of Crime Act</a> in a
consistent way as referable to the one event, whatever it may be.  There seems
no valid basis to distinguish between the situation
where property of an
accused or of another is to be forfeited.  Nor does there seem to be any
validity in the distinction put forward
between the acceptance of the verdict
of a jury and the acceptance of an offered plea.  While for many purposes there
is a distinction
and while there may be available in Commonwealth matters to
which the Judiciary Act applies, the otherwise obsolete opportunities
to set
aside or prevent the conviction by moving in arrest of judgment or for a
verdict, nil obstante veredicto or, in the case of
a plea, to seek to withdraw
the plea or set aside the acceptance of a plea, nonetheless the test proposed
in <b>Della Patrona </b>(supra) and derived from a substantial body of case law
propounds that conviction occurs, whether later to be set aside or reversed,
upon any acceptance of the fact of guilt, as established by a verdict or a plea
and the acting on it as, where the judge acts upon
that plea or verdict in some
formal manner equivalent to the pronouncement or entry of judgment, such as the
remand in custody for
sentence, ie., where there is some unequivocal, formal
act of recognition of the fact of guilt and the proceeding to penalty.  
<P>

30	The third matter presents more difficulty.  Mr. Game, SC., who appears for
the Director, put that it was apparent that the trial
judge did not realise the
legal effect of what it was he was doing when he remanded in custody, as
amounting to his convicting the
accused and that his words and actions on the
19th were explicable on the basis that although he had, both in law and in
fact, convicted,
a mistaken belief that sentence was essential to conviction
caused him to pronounce the conviction on the 19th when he sentenced,
that is,
on that day he only made a formal pronouncement of conviction since he was
under the mistaken belief he had not already
convicted.
<P>

31	Bearing in mind the seriousness of the question and its potential for the
forfeiture of the property of a person, not the accused,
had I been of view
that his Honour had been, at any time subsequent to the plea, other than of an
intention to convict, I would have
held that the conviction did not occur until
the 19th.
<P>

32	It is inconceivable to me that a judge could convict an accused person, thus
so dramatically changing that person's status, unintentionally,
whether that
unintentional conviction arose from ignorance of the true state of the law or
the facts, but in this case it seems patent
that at all times his Honour
intended to convict and took the steps that <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra) has
held amounts to convicting. 
<P>

33	In my view the views his Honour expressed on the l9th are not such as to
lead me to hold as a question of fact that conviction
did not occur until that
day.
<P>

34	I am unable to distinguish <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra).  Indeed, since, on
the authorities, I consider the fact of conviction is primarily to be
determined by the act publicly
performed by the judge in the recognition of
guilt and acceptance of it, there is every reason for me to feel confirmed in
the view
that <b>Della Patrona </b>(supra) is not only binding but right.
<P>

35	In those circumstances, and in accordance with the views I have expressed,
it is necessary for me to resolve the question of
whether there was a
conviction or not against the applicants and I do so.
<P>

36	Therefore, I find that on 11 May 1998 there was an initial conviction, that
on 17 July 1998 there were further convictions and
that what thereafter
occurred was the proceedings on sentence in respect of those convictions. 
<P>

37	Nonetheless, in the event that a court, having power to do so, should
consider that I am wrong or that <b>Della Patrona</b> (supra) was wrongly
decided, it might remain open to the applicants to obtain a favourable
determination of the application, provided
it were determined in their favour,
before 18 May.  Consequently, if they are minded to appeal, it will be
necessary that all possible
steps be taken to put the matter in proper order so
that an appeal might be determined well before that.
<P>

38	I would, therefore, direct counsel to bring in tomorrow short minutes as to
the form of the appropriate orders giving effect
to these views and dealing
with any other issues outstanding in relation to the application including, if
necessary, diligent prosecution
without undue delay, so if the matter goes
before the Court of Appeal it will be in a position to deal with it as
expeditiously as
might, for that court, be convenient.
