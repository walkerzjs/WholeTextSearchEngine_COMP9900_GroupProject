<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	There has been controversy over the admissibility of a
number of questions asked of a witness this morning in re-examination
and also
over leave granted by me to Mr Drabsch to have Mr Shand of Queen's Counsel ask
two further questions in cross examination
after the re-examination of the
witness.
<P>

2   	In cross examination Mr Shand showed the witness a document
which contained a schedule of events proposed to take place on
15 July 1991.
He then asked the following questions and received the following answers:
<P>

"That was in a series of actions which you were scheduled to take part in,
wasn't it?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  Did you?
<P>

A.  No, not personally.
<P>

Q.  Well, did you know that you were intended to take part in them before they
happened?
<P>

A.  No.
<P>

Q.  You weren't told?
<P>

A.  No.
<P>

Q.  Were you present when those actions took place?
<P>

A.  I was there when it happened in the head office area, yes.
<P>

Q.  Did you know why it was happening?
<P>

A.  Not specifically, no."
<P>

Subsequently, the following transpired in the cross examination:
<P>

"Q.  Did you not indicate to this Court on your oath at the time you saw these
things happening you didn't know why they were happening?
<P>

A.  I would like to revise that if that's the case.
<P>

Q.  Did you not swear that only a few minutes ago?
<P>

A.  I'd like to revise that answer if that's --
<P>

Q.  First answer my question.  Did you?
<P>

A.  Yes, I did.
<P>

Q.  That's what you swore, isn't it?
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Is the answer yes?
<P>

THE WITNESS:  Yes.
<P>

SHAND:  Q.  And you knew it was false when you gave the answer, didn't you?
<P>

A.  Yes."
<P>

3   	In re-examination, Mr Hollo of counsel sought to ask the
witness what was in his mind when he gave the answer he subsequently
admitted
was false, what the revision was that he subsequently wanted to make and why he
admitted that the previous answer was false.
 These questions were objected to.
I allowed those questions and indicated I should give my reasons, which I now
do.
<P>

4   	Re-examination is now governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act
1995</a> which provides:
<P>

"39  On re-examination:
<P>

(a) a witness may be questioned about matters arising out of evidence given by
the witness in cross examination; and
<P>

(b) other questions may not be put to the witness unless the court gives
leave." 
<P>

It seems to have been the intention of the legislation to repeat the common law
as to re-examination:  see the Report of the Australian
Law Reform Commission
on Evidence, ALRC 26, Vol 1, pars 628-9; Odgers' Uniform Evidence Law (3rd ed,
1998)  [39.3].  The section
seeks to achieve this end by employing the
expression "matters arising out of evidence given by the witness in cross
examination".
<P>

5   	Authorities have made plain that the re-examiner is not
limited solely to eliciting clarifications or giving explanations where
there
is an ambiguity, but is allowed: 
<P>

"... wherever an answer in cross examination would, unless supplemented or
explained, leave the court with an impression of the
facts, whether facts in
issue or facts relating to credibility, which is capable of being construed
unfavourably to the party calling
the witness and which represents a distortion
or incomplete account of the truth as the witness is able to present it:"
<P>

Cross on Evidence (Aust ed, 1996) par 17,605; <b>Wojcic v Incorporated Nominal
Defendant</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1969/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] VicRp 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20VR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] VR 323</a> at 326; <b>Wentworth v Rogers [No 10]</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8
NSWLR 389</a> at 409; and see 6 Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn Rev) s1896.  It has
been specifically decided by the Full Court in South Australia
that these
matters extend to subjective considerations going to the mental state of the
witness at the time of answer:  <b>Reg v Lavery (No 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2020%20SASR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 20 SASR 430</a>
at 435 and 451, <b>Reg v Szach</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2023%20SASR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 23 SASR 504</a> at 511-9; 566-70; 587-8.
In the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> this broad approach is in my view adopted by the
wording of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39(1)</a> and confirmed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(1).</a>
<P>

6   	There have been various statements in the past as to
limitations upon re-examination.  It has been stated that the re-examiner
may
not cross examine his own witness:  Phipson on Evidence (14th ed, 1990) par
12-28.  This is no doubt true if it means that, having
obtained an answer from
a proper question in re-examination, the re-examiner attempts, particularly if
by leading questions, to deflect
the witness from that answer or get him to
modify it.  It is also sometimes said that in  re-examination one cannot get
the witness
to alter or reverse an answer, or a clear answer, given in cross
examination, but I can find no authority for a proposition in those
terms.
<P>

7   	Whilst modern authority rejects the proposition that
re-examination is limited to clarifications and explanations of ambiguities,
it
may be that it is correct that, where the question in re-examination is put
upon the basis of making a necessary clarification
or explanation, and it
appears to the Court that there is no lack of clarity or ambiguity, then the
question may be rejected, particularly
if the result of allowing it may well be
that the Judge would feel obliged in his or her discretion to allow
considerable further
cross examination as a result of the answers:  see
<b>Hadid v Australis Media Ltd</b> SCNSW Sperling J 5 November 1996 unreported;
<b>Shipp v Cameron (No 2)</b> SCNSW Einstein J 13 October 1997 unreported.
<P>

8   	I came to the conclusion that, the credit of Mr Lepparde,
having been compromised by answers that he gave to Mr Shand in cross
examination, the questions that I allowed in re-examination this morning fell
within the broader principle set out above and ought
be allowed.  They were
proper questions tending to re-establish the witness' credit within the general
principle in the cases referred
to.  I did not admit them simply by reference
to an apparent lack of clarity or ambiguity, although, in coming to my
decision,  I
did advert to the fact that some lack of clarity may have arisen
from the use of the singular pronoun "it" in the question leading
to the
impugned answer, whereas the antecedents of that preposition, in the questions
and answers immediately before and immediately
after the impugned question,
appeared to be plural antecedents.  I also adverted to the fact that the
witness had attempted, when
cross-examined, to say that he sought to revise his
earlier answer.   Mr Shand quite properly had not allowed him to do so, as such
revision was not an answer to the questions Mr Shand had chosen to ask.
Nonetheless, the answer was not struck from the record, there
being no
application to do so, and stood as part of the cross examination, from which
judgment had to be made as to whether or not
the re-examination sought
arose.
<P>

9   	For those reasons I did allow in re-examination the
questions referred to.  Because of the vexed nature of the question of
the
antecedent to the preposition "it", I thought it proper, after the witness had
given his answer in re-examination, to allow Mr
Shand to ask two further
questions in cross examination on that subject matter only, in the exercise of
my discretion and as a matter
of ensuring fairness to both the opposing parties
in relation to this matter.
