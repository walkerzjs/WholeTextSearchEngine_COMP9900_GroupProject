<b><u>NO. 1636 OF 1998</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>HOSPITALITY EXCELLENCE PTY. LIMITED &amp; ORS.  V.  THE STATE OF NEW
SOUTH WALES</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>(On admissibility of evidence - see p20 of transcript)
<P>

1  	I have heard submissions on whether I should admit parts of the
affidavit of Mr Leary sworn 20 November 1998, and in particular
various parts
of paragraphs between 141 and 152 inclusive of that affidavit.
<P>

2  	It appears that in those paragraphs Mr Leary is purporting to
express an expert opinion in relation to three matters:  firstly,
the capacity
of the plaintiff to undertake the work of the kind which became available with
the privatisation of the Commonwealth
Employment Service; secondly, the
likelihood of the plaintiff being successful in obtaining that work; and
thirdly, the likely profitability
of that work.
<P>

3  	Mr Meagher SC for the defendant submitted that the evidence is
not admissible as expert evidence under s79 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>. He pointed out
that that section required that there be specialised knowledge, that the
specialised knowledge be based on the witness's
training, study or experience,
and that the opinion be wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.  Mr
Meagher referred me to
the case of<b> </b><u>HG v R</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20160%20ALR%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 160 ALR 554</a> and
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 451.</a> He relied particularly on the judgment of Gleeson CJ at
paragraphs 38 to 45 of that judgment. He also referred me to the judgment
of
Gaudron J in the High Court and Mason P in the Court of Appeal. Mr Meagher also
referred me to the case of<b> </b><u>Quick v Stollen</u><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1200.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1200</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20157%20ALR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 157 ALR
615</a>, especially 616-9, and<b> </b><u>NMFM Property v Citibank Limited</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20161%20ALR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 161 ALR 476</a> at 577.
<P>

4  	Mr Meagher submitted that the evidence relied on to base the
relevant specialised knowledge here was of the utmost generality
and therefore
of little weight. He submitted that, in the absence of detailed evidence of the
circumstances of tenders in the past
and of the circumstances of the granting
of tenders under the new system, it was not shown that Mr Leary had specialised
knowledge
which would base an opinion as to the likelihood of tenders being
accepted. Similarly, there was no sufficient evidence to base a
finding of
specialised knowledge in relation to the financial outcomes of the acceptance
of such tenders.
<P>

5  	Mr Slattery QC for the plaintiffs submitted that the history of
successful tendering showed that Mr Leary had the experience
to form a judgment
as to what was likely to be a successful tender under the new circumstances,
and also the profitability of undertakings
pursuant to successful  tendering.
In relation to profitability, Mr Slattery submitted that it was an area of
expertise for an experienced
business person to have knowledge, in relation to
a particular class of business, the costs involved in such a class of business,
and the returns from it. He submitted that, on the question of the probability
of acceptance, there was a significant common factor
between the business
previously undertaken by the plaintiff and that available under the new system,
namely, case management for
the long term unemployed.  Mr Slattery submitted
that I should prefer the more liberal approach to expert evidence, suggested by
the judgments of Gaudron J in <u>HG</u> and Branson J in<u> Quick</u>, to the
narrower formulation of Gleeson CJ in <u>HG</u>.
<P>

6  	I should add that the plaintiff seeks also to rely on material in
an affidavit of Mr Leary sworn today, which gives more detail
in relation to
the past experience of Mr Leary and the plaintiff, and in relation to the
current system.  This affidavit contains
an assertion by Mr Leary that, in
relation to past tenders, he calculated the costings, and assertions as to the
percentage of successful
tenders. The affidavit also contains a comparison
between the previous programmes in which the plaintiff was engaged and those
which
are now available. 
<P>

7  	Those particular parts of that affidavit have been objected to by
Mr Meagher.  Mr Meagher has also indicated that, if this affidavit
would make a
difference to my ruling on the admissibility of Mr Leary's evidence on the
likelihood of acceptance of tenders and the
financial outcomes, then there was
a need, at least, to obtain instructions on the matter, and that he may object
to the reading
of the affidavit on the grounds of late service and
prejudice.
<P>

8  	In relation to the general approach which I should take to expert
evidence, it does seems to me that this evidence falls short
of what Gleeson CJ
stated to be the admissible form of such evidence, namely, that it
differentiate between the assumed facts on
which the opinion is based and the
opinion in question. I think it is fair to say that Gaudron J in the same case,
and Branson J
in <u>Quick</u>, supported the view that this is not an absolute
requirement, now at least, for the admissibility of expert evidence, although
of
course it is desirable that it be in that form.
<P>

9  	In my opinion, it is necessary that one be able to identify the
matter of opinion which is sought to be admitted into evidence;
and in some
cases that will require clear identification of the assumed facts on which it
is based.  In other cases, it seems to
me, particularly where the facts on
which the opinions are based are facts of which the expert has personal
knowledge, that requirement
is not absolutely essential; although the failure
to clearly identify the facts on which the opinion is based may greatly affect
the weight of the opinion, and may make it appropriate to reject the evidence
under s135 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> if the failure to clearly identify the facts on
which it is based makes it unfair to the other party to admit the evidence.
<P>

10  	In the present case, it seems to me that there is evidence,
albeit evidence of some generality, of the experience of Mr Leary
in training
programmes, particularly training  programmes for the long term unemployed;
and, in my opinion, this does support a finding
that he has specialised
knowledge which enables him to express an opinion on the capacity of the
plaintiff to carry out work of the
kind becoming available pursuant to the
privatisation of the CES.
<P>

11  	In relation to the other two aspects on which this evidence is
led, namely, the probability of the plaintiff being successful
in tenders and
the profitability of that work, it seems to me that the position is
different.
<P>

12  	In relation to the former, there are many facts which would be
part of the factual basis for such an opinion which have not
been put in
evidence, at least prior to the most recent affidavit of Mr Leary.  Even with
that affidavit, there is little detail
about the circumstances of the tenders
in which the plaintiff had previously been involved, and very little detail in
relation to
the circumstances surrounding the tendering for work becoming
available under the present system. In my opinion, that has the consequence
that I am unable to be satisfied that Mr Leary really does have specialised
knowledge which goes to the likelihood of outcomes under
the present system.
The failure to set out the full factual basis on which such an opinion might be
based also, in my opinion, raises
questions of fairness.  If I was otherwise
inclined to the view that this was a proper subject of expert evidence from Mr.
Leary,
in my opinion I would exclude it under s135.
<P>

13  	Similar considerations apply in relation to the profitability of
work resulting from tenders under the new system. There is
evidence that Mr
Leary drew up calculations in relation to proposed tenders, and indeed that is,
it would seem, the material relied
on as the basis for opinion evidence as to
the profitability of such work. However, apart from the most recent affidavit
of Mr Leary,
there is no evidence that he had been the person responsible for
financial planning in relation to the previous business, and no
evidence as to
whether the outcomes in any way coincided with financial planning he had
undertaken.
<P>

14  	The most recent affidavit attempts to take the matter a little
further by asserting that he calculated costings for the previous
tenders, but
there is no particularity given in relation to those costings. Again, it seems
to me that I am not in a position to
be satisfied as to Mr Leary's specialised
knowledge in relation to calculating the future profitability of businesses
under the new
system; and it seems to me also that, even if I were so
satisfied, the factual basis of both his alleged expertise and his opinions
as
to the future are not set out sufficiently for fairness to the other party.
Again in relation to this matter, in my opinion the
evidence would be
disallowed under s135 even if the requirements of s79 were satisfied.
<P>

15  	I should add that it will still be open to the plaintiff to
submit that, from material before the Court, the Court itself can
draw an
inference as to whether the plaintiff would have been successful in obtaining
acceptance of tenders. It may be that other
evidence will enable the Court to
draw some inference as to whether this business may have been profitable.
However, for the reasons
I have given, I do not admit Mr Leary's material as
expert evidence of either of those two matters.
