ANNE PERKINS</b>
<P>

<b>	JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a> in respect of the estate of the late Margaret Ruby Perkins who died on 21
August 1997.  She was survived by her two sons, their wives
and children.  The
plaintiff is one of her sons and the defendants are her other son and his wife.
Under her will which was made
on 3 March 1992 she appointed the defendants as
executors and trustees and gave, after the disposition of chattels, the residue
of
her estate to be held in two equal half shares.
<P>

2   	One half share went to the defendants and the other half
share was held on the trusts which are set out in cl 5(c) of the will.
 Those
trusts are in the following terms: 
<P>

"(c)  As to the remaining one half share I direct that the same be held upon
the following trusts:
<P>

	(i)  To invest the capital of the said share
<P>

	in accordance with the trusts for investment
<P>

	herein and to retain such investment upon
<P>

	trust until the death of Maureen Ivy Perkins
<P>

	and then to pay the capital of the said fund
<P>

	and any undistributed net income to Kevin
<P>

	William Maurice Perkins.
<P>

	(ii)  I direct my trustee during the life of
<P>

	Kevin William Maurice Perkins and prior to
<P>

	the vesting of the capital fund in accordance
<P>

	with the preceding sub-cl (i), to pay to the
<P>

	said Kevin William Maurice Perkins the net
<P>

	income derived from the said fund in each
<P>

	financial year after satisfying from the
<P>

	income of the said fund the taxation 	liability of the income earned in
such
<P>

	financial year.
<P>

	(iii)  Should Kevin William Maurice Perkins
<P>

	die before me or before the vesting in him
<P>

	of the capital fund in accordance with
<P>

	sub-cl (i) I direct that the capital and
<P>

	any undistributed net income of the fund
<P>

	be paid to those of Judith Ann Ducrou, 
<P>

	Colin James Perkins, Deborah Gaye Howard
<P>

	and Diane Margaret Mitchell as shall then
<P>

	be living and if more than one in equal
<P>

	shares as tenants in common."
<P>

3   	As can be seen from that provision the share for the
plaintiff is held so that he has the income from it until his wife dies
and
thereafter he receives the capital.  In the event of him pre-deceasing his wife
the amount of the capital goes to the persons
named in sub-s (iii) who are the
children of the plaintiff.  As is evident the plaintiff's wife takes no part in
that disposition.
<P>

4   	The reason for that was set out by the deceased in a letter
which she wrote the same day addressed to her son Kevin in which
in effect she
apologised for what she had done in her will and explained her reasons.  These
reasons were connected with the plaintiff's
wife's dealings with the
plaintiff's money in the past.  She refers to the plaintiff's wife spending the
money for purposes which
were not agreed and forging payments using the
plaintiff's credit card.  
<P>

5   	The estate has been reduced to cash and expenses paid.  The
distributable estate is in the order of $278,191.16.  One half
of that has been
distributed to the defendants pursuant to the provisions of the will, the other
half has been invested by them and
that amounts to $139,095.58.  There have
been two payments of income to the plaintiff since the date of death, one in
respect of
the year 1998 in the sum of $2605 and for the year 1999 in the sum
of $6241.08.  
<P>

6   	There has as a necessary consequence of these proceedings
been costs incurred.  The plaintiff's costs to date are estimated
at $14,000
and the defendants' costs $9500.
<P>

7   	I will just deal with a few matters of history first.   The
plaintiff was born on 8 October 1934 and his brother the defendant,
Brian, was
born in 1942.  The plaintiff married in 1955 and has had four children from the
marriage, none of whom are now dependent
upon him.  He was a panel beater and
retired from work in 1987 due to health problems.  In 1989 some of the problems
that he was
having with his wife came to a head and he at that stage was forced
to, inter alia, borrow some money from his brother and sell the
family car to
repay amounts that she had run up.  The plaintiff's father died in 1992 and the
deceased made her will on 3 March 1992.
 In 1994 there was a dispute between
the plaintiff and his wife over the problems to which I have referred and she
left home for
two months.
<P>

8   	In May 1995 the plaintiff had surgery at Westmead Hospital
to replace his right knee and in August 1997 the deceased died.
 The plaintiff
had further surgery in September 1997 on his left knee and in due course the
house property was sold towards the end
of 1997.
<P>

9   	In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High
Court has recently, in <b>Singer v. Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a>, set out
the two stage approach that the Court must take.  At p 209 they said the
following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'? The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the interrelationship
which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper maintenance' etc. were
explained in Bosch v. Perpetual Trustee Co Limited.  The determination of the
first
stage in the two-stage process calls for an assessment of whether the
provision (if any) made was inadequate or what, in all the
circumstances, was
the proper level of maintenance etc. appropriate for the applicant having
regard, amongst other things, to the
applicant's financial position, the size
and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship between
the applicant
and the deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and
other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.   Take, for example, a case
like Ellis v. Leeder where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be
made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements to pay creditors."
<P>

10   	The plaintiff's condition in a financial sense is that he
is presently sixty-four years of age, he is married and has no children
dependent upon him.  He and his wife have a house worth $152,000, furniture
$8000, he has cash of a little over $10,000 which is
substantially comprised of
the recent income distribution, he has a 1984 Commodore car which could
possibly be traded-in for $2500.
 He is on a disability pension of $360 per
fortnight and his wife is on the same pension but an aged one.  Obviously their
income
is used totally in meeting expenses.  
<P>

11   	His medical condition has been set out in a lengthy report
by his treating orthopaedic surgeon and he summarises the plaintiff's
situation
as having undergone bilateral total hip replacements and bilateral total knee
replacements.  He says his right hip replacement
is failing and he is likely to
require replacement within the next couple of years.
<P>

12   	He also goes on to say that he would be able to perform
that surgery on the plaintiff as a public patient at Westmead but
there would
be a two year waiting list.  He mentions that if it was to be done through the
private sector the cost would be in the
order of $18,000 and there is no
significant waiting time.
<P>

13   	It is necessary in the context of the provisions in the
will to look at how it is said that the plaintiff has been left without
adequate and proper provision for his maintenance, education and advancement in
life.  These matters are put on two levels.  On the
first level are a number of
specific matters.  His house needs some repairs and renovations: there are
firstly expenses in connection
with the kitchen $5500, cost of floor coverings
$2000, cost for enclosing verandah $4500.  Although there was criticism of the
generality
of the evidence it seems to me, particularly given the description
of some of the work the plaintiff was hoping to attend to himself,
that the
estimates are probably modest.   He also referred to a wish to paint the
outside himself, but no doubt he may have some
difficulty with that.  
<P>

14   	Another specific area is the question of purchasing a new
car.  That seems to be a reasonable matter given the state of repair
of his
existing car and what he has had to spend on it.  He estimates he would need
$34,000 less a trade-in of $2500 which he might
get for his car if it survives
to that time.
<P>

15   	The other specific area I have already touched on is the
hospitalisation costs of $18,000.  True it is that it is possible
for this to
be obtained on a free basis.  However, there are a number of imponderables in
this area which are really not addressed
in the evidence.  They are, firstly,
whether the public hospital difficulties will continue in their present form or
perhaps even
be exacerbated; secondly, whether there may or may not be some
urgency in the need for provision of this work.  I think, having seen
the
plaintiff, what his doctor says is supported by the way in which he walks and
is able to move.  Even though the evidence does
not address this area it is an
area of concern which should be able to be accommodated and the plaintiff
should not have the worry
in this regard.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff also puts forward a generalised need for
contingencies and in this respect he refers to his age, the little
resources
which he has and the general uncertainties which life presents.  
<P>

17   	It is necessary also to have regard to others who have a
claim upon the bounty of the deceased.  As can be seen from the will
there are
four persons who have a contingent interest in the share in question.  Three of
those have sworn affidavits saying that
they have no objection to the whole of
their contingent interest being made available to their father.  The other has
not given evidence
but through correspondence expresses the view that the will
should be upheld.  There is no evidence from the person who takes that
view and
accordingly the court has no information on that person's financial situation.
The court thus can assume that the person
does not want the court to take into
account her personal financial situation in consideration of the competing
claims upon the bounty
of the testator.
<P>

18   	The reasons for the deceased leaving her will in the way
she did stem from the relationship in part between the plaintiff
and the
plaintiff's wife and the deceased.  Apparently, according to the plaintiff -
and there is no reason not to accept him - in
1958 they had an argument about a
trivial matter and, apart from exchanging a few words at a funeral in 1992,
never spoke to each
other again. 	
<P>

19   	The plaintiff has frankly put his situation before the
court in his affidavit.  In par 9 he talks about how for many years
his wife
accessed moneys which had been in their joint savings account without his
knowledge or consent.  At other times she would
be given money to pay household
bills and the money would be spent on other things.  She apparently ran up
debts on his St George
Bank credit cards and they, as I have mentioned before,
became so unmanageable that he had to sell the family car and also borrow
money
from his brother.
<P>

20   	He does not dispute that his wife is a spendthrift and
that she did not always tell him the truth about what she had done
with money.
These problems led to the dispute between them in 1994 as a result of which the
plaintiff's wife left home for some two
months.  They are however back together
and have remained together since 1994.
<P>

21   	The plaintiff says that he took steps in 1994 to separate
out their finances.  He has a separate bank account which is a savings
account
into which his pension is paid and his wife has an account into which her
pension is paid.  He says he supervises all the
payment of the household bills.
No doubt from that time, having regard to the history of what had happened and
the little assets
under the plaintiff's control, there has been very little
opportunity for the plaintiff's wife to run up large accounts and debts.
<P>

22   	Apart from the affidavit evidence there is also evidence
given in cross-examination of the plaintiff.   That brought to light
a number
of matters.  One of them was that he received an examination summons to be
examined in respect of a judgment debt.  Apparently
that was the first he ever
heard of that matter as his wife had managed to successfully conceal from him
the processes that no doubt
were served prior to that event.  She also, when
she used his credit card, managed to conceal from him what was happening by
intercepting
the bank account statements when they were coming home.
<P>

23   	Another more particular and more worrying matter was that
when the plaintiff and his wife moved from Penrith to North Narooma
there was
some small surplus left over which they invested through their solicitor.  The
plaintiff thinks the amount was about $10,000.
 What became clear is that his
wife managed to get hold of the moneys from that investment when a mortgage was
repaid and a discharge
given.  It turns out that she has forged his signature
on the discharge and received the funds.  Some of them may have been spent
on
the new place at Narooma but certainly not all.
<P>

24   	I think in this case, given the position of the plaintiff,
it has clearly been established that he has been left without adequate
and
proper provision for his support and his advancement in life having regard to
the terms of the will.   The question is of course
what is an appropriate order
and any conditions that may be applied to it.  In <b>Howarth v. Reed</b> Powell
J refers to the possibility of a provision not being applied by the person for
the purposes intended by the court.  At pp
43 and 44 his Honour said:
<P>

"While, as will be apparent from what I have earlier written, I am deeply
concerned at what I regard as the totally unrealistic
approach to the
management of their affairs adopted by Mr and Mrs Howarth, which approach, if
persisted in, will almost inevitably
lead to the benefit of any Order which
might be made in Mrs Howarth's favour being dissipated in short order, it seems
to me that,
while that is a matter which may bear on the form of Order to be
made, it is not a matter which ought, without more, to be regarded
as
disqualifying Mrs Howarth from receiving the benefit of any Order to which she
might otherwise be entitled.  Nor is this a novel
view, for a similar approach
is reflected in the following passage in the judgment of Young J in Bondy v.
Vavros (28 August 1998
(unreported)):
<P>

	'I should interpose at this point that
<P>

	in one sense it does not matter if I
<P>

	form the view that a plaintiff is a
<P>

	spendthrift.  If a person is entitled
<P>

	to an order, what they do with the 
<P>

	money that they receive is their
<P>

	business and it is none of my affair
<P>

	if I very much fear that the money
<P>

	may be wasted on wine, women and song
<P>

	in a short period of time.  I have
<P>

	deliberately used that expression to
<P>

	make it clear that I am not referring
<P>

	at the moment to the facts of this
<P>

	particular case.  On the other hand,
<P>

	when one is considering what a wise and
<P>

	just testator would have done, if one
<P>

	can see that a plaintiff is a spendthrift
<P>

	and the testator has arranged his will
<P>

	in such a way as to limit the funds
<P>

	flowing to the plaintiff, then one may
<P>

	very well come to the conclusion that the
<P>

	plaintiff has failed to establish that
<P>

	there has been any breach of moral duty.'
<P>

The question, then, is what is the form of Order which ought now to be
made?"
<P>

25   	In this case of course we are not concerned with the
plaintiff not applying the funds in a satisfactory manner.  He certainly
is a
trustworthy person and appears to be sensible and concerned for his future.  He
feels that he has secured the situation by having
a separate bank account with
the signature for any withdrawal having to be verified at the bank.  It does
seem to me however that,
given the past history, it is not beyond the bounds of
possibility that his wife may, if she obtained the passbook, forge his
signature
and withdraw funds.  The history given indicates that the plaintiff's
wife has a real disability.  The plaintiff of course is perfectly
happy to
continue his relationship and that is a matter of great credit to him.  It
seems to me that if it is possible to minimise
the chance of something untoward
happening it may be wise to do so.
<P>

26   	I also accept that the plaintiff should naturally feel
that he would not wish to be beholden to his brother and have to ask
him for
money to be spent on him.  That is natural, given the ages and positions in
life of both brothers.
<P>

27   	The other thing that should be observed is that the future
contingencies for the plaintiff are not certain.  Apart from the
application of
the statutory provision in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a> there is no express
provision for the advancement under the trust of the plaintiff's share. There
certainly, given the plaintiff's
and his wife's comparative ages, is a real
possibility that he may pre-decease her.  
<P>

28   	In these circumstances I propose to make a composite order
which will provide something for the plaintiff now, some fund which
the
plaintiff can direct and not necessarily need to feel that he is beholden to
his brother, and also to give some additional powers
of advancement in respect
of the balance.
<P>

29   	The order I make is as follows:
<P>

(1)	I order the defendants to hold the funds referred to in par 5(c) of the
will of the deceased for the purposes and upon the trusts
therein mentioned and
upon the further trust -
<P>

		(a) to pay thereout forthwith to the plaintiff the sum of $30,000; 
<P>

(b) to pay thereout from time to time at the direction of the plaintiff such
sums up to a total amount of  $60,000 for -
<P>

	    		(i) medical, hospital and like services provided to the 				plaintiff,

<P>

             		(ii) renovations or repairs to any home in which the
plaintiff has an interest,
<P>

             		(iii) the purchase of a motor vehicle for the plaintiff.
<P>

		(c) to exercise the powers in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a> without limit 		to the
amount of capital that may be advanced.
<P>

30   	I have heard submissions on costs which raise a number of
discrete areas.  One of the particular areas is the service of an
offer of
compromise on 30 October 1998.  Effectively that offer of compromise given by
the plaintiff to the defendants offered to
settle the proceedings for payment
from the fund of a legacy of $60,000. It appears to be an offer in accordance
with the terms of
the rules and it is submitted the plaintiff has in effect
done better under the judgment than that, given that he is given the right
to
direct the payment in respect of the $60,000 to which I have referred in my
judgment.  
<P>

31   	Probably the plaintiff, I would have thought, has done
better but I do not think that in this particular case it follows that
there
should automatically be from the expiration of the offer, which was 28
November, an order for indemnity costs in favour of
the plaintiff.  One
frequently sees in this jurisdiction disputes between parties to litigation
where the litigation truly could
be described as inter-parties litigation where
it can be the case that one sometimes even finds a trustee not obtaining costs.
However,
the litigation in this case I think is somewhat different. 
<P>

32   	It seems to me that the executors were placed in a
difficult situation in that they were bound to uphold the will as they
had one
contingent beneficiary who wished them to do that.  The other aspect that leads
me to think it would be inappropriate to
apply what would normally follow from
the rules is that the difficulty itself comes from the actions of the testatrix
given the difficulties
that she perceived and the solution that she adopted.

<P>

33   	In the circumstances I do not think it is appropriate that
the plaintiff's costs should be paid on an indemnity basis after
the offer of
compromise, but clearly the plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis should
be paid.  Similarly the defendants'
costs on an indemnity basis should also be
paid.  The question is from what part of either the estate or notional estate
should the
amounts be paid?  There was a submission from the plaintiff that
there was in fact no actual estate left.  This was on the basis
that the estate
is now held by the defendants as trustees.  In my view I do not think that an
appropriate conclusion.  The estate
is still held by the present defendants and
to my mind it certainly is what is referred to in the Act as the actual
estate.
<P>

34   	There are a number of provisions of the Act to which I
should refer and these include the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 24</a> which allows the court to
designate notional estate where part of it has been distributed.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 28(1)</a>
provides that the court should not designate property as notional estate unless
it is satisfied that the estate of the deceased person
is insufficient to allow
the making of the provision that in its opinion should be made.  
<P>

35   	There also has to be noticed the particular powers in
respect of costs.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta122/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33(1)</a> provides:
<P>

"Except as provided in sub-ss (2) and (3) the Court may order that the costs,
charges and expenses of or incidental to proceedings
under this Act in relation
to the estate or notional estate of a deceased person be paid out of the estate
or notional estate, or
both, in such manner as the Court thinks fit."
<P>

36   	That is a wide power and is in the present circumstances
not affected by the remaining sub-sections.   The entitlement of
the
beneficiaries under the will to receive a share derives from the fact that they
are each entitled to a proportion of the residue.
 Residue is determined, as
provided in cl 5(a) of the will, after payment for just debts, funeral and
testamentary expenses.  Accordingly,
in the ordinary case in determining
residue the proper costs of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> application would be
described as testamentary expenses and would come out of the estate before
dividing it in half, in this case,
to determine what each share comprises.  In
these circumstances it seems to me that it would be quite inappropriate for the
share
of one beneficiary to be determined prior to the actual determination of
the true residue.  I think the reality is that the distribution
was within a
few months of the date of death of the deceased and well within the eighteen
months period. Accordingly, even if a notice
of intended distribution had been
published there would be no protection to an executor who had notice of the
claim.  However, I
do not rely upon that matter.
<P>

37   	It seems to me that the matter can also be considered
having regard to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> which gives the court power to specify
beneficial entitlements and specify what parts of the estate should bear the
burden of that
provision.  The general thrust of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> and s 33 in my view leads
to a result that it is appropriate, subject to the matters in s 27, to make an
order that the plaintiff's
costs on a party and party basis and the defendants'
costs on an indemnity basis be paid as to one half out of the actual estate
and
as to one half out of property to be designated as notional estate.  The court
thus has to look at the provisions of s 27(1)
to see whether there will be any
interfering with reasonable expectations and there is no such evidence of such
matter.
<P>

38   	I have already dealt I think with the substantial justice
and merits in making the order I propose.  They specifically encompass
the fact
that a plaintiff who is successful in his proceedings should not have to bear
out of his share of the estate the costs.
 There are no other particular
matters in the section that require consideration.  
<P>

39   	Accordingly, I order:
<P>

(2) To the extent necessary I designate as notional estate the debt due to the
defendants by Canley Vale Real Estate Pty Ltd referred
to in par 2 of the
affidavit of Brian Zenas Perkins sworn 21 July 1999.
<P>

(3) I order that the plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis and the
defendants' costs on an indemnity basis be paid as to
one half out of the
actual estate and as to one half out of the notional estate. 
<P>

	(4) The exhibits can be returned.
<P>
