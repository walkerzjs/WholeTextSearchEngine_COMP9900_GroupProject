1	<b>MASTER:</b>   By summons 3223 of 1997, filed on 15 July 1997, Waldemar
Bujnowski claims, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i>
1982</a>, an order that provision be made for his maintenance and advancement in
life out of the estate of his late mother, Paulina Bujnowska
(to whom I shall
refer as "the deceased"). By summons 4213 of 1997, filed on 30 September 1997,
Kazimierz Zacharczuk claims, pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a></i>, an order that provision be made for his maintenance and advancement in
life out of the estate of the deceased.
<P>

2	By statement of claim 4537 of 1998, filed on 5 November 1998 Kasimierz
Zacharczuk seeks, essentially, a declaration that the Public
Trustee, the
defendant to that suit, as executor of the deceased, holds the assets of the
estate of the deceased, after payment of
debts and expenses, upon trust for the
plaintiff absolutely, and a further declaration that the defendant holds the
house property
situate at and known as 4 Portland Place, New Lambton, and the
house property situate at and known as 4 Kotara Place, Kotara, upon
trust for
the plaintiff absolutely, together with consequential orders.
<P>

3	On 20 November 1998 Austin J by consent made identical orders in each of the
three proceedings. The effect of those orders was
that each of the three
proceedings be heard together. His Honour made certain consequential orders,
including an order referring
proceeding 4537 of 1998 to a Master for hearing.
Although not so expressly ordered by His Honour, the hearing before me of the
three
matters proceeded upon the footing that the evidence in each matter
should be treated, so far as was relevant, as evidence in each
of the other two
matters. 
<P>

4	The deceased, who had been born in Poland in 1918 or 1919, died on 6 April
1996 (aged about seventy-seven). 
<P>

5	The deceased had been married only once, in Poland. Of that marriage were
born two children, the plaintiff Waldemar Bujnowski
and Helen (Mrs
Williamson).
<P>

6	It would appear that the deceased's husband joined the Polish Army to resist
the German invasion, and that the deceased never
saw or heard from him again.
The deceased and her two children migrated to Australia in about 1949, having
fled Poland to Germany
at the end of the war. From 1958 until the time of her
death (that is, for a period of 38 years) the deceased had lived in a de facto
relationship with Kazimierz Zacharczuk. 
<P>

7	The deceased left a will dated 25 August 1995, probate whereof was on 24
February 1997 granted to Waldemar Bujnowski, the executor
named in such will.
Subsequently, by deed made on 17 February 1998, that executor appointed the
Public Trustee to be executor of
the will of the deceased in his stead. 
<P>

8	The deceased at the time of her death owned absolutely a house property
situate at and known as 16 Kotara Place, Kotara, and was
also the owner as to a
one half share as tenant in common in a house property situate at and known as
4 Portland Place, New Lambton.
The other one half share in that house property
is held by the plaintiff Kazimierz Zacharczuk (to whom I shall hereinafter
refer
as "Kazimierz").
<P>

9	The other assets in the estate of the deceased consisted of accounts with a
bank and a building society, having a total value
at the time of her death
(according to the Inventory of Property) of about $71,000. 
<P>

10	The Portland Place property had been the residence of the deceased and
Kazimierz from the time of its acquisition by them in
1965, up to the death of
the deceased in 1996. Kazimierz has continued to reside therein to the present
time.
<P>

11	By her will the deceased gave to her daughter Helen Williamson the
deceased's half interest in the Portland Place property (that
half interest
having an estimated value of $62,500); she gave the house property at Kotara
Place to her great-granddaughter, Clarissa
Mather (the daughter of Waldemar
Bujnowski's daughter Sasha (or Sacha) Mather), who is an infant presently aged
nine years (having
been born on 12 October 1989). The estimated value of the
Kotara Place property is $155,000. The deceased gave the residue of her
estate
to be divided between her son Waldemar and her de facto widower Kazimierz. 
<P>

12	Apart from the foregoing items of real property, the assets of the estate
presently consist of funds held by the Public Trustee
in an amount of $53,709.
(Since the date of the death of the deceased various amounts, totalling
$12,500, have been paid for funeral
expenses and repairs to the two
properties.) From that amount of $53,709 must be deducted the Public Trustee's
commission on unrealised
realty in an amount $7,350. In addition, provision
must be made for the payment of the costs of the defendant in the three
separate
proceedings, estimated to total $16,500. Further, provision must be
made for the costs of either or both of the plaintiffs, in the
event that such
plaintiff or plaintiffs be successful in one or more of their several
claims.
<P>

13	Upon the basis of the foregoing figures, it has been estimated on behalf of
the plaintiff Kazimierz that there will remain in
residue available for
distribution an amount of $29,900. In consequence, therefore, under the terms
of the will each of the present
plaintiffs would receive from the estate of the
deceased the sum of $14,950. 
<P>

14	It was submitted on behalf of Kazimierz that the various real property
transactions in which the deceased during her lifetime
participated were
conducted in such a manner, and by financial contributions made by him towards
the original acquisition of a property
at 125 Lambton Road, Lambton, purchased
by the deceased in 1960, as to give rise to a constructive trust in favour of
Kazimierz.

<P>

15	The purchase price of that Lambton Road property was &#163;1,200, of which
the sum of &#163;300 was provided by Kazimierz (who
had borrowed that sum from
a friend), and the balance was financed by a mortgage from the Bank of New
South Wales. Kazimierz repaid
from his wages that amount of &#163;300 which he
had borrowed. The deceased was registered as the sole owner of that property,
which
was sold by her in 1965 for about &#163;2,400. The property at 4 Portland
Place, New Lambton was then purchased for &#163;1,800.
The deposit on that
purchase was paid from the proceeds of sale from the Lambton Road property, the
balance being provided by way
of mortgage finance from the Bank of New South
Wales. 
<P>

16	According to Kazimierz, he repaid also the mortgage loan from the Bank of
New South Wales in respect to the Lambton Road purchase.
He also said that he
personally effected many improvements and renovations to each of the Lambton
Road and Portland Place residences
(each of which, at the time of acquisition,
was in a state of considerable dereliction), and, in due course, to each of the
properties
subsequently purchased by the deceased.
<P>

17	It was submitted on behalf of Kazimierz that there had ultimately arisen a
constructive trust over the Portland Place property
(indeed it was submitted
that such a constructive trust extended over the entirety of the real property
owned by the deceased) in
favour of Kazimierz. 
<P>

18	It is appropriate, therefore, that I should proceed to a determination of
the claim of Kazimierz in respect to such a constructive
trust, before
considering the two claims under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.</i> 
<P>

19	It will be appreciated that if Kazimierz is successful in his suit for a
declaration of a constructive trust, then the estate
will consist of no more
than funds totalling a little less than $30,000. Counsel for Kazimierz adopted
the view that if Kazimierz
were successful in his suit for such a declaration
of trust, then it would not be necessary for him to proceed with his claim for
provision under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.
<P>

20	During her lifetime the deceased participated in a number of real property
transactions, either alone, or conjointly with either
her son Waldemar or her
de facto spouse Kazimierz. It would appear that the deceased attended to all
the legal and financial aspects
associated with those transactions. (Kazimierz
did not even conduct a bank account until about May 1991, when he commenced to
receive
the age pension. To that time the deceased looked after the entirety of
their financial affairs.) It is appropriate here to record
that Kazimierz does
not read English, and that his evidence (both by affidavit and oral) was given
through an interpreter. 
<P>

21	The evidence established the following real property transactions by the
deceased.
<P>

22	In 1960, as has already been recorded, the house property at 125 Lambton
Road, Lambton, was purchased in the name of the deceased;
and after the sale of
that property in 1965 the property at 4 Portland Place, New Lambton, was
purchased in the names of the deceased
and Kazimierz as tenants in common in
equal shares. 
<P>

23	In about 1965 the deceased purchased a property at 29 Pentland Avenue,
Punchbowl, for her son Waldemar for &#163;3,500. During
the four years he lived
there Waldemar was responsible for the mortgage payments. After Waldemar's
marriage broke down in about 1969
the deceased rented out that property for
several years before selling it (for, according to Waldemar, about $65,000) in
about  1972
or 1973. In that latter year Waldemar and his then wife Lorraine
purchased as joint tenants a property at Lot 2, Avondale Street,
New Lambton.
The deceased provided some funds to Waldemar to assist in that purchase. 
<P>

24	In about October 1974 the deceased and Kazimierz purchased, as joint
tenants, vacant land at Lot 48, Westholme Street, Rutherford,
for about $6,000.
That land was sold about eighteen months later for about $12,000.
<P>

25	In 1974 Waldemar and his wife purchased Lot 3, Avery Street, Rutherford, as
joint tenants. Again, the deceased gave assistance
towards that purchase, by
providing mortgage finance. Waldemar and his wife sold Lot 2, Avondale Street,
New Lambton in 1978. In
the following year, 1979, Lorraine transferred to
Waldemar her interest in Lot 3, Avery Street, Rutherford. He subsequently sold
that property in 1981, receiving $10,000.
<P>

26	In 1979 or 1980 the deceased purchased a property at St. James Road, New
Lambton, for $14,000. That property was sold about eighteen
months later for
$41,000 (after, according to Kazimierz, he had performed substantial
renovations to it).
<P>

27	In about 1979 Kazimierz purchased a property at Anzac Street, Maitland, for
$10,000, which he sold two years later for $34,000.

<P>

28	In 1981 the deceased and Kazimierz sold the property at Lot 48, Westholme
Street, Rutherford, for $12,000. In the same year Waldemar
sold the Avery
Street property. 
<P>

29	Also in 1981, in September of that year, the deceased purchased a property
at 125 Kings Road, New Lambton, for $45,000. Once
again, Kazimierz said that
he performed considerable renovations and restorational work to that property,
especially after it  had
been damaged in, it was said, December 1989 in the
Newcastle earthquake. The property was sold in early 1990 for $95,000.
<P>

30	In 1984 the deceased purchased the Kotara Place property for $61,000. She
sold the Kings Road property for about $95,000 in 1990.

<P>

31	Kazimierz said that he had assumed that each of the Lambton Road and the
Portland Place properties had been purchased in the
joint names of the deceased
and himself, and that it was only after the deceased's death that he became
aware that they had been
purchased in the name of the deceased alone. 
<P>

32	It would appear that in the mid-1950s the deceased owned and lived in a
house property at 109 Victoria Street, Lewisham (which
she had purchased in
December 1955 for &#163;2,800, that purchase, having been financed by two
separate loans, which were repaid
in 1958, at about the time when the property
was sold, for &#163;3,300). At that time her son Waldemar was living with her.
He was
employed as a telegram boy, earning &#163;12 7s 6p a fortnight, of which
he gave his mother &#163;10. 
<P>

33	The deceased, whilst she was residing at Lewisham, was in employment,
working, sequentially, for Huttons Meats, AWA at Ashfield,
and a clothing
factory (where she was employed as a machinist). 
<P>

34	In about 1958 the deceased moved to Newcastle. After several years in
Newcastle the deceased resumed employment, in early 1961.
Firstly, she was
working, part-time, as a cleaner. She later became a full-time cleaner at the
Newcastle Court House, a position
which she held at least until she attained
the age of 65 (which would have been in about 1983). (Waldemar's former wife,
Mrs Lorraine
Mather, said that the deceased held that position from about 1970
until at least 1990.)
<P>

35	In 1958 Kazimierz joined the deceased in Newcastle, residing with her,
firstly, in rented accommodation at 119 Cardiff Road,
Wallsend, They continued
to live together in a de facto relationship from then until her death. 
<P>

36	When she reached the age of about seventy (in about 1988) the deceased
eventually received a part-pension from the Department
of Social Security. The
precise nature of that pension has not emerged from the evidence.
<P>

37	There was admitted into evidence (as Exhibit A) a notice to admit facts,
addressed to Kazimierz, and the answers of Kazimierz
to such notice. During the
course of the hearing Kazimierz admitted item 4 in that notice (relating to the
sale price of the Lewisham
property, which item he had by his answer stated
that he did not know and could not admit). 
<P>

38	It was submitted on behalf of Kazimierz that the deceased could not have
purchased the Lambton property from her own funds. That
is probably so.
However, that fact does not, of itself, establish the existence of a
constructive trust in favour of Kazimierz over
the entirety of the assets of
the deceased, or, indeed, over even the remaining half of the Portland Place
property. 
<P>

39	It must be appreciated that it was only the Lambton property and the
Portland Place property which were purchased subject to
any mortgages. All the
other properties purchased by the deceased (either in her own name alone or in
the name of herself conjointly
with either Kazimierz or Waldemar), were
unencumbered. 
<P>

40	Further, the submissions on behalf of Kazimierz failed to acknowledge the
following matters:
<P>

	(a) the benefit which the deceased received from the sale of the Lewisham
property, of which she had been the owner before she
met Kazimierz;
<P>

	(b) the contribution which the deceased made to the purchase of the various
properties from the income received by her from her
various employments;
<P>

	(c) the contribution which the deceased made in locating and acquiring the
various properties;
<P>

	(d) the contribution which the deceased made in the renovation of the various
properties.
<P>

41	Further, the evidence of Kazimierz fails to explain why some properties were
purchased in joint names, one property in the name
of Kazimierz alone, and
other properties in the name of the deceased alone. 
<P>

42	It is also appropriate to look to the circumstances of the acquisition of
the Kotara property, which is one of the two properties
in which the deceased
held on interest at the time of her death. Kazimierz acknowledged that that
property was purchased from the
proceeds of sale of the Punchbowl property. The
Punchbowl property, in its term, was purchased in the joint names of the
deceased
and her son Waldemar. The deceased paid the deposit on that property.
The evidence discloses that there were mortgages on the property.
According to
the evidence of Waldemar he paid the mortgages on that property whilst it was
occupied by him. After he ceased to occupy
the property and transferred his
interest therein to the deceased, she rented out the property and paid the
mortgage from such rental
income. 
<P>

43	The source of the deposit money for the Punchbowl property is not disclosed.
However, what does emerge from the information available
concerning the
acquisition of and funding of that property is that Kazimierz made no
contribution to the funding of that purchase.
In those circumstances it can be
said positively that the deceased and Waldemar had a substantial interest in
the Punchbowl property,
even in they did not have the entire interest in that
property. There is no reliable evidence upon which it can be said that
Kazimierz
had any interest in the Punchbowl property. 
<P>

44	There is no evidence which supports the existence of any trust in respect to
the property dealings between Kazimierz and the
deceased. There are no facts
from which it can be said that there was some arrangement pursuant to which it
was acknowledged or understood
that a trust would arise. There was no evidence
of any conversations (either before or after the purchase of any of the
properties)
about any such arrangements having been made between the deceased
and Kazimierz.
<P>

45	From the foregoing evidentiary matters, I am not satisfied that Kazimierz
has established any interest in the Kotara property
sufficient to substantiate
his claim that there has arisen in his favour a constructive trust in respect
of that property.
<P>

46	Accordingly, the suit of Kazimierz, seeking a declaration of trust, must be
dismissed. 
<P>

47	In those circumstances, therefore, it is necessary for me now to proceed to
a consideration of the two claims under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.
<P>

48	Kazimierz, as the de facto spouse of the deceased, is an eligible person
within paragraph (a) of the definition of that phrase
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a>
(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. He thus has the standing to make his
present claim for provision under that Act. Waldemar also, as a son of the
deceased, is an
eligible person, within paragraph (b) of the definition. He
thus also has the standing to make his present claim. The only other
eligible
person in relation to the deceased is her daugher Helen. Her
great-granddaughter Clarissa is included in the executor's
affidavit as a
person who is or may be an eligible person. However, I am not satisfied that
she is such, and no submission to that
effect was made by the defendant.
<P>

49	Kazimierz was born on 5 May 1926 in Poland, and is presently seventy-two
years of age. He came to Australia in 1950 from Germany
(whither he had been
transported from Poland in 1942, at the age of sixteen, to work for the German
war effort). He was employed
as a labourer, firstly for BHP in Newcastle for
four years, then for the Newcastle Abattoirs for about twenty-five or
twenty-six
years, and finally for the Maitland Abattoirs for seven years, until
he retired in about 1987, when he was aged about 61. 
<P>

50	When the Newcastle Abattoirs closed down Kazimierz received severance moneys
of about $10,000. He used those moneys to purchase
a property at Maitland. That
was an old weatherboard house which was in a state of considerable dereliction,
having been subject
to the Maitland floods. About two years after Kazimierz had
acquired it, the Department of Main Roads purchased that property from
him for
$34,000. Kazimierz invested those moneys with the Government Insurance Office,
and subsequently with the Newcastle Permanent
Building Society. Since that time
he has had recourse to those moneys to meet living expenses, legal costs, car
repairs and insurance.
The amount of his investment from that source is now
about $19,000.
<P>

51	At the present time the assets of Kazimierz are as follows:
<P>

	Newcastle Permanent Building Society Savings Account - $19,000
(approximately).
<P>

	Mitsubishi Sigma motor vehicle - $2,500 (estimated).
<P>

	One-half interest in 4 Portland Place New Lambton - $62,500.
<P>

52	I have already recorded that since the death of the deceased Kazimierz has
continued to live in the Portland Place property,
which has been his home for
the past thirty-three years. He has effected considerable repairs and
improvements to that house property,
including the construction of extensive
vegetable and flower gardens, to the tending of which Kazimierz has devoted a
substantial
amount of time and from which he derives great enjoyment. 
<P>

53	It will be appreciated that if the precise terms of the will of the deceased
take effect, it will be necessary for the Portland
Place property to be sold.
Although Kazimierz will be entitled to one half of the net proceeds of such
sale, that entitlement will
result in his receiving only the sum of about
$62,500 (or perhaps a little less, after the costs and expenses of the sale
have been
deducted from the sale price).
<P>

54	I consider that Kazimierz is entitled to security and flexibility in his
accommodation. It would, in my view, be quite improper
for him to be
dispossessed of the property which has been his home for the past thirty-three
years, and to the improvement of which
he has devoted considerable care and
attention. It should also here be noted that Helen Williamson, the daughter of
the deceased,
who under the terms of her mother's will receives the deceased's
half interest in the Portland Place property now (as represented
on her behalf
by the Public Trustee) does not oppose that half interest being awarded to
Kazimierz. There is a close and affectionate
relationship between Kazimierz and
Helen and her family (he treats Helen as his daughter and her children as his
grandchildren).
If Kazimierz, although presently in good health and able to
drive his own motor car, eventually ceases to be able to maintain his
independent lifestyle, he has expressed a desire to live near Helen, who
resides at Maryong, an outer suburb of Sydney.
<P>

55	I propose, therefore, to order that Kazimierz receive the deceased's half
interest in Portland Place, so that he will own the
entirety of that property
absolutely.
<P>

56	Kazimierz expressed a desire that, in addition, he should receive from the
estate some further benefit, to allow him, for example,
to make a protracted
visit to his native Poland, which he has not seen since he was aged sixteen.
The only sources from which any
such further benefit might come are the
interest of Waldemar in residue and the Kotara Place property. For the reasons
which emerge
later in this judgment I am not prepared to interfere with the
testamentary dispositions of the deceased in relation to those assets.
In any
event, the interest of Kazimierz in the residue, together with his own other
resources, will enable him, if he wishes, to
make the visit to Poland.
<P>

57	The deceased's son Waldemar is now aged 58, having been born on 4 December
1940.
<P>

58	He was married in 1964 to Colleen Madden (from whom he was divorced in
November 1969), and subsequently to Lorraine, now Mrs
Mather (from whom he was
divorced in the mid-1970s). He has two adult children, and an adult stepson.
<P>

59	In his early childhood Waldemar had a number of operations on his right leg,
which resulted in its being half an inch shorter
than his left leg. This
condition now causes him pain in his left leg and back. He suffers from high
blood pressure, high cholesterol
and gout, for which various conditions he
takes medication. In addition, Waldemar suffered injuries to his right leg and
hip whilst
at work, and suffers from arthritis in his hand, shoulder, back and
knees. He takes medication for pain relief. 
<P>

60	When Waldemar in 1970 moved to Newcastle permanently he resided for some
time with his mother and Kazimierz at Portland Place.
Since about 1987 Waldemar
has not worked, and he has been in receipt of an invalid pension, which is
presently in an amount of $354.82
a fortnight. It is unlikely that he will ever
be able to resume employment.
<P>

61	The present assets of Waldemar are as follows:
<P>

	Rollover deposit with Commonwealth Bank - $62,000
<P>

	Ford motor car (purchased 1997 for $5,000) - $3,000
<P>

	House contents - $5,000
<P>

62	The evidence discloses that during her lifetime the deceased gave very
considerable financial and material assistance to Waldemar.
That assistance
included the provision of houses, payment of divorce costs, provision of bail
money, payment in respect of a motor
vehicle (apparently, to prevent
repossession). That fact of such assistance, of itself, is not determinative of
his present claim
(see <i>Hunter v Hunter</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 573).</a> 
<P>

63	Waldemar has an investment of $62,000. He has resided in the Kotara Place
property since December 1989, during which period he
has paid no rent or
occupation fee. He treats that property as if it were his own. At various times
members of his family (including
each of his daughters, his granddaughter
Clarissa, and his adult stepson) have resided there with him. Waldemar stated
in his evidence
that he had been responsible for various repairs and
improvements being carried out to the Kotara Place property. However, that
assertion
was denied by his sister Helen. 
<P>

64	It will be appreciated that by her will the deceased, although she did not
provide accommodation for him, attempted to enable
Waldemar, by giving him a
share of residue, to go some way to acquiring his own accommodation. That share
of residue, about $30,000,
together with his own savings of $62,000, would
assist in enabling him to acquire some modest residence in the Newcastle
district,
either by purchase or by renting.
<P>

65	I do not consider that Waldemar has established any entitlement to be
awarded a residence by his mother. I do not consider that
he is entitled to
receive the Kotara Place property absolutely, which is what he has claimed in
the present proceedings.
<P>

66	In approaching the claim of Waldemar, it is necessary for the Court to
consider any competing claims upon the testamentary bounty
of the deceased. The
competing claims are those of the deceased's daughter Helen (who is the only
other eligible person apart from
Waldemar and Kazimierz), of Kazimierz, and of
the deceased's great-granddaughter, Clarissa Mather. 
<P>

67	I have already recorded that Helen Williamson does not oppose the interest
given to her under the will of her mother (being the
deceased's half interest
in Portland Place) being awarded to Kazimierz. Helen makes no other claim
against the estate of the deceased.
Accordingly, the only competing claims
which the Court must consider are those of his own granddaughter, Clarissa (the
great-granddaughter
of the deceased), to the Kotara Place property, and of
Kazimierz, who under the will shares the residue with Waldemar. 
<P>

68	The significance of those competing claims is that they may have the effect
of reducing, or even extinguishing, any order for
provision an entitlement to
which the plaintiff Waldemar otherwise might have established. I have already
expressed the view that
I do not consider that Waldemar has established an
entitlement to any interest in the Kotara Place property. Accordingly, it is
not
essential for me to proceed to a consideration of the competing claim of
Clarissa to that property. Nevertheless, in the event that
I am wrong in my
conclusion that Waldemar has not established an entitlement to the Kotara Place
property, then it is appropriate
that I should express my views concerning the
competing claim of Clarissa. 
<P>

69	For most of her life Clarissa has been cared for by her grandmother,
Lorraine Mather, the former wife of Waldemar. The reason
for this is that
Clarissa's mother Sasha Mather has suffered drug addiction. Clarissa has lived
with Mrs Mather and her present husband
since shortly after her birth. In
mid-1997 Mr and Mrs Mather obtained, with the support of the Department of
Community Serices, a
custody order for Clarissa for a period two years, at the
end of which period they expect that they will receive permanent custody
of
Clarissa until she attains the age of sixteen.
<P>

70	Clarissa's mother makes no contribution to her daughter's maintenance or
support. However, since November 1997 Mrs Mather has
been receiving an
allowance of $158 a fortnight for Clarissa from the Department of Youth and
Community Services. Before then Mrs
Mather received only child allowance of $23
a fortnight. 
<P>

71	Apart from her interest under the will of her great-grandmother Clarissa has
no assets. She requires dental treatment (being
braces for her teeth) at a cost
of about $3,500. In addition, she suffers from a problem with one of her
kidneys, which will probably
require surgical intervention. 
<P>

72	The evidence discloses that there was a very close and affectionate
relationship between the deceased and Clarissa. The deceased
spent a
considerable amount of time with her great-granddaughter, taking her out for
the whole day usually about twice a month, on
a Saturday. On occasion Clarissa
would stay overnight at the deceased's residence. The deceased also made
clothes for Clarissa.
<P>

73	It is apparent that the deceased recognised an obligation to make some
provision for Clarissa, who has had a most unfortunate
start to her life,
having been, for practical purposes, abandoned by her natural parents, and
whose grandparents (Waldemar's daughter
and her husband) are attempting to
provide the role of parents for her. The deceased clearly observed a need for
assistance in favour
of Clarissa, and she has attempted to do that by her
testamentary gift of the Kotara Place property to Clarissa. 
<P>

74	I would be most reluctant to interfere with the gift by the will of the
deceased of the Kotara Place property to Clarissa. Accordingly,
even if
(contrary to the conclusion which I have already expressed) Waldemar were to
have established an entitlement to an interest
in the Kotara Place property (be
it to receive that property absolutely, or be it some lesser interest in that
property), then, I
would consider the competing interest of Clarissa to be such
as either to extinguish entirely the entitlement of Waldemar to that
property,
or, at the very least, to reduce that interest to an entitlement for his life.

<P>

75	The only other fund from which Waldemar might be entitled to receive some
benefit out of the estate of the deceased would be
the interest of Kazimierz in
residue. Having regard to the age and the financial and material circumstances
of Kazimierz, I would
not be disposed to encroach upon his interest in that
residue, in order to give an additional benefit to Waldemar out of the estate
of the deceased.
<P>

76	It follows, therefore, that I proposed to dismiss the claim of the plaintiff
Waldemar Bujnowski. I propose to award to the plaintiff
Kazimierz Zacharczuk
the half interest of the deceased in the New Lambton property. I have already
expressed my conclusion that the
claim of Kazimierz for a declaration of trust
will be dismissed.
<P>

77	I have not heard any submissions as to costs. 
<P>

78	Although Kazimierz was not successful in his claim for a declaration of
trust, he has been substantially successful in his claim
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a></i>. Waldemar has been unsuccessful in his claim. The defendant
executor will be entitled to his costs in each set of proceedings. 
<P>

79	Accordingly, unless within seven days of the date hereof any party arranges
with my Associate for the matter to be listed for
argument as to costs, I make
the following orders:
<P>

80	3223 of 1997 Waldemar Bujnowski v The Public Trustee
<P>

	1. 	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

	2. 	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the 	defendant, such costs to
be on the party and party 	basis.
<P>

	3. 	I order that the defendant be entitled to retain from 	the estate of the
late Paulina Bujnowska ("the 	deceased") his costs
on the indemnity basis, to
the 	extent that he does not recover such costs from the 	plaintiff.
<P>

81	4213 of 1997 Kasimierz Zacharczuk v The Public Trustee
<P>

	1. 	I order that the defendant hold the interest of the 	late Paulina
Bujnowska ("the deceased") in the 	property situate at and
known as 4 Portland
Place, 	New Lambton, for the plaintiff absolutely. 
<P>

	2. 	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and 	party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the 	indemnity basis
be paid out of the estate of
the 	deceased.
<P>

82	4537 of 1998 Kasimierz Zacharczuk v The Public Trustee
<P>

	1. 	I order that the suit be dismissed.
<P>

	2. 	I order that the defendant be entitled to retain his 	costs on the
indemnity basis out of the estate the 	deceased, and otherwise
I make no order
as to costs.
<P>

83	In each matter I order that the exhibits may be returned.
