<b>4089 of 1998  	ADRIAN CECIL BRYANT  -v-  </b>
<P>

<b>			AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND BANKING </b>
<P>

<b>			GROUP LIMITED</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  There is presently before me a Notice of Motion filed by the
defendant, Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited on 24
September
1998, by which the defendant seeks substantively an order that the proceedings
brought by the plaintiff, Adrian Cecil Bryant,
be summarily dismissed pursuant
to Part 13 rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules.  That rule provides, in subrule
(1) thereof:
<P>

	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for
relief in the proceedings
---
<P>

	(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;
<P>

	(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or
<P>

	(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the 	Court.
<P>

	the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or
in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.
<P>

2	The substantive proceedings were instituted by a Statement of Claim filed by
the plaintiff on 19 June 1998.  The cause of action
asserted in that pleading
may be described as a cause of action based upon the conduct of the defendant
in its capacity as the mortgagee
of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, by that
pleading, asserted that he entered into certain agreements with the defendant
and that he
gave mortgages over various pieces of rural property to the
defendant, and that the defendant, in exercising its rights as mortgagee
over
those pieces of rural property and in exercising whatever rights it might have
had over cattle of the plaintiff located on some
or all of those properties,
acted in such a way as to give rise to a cause of action in the plaintiff.
<P>

3	The ground upon which the defendant makes the present application for summary
dismissal of the proceedings is that the present
proceedings in the Supreme
Court are, so it is submitted, an attempt by the plaintiff to re-litigate
matters which have already been
conclusively and finally decided in the Federal
Court of Australia.  To the extent that the present proceedings are an attempt
to
re-litigate what has already been decided in the Federal Court, the present
proceedings are, so it is submitted by the defendant,
an abuse of the process
of the Supreme Court.
<P>

4	On 16 October 1997 Justice Lindgren in the Federal Court in Sydney delivered
an ex tempore judgment in proceedings MG610 of 1994.
 The present plaintiff,
Adrian Cecil Bryant, was described as the applicant in those proceedings and
the present defendant, Australia
&amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited, was
described as the first respondent in those proceedings.
<P>

5	His Honour detailed the factual background to the proceedings before him and
also set forth the procedural history of the matter.
 It is unnecessary for me
to repeat the details of that factual background and procedural history.
Suffice it to say, however, that
there had already been before Justice Lindgren
earlier interlocutory applications concerning the form of the pleadings in the
Federal
Court proceedings.  The plaintiff in those proceedings made four
separate attempts to formulate his cause of action in an appropriately
framed
pleading.   The outcome of his Honour's decision was to the effect that the
plaintiff had not established a cause of action
disclosed in even the final of
those attempted pleadings (described as the Third Amended Statement of
Claim).
<P>

6	In consequent his Honour made orders on 17 November 1997 the effect of which
was that the claim of the plaintiff in the proceedings
before his Honour be
summarily dismissed.  Included in those orders (as order 5) was the
following:
<P>

	The applicant not be granted further leave to re-plead his claim.
<P>

7	The orders of Justice Lindgren of 17 November 1997 thus brought to an end the
proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia. 
No attempt was made by the
plaintiff to appeal from his Honour's decision to the Full Court of the Federal
Court.
<P>

8	I have had the benefit of each Counsel sending to me written submissions
before today's hearing.  Those two sets of written submissions
will be retained
in the Court file.
<P>

9	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, in opposition to the
present application for summary dismissal of the proceedings
which he has
brought in the Supreme Court, that the evidence in certain areas in support of
the plaintiff's claim is now stronger
than it was at the time of the various,
and especially the ultimate, hearings before Justice Lindgren in the Federal
Court.   The
plaintiff in particular seeks to rely upon evidentiary matters
which establish, so it is submitted, that the defendant sold the cattle
of the
plaintiff at an undervalue.
<P>

10	It should be emphasised, however, that Justice Lindgren did not decide the
matters before him upon the strength of the evidence
asserted by the plaintiff
to support the plaintiff's claim.  His Honour decided the matter upon whether
that evidence, assuming that
the plaintiff could, at the final hearing,
establish those evidentiary matters, could in any event sustain the cause of
action relied
upon by the plaintiff.
<P>

11	It does not seem to me that his Honour decided the matter in any way upon
the strength of the evidence that the plaintiff could
establish at the final
hearing.  His Honour was dealing with the question of whether the cause of
action could be sustained, assuming
that the evidence was as the plaintiff in
his various pleadings asserted it to be.  
<P>

12	But that matter of the strength of evidence, or even the approach by Justice
Lindgren to evidentiary matters, is not determinative
of the present
application before me.  I am satisfied (and indeed the plaintiff, through his
counsel, does not appear to dispute
this fact) that the present Statement of
Claim is in substance identical to the pleadings which were relied upon by the
plaintiff
in the proceedings in the Federal Court and in particular to the
final pleading in that Court (being the Third Amended Statement
of Claim), and
that the cause of action asserted in the Statement of Claim in the Supreme
Court is in substance identical to the
cause of action asserted by the
plaintiff in the various pleadings in the Federal Court and ultimately in the
Third Amended Statement
of Claim in the Federal Court.
<P>

13	In <i>Walton v Gardiner</i><b>, </b>a decision of the High Court of
Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 378</a>, Mason CJ and Deane and Dawson JJ, in a joint
judgment, said at 392-393:
<P>

	The inherent jurisdiction of the superior court to stay its proceedings on
grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories
of cases in which
the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice
with fairness and impartiality, may
be converted into instruments of injustice
or unfairness.
<P>

14	Thus it has long been established that, regardless of the purpose for their
institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute
an abuse of process if
they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail.  (See, for example,
<i>Metropolitan Bank v Pooley </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%2010%20AC%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1885) 10 AC 210</a> at 220-221 and <i>General
Steel Industries Incorporated v Commissioner for Railways </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR
125</a> at 128-130.)
<P>

15	Again, proceedings, although within the jurisdiction of a court will be
unjustifiably oppressive and vexatious of an objecting
defendant and will
constitute an abuse of process if that court is, in all the circumstances of
the particular case, a clearly inappropriate
forum to entertain them.  (See
<i>Voth v  Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538.)</a>
<P>

16	Yet again proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process
if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not
give rise to an estoppel,
their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the
reason that it is sought to litigate
anew a case which has already been
disposed of by earlier proceedings. (See, for example, <i>Reichel v McGrath
</i>(1989) 14 AC 665 at 668 and <i>Connelly v Director of Public
Prosecutions</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20AC%201254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) AC 1254</a> at 1361-1362 per Lord Pearce.)
<P>

17	The jurisdiction of a superior court in such a case was correctly described
by Lord Diplock in <i>Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police
</i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] UKHL 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 529</a> at 536 as
<P>

	the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse
of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent
with the literal
application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to
a party to litigation before it,
or would otherwise bring the administration of
justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.
<P>

18	In the instant case what the plaintiff is attempting to do is no more than
to re-litigate a matter which has finally and conclusively
been decided against
him in the Federal Court of Australia.  It is unnecessary to categorise the
precise manner in which he is attempting
to do that, be it called a
contravention of the principle of <i>res judicata</i> or an application of the
principle of issue estoppel or an application of what has been described as the
<i>Anshun </i>principle (after the decision of the High Court of Australia in
<i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589).</a>
<P>

19	It falls within the category described by the High Court of Australia in
<i>Walton v Gardiner </i>when Their Honours quoted with approval what Lord
Diplock said in <i>Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police</i>.
It constitutes, in my conclusion, an abuse of the process of the Court which
entitles the Court to exercise its power to ensure
that a plaintiff, who has
had every opportunity to litigate the asserted cause of action in the Federal
Court of Australia and has
lost in that Court, should not be allowed now to
attempt to re-litigate the same asserted cause of action in the Supreme
Court.
<P>

20	Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the present proceedings.
<P>

21	I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the proceedings be dismissed.
<P>

	2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the 	defendant of the Notice of
Motion filed by the 	defendant on 24 September 1998
and of the 	proceedings.
<P>

<P>
