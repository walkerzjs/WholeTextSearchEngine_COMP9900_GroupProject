<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, Andrew Smith, is a teacher employed by the
Department of Education and Training (NSW).  A charge has been brought
against
him pursuant to the <i>Teaching Services Act 1980</i>, s 83, which provides as
follows, so far as is relevant:  "An officer ... who ... (f) engages in any
disgraceful or improper conduct
...is guilty of a breach of discipline."
<P>

2   	Section 84 provides (relevantly) that a breach of
discipline alleged to have been committed by an officer shall be dealt with
by
the Director-General of Education or a prescribed officer.  Section 85 provides
that where a breach of discipline is then found
or admitted, the
Director-General or prescribed officer may impose a range of penalties.  Where
the breach is dealt with by the Director-General,
the range of penalties
includes dismissal or a direction that resignation will be accepted.  Where the
breach is dealt with by a
prescribed officer, the prescribed officer may
recommend to the Director-General that the officer be dismissed or that he or
she
be required or allowed to resign.  The Director-General is not bound by
such a recommendation and may impose a lesser penalty.  A
decision by the
Director-General has effect subject to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/gareata1980458/" class="autolink_findacts">Government and Related Employees
Appeal Tribunal Act 1980</a>. </i>
<P>

3   	Section 87 provides that an officer may be suspended from
duty until the charge has been dealt with.
<P>

4   	On 12 September 1997, Ms G Shadwick, an Assistant
Director-General of the department, gave notice of a charge pursuant to s
83
involving a young person.  (Pursuant to a direction given by me in the course
of the hearing the young person involved is now
referred to as "Miss T").  The
notice of charge dated 12 September 1997 was in the following terms.
<P>

"You are charged with a breach of discipline within the meaning of section
83(f) of the Teaching Services Act 1980 in that:
<P>

<center>	You engaged in improper conduct.</center>
<P>


<P>

Particulars of this breach of discipline are, whilst at Yeoval Central
School:
<P>

1.	During November 1991 whilst attending a party at the home of a student
(namely Darvy Wurr) you:
<P>

(a)	Allowed or condoned students (including Darvy Wurr, <i>Miss T</i>, Andrew
Eggleton) to consume alcohol.
<P>

(b)	Consumed alcohol in the presence of students (including Darvy Wurr,<i> Miss
T</i>, Andrew Eggleton).
<P>

(c)	Kissed a female student (namely<i> Miss T</i>).
<P>

(d)	Engaged in sexual intercourse with a female student (namely <i>Miss
T</i>).
<P>

2.	During November or December 1991, you took a female student (namely <i>Miss
T</i>) to your home, took her to your bedroom and engaged in sexual intercourse
with her on your bed.
<P>

3.	On or about 22 December 1991, you drove a female student (namely<i> Miss
T</i>) to Wellington, Dubbo and back to Yeoval without her parents' consent.
<P>

4.	During September 1991, you left your Year 12 class unsupervised so that you
could drive to your home to change your clothes for
a social engagement
immediately after school finishing time.
<P>

5.	On or about 5 December 1991, whilst at a party at the home of a male student
(namely Paul Price) you consumed alcohol in the
presence of students (including
Andrew Eggleton).
<P>

6.	On or about 18 December 1991 and 20 December 1991, you engaged in conduct
leading to cautions by a police officer (Constable
Ken McKenzie) in regard to
the supply of alcohol to students.
<P>

You are directed to reply to me in writing within fourteen (14) days, either
admitting or denying the truth of the charges and provide
any explanation you
desire to give."
<P>

5   	Following correspondence between the plaintiff's solicitors
and the department, the charge was amended by letter dated 9 March
1998 to
include the following matters.
<P>

"7.	During December 1991, despite warnings from the principal (Ron Phillips),
you organised and held a party at your residence in
Yeoval when you knew or
ought to have known that students would attend the party.
<P>

8.	During the party referred to in particular 7, you:
<P>

(i)	allowed and or condoned students to attend the party.
<P>

(ii)	consumed alcohol in the presence of students (including Amanda Lees).
<P>

(iii)	kissed and embraced a female student (namely <i>Miss T</i>).
<P>

9.	You failed to:
<P>

(i)	maintain proper standards of conduct whilst in the presence of children who
were students at your school;
<P>

(ii)	have regard for the need to protect the reputation of the teaching service
and the Department.
<P>

by:
<P>

(a)	becoming angry during the party referred to in Particular 7 and throwing
household objects (including a toaster) out of the
house.
<P>

(b)	during the party referred to in Particular 7, punching a wall with your
fist which necessitated your conveyance to the local
hospital for medical
treatment.
<P>

(c)	engaging in the conduct outlined in Particulars 1 to 6 inclusive."
<P>

6   	Following further correspondence, Mr G Green, an assistant
Director-General of the department, advised the plaintiff's solicitors,
by
letter dated 8 March 1999, that he had been appointed as the prescribed officer
to deal with the charge and would proceed accordingly.
<P>

7   	On 1 April 1999, the plaintiff instituted these proceedings
in the Administrative Law Division of the court, by summons, joining
as
defendants Mr K G Boston (Director-General of the department), Ms G Shadwick
and Mr G Green as defendants.  The following orders
are claimed in the
summons:
<P>

"1.	An order permanently restraining the Third Defendant from dealing with the
Charge of breach of discipline contrary to Section
83(f) <i>Teaching Services
Act 1980</i> contained in a Notice of Charge signed by the Second Defendant
dated 12 September 1997 and amended on 9 March 1998.
<P>

2.	An order permanently restraining the Second Defendant from prosecuting the
charge of breach of discipline contrary to Section
83(f) <i>Teaching Services
Act 1980</i> contained in a Notice of Charge signed by the Second Defendant
dated 12 September 1997 and amended on 9 March 1998.
<P>

3.	An order permanently staying all proceedings pertaining to the prosecution
of the charge of breach of discipline contrary to
Section 83(f) <i>Teaching
Services Act 1980</i> contained in the Notice of Charge signed by the Second
Defendant dated 12 September 1997 and amended on 9 March 1998.
<P>

4.	Costs."
<P>

8   	As at 11 May 1999, the plaintiff had been suspended from
active teaching.  On that date, Dunford J noted an undertaking by
the
defendants not to take any further steps in relation to the charge until the
present proceedings were determined provided that
the plaintiff prosecuted the
proceedings expeditiously and did not seek to return to active teaching.
<P>

9   	The matter came on for hearing before me on 26 August 1999.
Mr Porter of Queen's Counsel and Ms Needham appeared for the plaintiff.
 Mr
Menzies of Queen's Counsel and Ms Dowling appeared for the defendants.
<P>

10   	The evidence for the plaintiff consisted of two affidavits
together with documents annexed and exhibited.  No evidence was
adduced by the
defendants.  The first affidavit read in the plaintiff's case was that of Mr P
A MacMahon, the plaintiff's solicitor,
sworn 1 April 1999.  The affidavit gave
some part of the history of the case which is apparent in further detail from
the documentary
material referred to in the affidavit and exhibited to the
affidavit.  A copy of the departmental file in relation to the disciplinary
charge was exhibited to the affidavit.
<P>

11   	In the second affidavit, sworn on 26 August 1999, the
plaintiff said that, following his dismissal in April 1992, he left
the Yeoval
area and has not returned to that area nor, with two minor exceptions, had
contact with any of the persons with whom he
was in contact whilst living at
Yeoval.  He went on to say that he no longer had his diaries nor any other
documentation which might
assist him to establish where he was at any
particular time in the latter part of 1991. 
<P>

12   	The plaintiff graduated from the University of Newcastle
with the degree of bachelor of education in social sciences.  He
was engaged by
the department pursuant to s 48 of the <i>Teaching Services Act 1980</i>.
(This section provides, in general terms, that a person appointed to a
permanent position is to be appointed on probation for a
period of twelve
months or such longer period as the Director-General may determine.  The
Director-General may, after expiration
of the period of probation, confirm or
annul the appointment or, during the period of probation, extend the period of
probation or
annul the appointment.  There is a statutory bar against appeal to
the <i>Government and Related Employees</i> <i>Appeal Tribunal</i> against
termination of employment pursuant to such annulment.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff commenced employment at Yeoval Central
School shortly after the beginning of the 1991 school year, teaching
social
studies and related subjects.  The plaintiff's headmaster in 1991 was Mr R
Phillips.  
<P>

14   	The following course of events appears from the
documentary material which is in evidence.  During 1991, Mr R Phillips,
headmaster
of Yeoval Central School, recorded, in his diary, concerns in
relation to asserted deficiencies in the plaintiff's classroom work
and
attendance record.  In November and December 1991, Mr Phillips recorded
concerns about alleged fraternisation by the plaintiff
with students,
particularly female students, outside school hours.
<P>

15   	On 9 December 1991, Mr Phillips wrote a report on the
plaintiff's performance.  The report refers to recent improvement in
level of
commitment and enthusiasm for teaching but the need to maintain a more
consistent and sustained approach.  The report was,
generally speaking,
unfavourable but hopeful of improvement.  Mr Phillips recommended that the
plaintiff's efficiency be determined
as not satisfying the requirements for the
award of a teacher's certificate.  The implication of the report was a
recommendation
that the plaintiff's probation period be extended. 
<P>

16   	In January and February 1992, Mr Phillips recorded
concerns in relation to an alleged sexual relationship formed by the plaintiff
with a student, Miss T, associated with heavy drinking by the plaintiff in the
company of students.  Mr Phillips also recorded that
Constable McKenzie of
Yeoval had informed him of having given two cautions to the plaintiff in
December 1991 regarding the supply
of alcohol to school students (presumably
under age); that he (Mr Phillips) had interviewed Miss T who confirmed that
sexual intercourse
with the plaintiff had occurred; that the allegation had
been put to the plaintiff by Mr R Hankin, Director, Orana West Cluster of
Schools, who was present at the interview of the plaintiff; and that the
plaintiff had neither confirmed nor denied the allegation.
 The matter was
apparently reported to the police and to the Department of Community
Services.
<P>

17   	The allegation of a sexual relationship with a student
was, as expected, of serious concern to the department.  Pending legal
advice,
the department wrote to the plaintiff on 19 February 1992, advising him that
serious allegations had been made concerning
his conduct and that, pending
investigation, the plaintiff was suspended on full pay<b>. </b>
<P>

18   	The department's file includes a copy of a police
statement made by Miss T at Dubbo Police Station on 20 February 1992.  (It
is
not apparent from the file whether this statement came into the possession of
the department earlier than 10 July 1997.  On that
date, Miss T signed a
document authorising the department to use information contained in the
statement.  The department was, however,
fully conversant with Miss T's
assertions, from the departmental interview to which I have referred.)  Miss T
said in the statement
to the police that she was born on 24 May 1975.
(Accordingly, she would have been sixteen years of age in November 1991.)  She
said
that, at the end of November 1991, she had gone to a party at the home of
a school friend; she and other students had walked to the
hotel in the town
where one of the students had bought a large bottle of spirits and some soft
drink; they all chipped in; they walked
back to the house where the party was
going on and shared the purchases among about four of them;  she was feeling a
bit drunk; 
she saw the plaintiff there;  he went to the hotel at one stage and
bought the boys a carton of beer;  Miss T also drank Tropicana
(which I take to
be alcoholic);  she started to feel drunk;  she remembered some things but not
others;  she and Mr Smith were kissing
on the lounge;  she could not remember
which of them had initiated that conduct;  a friend, Amanda Lees, had chipped
her and the
plaintiff for kissing; the plaintiff mentioned this to her; she
said to the plaintiff, "Oh who cares what she thinks" and they started
kissing
again; later, they were sitting on the ground in the backyard, kissing each
other; a fellow student, Andrew Eggleton, gave
them a blanket; the plaintiff
picked up the blanket and he and Miss T walked further down into the backyard
to the vegetable patch.
<P>

19   	Miss T's language in the statement displays a certain
nonchalance about what is then said to have occurred.  She is recorded
as
saying "We started kissing again and then it just happened.  We had a root.  I
remember feeling his dick going into my fanny and
I remember him moving up and
down on top of me.  After we finished, he said, `I wish we could do it again,
when we are sober.'  He
said it when we were lying on the blanket.  Before we
had the root, I can't remember if Mr Smith took my clothes off or whether I
took my clothes off for him.  After we finished, I had to put my undies and my
cut off blue jeans back on.  I think my top and bra
were still on, but I just
had to do the bra up."  After describing that episode, Miss T said in the
statement:
<P>

"I just remembered that before Mr Smith and I went down in to the back garden,
he said to me, something like, `Can you stay the
night at my place.'  I said,
`Can we phone mum from your place?  He said, `My phone doesn't work.'  So then
I said, `I will ring
Mum from here.'  I went and made a phone call to mum.  I
was going to make out to her that I was staying at Amanda's place.  She
told me
something.  I can't remember if Mr Smith was in the room or not when I made the
call."
<P>

20   	There is no suggestion in the statement to the police that
Miss T was at all upset by what is alleged to have occurred, either
at the time
or at any later time.  The tenor of the statement strongly suggests she was
not.
<P>

21   	In her statement, Miss T went on to describe a further
episode in a similarly casual manner.  She said, "The next time Mr
Smith and I
had a root was before school had broken up for the Christmas holidays."  She
then described meeting the plaintiff after
receiving a message from two of her
friends.  She said the plaintiff drove her in his car to a place twenty or
thirty kilometres
from the town; on the way, the plaintiff had said they needed
to get their story right about the party;  Miss T replied that she
and a friend
had already got a story ready, namely, that the plaintiff had left at a point
in the party which preceded anything of
a sexual nature having occurred;  they
stopped, talked and kissed;  the plaintiff checked that his house mate was
still playing tennis;
 Miss T said that her mother was still at Tech;  they got
undressed and lay on the bed;  she then described a further episode of
intercourse in a matter of fact way;  she said the two of them then "just lay
and talked for a while about different things."
<P>

22   	Again, there is no suggestion in the statement that Miss T
was upset by the episode, then or at any later time, and the strong
implication
is that she was not.
<P>

23   	In her statement, Miss T said that, on 22 December 1991,
she went for a drive with the plaintiff; nothing happened between
them that
day, she went to his place a little later that night and he drove her home
afterwards.
<P>

24   	Miss T went on to say that, just before 22 December 1991,
the plaintiff had a party at his place.  Miss T said in her statement,
"When I
was at his party, we had a kiss, but that was all."  She said her boyfriend
"went right off at me" for that;  the plaintiff
had asked her to stay the night
at his place but that proved to be impracticable.
<P>

25   	Miss T said that, on the Saturday night prior to making
her statement, 15 February 1992, she had been at a party at Rachael
Lees'
house;  the plaintiff was at the same party and was ignoring her,  she told a
friend, Melissa Redding, that she and the plaintiff
had slept together twice;
she also told another friend, Tanya Wykes.
<P>

26   	Miss T said in her statement that she had had sex with her
boyfriend previously.  She said she did not want to see the plaintiff
get into
trouble from the police or go to gaol.  She said she did not want to go to
court or tell people what happened.  She said
another reason she did not want
"to go" (presumably, to court) was because she did not want to see the
plaintiff get into any trouble.
<P>

27   	Mr Phillips' report of 9 December 1991 was made on a
departmental form which makes provision for a memorandum to the teacher,
appearing at the foot of the same form.  The memorandum is dated 18 February
1992.  It is in terms that, following consideration
of Mr Phillips' report and
of other evidence, it was proposed that the plaintiff's efficiency would be
determined on 18 March 1992
as not satisfying the requirements for the award of
a teacher's certificate and for the position held.  This was not notice of
annulment
and it is unnecessary to decide precisely how that memorandum
related, if at all, to the scheme of the<i> Teaching Services Act 1980.</i>
<P>

28   	Mr W Kyrios, Director of Legal Services, was consulted.
He wrote to the department's Director of Human Resources on 21 February
1992.
He advised that there was sufficient evidence either to annul the plaintiff's
probationary appointment pursuant to s 48 or
to charge him with a disciplinary
offence pursuant to s 83.  The letter went on to advise, in effect,  that the
department could
terminate the plaintiff's engagement pursuant to s 48 or, if
the department was not satisfied that the plaintiff's services should
be
terminated, the matter could be dealt with by way of disciplinary charge.  Mr
Kyrios went on to advise that, if the former approach
were to be adopted, the
plaintiff should be given the opportunity of responding to the allegation of
sexual misconduct and that the
issues should be confined to that topic.
<P>

29   	It was implicit in Mr Kyrios' advice (incorrect, as it
turned out) that annulment pursuant to s 48 would terminate the plaintiff's
employment in a way that could not be challenged other than for denial of
procedural fairness.  (As, as will appear, Mr Kyrios was
by no means alone in
his view).  
<P>

30   	Pursuant to Mr Kyrios' advice, the department wrote to the
plaintiff on 5 March 1992 enclosing a letter from Mr Hankin dated
4 March 1992.
In that letter, Mr Hankin said it was alleged that the plaintiff was involved
in an intimate personal relationship
with Miss T, a student at Yeoval Central
School; that sexual intercourse had occurred on two occasions; that, Miss T
being under
seventeen years of age, the matter had been notified to the police
who had obtained a statement from Miss T; and that Mr Hankin recommended
consideration be given to annulling the plaintiff's appointment.  The
department's letter sought a response to the allegations of
having formed an
intimate personal relationship with a student and having engaged in sexual
intercourse with a student under seventeen
years of age.  The letter went on to
advise the plaintiff that he was suspended on full pay until further notice.
<P>

31   	On 10 March 1992, the plaintiff wrote to the department
saying that he categorically and totally denied the matters alleged.
<P>

32   	On 19 March 1992, Mr Phillips submitted a report.  The
report was very unfavourable.  It asserted, in detail, lack of thorough
lesson
and programme planning and preparation, inappropriate teacher technique and
inability to cater for a wide range of student
needs and abilities, and
persistent lack of appropriate student supervision.  Additionally, it asserted
inappropriate conduct and
behaviour with students, stating that a number of
serious incidents had occurred in 1991, that on at least four occasions the
plaintiff
was counselled and finally cautioned about his relationship with
students both at school and in a social setting, involving alleged
drinking in
the company of students at a hotel and at his house, inviting male and female
students to his house, and transporting
female students in his car despite
being cautioned about the practice.  The report concluded with the comment
that, in November 1991,
the plaintiff had been informed that he would not be
recommended as having fulfilled the requirements to receive his teacher's
certificate.
 There was no explicit mention in the report of the alleged sexual
misconduct with Miss T.  
<P>

33   	On 20 March 1992, the department received a letter from
the plaintiff, responding to Mr Phillips' report of 9 December 1991
and the
memorandum of 18 February 1992.  In his letter, the plaintiff said he had not
received the report and memorandum until 11
March 1992.  (There is no evidence
that he received it earlier.)  In his 20 March 1992 letter, the plaintiff, in
effect, sought an
opportunity of fulfilling Mr Phillips' expressed hopes that
the plaintiff's performance as a teacher would continue to improve, which
the
plaintiff said (as was obviously the case) could not be done while he was
suspended.
<P>

34   	On 1 April 1992, the Director-General, Mr Boston, directed
a notice to the plaintiff annulling his appointment pursuant to
s 48 and
determining that the plaintiff would cease to be employed as from 8 April 1992.

<P>

35   	On 22 April 1992, the plaintiff filed an application for
reinstatement in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South
Wales
pursuant to the <i>Industrial Relations Act 1991</i>, s 246.  The application
included a statement of the plaintiff's reasons as to why the dismissal was
harsh, unreasonable and unjust
within the meaning of that section.  These were
as follows:
<P>

"1.	In respect of the Principal's report prior to its receipt I had been given
no indication by him or my immediate supervisor that
my services were so
unsatisfactory that I may be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I believe that the matters raised in the Principal's report are not the real
reasons for my dismissal.  On about 5 March 1992
I received from the Department
details of certain allegations that had been made against me by a person
unknown as to my personal
conduct.  I have denied the allegations.  The
coincidence of the allegations and my dismissal, however, lead me to believe
that that
is the reason for my dismissal.
<P>

3.	I believe that in view of the above my dismissal is harsh, unreasonable and
unjust."
<P>

36   	The department sought a preliminary ruling by the
Commission that there was no jurisdiction to entertain the application on
the
ground that an annulment pursuant to s 48 of the <i>Teaching Services Act
1980</i> was not a dismissal within the meaning of the <i>Industrial Relations
Act 1991</i>, s 246.  On 14 August 1992, Connor CC held that it was.  On 16
December 1992, on appeal to the Industrial Court of New South Wales,
Cahill DCJ
reversed that decision.  On 27 August 1993, the Full Court of the Industrial
Court of New South Wales reversed Cahill
DCJ and reinstated the decision of
Connor CC: (see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%2051%20IR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 51 IR 204).</a>
<P>

37   	The hearing of the substantive application then proceeded
before Connor CC on 25 November 1993.  Evidence was given by the
plaintiff in
support of the application.  The department commenced its case.  Mr Phillips
was called.  Part way through his evidence
in chief, the Commissioner
intervened with some observations concerning the issues in the proceedings and
the matter was adjourned
to 26 November 1993.  On 26 November 1993, the
Commission was informed that the matter had been settled on the basis that the
plaintiff
would be reappointed as a probationary teacher from the beginning of
1994 but with details remaining to be discussed.  The matter
was adjourned to
16 December 1993 for that purpose.  On 16 December, terms of settlement were
handed up.  These included a term that
the plaintiff would be reinstated on the
basis of a further six months probationary period.
<P>

38   	I infer that the plaintiff then resumed teaching duties
with the department and that he continued to work for the defendant
as a
teacher for some four years until the present charge was notified.  I assume
that, at some stage, the plaintiff fulfilled the
department's requirements and
obtained a teaching certificate.
<P>

39   	I will now provide a more detailed summary of the
proceedings in the Commission.  Part of the transcript of the proceedings
before Connor CC is contained in the department's file.  The following is a
summary of the evidence given before the Commission so
far as it appears from
the incomplete transcript.
<P>

40   	Conformably with the plaintiff's assertion that the real
reason for annulment was the allegation of sexual misconduct, it
was led from
him in chief that he had received the department's letter of 5 March 1992 and
the enclosed letter of 4 March 1992 by
Mr Hankin, which together specified the
allegation of sexual intercourse with Miss T.  The plaintiff's letter denying
the allegation
was also tendered.  Asked when he first became aware of the
allegation, the plaintiff said that he had heard rumour of it during
the
previous year, 1991; that he been asked by someone in a hotel whether he had
had sex with a student; that, less than a week later,
he was asked by a student
in another class whether this was so; that the student's father was a friend of
his, and the question was
put to him in his friend's home.  Asked whether the
suggestion that he had formed an intimate relationship with the student was
true,
the plaintiff answered that it was not.  The plaintiff then went on to
say that, about two weeks into the beginning of the school
year in 1992, he was
made further aware of the allegation in the discussion with Mr Phillips and Mr
Hankin (that being the interview
to which I have referred); and that, on that
occasion, he had been asked to resign.  
<P>

41   	The plaintiff was cross-examined about alleged
deficiencies in relation to class work.  He was asked if Mr Phillips had
counselled
him strongly against holding a party for students because of
possible problems with alcohol.  He agreed that Mr Phillips had done
so and
that he (the plaintiff) had agreed not to hold the party.  He agreed though
that the party had gone ahead, not at his place,
and that he had attended.  He
agreed he had gone to a party in early December 1991 given by one of the
students and had become reasonably
drunk.  He denied supplying alcohol to a
year nine student.  He denied kissing and cuddling Miss T at that party.  He
denied being
especially friendly with another female student.  He did not
recall receiving cautions from Constable McKenzie a week or so before
Christmas
1991, although he agreed that was possible.  He then agreed that he had had a
couple of discussions with Constable McKenzie,
one to do with a driving matter
and the other to do with supplying alcohol.  (He did not admit in
cross-examination that he had supplied
alcohol to an under age person.  He was
not asked if he had, except in relation to the particular year nine student to
whom I have
referred, and that he denied, as I have said.)
<P>

42   	He agreed, in cross-examination, that, at the interview
with Mr Phillips and Mr Hankin concerning Miss T, he did not agree
with or deny
the allegations put to him at that time.
<P>

43   	It appears from other cross-examination that the plaintiff
had said in his evidence in chief (in a part of the transcript
which is not
before me) that he was aware of his classroom deficiencies but believed he was
improving and that his superiors were
not dissatisfied with the way he was
going.
<P>

44   	It was not put to the plaintiff in cross-examination that
he had had sexual intercourse with Miss T.
<P>

45   	Mr C Howard of the NSW Teachers' Federation was called in
the plaintiff's case.  The substantive parts of his evidence have
not been
included in the transcript in evidence before me.
<P>

46   	Trevor Smith, the plaintiff's father was called in the
plaintiff's case.  He had spoken to Mr Hankin at the beginning of 1992.
Nothing presently relevant seems to arise from this witnesses evidence.  
<P>

47   	The Crown then opened its case.  Mr Phillips was called.
He gave evidence of matters of which he had direct knowledge and
which had
caused him concern.  The plaintiff had complained about Mr Phillips writing an
interim report, whereas that report (he
said) was merely part of the routine
procedures in relation to a teacher on probation.  The Commissioner then
allowed evidence of
things Mr Phillips was told, but only as evidence of being
so told not as evidence of the fact.  These matters related to teaching
ability
and competency, punctuality and lesson preparation.  Familiarity with students,
Mr Phillips said, was probably not the concern.
 There was a concern about lack
of class discipline.  The plaintiff's lesson plans had been produced for review
by a senior teacher,
Mr Batten.  About a month later, Mr Phillips reviewed the
situation in relation to classroom work and found that there had been an
improvement, but Mr Phillips said he was not satisfied that the plaintiff was
ready to receive a teacher's certificate, further development
being needed.  Mr
Phillips said he had included encouraging comments in his report, (which I take
to be the report of 9 December
1991) so as not to destroy the plaintiff's
aspirations, but that the conclusion was that the plaintiff was not qualified
to receive
a teacher's certificate at that stage.  Mr Phillips said he was not
confident that the plaintiff would ever qualify for a teacher's
certificate.
<P>

48   	Mr Phillips said that, on 21 November, he had counselled
the plaintiff against holding a party for students.  Mr Phillips
said he heard
that the party had gone on elsewhere and that the plaintiff had attended.  He
spoke to the plaintiff about this.  The
plaintiff had replied that it was his
own private business and threatened to bring in the Teachers' Federation.  The
Federation did
not intervene and Mr Phillips did not pursue the matter further.
Then Mr Batten had raised with Mr Phillips the matter of the plaintiff
transporting students in his car.  The plaintiff was counselled and cautioned
about that, particularly about having young girls in
the car with him because
of the risk of innuendo.  There was then a report of the plaintiff drinking
with a student, Andrew Eggleton,
while counselling him over some matter.  Mr
Phillips had warned the plaintiff about that.
<P>

49   	Up to this point, no evidence of sexual intercourse with
Miss T had been led in the department's case.
<P>

50   	It was then sought to adduce evidence from Mr Phillips
concerning something he was told by a student, Melissa Reading (sic).
 This was
a person referred to in Miss T's statement to the police.  In that statement,
Miss T said that, on 15 February 1992, at
a party at Rachael Lee's house she
told a friend, Melissa Redding (sic), that she (Miss T) and the plaintiff had
slept together twice,
and that she (Miss T) had also told another friend, Tanya
Wykes, of this.
<P>

51   	There was an objection to hearsay evidence being led.  The
Commissioner correctly devined what the nature of the evidence
would be,
although he may not have known what it was to be in terms.  He said, "This goes
to, I gather, the allegation which was
a central issue in the proceedings does
it?"  No coherent response is recorded in the transcript.  The Commissioner
referred to his
power to admit hearsay evidence but expressed a reluctance to
rely on hearsay evidence of the kind he believed to be involved.  The
proceedings were then adjourned for an off-the-record discussion with the
Commissioner.
<P>

52   	The terms of settlement handed up when the proceedings
resumed on 16 December 1993 were as follows.
<P>

"1.	Mr Smith will be reinstated to the Department of School Education Teaching
Service on day one, term one, 1994 (Western Division).
<P>

2.	Mr Smith will be appointed to Willyama High School as a mobile Social
Science Teacher.
<P>

3.	The appointment will be for a six month probationary period.
<P>

4.	During the six month probationary period the Principal of Willyama High
School will submit a report containing a recommendation
on efficiency at the
end of term one and the end of term two.
<P>

5.	The Principal will be advised of the areas of concern identified by the
Principal of Yeoval Central School and will put in place
a detailed improvement
program for Mr Smith directed to these areas.  The Principal will be provided
with a copy of the Principals
report on teacher dated 9 December, 1991 and with
details of previous improvement programs developed for Mr Smith.
<P>

6.	Mr Smith will co-operate fully with all aspects of the improvement program
including providing evidence of lesson preparation
on a weekly basis.
<P>

7.	At the conclusion of term 2, 1994 -
<P>

(i)	Should Mr Smith receive a satisfactory report, he will be appointed to the
nearest available vacancy;
<P>

(ii)	Should Mr Smith receive an unsatisfactory report, action will commence
immediately to annul his appointment.
<P>

8.	Mr Smith will not receive any payment or accrue any leave or other
entitlement for the period from his dismissal until his retirement."
<P>

53   	On the same date, 16 December 1993, Connor CC issued a
document under the heading "Statement".  It gave details of the history
of the
matter prior to the application and of the course of the application.  The
history of events recounted in the statement referred
to the alleged
unsatisfactory features of the plaintiff's employment during his first year,
including fraternisation with students
outside of school hours.  It made no
reference to any higher level of misconduct such as sexual impropriety with a
student, travelling
in a motor vehicle with female students, drinking with
students or providing alcohol to students.  The statement concluded with the
matter having been resolved in accordance with the terms of settlement.  The
Commissioner said, "The matter is concluded on that
basis."
<P>

54   	The parties are at issue as to how to characterise what
had occurred in the Commission.  It is submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff
that the proceedings were concluded with an order by the Commission for
reinstatement.  I disagree.  Connor CC noted that
the proceedings were
concluded on the basis of the terms of settlement.  The terms of settlement
included an agreement for reinstatement
not agreement to an order for
reinstatement.  No such order was made.
<P>

55   	No further action was taken by the department until 1997.
There is then a record of interview with Miss T, conducted by a
departmental
officer on 10 July 1997.  Miss T was now twenty two years of age.  There is
also a statement by Miss T on file.  It
is undated, but I take it to have been
made shortly after interview (as is the case with other persons interviewed a
little later).
 In the statement, Miss T gave a short but clear account of
sexual intercourse on the two occasions referred to in her statement
to the
police.
<P>

56   	There are some disturbing features of the interview
conducted on 10 July 1997.  Asked how she felt "about all this", Miss
T replied
that a lot of people heard about it then, and she felt they blamed her for the
plaintiff losing his job, leaving town and
possibly going to gaol.  The
interviewer replied that the plaintiff had not gone to gaol, that he was stood
down from his job "firstly
because of efficiency", that he had appealed on the
grounds of wrongful dismissal, that he had been reinstated and that he had been
employed at a school near Broken Hill.  
<P>

57   	The interviewer then gave Miss T information about the
background of the reopened investigation, including the recommendation
of the
Honourable John Slattery that a number of investigations into sexual misconduct
on the part of teachers should be reopened.
 The interviewer went on to provide
information about the nature of the reopened investigation.  Miss T was told it
was highly unlikely
that the process would end in any criminal court and that
it could all be settled by what was called a paper hearing between the
department's lawyers and the plaintiff's union lawyers; that, if the
allegations were substantiated, the plaintiff could be charged
with breaches of
discipline and disciplinary action might follow within the department, not in a
criminal court; and that, if the
matter reached a certain stage, the plaintiff
would have a right of appeal to the<i> NSW Government and Related Employees
Appeal Tribunal</i>. 
<P>

58   	I hesitate to criticise an interviewing officer, who has
not had the opportunity to be heard.  It is sufficient to say, for
present
purposes, that Miss T appears to have been given to understand - erroneously -
that, if she authorised the use of her police
statement, she could be assured
oral evidence by her in any investigation would be unnecessary (an assurance
which the interviewing
officer was in no position to give) and, secondly, that
any sanction imposed on the plaintiff would be a punishment which, by
implication,
did not include the prospect of dismissal.  Whether Miss T would
now be willing to give evidence against the plaintiff (if that be
required) in
the current disciplinary proceedings is doubtful.  Whether the department would
compel her to do so - assuming a power
to compel - must also be doubtful in the
circumstances that have occurred.
<P>

59   	On 4 February 1998, Ms Amanda Lees was interviewed and, on
10 February 1998, she signed a statement.  On 4 February 1998,
Ms M Tobin was
interviewed, and she signed a statement on 23 February 1998.  These interviews
and statements were also directed to
investigation of the allegation of sexual
impropriety on the part of the plaintiff.
<P>

60   	There is nothing in the record of interview of Miss T or
the other persons to whom I have referred suggesting that Miss T
was at all
upset by the alleged sexual episodes involving the plaintiff.
<P>

61   	The first argument advanced by counsel for the plaintiff
was that the disciplinary proceedings should be stayed as an abuse
of process.
He relied on the decision of the High Court in <i>Walton v Gardiner</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d1993%29%20177%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-1993) 177 CLR 378</a> and, in particular, on that part of the decision to
which I shall refer.  Reliance on the decision was limited in that way.
<P>

62   	The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its
own proceedings on grounds of abuse of process was stated (at 393)
as extending
to -
<P>

"all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the
court, which exist to administer justice with fairness
and impartiality, may be
converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness."
<P>

Such categories were said to include the following (at 393) -
<P>

"(I)f, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel,
their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious
and oppressive for the
reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been
disposed of by earlier proceedings."
<P>

63   	These statements of principle have equal application where
proceedings other than proceedings in the same court are sought
to be stayed.
In <i>Walton</i> itself, the proceedings sought to be stayed were disciplinary
proceedings before a tribunal. 
<P>

64   	Does the department seek to litigate anew a case which has
been disposed of by earlier proceedings?  I do not think so for
the following
reasons.
<P>

65   	The case against the plaintiff allegedly disposed of by
the proceedings before the Commission was not explicitly stated in
the argument
before me.  I take the plaintiff's argument to be that the case against him,
allegedly disposed of by the proceedings
before the Commission, was that sexual
intercourse with Miss T warranted termination of the plaintiff's employment by
the department,
and that this is the case he now faces anew in current
proceedings.
<P>

66   	I find, in the plaintiff's favour, that that case was
advanced against him in the Commission.
<P>

67   	The plaintiff first raised the matter as part of<i>
his</i> case before the Commission.  One at least of the grounds on which he
contended that the dismissal had been unfair was that lack of
teaching
proficiency was the ostensible but not the true reason for his dismissal, and
that the true reason was the complaint of
sexual misconduct made against him
which, according to the plaintiff, was false.  The plaintiff threw down the
gauntlet on that issue.
 The department had a choice.  It could have let the
gauntlet lie and sought to justify the dismissal solely on the ground of lack
of teaching proficiency, irrespective of any hidden agenda which it might have
had based on the allegation of sexual misconduct.
 Alternatively, it could also
have sought to justify the dismissal solely on the ground of lack of teaching
proficiency and, confining
its case to that, it could have sought to dispel the
assertion of a hidden agenda - if it was in a position to do so - by calling
those departmental officers who made the relevant recommendations and decisions
about termination of the plaintiff's appointment.
 The department did neither
of these things.  It took up the gauntlet, electing to answer the plaintiff's
challenge by endeavouring
to justify the dismissal, not only on the ground of
lack of teaching proficiency, but also on the ground of sexual intercourse with
Miss T.
<P>

68   	The statement in <i>Walton</i> (quoted above) that there
need not be an estoppel does not qualify the need for disposal of the case
against the plaintiff by the
earlier proceedings.  That statement serves only
to include within the ambit of the principle the disposition of
<i>substantially</i> the same issue, that is, notwithstanding some
insubstantial difference.  (See the discussion at 398.)
<P>

69   	The fatal flaw in the plaintiff's argument is that the
case of sexual intercourse with Miss T warranting dismissal was not
disposed of
by the proceedings in the Commission.  No determination having been made, no
judgment given and no order made, the proceedings
disposed of nothing.  All the
Commissioner did was to record the parties' agreement for re-instatement.
<P>

70   	If I am wrong and the relevant issue was materially
disposed of by the earlier proceedings, I would not stay the disciplinary
proceedings in the exercise of the Court's discretion. 
<P>

71   	In <i>Walton</i>, the majority, in their joint judgment,
referred to the earlier decision in <i>Jago v District Court (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989)
168 CLR 23.</a>  They said (at 395-6):
<P>

"As was pointed out in<i> Jago</i>, the question whether criminal proceedings
should be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls to be determined
by a weighing
process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors
and considerations.  Among those factors and considerations are
the
requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the
disposition of charges of serious offences and
in the conviction of those
guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the
administration of justice.  The question
whether disciplinary proceedings in
the Tribunal should be stayed by the Supreme Court on abuse of process grounds
should be determined
by reference to a weighing process similar to the kind
appropriate in the case of criminal proceedings but adapted to take account
of
the differences between the two kinds of proceedings.  In particular, in
deciding whether a permanent stay of disciplinary proceedings
in the Tribunal
should be ordered, consideration will necessarily be given to the protective
character of such proceedings and to
the importance of protecting the public
from incompetence and professional misconduct on the part of medical
practitioners."
<P>

72   	<i>Walton</i> involved disciplinary proceedings against
medical practitioners which could have resulted in their deregistration in the
public interest.
The present case involves whether the employment of a teacher
should be terminated for alleged misconduct in the public interest.
 In the
present case, the disciplinary proceedings would come on for determination
about eight years after the relevant allegations
were made.  The plaintiff has
had reason to believe, since 1993, that these allegations would not be relied
upon as a ground for
dismissal.  There is a serious question as to whether Miss
T will be a witness against the plaintiff in the disciplinary proceedings
and
as to whether, on that account, the charge of misconduct in the relevant
respect can be sustained.  But, notwithstanding these
considerations, the
nature of the allegations is such that the agency charged by the parliament to
decide whether the plaintiff's
employment should be terminated for such alleged
misconduct should be allowed to discharge its function.  In my view, the public
interest in that regard prevails.
<P>

73   	I would stress that dismissal is not the inevitable
outcome of the relevant allegations being made out (if that should occur),
and
nothing in this judgment should be construed as conveying such a view.  If the
charge is made out factually, that is, of course,
a serious matter.  It is an
offence against <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s73.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 73</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></i> for a teacher to have sexual
intercourse with a female pupil above the age of sixteen years and under the
age of seventeen years.
 The maximum penalty is penal servitude for eight
years.  The policy of this law is obvious enough.  An adolescent girl may be
induced
to have intercourse with a person in authority in circumstances where
the experience may prove to be psychologically harmful.  The
fact that Miss T
was not or may not have been the plaintiff's pupil within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s73.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 73</a>
(in that she was not taught by him) is not a relevant distinction for the
purpose of recognising the seriousness with which conduct
of the kind alleged
is viewed by society and the policy reasons for that.  However, it has also to
be recognised that no psychological
harm might be done in such a case.  Some
adolescents are sexually active earlier than others, and some engage in sexual
activity
with persons who are substantially older than themselves without
psychological harm.  There is no reason to suppose, on the material
which I
have seen, that any psychological harm was done in this case.  There are strong
indications to the contrary.  That would
be an important consideration.
<P>

74   	If the allegations are admitted or proved, the prescribed
officer and the Director-General would also, no doubt, take into
account what
has happened in the intervening eight years.  I have no information about that.
I do not know whether there has been
any similar complaint, what has been the
standard of the plaintiff's service in the department since 1991, what the
plaintiff's domestic
situation has been, and so on.  These would be important
considerations.  
<P>

75   	I can readily envisage a situation in which dismissal were
not the result of proven sexual misconduct with a student, having
regard to
such considerations.  There is the important further consideration of delay,
the plaintiff having faced the same allegations
in the proceedings before the
Industrial Commission and the plaintiff having presumably ordered his life on
the assumption that those
allegations would not be further pursued in view of
the settlement that was reached.
<P>

76   	I would expect those with responsibility for the
investigation and for the determination of the charge to exercise their
function
responsibly were the allegations established, and to consider whether
it were truly necessary, in the public interest, for the plaintiff's
employment
to be terminated.
<P>

77   	As alternative to the argument based on that part of the
decision in <i> Walton </i>to which I have referred, counsel for the plaintiff
advanced res judicata, issue estoppel and Anshun estoppel.  All three are
dependent
on there having been a determination by the Commission.  That there
was no judgment, order or decision is fatal to each of these
arguments:  see
<i>Halsbury's Laws of Australia</i>, para 190-40.  Further as to res judicata
and the need for a prior judgment, see <i>Maganja v Arthur</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20NSWLR%20561" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3 NSWLR
561</a>, 564.  Further as to issue estoppel and the need for a prior judgment or
order, see <i>Blair v Curran</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%2d1940%29%2062%20CLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939-1940) 62 CLR 464</a>, 531.  And further as
to Anshun estoppel and the need for a prior judgment, see <i>D A Christie Pty
Ltd v Baker</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1996/89.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] VicRp 89</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20VR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 VR 582</a>, 602.
<P>

78   	Each of the arguments advanced by the plaintiff in support
of the summons fails for these reasons.  The summons must be dismissed
with
costs.
<P>

79   	The orders I make are as follows:
<P>

1.	Summons dismissed.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs.
