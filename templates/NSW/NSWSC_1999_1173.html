&amp; Ors</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These are appeals from decisions of Master Harrison
given on 18 September 1998 in proceedings No.20124/95 and proceedings
No.20125/95.  
<P>

2  	In the appeal in proceedings No.20124/95 the appellant is Mr Jake
Sourian, who is the plaintiff in the proceedings, and the
respondents are the
State of New South Wales, Francis Egan trading as Liability &amp; All Claims,
VACC Insurance Co Limited, Caltex
Oil (Australia) Pty Limited and the Australia
and New Zealand Banking Group Limited.  It is convenient to refer to these
proceedings
as "the Sourian proceedings".  
<P>

3  	In the appeal in proceedings No.20125/95 the first two appellants
are Gerier Agop Magarditch and Sonya Magarditch, who are Mr
Sourian's parents.
In the notice of appeal instituting the appeal Magic Australia Pty Limited is
named as a third appellant.  I will
refer to the first two appellants as Mr
Magarditch and Mrs Magarditch, to the third named appellant as "Magic" and to
the proceedings
No.20125/95 as "the Magarditch proceedings".  The respondents
to the appeal in the Magarditch proceedings are the same five corporate
or
natural persons as are respondents to the appeal in the Sourian proceedings.
<P>

4  	In this judgment I will refer to the first respondent in both
appeals as "the State", to the second respondent as Mr Egan or
"the loss
assessor", to the third respondent as "VACC" or "the insurer", to the fourth
respondent as "Caltex" and to the fifth respondent
as "ANZ" or "the Bank".
<P>

5  	The substantive orders made by Master Harrison in the Sourian
proceedings were that a notice of motion filed by Mr Sourian on
29 June 1998 be
dismissed and that the proceedings generally be dismissed.   In the notice of
motion Mr Sourian had sought orders
giving leave to join Magic as a plaintiff
and ANZ as a fifth defendant.
<P>

6  	The substantive orders made by Master Harrison in the Magarditch
proceedings were that a notice of motion filed on behalf of
the plaintiffs Mr
and Mrs Magarditch on 15 July 1998 be dismissed and that the proceedings
generally be dismissed.  In the notice
of motion Mr Magarditch had sought
orders that:-
<P>

(i)	The Sourian proceedings and the Magarditch proceedings be tried at the same
time.
<P>

(ii)	The two proceedings be consolidated.
<P>

(iii)	Leave be granted to join or "reinstate" the loss assessor as a
defendant.
<P>

(iv)	Leave be granted to join ANZ as a defendant.
<P>

(v)	Leave be granted to join Magic as a plaintiff.
<P>

(vi)	An extension of time be granted in which to file another statement of
claim.
<P>

(vii)	Leave be granted to join or "reinstate" Caltex as a defendant.
<P>

(viii)	Leave be granted to Mr Sourian to appear for Magic.
<P>

7  	At the hearing before Master Harrison, which took place on 20
August 1998, Mr Sourian appeared for himself and was in effect
permitted to
appear for his parents.  On the hearing of these appeals Mr Sourian appeared
for himself and, like the Master, I permitted
Mr Sourian to appear for his
parents, but not for Magic.  Mr Sourian's father was in Court for most of the
hearing but his mother
did not come to the Court.
<P>

<b>Background Facts</b>
<P>

8  	In order to understand the issues on these appeals, it is
necessary to set out a number of background facts, none of which would
appear
to be controversial.
<P>

9  	In about 1984 (the precise date is unclear but is not material)
Magic, whose shareholders and directors were then Mr and Mrs
Magarditch,
purchased a service station business with a workshop at 607 Pacific Highway,
Chatswood.  Magic entered into a deed of
lease with Caltex dated 28 May 1986,
whereby Magic leased the premises on which the business was conducted from
Caltex.  Magic also
entered into an agreement with Caltex for the supply by
Caltex of petroleum products, which was described as "the supply agreement".
Magic proceeded to carry on the business which it had purchased.  Mr Sourian
played an important part in carrying on the business
of Magic and was sometimes
referred to as "the manager".  
<P>

10  	On or about 13 July 1987 Magic submitted a proposal for
insurance to the insurer VACC and on 15 July 1987 the insurer entered
into a
contract of insurance with Magic, whereby inter alia the buildings and stock on
Magic's business premises were insured against
damage or destruction by
fire.
<P>

11  	On 30 September 1987 Magic's premises at Chatswood were entered
and a small fire was lit.  A pipebending machine was damaged.
 Magic made a
claim on its insurance policy with the insurer.  
<P>

12  	On the night of 3 February 1988 there was a fire at Magic's
premises.  The insurer was notified and a representative of the
loss assessor
attended at the premises.  
<P>

13  	On 16 March 1988 a claim form or declaration of loss in respect
of the fire on 3 February 1988 was lodged by Magic with the
insurer.  The
declaration of loss was signed by Mr Magarditch but was lodged on behalf of
Magic by Mr Sourian.  Attached to the declaration
of loss were a large number
of stock sheets purporting to record stock which had been damaged by the fire
or by water used by the
fire brigade in fighting the fire.
<P>

14  	The fire was investigated by the police.  The police officer in
charge of the investigation was Detective Sergeant Peter Thomas,
who was
assisted by Detective Senior Constable Carl Paget.  
<P>

15  	On 12 May 1988 Detective Sergeant Thomas and Detective Senior
Constable Paget went to see Mr Sourian at premises at Gladesville.
 Detective
Sergeant Thomas told Mr Sourian that the police had been making inquiries about
the fire on 3 February 1988, that the
police were treating the fire as arson
and that the police had reason to believe that Mr Sourian was responsible for
the fire.  Mr
Sourian telephoned his solicitor and on advice from his solicitor
exercised his right to decline to answer any questions from the
police.
However, Detective Sergeant Thomas proceeded to outline to Mr Sourian the
grounds on which he suspected that Mr Sourian was
responsible for the fire.
Detective Sergeant Thomas also told Mr Sourian that, apart from arson, he would
be charged with other offences.
<P>

16  	On 12 May 1988 Mr Sourian was charged with the following
offences:-
<P>

(i)	Maliciously damaging property by fire (<i>Crimes Act </i>s195(b).
<P>

(ii)	Publishing a false statement in an insurance proposal with intent to
obtain a financial advantage from the insurer VACC (<i>Crimes Act</i>
s178BB).
<P>

(iii)	Publishing a false statement in a letter to the insurer VACC on 10
February 1988, with intent to obtain a financial advantage
from the insurer
(<i>Crimes Act</i> s 178BB).
<P>

(iv)	Publishing a false statement in an insurance claim form with intent to
obtain a financial advantage from the insurer VACC (<i>Crimes Act</i>
s178BB).
<P>

(v)	Conspiring to assault a man named McGowan, a former employee of Magic, who
had assisted the police in their enquiries into the
fire on 3 February 1988.
<P>

(vi)	Assaulting a man named Middleton, an employee of the loss assessor Mr
Egan, on 19 April 1988.
<P>

17  	On 20 June 1988 Caltex, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/prmfa1980359/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s16(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/prmfa1980359/" class="autolink_findacts">Petroleum
Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980</a> (Commonwealth) </i>served on Magic, Mr
Sourian and Mr and Mrs Magarditch a notice of termination of the lease and the
supply agreement between Caltex
and Magic, which together constituted a
"franchise agreement" for the purposes of the Act.  Most, but not all, of the
grounds stated
in the notice as being grounds for termination depended on
allegations that Mr Sourian had committed the offences with which he had
been
charged on 12 May 1988.
<P>

18  	On 26 July 1988 solicitors acting for the insurer VACC wrote a
letter to the secretary of Magic, avoiding the insurance policy
on the grounds
of fraudulent non-disclosure, "that one of your company's directors Jake
Magarditch, also known as Jake Sourian, has
been convicted of a number of
offences, including the import of prohibited goods in the form of machine guns,
bullet proof vests
and the like, assault and malicious injury, among others".

<P>

19  	Mr Sourian was not a director of Magic but, as I have already
noted, he played an important part in the carrying on of Magic's
business and
was sometimes referred to as being the manager of the business.   Mr Sourian
had convictions for goods in custody, possessing
an unlicensed pistol, assault,
breach of a recognisance, malicious injury to property and importing prohibited
imports being bullet
proof vests.  He did not have any conviction for importing
machine guns.  Mr Sourian's convictions had resulted in a recognisance
and then
fines.
<P>

20  	On or about 29 July 1988 Magic commenced proceedings in the
Federal Court against Caltex, seeking a declaration that the notice
of
termination of the franchise agreement was invalid and consequential relief.  A
cross-claim was filed by Caltex seeking a declaration
that the franchise
agreement had been validly terminated and an order giving Caltex possession of
the leased premises.
<P>

21  	The proceedings in the Federal Court came on for hearing on 8
May 1989.  Magic was represented by senior counsel.  On the fifth
day of the
hearing the proceedings were settled.  Orders were made by consent giving
Caltex possession of the leased premises and
leave to issue a writ of
possession but staying these orders up to 31 May 1989, conditionally upon Magic
complying with certain undertakings.
 
<P>

22  	Committal proceedings on the charges against Mr Sourian were
held in 1989.  It would appear that the prosecution did not offer
any evidence
on the charge of publishing a false statement in the letter of 10 February
1988.  On 5 January 1990 all of the charges
against Mr Sourian were dismissed
by the magistrate, with the exception of the charge under s178BB of the
<i>Crimes Act</i> of publishing a false statement in an insurance claim form.
Mr Sourian was committed for trial on this charge.
<P>

23  	On 20 June 1991 Magic was wound up by a court order, Mr I L
Struthers being appointed official liquidator.  
<P>

24  	The trial of Mr Sourian on the charge of publishing a false
statement in the insurance claim form took place in 1993 before
Judge Nader,
sitting without a jury, in the District Court.  Judge Nader found Mr Sourian
not guilty.  In a judgment delivered on
2 July 1993 Judge Nader said that on
the Crown case he had a reasonable doubt whether the Crown had established the
state of mind
on the part of Mr Sourian which the Crown was required to
establish as an ingredient of the offence charged.  Mr Sourian was not
required
to make any answer to the Crown case.
<P>

25  	In his judgment of 2 July 1993 Judge Nader went on to say:-
<P>

"I do not want to make unfavourable comments to Mr Sourian, but I should tell
him that the result may have been different, if it
had been simply a matter of
deciding the case on a balance of probabilities.  He may have had some
explaining to do.  But he did
not have to explain anything in a criminal trial
and he may be the beneficiary of some rules of the criminal law that favour
accused
persons to a considerable extent.
<P>

However, I do not want to leave a shadow over him.  I find him not guilty and
he goes away entitled to the operation of the presumption
of innocence and the
law must treat him that way.  I do not want to hear any evidence from Mr
Sourian and in accordance with what
was said in <b>Prasad</b> by the South
Australian Court, I dismiss the case".
<P>

26  	After his acquittal by Judge Nader Mr Sourian made an
application for a certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s2</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/" class="autolink_findacts">Costs in Criminal Cases
Act</i> 1967</a>.  On 8 March 1994 Judge Nader gave judgment on the application,
granting Mr Sourian a certificate under the Act.
<P>

27  	In his judgment of 8 March 1994 Judge Nader considered the
question posed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s3(1)(a)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cicca1967226/" class="autolink_findacts">Costs in Criminal Cases Act</a></i>, namely
whether, if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been
in possession of evidence of all the relevant
facts, it would not have been
reasonable to institute the proceedings.  His Honour commented that the case
against Mr Sourian was
a circumstantial case.  A circumstance relied on by the
Crown was that Mr Sourian had set fire to the premises.  His Honour said
that,
having studied the evidence relating to the charge of arson, he agreed "that
the circumstances were such as to do no more than
cast a suspicion of guilt on
the accused".
<P>

28  	Another circumstance relied on by the Crown was that, according
to evidence given by Mr McGowan, large quantities of stock
had been removed
from the Chatswood premises immediately prior to the fire.  Judge Nader said
that "the evidence taken at committal
should have made it clear to the
prosecution that Mr McGowan was an unreliable witness, whose testimony was
tainted by bias and inconsistency".
<P>

29  	Another, related, circumstance sought to be relied on was that
the stock at the premises immediately before the fire was at
a low level.
Judge Nader commented:-
<P>

"Evidence intended to prove that stocks at Chatswood were low at the time of
the fire was unsatisfactory.  It was selective in the
sense that some witnesses
were called at committal to prove the fact, while other available witnesses
including the main suppliers
of stock to Chatswood were not called.  This
presented a distorted picture.  It was unreasonable for the crown to have
placed reliance
on the alleged fact of depleted stocks in deciding to prosecute
the accused to trial.
<P>

The manner in which the stock-take after the fire was done was so grossly
disorganised and incompetent that its results could never
reasonably have
formed the basis of demonstrating fraud on the part of the applicant.  It was
manifestly clear before the trial that
there was no reliable basis for
assessing stock lost in the fire.  At all material times the applicant expected
the results of any
stock-take made by him to be checked independently.  He even
suggested that an independent third party check his stock-take.  That
offer was
never taken up".
<P>

30  	Another circumstance sought to be relied on by the Crown was
that the business of Magic conducted at the premises at Chatswood
was in a poor
financial position.  Judge Nader commented:-
<P>

"There was available evidence, contrary to an underlying assumption of the
prosecution, that the Chatswood branch of Magic Mufflers
was in a healthy
financial position.  This fact deprived an already weak Crown case of some
evidence of motive".
<P>

31  	Judger Nader continued:-
<P>

"It is abundantly clear to me that a knowledge of all these facts, and others
which I felt it not necessary to specify, made it
unreasonable to charge and
subsequently to continue the prosecution against Mr Sourian for attempting to
obtain money by fraud".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"I find, therefore, that if the prosecution had been in possession of all the
relevant facts, it would have been unreasonable for
the prosecution to
institute the proceedings.  It concerns me somewhat in this case that the
prosecution was in fact in possession
of many of the relevant facts, which
should have deterred it from proceeding.  I make no accusation of impropriety,
but there seems
to have been an unhealthy proximity between the investigators
and the insurance company which may have resulted in a loss of objectivity".
<P>

32  	Mr and Mrs Magarditch brought proceedings in the Equity Division
of this Court against ANZ.  On 28 April 1994 Windeyer J directed
that an
inquiry be held before an Equity master.  An inquiry was conducted by Master
McLaughlin, who gave judgment on 20 March 1996.
 An appeal brought from Master
McLaughlin's decision was heard by Santow J, who gave judgment on 17 April
1997, allowing the appeal
from Master McLaughlin's decision.  An application
for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 23 September 1998.

<P>

33  	According to the Court of Appeal, which gave a detailed
judgment, an issue in these Equity proceedings was whether ANZ was
entitled to
apply monies from the sale of a property at 140 Victoria Road, Gladesville,
which had been bought with the assistance
of funds in a fully drawn advance
account with ANZ known as "FDA2", first in payment of the amount due on FDA2
and then in payment
of monies due to ANZ from Magic.  Master McLaughlin found
that the liability on FDA2 amounting to $205,000 was not a liability of
Magic
but a liability of Mr Sourian personally and this finding was not upset on
appeal.  Santow J held that, even accepting that
Mr Sourian, and not Magic,
should be taken to have been the borrower of the $205,000 (a matter about which
his Honour clearly had
doubts), ANZ was entitled to apply the proceeds of sale
of the property in the way in which it had and that in any event the parties
had agreed that the moneys should be applied in the way the Bank had applied
them.  The Court of Appeal decided that there was no
appellable error in Santow
J's judgment.
<P>

34  	On 17 February 1995 both the Sourian proceedings and the
Magarditch proceedings were commenced.  I will defer to a later part
of this
judgment an account of the various things which have happened in the two
proceedings.
<P>

35  	On 6 September 1996 Mr Sourian and Mr Magarditch commenced
further proceedings in the Equity Division of this Court against
ANZ and the
liquidator of Magic.  When the proceedings came before Young J Mr Sourian made
allegations of misconduct against the
liquidator of Magic, who had been
appointed by this Court when the order for the winding-up of Magic was made.
Young J thereupon
ordered that the proceedings be transferred to the Federal
Court.  In an amended statement of claim in the Federal Court various
allegations were made against ANZ and it was alleged that the liquidator of
Magic had failed to perform his duties as liquidator
faithfully and had acted
negligently in the performance of his duties.  A hearing took place before
Einfield J in March 1998.  Einfield
J reserved his decision and it would seem
that judgment had not been given by the time Master Harrison conducted the
hearing before
her on 20 August 1998 or before she gave her judgments on 18
September 1998.  
<P>

<b>The present proceedings</b>
<P>

36  	Both the Sourian proceedings and the Magarditch proceedings were
commenced by a statement of claim filed on 17 February 1995.
 In the original
statement of claim in the Sourian proceedings Mr Sourian was the sole plaintiff
and the defendants were the New
South Wales Commissioner for Police, Detective
Sergeant Thomas, Detective Senior Constable Paget, the loss assessor Mr Egan,
the
insurer VACC, Caltex and the New South Wales Director of Public
Prosecutions.  The claims, or at least the principal claims, made
in the
statement of claim in the Sourian proceedings were that the second and third
defendants had maliciously and without reasonable
and probable cause proffered
criminal charges against the plaintiff, that the fourth and fifth defendants
had maliciously and without
reasonable and probable cause counselled and
procured the laying of those charges, that the fifth defendant had failed to
meet the
insurance claim arising from the fire, that the sixth defendant had
acted wrongly and unreasonably in ejecting Magic from the premises
at Chatswood
and that the seventh defendant had prosecuted the plaintiff at his trial in
1993.  In the Magarditch proceedings Mr
and Mrs Magarditch were the plaintiffs
and the same seven persons were the defendants.  The same claims or virtually
the same claims
were made in the statement of claim in the Magarditch
proceedings as were made in the statement of claim in the Sourian
proceedings.
<P>

37  	The fourth defendant (the loss assessor Mr Egan) and the sixth
defendant (Caltex) brought applications in both the Sourian
proceedings and the
Magarditch proceedings pursuant to Pt13 r5 and Pt15 r26 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  The applications came on
for hearing before Master Greenwood and Master
Greenwood gave judgment on 27 March 1996.  
<P>

38  	In the Sourian proceedings Master Greenwood held that the
pleading of the claim in the nature of malicious prosecution against
the fourth
and the fifth defendants was defective, in that the act or acts of the fourth
or fifth defendants by which they allegedly
"procured" the laying of the
criminal charges were not stated and no particulars were given of the alleged
malice.  The Master said
that the pleading "does not deal with the gap between
providing information and participation in the laying of charges... it does
not
deal with the gravamen of the claim for malicious prosecution, when it is made
against a person other than the prosecutor". 
Master Greenwood struck out the
statement of claim in the Sourian proceedings, insofar as it made a claim of
malicious prosecution
against the fourth and fifth defendants.
<P>

39  	In the Magarditch proceedings Master Greenwood held that the
claim in the nature of malicious prosecution pleaded in the statement
of claim
suffered from the same defects as the corresponding claim in the Sourian
proceedings and from the additional defect that
Mr and Mrs Magarditch, the
plaintiffs in the Magarditch proceedings, had not been prosecuted.  Master
Greenwood dismissed the claim
for malicious prosecution against the fourth and
fifth defendants.
<P>

40  	Master Greenwood said that he had great difficulty in seeing how
any claim could lie against the sixth defendant Caltex in
either proceedings.
The Master pointed out that the franchisee from Caltex was the company Magic,
and not Mr Sourian or Mr and Mrs
Magarditch.  Proceedings had been brought in
the Federal Court challenging the termination of the franchise agreement and
had ended
in the making of orders in favour of Caltex.  However, rather than
summarily dismissing the claims made against Caltex, Master Greenwood
simply
struck out the parts of the statements of claim which made allegations against
Caltex.
<P>

41  	Appeals by Caltex, in which Caltex asserted that Master
Greenwood should not merely have struck out the parts of the statements
of
claim in which claims were made against Caltex but should have summarily
dismissed those claims, were dismissed by Simpson J on
29 July 1996.
<P>

42  	On 26 September 1996 an amended statement of claim was filed in
the Sourian proceedings.  The defendants named in the amended
statement of
claim were the State of New South Wales, the loss assessor Mr Egan, the insurer
VACC and Caltex.  The first defendant
was sued pursuant to <i>the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown
Proceedings Act</i> 1988</a> and as being liable pursuant to the <i>Law Reform
(Vicarious Liabilities) Act</i> 1983 for the actions of its "employed" police
officers.  The principal claims made in the amended statement of claim were
that the
second and third defendants or one of them "maliciously and without
reasonable and probable cause" either "caused" or  were "instrumental
in
causing" the first defendant to arrest and charge the plaintiff on each of the
various charges which had been brought against
the plaintiff.  It was alleged
that the third defendant was liable, not only for its own acts and omissions,
but also for the acts
and omissions of the second defendant.
<P>

43  	The second defendant and the third defendant brought
applications pursuant to Pt15 r26 and Pt13 r5 of the Supreme Court Rules,
in
regard to the amended statement of claim.
<P>

44  	In a judgment given on 5 June 1997 Master Greenwood held that
the amended statement of claim in the Sourian proceedings was
defective, in
that it did not say how it was alleged the third defendant was liable for the
acts and omissions of the second defendant,
which was an independent
contractor;  it did not plead the facts by reason of which it was alleged that
the second defendant and
the third defendant had been "instrumental" in causing
the first defendant to arrest and charge the plaintiff; and some of the
particulars
of damage alleged could only relate to damage sustained by Magic,
and not the plaintiff.  The Master did not decide that the plaintiff
had no
case against the second and third defendants.  Because there were a number of
defects in the pleading, Master Greenwood thought
that it would be better to
strike out the statement of claim generally (rather than simply striking out
parts of it) and he gave
leave to the plaintiff to file a further amended
statement of claim by 7 July 1997.  
<P>

45  	A further amended statement of claim (the third statement of
claim in the Sourian proceedings) was filed on 7 July 1997, that
is within the
time permitted by Master Greenwood's order.  In the further amended statement
of claim Mr and Mrs Magarditch were named
as co-plaintiffs with Mr Sourian and
ANZ was added as a fifth defendant.  No leave had been given by Master
Greenwood to join Mr
and Mrs Magarditch or ANZ.  The principal claims made in
the further amended statement of claim were that the defendants had conspired
to defraud and injure the plaintiffs in their business being conducted through
Magic and that some of the defendants had conspired
maliciously and without
reasonable and probable cause to have Mr Sourian arrested and charged with
certain of the charges which had
been brought against him.
<P>

46  	Applications by all of the defendants in the Sourian proceedings
and some of the defendants in the Magarditch proceedings were
heard by Master
Harrison on 14 November 1997.  The applications were based variously on Pt13
r5, Pt15 r26 and Pt33 r6 of the Supreme
Court Rules.  
<P>

47  	The applications had originally been fixed for hearing before
Master Harrison on 9 October 1997.  On 9 October 1997 Mr Sourian
appeared for
himself and his parents and successfully applied for an adjournment.  The
applications were adjourned to 14 November
1997.  Master Harrison directed that
the plaintiffs file any affidavits on which they wished to rely by 30 October
1997. No affidavits
were filed.  On 14 November 1997 Mr Sourian sought a
further adjournment, which was refused by the Master.  An appeal to the Common
Law Duty Judge against the Master's refusal to grant an adjournment was
dismissed and the hearing of the applications proceeded on
14 November 1997.
Apart from the applications by the defendants, Master Harrison also heard an
application by Mr Sourian in the Sourian
proceedings, seeking leave to join Mr
and Mrs Magarditch as co-plaintiffs and ANZ as a defendant in those
proceedings.
<P>

48  	In her reserved judgment in both matters delivered on 23
February 1998 Master Harrison held that Master Greenwood had given
leave to
file an amended statement of claim only to Mr Sourian, and not to Mr and Mrs
Magarditch, and that leave should not be granted
to join Mr and Mrs Magarditch
as co-plaintiffs in the Sourian proceedings. Master Harrison also held that
leave should not be granted
to join ANZ as a defendant in the Sourian
proceedings.  The Master then considered the applications by the defendants.
Towards the
end of her judgment the Master said:-
<P>

"It is my view that the amended statement of claim as currently pleaded would
be liable to be struck out on the basis that pursuant
to Part 15 r 26, it
discloses no reasonable cause of action.  The pleading of conspiracy does not
set out each party's relationship
with each other, it does not allege where and
when the agreement or agreements were reached.  It does not set forth with
clarity
and precision the overt acts that each person is alleged to have
done.
<P>

In relation to the claim for malicious prosecution the pleading still does not
deal with the gap between providing information and
the participation of laying
of the charges.  The second and third plaintiffs were not the subject of
charges, so cannot maintain
a claim for malicious prosecution.  The damage
alleged is that suffered by Magic and not the plaintiffs.  The claim against
the fourth
defendant in relation to the lease still suffers from the
deficiencies identified by Master Greenwood.  As the amended statement
of claim
does not properly plead the causes of action relied upon, the defendants do not
know the case they have to meet.  It is
my view that the amended statement of
claim as currently pleaded discloses no reasonable cause of action and would be
liable to be
struck out.  To grant leave to the filing of the amended statement
of claim would be futile".
<P>

49  	Having decided that the further amended statement of claim was
liable to be struck out under Pt15 r26, Master Harrison turned
to consider
whether either the Sourian proceedings or the Magarditch proceedings should be
dismissed for want of prosecution.  The
Master, apparently drawing on the
commentary on Pt33 r6 in <b>Ritchies Supreme Court Procudure NSW</b> said at
p22 of her judgment:-
<P>

"The power of the courts to dismiss an action for default or want of
prosecution should be exercised only where the plaintiff's
default has been
intentional and contumelious or where there has been inordinate and inexcusable
delay on his or his lawyer's part
giving rise to a substantial risk that a fair
trial would not be possible (or to a risk of) serious prejudice to the
defendants:
<b>Birkett v James</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2All ER 801</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978)  AC 297</a> at 318.
In each case, a balance must be struck between the plaintiff and the defendant
and the court must decide whether or not,
in all the circumstances, justice
requires that the proceedings should be dismissed: <b>Witten v Lombard
Australia Ltd</b> (1968) 88WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 405 at 411;  <b>Southern Cross
Exploration NL v Fire &amp; All Risks Insurance Co Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20NSWLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4 NSWLR 491</a>;

<P>

50  	The Master also quoted from the decision of the House of Lords
in <b>Grovit &amp; Ors v Doctor &amp; Ors</b> (1997) 2 All ER 417 at 424, where
Lord Woolf said:-
<P>

"The courts exist to enable parties to have their disputes resolved.  To
commence and to continue litigation which you have no intention
to bring to
conclusion can amount to an abuse of process.  Where this is the situation the
party against whom the proceeding is brought
is entitled to apply to have the
action struck out and if justice so requires (which will frequently be the
case) the courts will
dismiss the action.  The evidence which was relied upon
to establish the abuse of process may be the plaintiff's inactivity.  The
same
evidence will then no doubt be capable of supporting an application to dismiss
for want of prosecution.  However, if there is
an abuse of process, it is not
strictly necessary to establish want of prosecution under either of the limbs
identified by Lord Diplock
in <b>Birkett v James</b>".
<P>

51  	The Master concluded at p23 of her judgment:-
<P>

"I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs have no intention to bring their case
to trial but rather they have not been able to properly
articulate their claim.
Accordingly, it is my view that neither the Sourian or the Magarditch
proceedings should be struck out for
want of prosecution".
<P>

52  	As regards Pt13 r5 of the Supreme Court Rules Master Harrison
referred to the judgment of Judge Nader of 8 March 1994 and the
judgment of
Master McLaughlin of 20 March 1996 as possibly lending some support to the
plaintiffs in the two proceedings.  The Master
concluded "it is my view that
the plaintiffs may have a cause of action and I emphasise the word `may'.
Accordingly they should be
given one further opportunity to amend their
respective statements of claim".  In each proceeding the Master granted leave
to file
a further amended statement of claim on or before 20 April 1998.  
<P>

53  	No further amended statement of claim was filed in either
proceeding by 20 April 1998.  On 27 April 1998 a notice of motion
was filed by
Mr Sourian in the Sourian proceedings, seeking a further extension of time in
which to file an amended statement of
claim and an order that the Sourian
proceedings be transferred to the Federal Court to be heard with the
proceedings in the Federal
Court which had come before Einfield J.  ANZ, the
fifth named defendant in the further amended statement of claim which had been
considered by Master Harrison, filed a notice of motion, seeking a declaration
that it had not been validly joined as a defendant.
 The other defendants in
the Sourian proceedings made applications seeking summary dismissal of the
Sourian proceedings.
<P>

54  	On 5 May 1998 Sperling J directed that any affidavit in support
of Mr Sourian's notice of motion be filed by 7 May 1998.  A
long affidavit by
Mr Sourian was filed on 7 May 1998 but Studdert J, before whom the various
applications came on 11 May, considered
that the affidavit did not give any
reason why an amended statement of claim had not been filed by 20 April 1998,
as directed by
Master Harrison.
<P>

55  	Although the application by Mr Sourian had been filed only in
the Sourian proceedings, Studdert J treated that application
as also being an
application in the Magarditch proceedings for an extension of time in which to
file an amended statement of claim
in those proceedings.  
<P>

56  	Studdert J in his judgment of 12 May 1998 said that, although Mr
Sourian had not adduced any evidence to explain why he had
not complied with
Master Harrison's direction, Mr Sourian had informed Studdert J that he had
been waiting for Einfield J to give
his reserved decision in the part of the
Federal Court proceedings which Justice Einfield had heard.  If that part of
the proceedings
in the Federal Court was successful, Mr Sourian would seek to
join Magic as a plaintiff in the further amended statement of claim
to be filed
in the Sourian proceedings.  Studdert J commented:-
<P>

"It is regrettable that Mr Sourian is not legally represented in these
proceedings.  He appears to have a misconception as to the
need to comply with
the requirements of court orders, and he has a further misconception as to the
requirements of appropriate pleadings
in this court".
<P>

57  	Studdert J declined to transfer the Sourian proceedings to the
Federal Court, for the reason that there was not yet any properly
pleaded
statement of claim in the Sourian proceedings.  His Honour said that he was
"troubled by the relief sought in paragraph 1"
of Mr Sourian's notice of
motion, that is the application for a further extension of time in which to
file a further amended statement
of claim.  After weighing various competing
considerations, his Honour said:
<P>

"I have decided to give the plaintiffs one further opportunity to put the
pleadings in order.  It seems to me that I should afford
an extension of
sufficient length to enable a realistic opportunity for any available cause or
causes of action to be properly pleaded.
 With this in mind, I am going to
grant an extension of time until 29 June 1998.  Any cause of action to be
pleaded against the first,
second, third and/or fourth defendants in matter
20124/95 is to be pleaded in a duly amended statement of claim by 29 June 1998.
Mr Sourian need not expect that if an amended statement of claim has not been
filed and served by that date this court would grant
any further adjournment,
because there are proceedings pending against Magic in the Federal Court or for
any other reason Mr Sourian
might later advance.  I am granting this
adjournment, setting its length with a view to it being a final opportunity for
Mr Sourian
to properly plead any available cause of action".
<P>

58  	Studdert J granted a similar extension of time to Mr and Mrs
Magarditch in the Magarditch proceedings.
<P>

59  	As regards ANZ, Studdert J said in his judgment:-
<P>

"The Master ruled that the plaintiffs had not shown the need to join the bank
and that the pleading against the bank was defective.
 Hence the bank's
position was that since there had been no order made for its joinder, it was
not an appropriate party to the plaintiff's
notice of motion.  That much seems
clear from the judgment of Master Harrison.  However, I am presently
unpersuaded that I should
make any order on the bank's notice of motion".
<P>

60  	On 29 June 1998 Mr Sourian filed a notice of motion in the
Sourian proceedings, in which he sought orders giving leave to join
Magic as a
second plaintiff and ANZ as a fifth defendant.  On 29 June 1998 Mr Sourian
filed an affidavit in support of the notice
of motion, to which he annexed a
copy of a "second further amended statement of claim" in the Sourian
proceedings.  The second further
amended statement of claim was verified by an
affidavit sworn by Mr Sourian on 29 June 1998.  It would appear that the notice
of
motion and the affidavit in support with its annexure were served on the
defendants on 29 June 1998.  Certainly, the defendants were
aware of the notice
of motion, when it was mentioned before Abadee J on 6 July 1998.
<P>

61  	On 15 July 1998 a document in the same form as the document
annexed to Mr Sourian's affidavit, verified by an affidavit sworn
by Mr Sourian
on 15 July 1998, was filed as an independent document.
<P>

62  	No document was filed in the Magarditch proceedings, apart from
the notice of motion filed on 15 July 1998, which I referred
to near the
beginning of this judgment.  However, a document described as an amended
statement of claim, verified by an affidavit
sworn on 15 July 1998 by Mr and
Mrs Magarditch, was prepared.  
<P>

63  	On 29 June 1998 Carruthers AJ made a declaration that ANZ had
not been joined as a defendant in the Sourian proceedings.  
<P>

64  	Mr Sourian's notice of motion and a number of applications by
the defendants in the Sourian proceedings came before Master
Harrison on 20
August 1998.  The applications by the defendants were based on one or more of
Pt13 r5, Pt15 r26 and Pt33 r 6 of the
Supreme Court Rules.  On the hearing of
the applications the Master had before her a number of voluminous affidavits by
Mr Sourian
and much other evidence.
<P>

65  	The Master delivered a reserved judgment on 18 September 1998.
In her reserved judgment the Master recounted the history of
the Sourian
proceedings in a series of numbered paragraphs.  Paragraph (14) dealt with
Studdert J's judgment of 12 May 1998.  Paragraphs
(15), (16) and (17) of this
history were in the following terms:-
<P>

"(15)	On 29 June 1998, the fourth amended statement of claim was not filed in
accordance with the orders of Studdert J.
<P>

(16)	On 29 June 1998, Carruthers AJ declared that Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Limited had not been joined as a defendant
in the proceedings.
<P>

(17)	On 15 July 1998, the plaintiff filed the fourth amended statement of
claim.  It was called `second further amended statement
of claim.'"
<P>

66  	The Master did not include in her history of the proceedings the
filing on 29 June 1998 of the notice of motion and the affidavit
by Mr Sourian,
with its annexure.
<P>

67  	Master Harrison said in her judgment that Mr Sourian had not
offered any explanation for the failure to file a statement of
claim within the
time limited by Studdert J.  She noted that Mr Sourian had been given numerous
opportunities to file a further amended
statement of claim.  The Master
continued:-
<P>

"The plaintiff did not seek a further extension of time but filed the further
amended statement of claim in the registry.  This
statement of claim was filed
irregularly.  He still has not sought that he be granted an extension of
Studdert J's order.  This may
be because he was aware that the court would be
most unlikely to grant a further extension of time.  I am conscious that the
plaintiff
is unrepresented but in the recent past history of this matter, he
has been treated leniently by the court because of his lack of
legal
representation.  It has always been taken into account that to dismiss the
plaintiff's proceedings depriving the plaintiff
of the opportunity of a hearing
on its merits is a drastic step.  This is an important consideration which I
have taken into account.
 The defendants have been awarded costs against the
plaintiff on several occasions.  On 23 February 1998 I ordered that the
plaintiff
pay the defendants' costs forthwith.  The plaintiff has not paid
these outstanding costs.  The prejudice that the defendants have
suffered by
the plaintiff's delays and non-compliance with court orders cannot be overcome
by a further order for costs.
<P>

As there is no explanation for the delay and non-compliance with the court's
direction, particularly in the light of Studdert J's
comments, and the
plaintiff has not paid the defendants outstanding costs, it is my view that
justice demands that the statement
of claim and the proceedings should be
dismissed with costs.
<P>

As the proceedings have been dismissed, I dismiss the plaintiff's notice of
motion filed 29 June 1998".
<P>

68  	On 20 August 1998 there also came before Master Harrison a
number of applications in the Magarditch proceedings, including
the application
by the plaintiffs of 15 July 1998 and applications by the first defendant and
the sixth defendant (Caltex) based
on one or more of Pt13 r5, Pt15 r26 and Pt33
r6 of the Supreme Court Rules.  On 18 September 1998 Master Harrison delivered
a separate
reserved judgment in the Magarditch proceedings, much of which was
in the same terms as the reserved judgment the Master delivered
on the same day
in the Sourian proceedings.  As in her judgment in the Sourian proceedings, the
Master gave an account of the history
of the proceedings in a series of
numbered paragraphs.  Paragraphs (14) and (16) were in the following terms:-
<P>

"(14)	On 29 June 1998, the further amended statement of claim was not filed in
accordance with the orders of Studdert J.
<P>

(Paragraph (15) related to interlocutory orders made by Abadee J on 6 July
1998)
<P>

(16)	On 20 August 1998, the plaintiffs tendered a copy of their proposed
amended statement of claim (Ex A)".
<P>

69  	After giving her account of the history of the Magarditch
proceedings, the Master noted that the proposed statement of claim
had not yet
been filed.  The Master continued:-
<P>

"The plaintiffs have been given numerous opportunities to file their further
amended statement of claim.  On 23 February 1998 I
gave the plaintiffs `one
further opportunity' to file their further amended statement of claim and
allowed two months for them to
do so.  On 12 May 1998 when the plaintiffs had
not taken advantage of that `one further opportunity' Justice Studdert granted
the
plaintiffs one further opportunity for them to file their further amended
statement of claim and specifically stated that `if the
amended statement of
claim is not filed and served by 29 June 1998, Mr Sourian need not expect that
the court would grant any further
adjournment'.
<P>

I am conscious that the plaintiffs are unrepresented but in the recent past
history of this matter, they have been treated leniently
by the court because
of their lack of legal representation.  It has always been taken into account
that to dismiss the plaintiffs'
proceedings is a drastic step.  It is an
important consideration which I have taken into account.  The defendants have
been awarded
costs against the plaintiffs on several occasions and on 23
February 1998 I ordered that the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs
forthwith.  The plaintiffs have not paid outstanding costs.  The prejudice that
the defendants have suffered by the plaintiffs' delays
and non-compliance with
court orders cannot be overcome by a further order for costs.
<P>

As there is no explanation for the delay and non-compliance with the court's
direction, particularly in the light of Studdert J's
comments, and the
plaintiffs have not paid the defendants outstanding costs, it is my view that
justice demands that the proceedings
should be dismissed with costs.
<P>

As the proceedings have been dismissed, I dismiss the plaintiffs' notice of
motion filed 15 July 1998".
<P>

70  	The present appeals have been brought from the decisions of
Master Harrison of 18 September 1998.  It is apparent from Master
Harrison's
judgments that she dismissed both proceedings pursuant to Pt33 r 6(2) of the
Supreme Court Rules, on the ground that the
plaintiff or plaintiffs had made
default in complying with Studdert J's orders made on 12 May 1998, that any
amended or further amended
statement of claim be filed by 29 June 1998.  In her
judgments of 18 September 1998 the Master did not give any consideration (and,
having regard to her decisions under Pt33 r6, it was unnecessary for her to
give any consideration) to whether either the Sourian
proceedings or the
Magarditch proceedings should be dismissed pursuant to Pt13 r5. In particular,
there is not any consideration
of whether a reasonable cause of action was
disclosed in the second further amended statement of claim in the Sourian
proceedings
or in the proposed amended statement of claim in the Magarditch
proceedings.  At the hearing of the appeals before me I gave leave
to each of
the respondents to each appeal to file a notice of contention to the effect
that Master Harrison's decision should be
affirmed on the grounds that each of
the proceedings should be dismissed pursuant to Pt13 r 5.  Each of the
respondents availed itself
of this leave and filed a notice of contention.
<P>

71  	Although it was not necessary for Master Harrison to refer to
the contents of the second further amended statement of claim
in the Sourian
proceedings or the proposed amended statement of claim in the Magarditch
proceedings, I will now outline the contents
of the two documents.  Later in
this judgment it will be necessary to refer to some parts of the documents in
more detail.
<P>

72  	The second further amended statement of claim in the Sourian
proceedings names ANZ as a fifth defendant.  The first thirteen
paragraphs make
allegations about individual defendants.  Paragraphs 14-20 are under the
heading "Malicious Prosecution Case".  Paragraphs
14 is in the following
terms:-
<P>

"14.	Between 1988 and 1993 the Defendants and each of them by their servants or
agents wrongfully and maliciously prosecuted the
Plaintiff in the Local Court
and the District Court of New South Wales, whereby the Plaintiff suffered
substantial loss and damage,
as particularised more fully below".
<P>

73  	Paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 state the charges which were brought
against Mr Sourian and the history of the criminal proceedings
against him in
the Local Court and the District Court.  Paragraph 18 is in the following
terms:-
<P>

"18.	The proceedings and each of them were brought against the Plaintiff
without reasonable and probable cause at the instigation
of the Defendants and
each of them, their servants and agents, as more particularly stated
herein".
<P>

74  	Particulars of the allegations in paragraph 18 are furnished in
relation to each of the six charges brought against Mr Sourian.
<P>

75  	In paragraph 19 it is alleged that each of the prosecutions was
brought against the plaintiff for an improper purpose.  Particulars
of this
allegation are furnished.  In paragraph 20 it is alleged that the plaintiff has
suffered loss and damage and particulars
of the loss and damage are given.
<P>

76  	The paragraphs in the second further amended statement of claim
from paragraph 21 onwards are under the heading "Conspiracy".
 In paragraphs
21-25 it is alleged that the first three defendants by named individuals
conspired to defeat Magic's claim against
the insurer VACC in relation to the
fires at the service station "and to damage and injure the plaintiff's
commercial standing and
in his business".  Particulars of alleged overt acts
done in furtherance of the conspiracy and particulars of the damage allegedly
suffered by the plaintiff are given.
<P>

77  	In paragraphs 26-29 of the second further amended statement of
claim it is alleged that Caltex by named agents conspired with
the first
defendant by its named agents to provide false information to the prosecution
authorities "to defraud and injure Magic
in its business and the plaintiff in
his business as its manager".  Particulars of alleged overt acts done in
furtherance of the
conspiracy and particulars of the damage allegedly suffered
by the plaintiff are given.
<P>

78  	In another series of paragraphs, which are confusingly numbered
24-28, it is alleged that the first and the fifth defendants
by named agents
conspired to provide false information to the prosecution authorities with
respect to the financial position of Magic
and the business standing of the
plaintiff to defraud and injure the plaintiff.  Particulars of alleged overt
acts done in furtherance
of the conspiracy and particulars of the damage
allegedly suffered by the plaintiff are given.
<P>

79  	The proposed amended statement of claim in the Magarditch
proceedings names Magic as a co-plaintiff and also names ANZ as the
fifth
defendant.  The first eleven paragraphs make allegations against individual
defendants.  Paragraph 10 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"After the above was effected, (that is, the insurance claim was submitted,) on
or about 12 May 1998, the Second Defendant by his
servant or agents as
particularised herein (and/or the Third Defendant and/or the Fourth and/or the
Fifth Defendant) secured the
intervention of the First Defendant in the
prosecution of Jake Sourian in respect of certain conduct whilst he was acting
on behalf
of Magic".
<P>

80  	Paragraph 12 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"After 03.02.88 and on or before 02.07.93 at a date and time which the
Plaintiffs are presently unable to specify more particularly,
the said Thomas
and Paget for whose conduct the First Defendant is liable, Edwin Middleton and
Frances Egan for whose conduct the
Second Defendant is liable and Greg Frost
for whose conduct the Third Defendant was liable, amongst themselves wrongfully
and maliciously
conspired and combined to defraud and injure the
Plaintiffs".
<P>

81  	Particulars of alleged overt acts done in furtherance of the
conspiracy and particulars of the damage allegedly suffered by
the plaintiffs
are given.
<P>

82  	Paragraph 16 of the proposed amended statement of claim is in
the following terms:-
<P>

"Further, the Fourth Defendant by its servants or agents Nelson Chad and
Richard Lund agreed with the First Defendant by Thomas
and Paget and with each
other maliciously and wrongfully to conspire and combine to provide false
information to the prosecution
authorities in New South Wales and to the Police
Service in order to injure Magic in its business and the First and Second
Plaintiffs
in their interests in the business".
<P>

83  	Particulars of alleged overt acts done in furtherance of the
conspiracy and particulars of the damage allegedly suffered by
the plaintiffs
are given.  
<P>

84  	Paragraph 21 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"Between 1988 and 1993 the First and Fifth Defendants by the said Thomas and
Paget and the said Kelly wrongfully and maliciously
conspired amongst
themselves and combined to injure the Plaintiffs".
<P>

85  	Particulars of alleged overt acts done in furtherance of the
conspiracy and particulars of the damage allegedly suffered by
the plaintiffs
are given.
<P>

86  	The concluding paragraphs in the proposed amended statement of
claim, which are numbered 25-29, are each in similar terms.
 It is alleged
successively against each defendant that between 1988 and 1991 by its servants
or agents Thomas and Paget and the
Director of Public Prosecutions it caused
loss to the plaintiffs by unlawful means, the unlawful means being the
malicious prosecution
of Mr Sourian and the conspiracy to injure Magic and the
plaintiffs, alleged earlier in the statement of claim
<P>

<b>The Procedural Law Governing the Appeals</b>
<P>

87  	As stated earlier in this judgment, the order Master Harrison
made dismissing each proceedings was made pursuant to Pt33 r6
of the Supreme
Court Rules.  Pt33 r6(2), which is the relevant part of Pt33 r6, provides:-
<P>

"Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or direction as to
the conduct of the proceedings, or does not prosecute
the proceedings with due
despatch, the Court may, on application by any party or of its own motion, stay
or dismiss the proceedings".
<P>

88  	The most important principles governing the application of Pt33
r6, as stated in <b>Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure,</b> were set out by the
Master in her judgment of 23 February 1998.  
<P>

89  	The present appeals have been brought pursuant to Pt60 r10 of
the Supreme Court Rules.  It is well settled that an appeal from
a master to a
single judge pursuant to Pt60 r10 is governed by the same principles as an
appeal from a judge of the Court to the
Court of Appeal.  See <b>Do Carmo v
Ford Excavations Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20NSWLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 NSWLR 409</a> and the commentary at
par60.10.1 of <b>Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure</b>.  Accordingly, where, as
here, an appeal is from a decision depending on an exercise of a discretion by
the judicial officer of first
instance, the appeal court must apply the
principles governing an appeal from a discretionary decision, which were stated
in the
classic passage in the judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in
<b>House v the King</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55 CLR 499</a> at 504-505 as follows:-
<P>

"The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be
determined is governed by established principles.  It
is not enough that the
judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the
position of the primary judge,
they would have taken a different course.  It
must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion.  If the
judge
acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant
matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he
does not take
into account some material consideration, then his determination should be
reviewed and the appellate court may exercise
its own discretion in
substitution for his, if it has the materials for doing so.  It may not appear
how the primary judge has reached
the result embodied in his order, but, if
upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may
infer that
in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the
discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.  In
such a
case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of
the discretion is reviewed on the ground that
a substantial wrong has in fact
occurred."
<P>

90  	In the present case, it was naturally submitted on behalf of the
respondents to both appeals that no error in the exercise
of the Master's
discretion had been established and accordingly the appeals should be
dismissed, even if it were the position that,
had I been the primary judge, I
would have taken a different course to that taken by the Master.
<P>

91  	The Master did not base her decision in either proceedings on
Pt13 r5 of the Supreme Court Rules.  However, as some of the
respondents'
applications before the Master were based on Pt13 r5, as well as Pt33 r6, and
as notices of contention relying on Pt13
r5 were filed on behalf of all
respondents in the appeals, it is appropriate, at this stage of my judgment,
that I refer to Pt13
r5.  Pt13 r 5 provides as follows:-
<P>

"(1)  Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim
for relief in the
proceedings:-
<P>

(a)  no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;
<P>

(b)  the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or
<P>

(c)  the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court,
<P>

the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or in
relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.
<P>

(2)  The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of any application for an
order under subrule(1)".
<P>

92  	It was accepted by the respondents to the appeals that, as the
Master had not based either decision dismissing the proceedings
on Pt13 r5, I
was not, so far as Pt13 r5 was concerned, reviewing any exercise of discretion
by the Master and, insofar as I considered
whether any order should be made
under Pt13 r5, I would be making an original exercise of the discretion
conferred by Pt13 r5 and
hence the onus would be on the respondents to persuade
me that I should exercise my discretion in their favour.
<P>

93  	The principles which should be applied in deciding whether
proceedings, or any particular claim in any proceedings, should
be dismissed
pursuant to Pt13 r5 are stated in pars13.5.1-13.5.5 of <b>Ritchie's Supreme
Court Procedure</b>.  The judicial pronouncement which is most frequently
quoted in this connection is part of the judgment of Barwick CJ in <b>General
Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (New South Wales)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964)
112 CLR 125</a> at 129-130, where Barwick CJ said inter alia:-
<P>

"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the view
that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of a cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  `be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense'".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"As I have said, some of these expressions occur in cases in which the inherent
jurisdiction was invoked and others in cases founded
on statutory rules of
court but although the material available to the court in either type of case
may be different the need for
exceptional caution in exercising the power
whether it be inherent or under statutory rules is the same.  Dixon J (as he
then was)
sums up a number of authorities in <b>Dey v Victorian Railways
Commissioners </b>where he says: `A case must be very clear indeed to justify
the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting
his
case for determination in the appointed manner by the court with or without a
jury.  The fact that a transaction is intricate
may not disentitle the court to
examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing
whether the proceeding
amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious.  But
once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact
or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not
competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous
and vexatious and an
abuse of process'.  Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when
he said that the defendant should
be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised
to ensure
that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is
not improperly deprived of his opportunity for the trial of
his case by the
appointed tribunal.  On the other hand, I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for
those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke the futility of the plaintiff's claim. Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive
kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed".
<P>

94  	As is apparent from subrule (2) of Pt13 r5, the Court on an
application under Pt13 r5 is not confined to an examination of
the pleadings
and may have regard to the evidence which has been adduced.  This is of some
significance in the present case, where
several very large affidavits by Mr
Sourian have been filed over an extended period of time and it can be inferred
that Mr Sourian
has already adduced all, or virtually all, of the evidence
available to him.
<P>

<b>The Appeal in the Magarditch Proceedings</b>
<P>

95  	It is convenient to deal first with the appeal in the Magarditch
proceedings.
<P>

96  	In the Magarditch proceedings I consider that the submissions by
the respondents based on the present appeal being an appeal
from a
discretionary decision by the Master should be upheld and that the appeal
should be dismissed.  I do not consider that any
error has been established in
the exercise of the Master's discretion.  Although in her judgment of 18
September 1998 the Master
did not explicitly state the principles she was
applying in regard to Pt33 r6, I infer that the Master applied the principles
which
she had set out in her earlier judgment of 23 February 1998.  These were
correct principles to apply.
<P>

97  	In deciding to dismiss the proceedings pursuant to Pt33 r6, the
Master particularly took into account the terms of the order
made by her on 23
February 1998 and the terms of the order made by Studdert J on 12 May 1998, the
failure to comply with those orders
and particularly the order made by Studdert
J, the absence of any explanation for the failure to comply with Studdert J's
order and
the fact that prejudice to the respondents could not be overcome by
the making of costs orders which would be effective.  All of
these matters were
matters which could properly be taken into account.  There was no material
consideration which the Master failed
to take into account.  The order made by
the Master dismissing the proceedings was not so unreasonable or so plainly
unjust as to
give rise to an inference that the exercise of discretion by the
Master had somehow miscarried.
<P>

98  	As I have held that the appeal against the Master's decision
dismissing the Magarditch proceedings pursuant to Pt33 r6 should
be dismissed,
it is strictly unnecessary for me to consider whether the Magarditch
proceedings should be dismissed pursuant to Pt13
r5.  However, in case I am
wrong in my primary holding, I should consider this further question.  In my
opinion, the Magarditch proceedings,
if they were not properly dismissed
pursuant to Pt33 r6, should be dismissed pursuant to Pt13 r5, on the grounds
that they cannot
possibly succeed.
<P>

99  	Anyone attempting to draw a statement of claim or an amended
statement of claim in the Magarditch proceedings would be confronted
by two
formidable obstacles.
<P>

100  	The first obstacle is that Mr and Mrs Magarditch, unlike Mr
Sourian, were not prosecuted by anybody and hence could have no
claim for
malicious prosecution.
<P>

101  	The second obstacle is that it was the company Magic, and not
Mr and Mrs Magarditch, which was the lessee and franchisee from
Caltex, which
carried on the service station business, which entered into the contract of
insurance with the insurer and which was
the customer, or at least the relevant
customer, of the Bank.  The separate corporate personality of Magic has to be
respected and
Mr and Mrs Magarditch cannot arrogate to themselves a cause of
action which belongs only to Magic.  Their attempts to do so are readily
understandable.  Magic has been wound up and hence control of Magic has passed
to the liquidator, to the exclusion of Mr and Mrs
Magarditch, and the
liquidator is unwilling to have any proceedings brought by Magic. 
<P>

102  	It is one or other or both of the two obstacles I have
identified, which would seem to have been mainly responsible for the
contorted
nature of the pleading in the original statement of claim and in the proposed
amended statement of claim in the Magarditch
proceedings.
<P>

103  	Without mentioning all of the reasons why I consider that the
Magarditch proceedings cannot possibly succeed, I will mention
some of my
reasons.
<P>

104  	Magic should not have been named as a plaintiff and cannot be
joined as a plaintiff, on an application by Mr and Mrs Magarditch.
 The attempt
to join Magic seems to be a tacit recognition that the claims pleaded, if they
exist, are claims properly belonging
to Magic.  That Mr and Mrs Magarditch
derived income from the business of Magic does not give them standing to sue on
causes of action,
which, if they exist, belong to Magic.
<P>

105  	The overt acts alleged, even if they could be proved, are
incapable, in my opinion, of establishing any of the conspiracies
alleged.  Any
conspiracy to defraud or injure, even if it existed, was directed at Magic, and
not at Mr and Mrs Magarditch.  
<P>

106  	The overt acts alleged, even if they could be established,
occurred in 1988 and any cause of action in conspiracy would have
become
statute-barred by the time the Magarditch proceedings were commenced on 17
February 1995.  I note, as regards the particular
overt acts alleged:-
<P>

107  	(i)	VACC refused to meet the insurance claim and avoided the
insurance policy by its letter of 26 July 1988.
<P>

108  	(ii)	Caltex made any decision not to repair the burnt out
premises "or otherwise to support Magic" and to terminate the franchise
agreement, by the time it gave its notice of termination of 20 June 1988. 
<P>

109  	(iii)	Mr Kelly, the officer of ANZ, who was alleged, in his
capacity as manager of the West Ryde Branch of the Bank, to have
conspired on
behalf of the Bank, ceased to be the manager of the West Ryde Branch, and to
have any connection with the West Ryde
Branch, on 20 June 1988.  The statement
Mr Kelly made to the police in the prosecution of Mr Sourian is before me and
it is not true
that Mr Kelly did not in the statement he made to the police
disclose that Magic and Mr and Mrs Magarditch owned a number of properties.
<P>

110  	As regards the claims made against individual defendants in the
latter part of the proposed amended statement of claim, the
claims do not, in
my opinion, plead any sustainable cause of action.  There is no basis in the
evidence before me for arguing that
Thomas, Paget and the Director of Public
Prosecutions were agents of any defendant, other than (possibly) the first
defendant, the
State.
<P>

<b>The Appeal in the Sourian Proceedings</b>
<P>

111  	In my opinion, the appeal in the Sourian proceedings against
the order of the Master dismissing the proceedings pursuant to
Pt33 r6 of the
Supreme Court Rules should be upheld.
<P>

112  	The histories of the two proceedings, the Sourian proceedings
and the Magarditch proceedings, are generally rather similar
and in each
proceeding Studdert J made an order on 12 May 1998, extending the time for the
filing of an amended or further amended
statement of claim to 29 June 1998.  In
each proceedings Master Harrison relied largely on what she found to be the
unexplained failure
to comply with this order by Studdert J, in deciding that
the proceedings should be dismissed.
<P>

113  	However, there is this difference between the two proceedings,
that in the Sourian proceedings, but not in the Magarditch
proceedings, the
plaintiff on 29 June 1998, that is within the time permitted by Studdert J's
order, filed a notice of motion and
an affidavit to which a form of statement
of claim was annexed.  This document was headed "Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim",
set out the terms of the second further amended statement
of claim on which Mr Sourian wished to rely (it is in the same terms as
the
second further amended statement of claim filed as an independent document on
15 July 1998), was verified by an affidavit sworn
by Mr Sourian on 29 June 1998
and was promptly served on the defendants.  It is to be borne in mind that Mr
Sourian was a lay person
acting without legal representation.
<P>

114  	The filing of this document, even as an annexure to another
document, within the time limited by Studdert J's order, was,
in my opinion, a
material factor, which should have been taken into account by Master Harrison
in making her discretionary decision
whether to dismiss the Sourian proceedings
pursuant to Pt33 r6.  However, the fact of the filing of this document is not
included
in the Master's account of the history of the proceedings (or
elsewhere in her judgment).  The Master simply stated in par(15) of
her account
of the history of the proceedings:-
<P>

"On 29 June 1998 the fourth amended statement of claim was not filed in
accordance with the orders of Studdert J".
<P>

115  	I consider that I should hold that the exercise of the Master's
discretion miscarried and should be set aside, for the reason
that she did not
take into account a material consideration, which she was bound to take into
account in making her discretionary
decision.
<P>

116  	As I have set aside the exercise of discretion by the Master
and as there is sufficient material before me for me to exercise
the
discretion, I should proceed to exercise the discretion myself.  Applying the
principles stated by Master Harrison in her judgment
of 23 February 1998 which
were taken from <b>Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure</b> and taking into
account the filing of the verified second further amended statement of claim on
29 June 1998 as an annexure to Mr
Sourian's affidavit, I do not consider that
the Sourian proceedings should be dismissed pursuant to Pt33 r6.  Even taking
into account
all the matters adverse to Mr Sourian relied on by the Master, I
do not consider that any default by Mr Sourian was intentional or
contumelious
or that there was an inordinate and inexcusable delay giving rise to a
substantial risk that a fair trial would not
be possible or to a risk of
serious prejudice to the defendants.  In striking the balance between the
parties and deciding whether
justice requires that the proceedings be
dismissed, I take into account that, as I will subsequently explain, Mr Sourian
would appear
to have some arguable causes of action.  It cannot be said of Mr
Sourian that he has no intention of bringing his case to trial.
 
<P>

117  	As I have declined to dismiss the Sourian proceedings pursuant
to Pt33 r6, it is necessary for me to consider the other applications
by the
respondents and in particular their applications pursuant to Pt13 r5.  In order
for me to do so, it is necessary to make some
examination of the tort of
malicious prosecution.  
<P>

<b>The Tort of Malicious Prosecution - </b>
<P>

118  	The element of the tort of malicious prosecution on which
argument focused on the present appeals is the element that the
defendant in an
action for malicious prosecution should have instituted or maintained the prior
prosecution of the plaintiff.
<P>

119  	There is no doubt that a person who laid the information which
set in motion the criminal prosecution of the person who is
the plaintiff in
the subsequent proceedings for malicious prosecution "instituted" the
prosecution of the plaintiff.  In the present
case, it can be inferred, with a
high degree of confidence, that each information was laid by a police officer
(probably Detective
Sergeant Thomas) and hence there is clearly an arguable
case that this element of the tort of malicious prosecution can be established
against the first defendant, the State.  However, the question arises whether
this element of the tort of malicious prosecution is
capable of being
established against any of the other defendants.  
<P>

120  	In <b>Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Limited v Brain</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1935/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2053%20CLR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 53 CLR 343</a> Dixon J said at 379:-
<P>

"The legal standard of liability for a prosecution which is instituted neither
by the defendant nor by his servant is open to criticism
on the ground of
indefiniteness.  It is clear that no responsibility is incurred by one who
confines himself to bringing before some
proper authority information which he
does not disbelieve, even although in the hope that a prosecution will be
instituted, if it
is actually instituted as the result of an independent
discretion on the part of that authority...  But, if the discretion is misled
by false information, or is otherwise practised upon in order to procure the
laying of the charge, those who thus brought about the
prosecution are
responsible...".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"The rule appears to be that those who counsel and persuade the actual
prosecutor to institute proceedings or procure him to do
so by dishonestly
prejudicing his judgment are vicariously responsible for the proceedings.  If
the actual prosecutor acts maliciously
and without reasonable and probable
cause, those who aid and abet him in doing so are joint wrongdoers with
him".
<P>

121  	The actual facts in <b>Commonwealth Life Assurance v Brain</b>
were unusual.  Although the charge of conspiring to defraud brought against
Brain, which was the foundation of his later claim for
malicious prosecution,
had been laid by a police officer, the information which led to the laying of
the charge was supplied to the
police by an officer of Commonwealth Life
Assurance and the prosecution was conducted by counsel and solicitors engaged
by Commonwealth
Life Assurance, which agreed to pay all costs, charges and
expenses of the prosecution.
<P>

122  	The facts in the New Zealand case of <b>Commercial Union
Assurance Co of New Zealand Limited v Lamont</b> <a href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZCA/1988/247.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] NZCA 247</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%203%20NZLR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 3 NZLR 187 (New</a> Zealand
Court of Appeal) bear some resemblance to the facts of the present case.  A
building and its contents belonging to Lamont
were destroyed by fire and Lamont
made a claim on an insurance policy with Commercial Union.  As a result of
suspicions expressed
by a fire safety officer that the fire had been
deliberately lit, police made enquiries of Commercial Union, which supplied
some
material from its files and that material was used in a prosecution of
Lamont on a charge laid by police of attempting to obtain
money from Commercial
Union by false pretences.
<P>

123  	At 196 Richardson J said:-
<P>

"To summarise the New Zealand authorities.  A defendant who has procured the
institution of criminal proceedings by the police is
regarded as responsible in
law for the initiation of the prosecution.  Expressions such as `instigate',
`set in motion' and `actively
instrumental in putting the law in force', while
evocative do not provide an immediate touchstone for the decision of individual
cases.  That requires close analysis of the particular circumstances.  In the
difficult area where the defendant has given false
information to the police
that in itself is not a sufficient basis in law for treating the defendant as
prosecutor. That conduct
must at least have influenced the police decision to
prosecute".
<P>

124  	Richardson J then considered authorities in other
jurisdictions, including <b>Commonwealth Life Assurance v Brain</b>, and said
inter alia at 199:-
<P>

"The core requirement is that the defendant actually procured the use of the
power of the State to hurt the plaintiff.  One should
never assume that tainted
evidence persuaded the police to prosecute. In some very special cases,
however, the prosecutor may in
practical terms have been obliged to act on
apparently reliable and damning evidence supplied to the police.  The onus
properly rests
on the plaintiff to establish that it was the false evidence
tendered by a third party which led the police to prosecute before that
party
may be characterised as having procured the prosecution".
<P>

125  	In the same case McMullin J said at 207-208:-
<P>

"But in some cases the person who supplied the information to the police may be
regarded as the prosecutor even though the information
was not laid by him.  A
person may be regarded as the prosecutor if, inter alia, he puts the police in
possession of information
which virtually compels an officer to lay an
information;  if he deliberately deceives the police by supplying false
information
in the absence of which the police would not have proceeded;  or if
he withholds information in the knowledge of which the police
would not
prosecute".
<P>

126  	In <b>Martin v Watson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%201%20AC%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 1 AC 74</a> the defendant in an
action for malicious prosecution had made a complaint to the police that the
plaintiff had indecently exposed
himself to her, whereupon the plaintiff had
been charged by the police.  The House of Lords held that the defendant was
liable to
be sued for malicious prosecution on the grounds that where a
complainant has falsely and maliciously given a police officer information
indicating that a person is guilty of an offence and the facts relating to the
alleged offence were solely within the complainant's
knowledge, so that the
police officer could not have exercised any independent discretion, then the
complainant could properly be
said to have been instrumental in setting the
prosecution in motion.
<P>

127  	Fleming the<b> Law of Torts (</b>9th ed 1998) says at
pp676-677:-
<P>

"The defendant must have been `actively instrumental' in setting the law in
motion.  Merely supplying information, however incriminating,
to the police on
which they eventually decide to prosecute is not the equivalent of launching a
prosecution;  the critical decision
not being his, `[the stone set rolling] is
simply a stone of suspicion.'  These days one should hesitate to credit an
informant with
having overcome the scepticism of a police trained to test the
reliability of complaints.  On the other hand, an informant may be
regarded as
a prosecutor if his information virtually compels the police to prosecute, even
more where he deliberately deceives the
police by supplying false information
without which they would not have proceeded".
<P>

128  	One reason for confining liability for malicious prosecution in
the case of persons who did not formally institute the criminal
proceedings but
who provided information to the police for the purpose of the criminal
proceedings, is the need to preserve the immunity
conferred by law on witnesses
who give evidence in court, an immunity which extends to statements made by
prospective witnesses in
preparation for pending court proceedings.  <b>Watson
v M'Ewan</b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1905/1905_7_F_HL_109.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1905] UKHL 1</a>; ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281905%29%20AC%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1905) AC 480.</a>  A person who provides information to the police
of any materiality will usually make a statement to the police and also give
evidence
at the trial of the accused.

in a passage which has been frequently cited:-
<P>

"But it does not matter whether the action is framed as an action for
defamation or as an action analogous to an action for malicious
prosecution or
for deceit or, as in this instance, for combining or conspiring together for
the purpose of injuring another;  the
rule of law is that no action lies
against witnesses in respect of evidence prepared, given, adduced or procured
by them in the course
of legal proceedings. The law protects witnesses and
others, not for their benefit, but for a higher interest, namely, the
advancement
of public justice.  The remedy against a witness who has given or
procured false evidence is by means of the criminal law or by the
punitive
process of contempt of court.
<P>

130  	The element of the tort of malicious prosecution that the
defendant should have instigated the prior criminal prosecution
of the
plaintiff was discussed by Levine J in <b>Cumberland v Clark</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39
NSWLR 514.</a>  In <b>Cumberland v Clark</b> the plaintiff had reported an alleged
assault to the police and had given the police the name of the particular
defendant (who I
will refer to simply as "the defendant") as a witness.  The
defendant gave a statement to a police officer and after interviews with
other
persons the plaintiff himself was charged with assault.  The criminal
proceedings against the plaintiff were dismissed.  Levine
J granted an
application by the defendant for summary dismissal of the proceedings for
malicious prosecution.  In his judgment Levine
J said at 529 that he
"essentially" agreed with submissions made on behalf of the defendant,
including a submission that "it would
only be in exceptional circumstances that
a court would not strike out a claim for malicious prosecution against a
witness in court
proceedings.  There would have to be evidence that the witness
had gone beyond the mere giving of evidence, had sought to prevail
upon other
witnesses to give false evidence or had otherwise taken some step to procure
the bringing about of the prosecution".
<P>

<b>Whether the Claims for Malicious Prosecution in the Sourian Proceedings
should be Summarily Dismissed against the Defendants other
than the
State</b>
<P>

131  	It was submitted on behalf of each of the loss assessor, VACC
and Caltex that the claims for malicious prosecution made against
each of them
in the second further amended statement of claim should be summarily dismissed,
on the grounds that on examination of
the second further amended statement of
claim including the particulars furnished in it, or if not on examination of
the second further
amended statement of claim then by reference to
incontrovertible evidence, it could be seen that Mr Sourian had no chance of
establishing
that the particular defendant had instituted or maintained any of
the criminal prosecutions against Mr  Sourian.
<P>

132  	It was further submitted that the second further amended
statement of claim represented a fourth attempt by Mr Sourian or
his legal
advisers to formulate claims for malicious prosecution and it should be
inferred that the particulars furnished in the
second further amended statement
of claim were the best particulars that could be supplied and could not be
improved upon, so that
it would be futile to grant leave to Mr Sourian to file
yet another statement of claim.  It was also submitted that it should be
inferred that in the voluminous affidavits Mr Sourian had made, with their many
annexures, he had assembled all of the evidence available
to him to establish
his claims for malicious prosecution.  There is considerable force in these
further submissions.
<P>

133  	So far as ANZ is concerned, it was submitted on behalf of ANZ
that it had not been joined as a defendant in the original statement
of claim,
that leave had never been given to join it as a defendant, that on 29 June 1998
Carruthers AJ had made a declaration that
ANZ had not been joined as a
defendant in the proceedings and that on 18 September 1998 Master Harrison had
dismissed Mr Sourian's
notice of motion of 29 June 1998, in which he had sought
an order giving leave to join ANZ as a defendant.  Accordingly, although
ANZ
had been named as a defendant in the second further amended statement of claim
filed by Mr Sourian, it had never been validly
joined as a defendant.
Consequently, the first question to be determined, so far as ANZ was concerned,
was not whether the claims
made against ANZ in the second further amended
statement of claim should be summarily dismissed but whether any error had been
shown
in the 's discretionary decision to dismiss Mr Sourian's application of
29 June 1998 that leave be given to join ANZ as a defendant.
<P>

134  	I accept all of these submissions made on behalf of ANZ.  I
also hold that no error has been established affecting the Master's
discretionary decision not to give leave to join ANZ as a defendant in the
proceedings.  It is accordingly unnecessary for me to
consider whether the
claims for malicious prosecution made against ANZ should be summarily
dismissed.  However, out of more abundant
caution I will consider this
question.
<P>

135  	I have already quoted pars14 and 18 of the second further
amended statement of claim, in which it is alleged that all of the
defendants
"prosecuted" Mr Sourian and that all of the criminal proceedings against Mr
Sourian were brought "at the instigation"
of all of the defendants.  However,
it is not sufficient in a statement of claim alleging malicious prosecution for
the plaintiff
simply to allege that a defendant had "prosecuted" the plaintiff
or that criminal proceedings had been brought "at the instigation"
of the
defendant.  It is necessary, at least in the case of a defendant who did not
formally institute the criminal proceedings against
the plaintiff by laying an
information, to plead the facts by reason of which it is alleged that the
defendant had "prosecuted" the
plaintiff or had "instigated" the prosecution of
the plaintiff.  
<P>

136  	Certain particulars are appended to paragraph 18 of the second
further amended statement of claim (which made the two allegations
that the
criminal proceedings against Mr Sourian were brought "without reasonable and
probable cause" and "at the instigation" of
the defendants or their agents) and
it is desirable to set out these particulars in full.  Separate particulars are
furnished in
relation to each of the six charges against the plaintiff. 
<P>

<center>"<b>Particulars</b></center>
<P>


<P>

(A)	First Offence - Arson
<P>

(i)  Information relevant to the innocence of the Plaintiff was withheld from
the Court and Prosecutor by the First Defendant's
police officers Peter Thomas
and Carl Paget with the knowledge and encouragement by words and deeds of the
Second Defendant and his
servant or agent Edwin Middleton, and the Third
Defendant by its servants or agents, the Second Defendant and also one Greg
Frost
and the Fourth Defendant by its servant or agent Nelson Chad (hereinafter
the said persons are referred to as the said Defendants,
their servants or
agents), namely the evidence of a witness from MSS Alarms whose testimony would
have shown that the Plaintiff was
at home asleep when the fire alarm sounded at
the Chatswood premises of Magic on 3 February 1988.
<P>

(ii)  Information relevant to the innocence to the Plaintiff was withheld from
the Court and the Prosecutor by the said Defendants,
their servants or agents,
or covered up by the said persons, namely evidence of forced entry by a typical
burglar's lever or jemmy,
in contravention of the Prosecution case that there
was no forced entry to the premises, thereby pointing to the Plaintiff as the
arsonist.
<P>

(iii)  A report dated 16 February 1988 of Jeffrey Gudmann of Forensic Services
Australia (NSW) Pty Limited in the possession of
the said Defendants, their
servants or agents consistent with the innocence of the Plaintiff was withheld
from the Court or the Prosecutor
by the said Defendants, their servants or
agent.
<P>

(iv)  Evidence was manufactured by the First and Fifth Defendants in that the
indebtedness of Magic and the Plaintiff was inflated
at the instigation of and
to the knowledge of the said Peter Thomas and Carl Paget by one Paul Kelly,
manager of the West Ryde branch
of the Fifth Defendant, which branch was the
branch of the Plaintiff and of the company Magic. In particular Kelly falsely
and without
authority of the Plaintiff or Magic opened a fully drawn advance
account in the name of Magic stating its indebtedness at $205,000
with a view
to suggesting the company was in financial trouble, when that was not the case,
and by making that evidence available
to the Court or to the Prosecutor.
<P>

(v)  The said Defendants, their servants or agents withheld evidence of the
value of the assets of Magic, namely real estate at
136-138 Victoria Road,
Gladesville and 140 Victoria Road, Gladesville, and did not disclose or make
available to the Court or to
the Prosecutor at the hearing the material knowing
it was relevant and helpful to the Plaintiff or did not take any reasonable
steps
to examine or check or investigate prices offered for the land shortly
before the fire in November 1987, in contradiction of the
Prosecution case.
<P>

(vi)  The said Defendants, their servants or agents provided information to the
Court or Prosecutor, whereby to the knowledge of
the said Defendants, their
servants or agents, it was suggested that premises owned or operated by the
Plaintiff or Magic were open
for business one day after the fire thereby
assisting in giving a false impression that the Plaintiff had evil or
suspicious motives,
when it was known or suspected by the said persons that
that was not the case, and when by checking with available witnesses the
falseness of the aforesaid assertion and impression could have been made
abundantly clear.
<P>

(vii)  The First and Fifth Defendants made available to the Prosecutor and the
Court a statement prepared by officers Thomas and
Paget which statement was
signed by the Fifth Defendant by its servant or agent Paul Kelly stating
falsely that Magic owed the Fifth
Defendant $700,000 when Kelly, Thomas and
Paget knew that to be untrue and in making further statements therein regarding
the bank
records and ledgers of Magic to falsely represent an unfair and
inaccurate financial picture of the company knowing that such statement
would
be used or likely to be used in the prosecution of the Plaintiff.
<P>

(viii)  The said Defendants, their servant and agents falsely prepared evidence
of financial difficulty of Magic through Edwin Middleton
and through Nelson
Chad knowing that the material would be used in the prosecution of the
Plaintiff.
<P>

(B)  Second Offence - Claim Form Matter
<P>

(i)  The said Defendants, their servants or agents, knowing that the
Prosecution case against the Plaintiff was that the claim of
Magic prepared by
or for him upon the Third Defendant for an indemnity in respect of the fire was
fraudulent, and/or for an inflated
amount withheld or arranged to be withheld
stock sheets of Magic of a stock-take done shortly after the fire by Mr Bill
Knock and
Mr Campbell Anderson servants or agents of the Second Defendant,
which stock sheets and stock-take report confirmed the accuracy
of the figures
assessed by the Plaintiff with respect to loss in the claim form.
<P>

(ii)  Subsequent to the said charge being laid and maintained, in May 1989 to
the knowledge of the said Defendants, their servants
or agents, evidence became
available for tender at the hearing to the knowledge of the Defendant, their
servants or agents that the
main witness for the Prosecution, one Valerie
Bowden had stated on oath in related Federal Court proceedings that in addition
to
herself Mr Bill Knock had prepared spread sheets of the stock of Magic
Australia Pty Limited, the effect of which was contrary to
her evidence in the
said Local Court, and whereby the Defendants by their servants or agents and in
addition by Mr Bill Knock and
Mr Campbell Anderson and Mr Frank Egan on behalf
of the Second Defendant by omission did not draw such evidence to the attention
of the Court and in so doing knowing of the relevance and of their duty to make
the evidence available to the Court or the Prosecutor
acted so as to maintain
the prosecution against the Plaintiff.
<P>

(iii)  Failure of the said Defendants, their servants or agents to investigate
properly or at all the signature of the Plaintiff
on the claim form so that the
plaintiff was arrested and charged wrongfully.
<P>

(C)  Third Offence - The Insurance Proposal Matter
<P>

(i)  The First, Second and Third Defendants, by their servants or agents Messrs
Paget, Thomas, Middleton, Frost      by their conduct
prior to the prosecution
of the Plaintiff urged prosecution of the Plaintiff for failing to disclose
certain information to the Third
Defendant knowing that there was no obligation
upon the Plaintiff under the policy or at all to the Third Defendant to
disclose the
said information, or alternatively knowing that there was no
reasonable basis for the assertion of such obligation.
<P>

(ii)  The Plaintiff repeats sub-paragraph A(i) to (iii), (v), (vi) and
(viii).
<P>

(D)  Fourth Offence - Misrepresentation Matter
<P>

(i)  The proceedings were withdrawn against the Plaintiff before the Local
Court for lack of evidence when the Defendants by their
servants or agents knew
or should have known before the prosecution commenced that there was no
reasonable or probable cause for
the prosecution.
<P>

(ii)  The Plaintiff repeats sub-paragraph A(i) to (iii), (v), (vi) and
(viii).
<P>

(E)  Fifth Offence - Assault Matter
<P>

(i)  To the knowledge of Thomas and Paget the insurance investigator employed
by the Second Defendant namely Edwin Middleton requested
the Plaintiff upon
threat of prosecution to withdraw the insurance claim of Magic Australia upon
the Third Defendant and presented
a release of the Third Defendant.
<P>

After the Plaintiff refused to withdraw the claim or sign the release the said
Edwin Middleton falsely alleged that the Plaintiff
had assaulted him, whereby
the Plaintiff was charged with assault when no such assault had been committed
by him.
<P>

(iii)  The plaintiff repeats sub-paragraph A(i), to (iii), (v), (vi) and
(viii).
<P>

(F)  Sixth Offence - Conspiracy Matter
<P>

(i)  The First Defendant by police officers Thomas and Paget and the Second
Defendant by one Edwin Middleton arranged for a statement
to be prepared by one
John McGowan a former employee of Magic to the effect that the Plaintiff had
assaulted Mr McGowan when each
of the said persons knew that that was not the
case and thereafter made such a statement available to the Prosecution for
prosecution
and maintenance of a charge against the Plaintiff.
<P>

(ii)  The Plaintiff repeats sub-paragraph A(i) to (iii), (v), (vi) and
(viii)".
<P>

137  	Before considering these particulars, it is desirable to set
out parts of the statement of Detective Sergeant Thomas of 12
May 1988, parts
of the report of Jeffrey C. Gudmann of Forensic Services Australia (NSW) Pty
Limited of 16 February 1988 and parts
of the statement of Mr Paul Kelly of 15
August 1988.
<P>

138  	As I stated earlier in this judgment, on 12 May 1988 Detective
Sergeant Thomas outlined to Mr Sourian the grounds on which
he suspected that
Mr Sourian was responsible for the fire at the Chatswood premises and also told
Mr Sourian that, apart from a charge
of arson, he would be charged with other
offences.  These parts of Detective Sergeant Thomas' statement were in the
following terms:-
<P>

"16.  I said, `Firstly this fire is Arson.  There is multiple seats of fire -
flammable liquid was used to fuel the fire and there
is no sign of forced
entry.  Do you care to say anything about that'. He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

17.  I said, `Secondly you have a motive for the fire - you are heavily
mortgaged, around $700,000.00 - and the Muffler Shop was
not doing well.  I am
told you were taking about $2500.00 a week NOT the $13,000.00 you claim.  Do
you care to say anything about
that.'  He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

18.  I said, `Thirdly you have the perfect opportunity to set the fire without
being detected.  I am told that you were at the Muffler
Shop as late as 10.30pm
this night.  Do you care to say anything about that.'  
<P>

He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

19.  I said, `There are quite a number of further grounds - There is no forced
entry - you activated the alarm when you depart the
premises yet it is not set
off until the fire is discovered.  You would expect it would go off if an
intruder entered the shop and
set this fire.  Do you care to say anything about
that.'
<P>

He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

20.  I said, `After your staff finishes for the day you shift a customers car -
out of the Muffler Shop into the Service Station.
 When the staff leave they
lock it in the Muffler Shop, they say where it should have been.  Do you care
to say anything about that'.

<P>

He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

21.  I said, `I am informed that you have or had moved the majority of your
stock and equipment from Chatswood to Gladesville Shop,
immediately prior to
the fire.  Do you care to say anything about that.'
<P>

He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

22.  I said, `It was convenient for you that your Gladesville Shop commenced
trading the same day or the day after this fire.  You
could re-direct your
customers to Gladesville.  Do you care to say anything about that.'
<P>

He said, `Nothing.'
<P>

23.  I said, `It will be my allegation that you set this fire with the
intention of grossly defrauding your Insurance Co.  The value
of the stock
allegedly lost by you and the damage occasioned has been grossly overstated.
You say it amounts to $300,000.00, there-about.
 I am informed that $50,000.00
would pull it all up.  That you wouldn't have more than about $20,000.00 stock
all up.  Do you care
to say anything about that.'
<P>

He said, `Nothing'.
<P>

24.  I said `I am told that you prepared your list of stock allegedly lost in
this fire while you were seated in your office at
Gladesville and while making
reference to a suppliers manual.  Do you care to say anything about that.'
<P>

He said, `No but I have heard enough of this shit.'
<P>

25.  I said, `There is a number of other matters that I want to put to you
concerning other allegations.  I want you to understand
that you don't have to
say anything to me unless you want to about any of the matters but whatever you
do say may later be used in
evidence in court'.
<P>

26.  I said, `I intend to charge you with attempting to defraud your Insurance
Company by submitting a false Declaration of Loss,
in respect of this fire.  Do
you care to say anything about that.'.
<P>

He said, `Do it'.
<P>

27.  I said, `I also intend to charge you with attempting to defraud the same
Insurance Company in respect of a Claim made by you,
for damage allegedly
sustained or occasioned to a bending machine, owned by you.  Do you know the
one I mean.'
<P>

He said, `I don't believe this, we will see about all this fucking shit.'
<P>

I said, `Do you care to say anything about the bending machine.'
<P>

He said, `No'.
<P>

28.  I said, `I also allege and I intend to charge you with a Fraud committed
on the same Insurance Company when you completed your
application for Insurance
on the Muffler Shop on the 13 July, 1987 when you failed to disclose your
criminal history and your driving
record.  Do you care to say anything about
that.'
<P>

He said, `I don't fucking believe this.'
<P>

I said, `Do you care to say anything'.
<P>

He said, `No'.
<P>

29.  I said, `I also intend to charge you with Assaulting Insurance
Investigator Mr Ted Middleton, in your office on the 19 April,
1988 when you
said the words to him `when this is all over I will bury you.'  Do you care to
say anything about that.'
<P>

He said, `No'.
<P>

30.  I said, `I also intend to charge you with arranging to have your former
employee, John McGowan assaulted.  He alleges that
the assault happened at a
time and place and with words said to him that can only mean that you were
involved.  Do you care to say
anything about that.'
<P>

He said, `Nothing to say at all - we will see about all this at a later
time'".
<P>

139  	It is apparent from Detective Sergeant Thomas' statement that,
at least on the principal charge of arson, the present case
is a very different
case from <b>Commonwealth Life Assurance v Brain</b> and <b>Martin v
Watson</b>.  The grounds relied on by Detective Sergeant Thomas for deciding to
charge Mr Sourian with arson depended on a number of pieces
of information
obviously supplied by a variety of informants and included inferences drawn by
Detective Sergeant Thomas from information
he had been supplied with, for
example his inference that Mr Sourian had had a "perfect opportunity" to set
the fire without being
detected.  The present case was not a case in which a
single complainant provided information which constituted the whole of the
prosecution case or which the police had no opportunity of checking or which
virtually compelled the police to commence a prosecution.
 Nor was it a case in
which Detective Sergeant Thomas, an experienced arson investigator, had no
opportunity to exercise an independent
discretion in deciding whether to bring
a charge of arson.
<P>

140  	Mr Gudmann conducted an examination of the premises on 10 and
11 February 1988.  Mr Gudmann was not an employee of the insurer
or of the loss
assessor.  He was the "manager" of a company Forensic Services Australia (NSW)
Pty Limited, which had been engaged
by the loss assessor to investigate and
report on the fire.  Parts of the report of 16 February 1988 were as
follows:-
<P>

"1.  A major seat of fire was located on the workshop side of the partition
wall of a storage room in the north-western corner of
the premises...
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

2.  Further examination however, revealed the presence of at least four
additional seats of ignition at independent locations within
the western
section of the premises...
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

3.  A detailed examination of the debris at each of the identified seats of
fire revealed no evidence of any natural or accidental
sources of ignition, and
similarly no evidence of incendiary or ignition devices.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

4.  ....These analyses revealed that the debris at Seats B and C contained
gasoline residues, whereas kerosene residues were detected
in the debris at
Seats A and E, and in the paper products recovered from the office.
<P>

4.  (the second paragraph numbered 4).  The only evidence of forced entry
damage detected was in association with the timber access
door.  However, the
nature of this damage was considered consistent with forced entry by the fire
brigade.  This point, together
with the security status of the premises at the
time of their arrival, should be checked with the attending fire brigade
members..."
<P>

141  	In his submissions to me Mr Sourian did not dispute the
accuracy of any part of Mr Gudmann's report.  Mr Sourian did not dispute
that
the fire had been deliberately lit;  he denied only that he was the person who
had lit the fire.  Mr Sourian did not dispute,
and sought to take advantage of,
Mr Gudmann's finding that there was no evidence of incendiary or ignition
devices and his finding
that there was some evidence of forced entry damage on
the timber access door to the premises.  It is true that Mr Gudmann considered
that this damage was consistent with a forced entry by the fire brigade but he
added that this matter should be checked with the
fire brigade personnel who
had attended the premises.
<P>

142  	Pars4, 7 and 12 of Mr Kelly's statement were in the following
terms:-
<P>

"4.	From records held with the bank, I am able to state that as at 3 February
1988, Magic Australia Pty Limited maintained three
accounts with the ANZ Bank,
West Ryde.
<P>

1.  Working Account - with an overdraft limit of $65,000
<P>

2.  Loan Account - with a limit of $430,000
<P>

3.  Loan Account - with a limit of $205,000
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

7.  These borrowings totalling $700,000 were secured by:-
<P>

1.  Second mortgage over Mr Jake Sourian's home at Artarmon (the First mortgage
being to ANZ Savings Bank).
<P>

2.  A First mortgage over vacant land at Thornleigh
<P>

3.  A First mortgage over Magic Mufflers and adjoining property at 136-138
Victoria Road, Gladesville
<P>

4.  A First mortgage over Mr Sourian's (Snr) home at Willoughby
<P>

5.  An unlimited guarantee of Directors.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

12.  From time to time, the account (the working account) exceeded the arranged
limit, however, we had adequate security and the
Balance Sheet indicated the
company was trading well.  Consequently, we permitted these excesses and at no
time contemplated returning
cheques".
<P>

143  	I will now examine the particulars appended to par18 of the
second further amended statement of claim to determine whether
Mr Sourian has
any arguable case against any defendant (apart from the first defendant) that
that defendant instituted or maintained
any of the criminal prosecutions of Mr
Sourian.
<P>

144  	In a number of the particulars it is alleged that information
was withheld from "the court and the prosecutor".  I take "the
court" to be a
reference to the Local Court in which the committal proceedings were held or
the District Court in which Mr Sourian
was tried and I take "the prosecutor" to
be a reference to the person who appeared for the prosecution in the Local
Court or in the
District Court.  In my opinion, if information which may be
relevant to the guilt or innocence of a criminal accused has been put
in the
possession of the police having the conduct of the prosecution, it is the
responsibility of those police, and not of any person
who provided the
information to the police or anyone else, to ensure that the information is
disclosed to the prosecutor.  It then
becomes the responsibility of the
prosecutor to determine whether the evidence should be adduced in the court
proceedings.
<P>

145  	A - First Offence - Arson
<P>

146  	(i) 	It is alleged that evidence of a witness from MSS Alarms
that the plaintiff was at home asleep, when the fire alarm sounded,
was
withheld from the court and the prosecutor.  It is alleged that this
information was withheld by the police officers Thomas and
Paget, who, as the
pleading accepts, were in possession of the information.  It is not alleged
that the information was withheld
by any of the second defendant, the third
defendant, the fourth defendant or the fifth defendant.  The only allegation
made against
these defendants is that the police officers withheld the
information from the court and the prosecutor with the "encouragement"
by words
and deeds of the nominated servants and agents of these defendants.  No
particulars of the alleged words or deeds are furnished
and I was not referred
to any evidence of the alleged words or deeds.  As stated above, it would be
the responsibility of the police
officer or officers having the conduct of the
prosecution to bring possibly relevant evidence which was in their possession
to the
notice of the prosecutor.
<P>

147  	(ii)	It is alleged that evidence of forced entry by a lever was
withheld from the court and the prosecutor by the defendants
or covered up by
the defendants.  No further particulars are furnished in the second further
amended statement of claim.
<P>

148  	In his oral submissions at the hearing Mr Sourian pointed to
the report from Mr Gudmann as containing evidence of forced entry
to the
premises.  
<P>

149  	It is not alleged in the second further amended statement of
claim that the evidence of forced entry (identified by Mr Sourian
as being Mr
Gudmann's report) was withheld by the loss assessor or any of the other
defendants from the police who were conducting
the criminal investigation.  On
the contrary, the pleading implicitly accepts that the police were put in
possession of the evidence
of forced entry.  It would have been the
responsibility of the police having the conduct of the investigation, and not
any of the
second to fifth defendants, to ensure that Mr Gudmann's evidence was
presented to the prosecutor.
<P>

150  	In any event, Mr Gudmann's information that he had found some
evidence of a forced entry to the premises was not withheld
from the court at
the committal proceedings.  It would appear to be true that Mr Gudmann's report
was not admitted into evidence
at the committal proceedings.  However, a copy
of the report had been supplied to Mr Sourian's legal representatives
(committal proceedings
4 April 1989 p3).  At the committal hearing counsel for
Mr Sourian objected to the report being tendered and objected to Mr Gudmann
refreshing his memory by referring to the report, as distinct from his
contemporaneous notes (committal proceedings 4 April 1989
pp3-4).  When Mr
Gudmann gave his oral evidence at the committal proceedings he gave evidence of
observing damage to the timber door
of the premises which could have been
caused by a lever.  
<P>

151  	It became apparent in the course of Mr Sourian's submissions
that his real complaints were:-
<P>

152  	(a)	That Detective Sergeant Thomas had not pursued, or had not
pursued diligently enough, an enquiry to the fire brigade as
to whether the
damage consistent with a forced entry had been caused by members of the fire
brigade.
<P>

(b)	A police physical evidence officer who had examined the premises had not in
his report included any mention of the signs of
a forced entry, which had been
detected by Mr Gudmann.
<P>

(c)	When Detective Sergeant Thomas spoke to Mr Sourian on 12 May 1988 he
alleged that there was no sign of forced entry.
<P>

153  	None of the defendants other than the first defendant have any
responsibility for any of these matters.
<P>

154  	(iii)	It is alleged that Mr Gudmann's report was withheld from
the court and the prosecutor by the defendants.  
<P>

155  	Much of what I said in relation to particular (ii) is equally
applicable here.  A copy of Mr Gudmann's report was provided
to Mr Sourian's
legal representatives.  Mr Gudmann's report was not admitted into evidence at
the committal proceedings, because
of the position adopted by Mr Sourian's own
counsel.  Mr Gudmann gave oral evidence at the committal proceedings of finding
evidence
of forced entry to the premises.  He also gave oral evidence of not
finding any delayed ignition or incendiary devices (committal
proceedings 4
April 1989 p29).
<P>

156  	(iv)	It is alleged that evidence of the indebtedness of Magic
and Mr Sourian was falsely inflated by Mr Kelly of the Bank,
at the instigation
of Detective Sergeant Thomas and Detective Senior Constable Paget.  No
allegation is made against any other defendant.
 
<P>

157  	The only particular furnished is that Mr Kelly falsely opened a
fully drawn advance account in the name of Magic showing an
indebtedness of
$205,000.  
<P>

158  	In his oral submissions Mr Sourian pointed to the finding by
Master McLaughlin that the liability on the fully drawn advance
account FDA2
was a liability, not of Magic, but of Mr Sourian.  As stated earlier in this
judgment, this finding was not upset on
appeal, although Santow J expressed
some reservations about it.
<P>

159  	However, even if the indebtedness on the fully drawn advance
account was not an indebtedness of Magic, it was an indebtedness
of Mr Sourian
and in my opinion it could not be regarded as making any material difference to
whether there was evidence of motive
for Mr Sourian to set fire to the
premises, that the sum of $205,000 was owed to the Bank, not by Magic, but by
Mr Sourian himself,
who was the son of the directors of Magic, who was the
manager of Magic and who was the person actually being accused of arson.
<P>

160  	According to paragraph 17 of his statement, Detective Sergeant
Thomas in speaking to Mr Sourian on 12 May 1988 did not distinguish
between Mr
Sourian and Magic, so far as financial liabilities were concerned.  Detective
Sergeant Thomas simply said to Mr Sourian
"secondly, <b>you (</b>my emphasis)
have a motive for a fire- you are heavily mortgaged, around $700,000".
<P>

161  	(v)	It is alleged that the defendants withheld evidence of the
value of Magic's assets consisting of real estate at 136-138
and 140 Victoria
Road, Gladesville and did not take any reasonable steps to investigate prices
for the land shortly before the fire
in "November" 1987.  No further
particulars are furnished of these allegations.
<P>

162  	In his statement of 15 August 1988 made to the police Mr Kelly
disclosed that the liabilities to the Bank including the sum
of $205,000 were
secured by securities over properties owned by Mr Sourian or Magic, including
the two properties in Victoria Road,
Gladesville.  In his statement Mr Kelly
did not assert that the securities which the Bank held were inadequate to
secure the amount
of the indebtedness to the Bank.  
<P>

163  	I was not directed to any evidence which would support an
allegation that any of the defendants withheld any evidence it had
of the
values of Magic's properties.  Evidence of the value of the properties would
have been within the knowledge of Magic itself.
<P>

164  	There was no obligation on any of the second to the fifth
defendants to carry out some kind of investigation into what prices
had been
offered for the land at Gladesville before the fire in 1987.
<P>

165  	(vi)	It is alleged that the defendants provided information
whereby it was "suggested" that Magic's premises at Gladesville
were open for
business one day after the fire, when it was "known or suspected" that that was
not the case, and when, "if" the defendants
had checked with available
witnesses, the falseness of the assertion "could have been made abundantly
clear".
<P>

166  	The words which I have put in quotation marks show that this
allegation falls significantly short of an allegation that any
of the
defendants provided information containing an outright assertion by the
defendant which the defendant knew to be false.
<P>

167  	The information, as pleaded in particular (vi), is that the
other premises (that is the premises at Gladesville) were "open"
for business
one day after the fire.  However, in paragraph 22 of his statement Detective
Sergeant Thomas said that he had said to
Mr Sourian on 12 May 1988:-
<P>

"It was convenient for you that your Gladesville premises commenced trading the
same day or the day after this fire".
<P>

168  	Mr Sourian did not dispute that the premises at Gladesville
were open for business one day after the fire;  he disputed that
the premises
were opened for business, for the first time, one day after the fire.  
<P>

169  	However, whether the information was that the premises at
Gladesville were opened for business for the first time the day
of the fire or
the day after the fire or merely continued to be open for business, it is
apparent from evidence given at the committal
proceedings that the source of
this information was not any of the defendants but Mr McGowan, the former
employee of Magic.
<P>

170  	(vii)	It is alleged that a statement was provided to the
prosecutor and the court in which Mr Kelly said that Magic owed ANZ
$700,000
and made further statements giving an unfair and inaccurate financial picture
of Magic.
<P>

171  	The first allegation is really a repetition of the allegation
made in particular (iv) that Mr Kelly falsely asserted that
the indebtedness of
$205,000 on the fully drawn advance account was a liability of Magic and not Mr
Sourian.  If the liability on
the fully drawn advance account was a liability
of Magic, then Magic's indebtedness to the Bank did exceed $700,000.  If the
liability
on the fully drawn advance account was a liability of Mr Sourian,
then the combined liabilities of Mr Sourian and of Magic exceeded
$700,000.
<P>

172  	The second allegation in this particular is completely lacking
in specificity and no further particulars of it are provided.
 
<P>

173  	(viii) 	It is alleged that the defendants falsely prepared
evidence that Magic was in financial difficulties through Mr Middleton
on
behalf of the loss assessor and Mr Chad on behalf of Caltex.  No particulars
are furnished of this allegation and I was not directed
to any evidence which
would support it.
<P>

174  	My conclusion from this examination of the particulars
furnished in the second further amended statement of claim is that
the
allegation that the proceedings charging Mr Sourian with arson were instituted
or maintained by the defendants is incapable of
being established against any
of the second defendant, the third defendant, the fourth defendant or the fifth
defendant and the proceedings
for malicious prosecution against those
defendants in relation to that charge would necessarily fail.  It follows that
the claims
for malicious prosecution for this offence against the second, third
and fourth defendants should be summarily dismissed and that,
were it necessary
to consider the fifth defendant, the claim for malicious prosecution for this
offence against the fifth defendant
should also be summarily dismissed.
<P>

<b>B - Second Offence - Claim form Matter</b>
<P>

175  	(i)	It is alleged that stock sheets of a stock take of Magic
done shortly after the fire by nominated servants or agents of
the loss
assessor, Mr Knock and Mr Anderson, which confirmed the accuracy of the figures
supplied by Mr Sourian in the claim form,
were withheld or arranged to be
withheld.  No particulars of the arrangement or of the withholding are
furnished.  Nevertheless,
although no particulars are furnished, it seems to me
that what is alleged might be capable of satisfying, as against the second
defendant the loss assessor, the requirement that the prosecution of Mr Sourian
for publishing a false statement in the claim form
should have been instituted
or maintained by the loss assessor.  The servants or agents of the loss
assessor are identified.  The
false statement allegedly made by Mr Sourian in
the claim form on which the prosecution was based related to the claim for the
value
of stock allegedly lost or damaged by the fire.
<P>

176  	I do not, however, consider that particular (i) is capable of
showing that the prosecution of Mr Sourian for this offence
was instituted or
maintained by any of the third defendant, the fourth defendant or the fifth
defendant.  As was pointed out by Master
Greenwood in his judgment of 5 June
1997, the loss assessor is an independent contractor and the insurer is not
vicariously liable
for the acts of the loss assessor.
<P>

177  	(ii)	It is alleged that one Valerie Bowden gave evidence in
proceedings in the Federal Court that Mr Knock, a servant or agent
of the loss
assessor, had prepared stock sheets, which were inconsistent with the evidence
Ms Bowden herself had given in the Local
Court in the committal proceedings and
that subsequently the defendants by their servants or agents did not draw this
evidence by
Ms Bowden "to the attention of the court".  I do not consider that
an omission by a person, who is not the person having the conduct
of a criminal
prosecution, to draw to the attention of the court hearing the criminal
proceeding that a witness in the criminal proceeding
has said in evidence in
other proceedings that some other person had prepared documents the effect of
which was contrary to evidence
given by the witness at an earlier stage in the
criminal proceedings, could render the first mentioned person liable to be sued
for
malicious prosecution.
<P>

178  	(iii)	In his oral submissions Mr Sourian said that the point of
this particular was that the signature on the claim form is
Mr Magarditch's and
not Mr Sourian's.  However, this particular misses the point of the charge
against Mr Sourian under s178BB of
the <i>Crimes Act</i>.  Mr Sourian was
charged, not with signing the claim form, but with having published it.  
<P>

179  	I conclude that Mr Sourian's claim for malicious prosecution in
respect of the insurance claim form matter should be summarily
dismissed as
against the third defendant, the fourth defendant and the fifth defendant but
should not be summarily dismissed as against
the second defendant, the loss
assessor.
<P>

<b>C - Third Offence - the Insurance Proposal Matter</b>
<P>

180  	Urging that a prosecution be brought is conduct of such a
character as can support an allegation in a subsequent action for
malicious
prosecution that the person who did the urging instituted or maintained the
prosecution.  However, the particulars which
the plaintiff has furnished in
relation to this charge are merely some of the particulars which have already
been supplied in relation
to the first charge.  I have already held that these
particulars are incapable of establishing that the prosecution of Mr Sourian
for arson was instituted or maintained by any of the defendants (apart from the
first defendant) and these particulars are equally
incapable, and indeed even
less capable, of establishing that the prosecution of Mr Sourian for having
made a false statement in
the insurance proposal was instituted or maintained
by any of the defendants (apart from the first defendant).  I conclude that Mr
Sourian's claims for malicious prosecution in respect of the insurance proposal
matter should be summarily dismissed as against the
second defendant, the third
defendant, the fourth defendant and the fifth defendant.
<P>

<b>D - Fourth Offence - Misrepresentation Matter</b>
<P>

181  	Particular (i) is not a particular of the allegation that the
defendants instituted or maintained the prosecution for this
alleged offence.
The only other particulars furnished are particulars which have already been
furnished in relation to the charge
of arson.  These particulars are even less
capable of establishing that any of the defendants (apart from the first
defendant) instituted
or maintained the prosecution for this alleged offence
than they are of establishing that any of those defendants instituted or
maintained
the prosecution for the offence of arson.  I conclude that Mr
Sourian's claims for malicious prosecution in respect of the
"misrepresentation"
matter should be summarily dismissed against all of the
second defendant, the third defendant, the fourth defendant and the fifth
defendant.
<P>

<b>(E)	Fifth Offence - Assault Matter</b>
<P>

182  	The particulars furnished are incapable of establishing against
any of the third defendant, the fourth defendant or the fifth
defendant that it
instituted or maintained the prosecution of Mr Sourian for this offence.
<P>

183  	However, notwithstanding obvious deficiencies in the
particulars, it seems to me that it is not possible to say that the substance
of what is alleged would be incapable of establishing that the second defendant
the loss assessor instituted or maintained the prosecution
of Mr Sourian for
this offence.  It is alleged that an insurance investigator employed by the
second defendant falsely alleged that
he had been assaulted by Mr Sourian and
that this false allegation led to Mr Sourian being charged with assault.
<P>

184  	I conclude that Mr Sourian's claims for malicious prosecution
in respect of the assault matter should be summarily dismissed
as against the
third defendant, the fourth defendant and the fifth defendant but should not be
summarily dismissed as against the
second defendant.  
<P>

<b>(F)	Sixth Offence - Conspiracy Matter</b>
<P>

185  	It is alleged that the first defendant and the second defendant
arranged for a statement to be prepared by Mr McGowan that
the plaintiff Mr
Sourian had assaulted Mr McGowan "knowing that this was not the case".
<P>

186  	The statement was made by Mr McGowan and would have been made
to the police.  No particulars are furnished of how the loss
assessor allegedly
"arranged" for the statement to be prepared or of how the loss assessor knew
that the allegation made by Mr McGowan
that Mr Sourian had assaulted Mr McGowan
was untrue.  I was not referred to any evidence which would support the
allegations that
the loss assessor had arranged for the statement to be
prepared or that the loss assessor knew that what was alleged in the statement
was false.
<P>

187  	I note that no allegation is made against any of the third
defendant the fourth defendant and the fifth defendant.
<P>

188  	I consider that Mr Sourian's claims for malicious prosecution
in respect of the conspiracy matter should be summarily dismissed
as against
all of the second defendant, the third defendant, the fourth defendant and the
fifth defendant.
<P>

189  	I have held that the claims for malicious prosecution against
the State for the prosecution of Mr Sourian on each of the six
charges set out
in paragraph 15 of the second further amended statement of claim should not be
summarily dismissed on the grounds
that Mr Sourian could not possibly succeed
in establishing the element of the tort of malicious prosecution that the
defendant should
have instituted or maintained the previous prosecution of the
plaintiff.  I have also held that the claims for malicious prosecution
against
the loss assessor for the prosecution of Mr Sourian on the second and fifth
charges set out in paragraph 15 of the second
further amended statement of
claim should not be summarily dismissed on the grounds that Mr Sourian could
not possibly succeed in
establishing that the loss assessor instituted or
maintained the prosecution of Mr Sourian on those two charges.
<P>

190  	That the defendant should have instituted or maintained the
prior criminal prosecution of the plaintiff is not, of course,
the only element
of the tort of malicious prosecution.  Of the other elements it is clear that
each of the prosecutions of Mr Sourian
ended in his favour.  The remaining
elements of the tort are that the prosecution of the plaintiff should have been
instituted or
maintained without reasonable and probable cause and maliciously.
See <b>Fleming</b> at 674.
<P>

191  	At the hearing comparatively little attention was paid to these
last two elements of the tort of malicious prosecution and
they are, in any
event, elements of such a character that it is intrinsically difficult to
demonstrate on a pre-trial application
that a plaintiff has no chance of
establishing them.  In the present case, as Judge Nader noted in his judgment
of 8 March 1994,
there is material which might be capable of establishing the
absence of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecutions and the
absence
of reasonable and probable cause may of itself afford some evidence of malice.
I would not summarily dismiss any of the claims
for malicious prosecution
against the first defendant or either the second or the fifth claim for
malicious prosecution against the
loss assessor on the grounds that the
plaintiff has no chance of establishing the elements of the tort of malicious
prosecution that
the prosecution should have been brought without reasonable
and probable cause and maliciously.  I also consider that none of the
claims
should be summarily dismissed on the grounds that they are frivolous or
vexatious or an abuse of process.
<P>

192  	At the hearing counsel for the respondents and particularly
counsel for the first respondent drew my attention to a number
of defects in
the pleading of the claims for malicious prosecution in the second further
amended statement of claim.   There are,
undoubtedly, a number of defects in
the pleading but they are not such as would, at least at this stage, warrant
the claims for malicious
prosecution being summarily dismissed.
<P>

193  	I have held that the six claims for malicious prosecution
against the State and two of the claims for malicious prosecution
against the
loss assessor should not be summarily dismissed.  However, as the pleading of
these claims in the second further amended
statement of claim is not free from
defects and as the pleading of these claims is closely intertwined with the
pleading of claims
which I have decided should be summarily dismissed, I
consider that, rather than attempting to dissect the second further amended
statement of claim into parts which should be dismissed and parts which should
be permitted to survive, I should strike out the second
further amended
statement of claim and give the plaintiff leave to file another further amended
statement of claim, limited to pleading
the claims for malicious prosecution
against the State and the two claims for malicious prosecution against the loss
assessor which
I have identified.
<P>

194  	I have not summarily dismissed the six claims for malicious
prosecution against the State or two of the claims for malicious
prosecution
against the loss assessor.  However, as I have remarked, the pleading of these
claims in the second further amended statement
of claim is not free from
defects and I would not wish to be taken as expressing any view on what
approach should be taken by another
judicial officer, if the defects in the
second further amended statement of claim remain in any further amended
statement of claim
and an application is made by one or both of the defendants
in relation to that further amended statement of claim.
<P>

<b>Whether the Claims for Conspiracy in the Sourian Proceedings should be
Summarily Dismissed</b>
<P>

195  	I turn to the claims for conspiracy in the second further
amended statement of claim.  Three separate conspiracies are alleged,
a
conspiracy between the first three defendants, a conspiracy between the first
defendant and the fourth defendant and a conspiracy
between the first defendant
and the fifth defendant.  It is necessary to examine separately each of these
claims of conspiracy. 

<P>

196  	(i)	Alleged conspiracy between the first three defendants.
<P>

197  	The object of the conspiracy, as alleged in paragraph 22 of the
second further amended statement of claim, was "to defeat
the claim of Magic
against the third defendant in respect of fires occurring at the Caltex Service
Station at 607 Pacific Highway,
Chatswood on 30 September 1987 and 3 February
1988 and to damage and injure the plaintiff's commercial standing and in his
business".
<P>

198  	The overt acts alleged are:-
<P>

"(i)	Providing false information and statements to the police and withholding
information regarding the conduct of the Plaintiff
causing him to be
prosecuted.
<P>

(ii)	Causing the Plaintiff to be prosecuted for six offences he did not
commit.
<P>

(iii)	Falsely asserting by letter dated 26 July 1988 on letterhead of
solicitors Messrs Curwood &amp; Derkenne that the Plaintiff
had been convicted
of importing machine guns, bullet proof vests and the like and malicious
injury, asserting fraudulent non-disclosure
in respect of these matters in
relation to the insurance police number PACO 5215 from inception.
<P>

(iv)	Wrongfully avoiding Police PACO 5215.
<P>

(v)	Wrongfully terminating the lease of Magic's premises.
<P>

(vi)	Misrepresenting the Plaintiff's business standing and reputation".
<P>

199  	Of these overt acts overt act (iv) does not really add anything
to overt act (iii).  Overt act (v) refers to an act, not of
any of the alleged
conspirators, but of the fourth defendant Caltex.  Overt act (vi) is so vague
that it should be disregarded. 

<P>

200  	Overt act (iii), while it might be capable of being regarded as
an act done in furtherance of a conspiracy to defeat the claim
of Magic on its
insurance policy, in which case the proper plaintiff in an action for
conspiracy would be Magic and not the plaintiff,
is not, in my opinion, capable
of being regarded as an act done in furtherance of a conspiracy "to damage and
injure the plaintiff's
commercial standing and in his business".
<P>

201  	The attempt to rely on overt acts (i) and (ii) involves a
contravention of the principles stated in <b>Cabassi v Vila</b>.  A person who
provides information and a statement to the police for the purposes of a
prosecution or who withholds information
from the police is immune from being
sued civilly, otherwise than for the tort of malicious prosecution.
<P>

202  	The claims of conspiracy against the first three defendants
should be summarily dismissed.
<P>

203  	(ii)	Alleged conspiracy between the first defendant and the
fourth defendant.
<P>

204  	The object of the conspiracy as alleged in paragraph 26 of the
second further amended statement of claim was "to provide false
information to
the prosecution authorities and to the police to defraud and injure Magic in
its business and the plaintiff in his
business as its manager".  
<P>

205  	The overt acts alleged are:-
<P>

"(i)	Chad and Lund agreed with Thomas and Paget not to provide profitability
figures for throughput of sales at the Caltex Service
Station available to
them.
<P>

(ii)	Chad, Thomas and Paget prepared a statement by Chad to the effect that the
company was in financial trouble because it had
recently put other assets being
properties to auction and representing that the company was thereby in
financial difficulty when
that was not the case.
<P>

(iii)	Chad and other diverse persons employed by the Fourth Defendant in 1988
and 1989 but unknown to the Plaintiff made a decision
not to repair the
premises that had been burnt in the fires or otherwise to support the Plaintiff
and the business he managed in
any way whatsoever with a view to defeat the
interests in the business and terminating the lease between Magic Australia Pty
Limited
and the Fourth Defendant in respect of the premises.
<P>

(iv)	The said Defendants caused the Plaintiff to be prosecuted for six offences
of which he was innocent.".
<P>

206  	I consider that this claim for conspiracy should be summarily
dismissed.  My reasons include:-
<P>

207  	Overt act (i) alleges an agreement not to provide certain
information and cannot be an overt act done in furtherance of the
conspiracy
alleged, which is to provide false information to the police.  Overt act (ii)
could only be an overt act done in furtherance
of a conspiracy to defraud or
injure Magic, and not Mr Sourian.  Overt act (iii) alleging a decision made on
behalf of Caltex not
to repair the burnt out premises, "or otherwise to give
support" and to terminate the lease could not be an overt act or acts done
in
furtherance of a conspiracy to provide false information.  As to overt act
(iv), I have already summarily dismissed all claims
for malicious prosecution
against Caltex.  The conspiracy alleged, to provide false information to the
prosecution authorities and
to the police, involves a contravention of the
principle of immunity from civil proceedings, apart from malicious prosecution,
of
witnesses and persons who make statements to the police.
<P>

208  	(iii)	Alleged conspiracy between the first defendant and the
fifth defendant.
<P>

209  	The object of the conspiracy, as alleged in paragraph 24 (the
second paragraph 24) of the second further amended statement
of claim was "to
provide false information to the prosecution authorities with respect to the
financial position of Magic and the
business standing of the plaintiff to
defraud and injure the plaintiff".
<P>

210  	The overt acts alleged are:-
<P>

"(i)  Arranging without authority of the Plaintiff or Magic the opening of a
fully drawn advance account at the West Ryde branch
of the Fifth Defendant with
a fully drawn advance showing $205,000 in the name of the company
inaccurately.
<P>

(ii)  Stating that the company owed monies in excess of $700,000 when that was
not the case.
<P>

(iii)  Knowing that properties belonging to the company were of significant
value not disclosing those properties in evidence made
available to the
prosecution authorities.
<P>

(iv)  Failing to disclose the property of the Plaintiff to the prosecution
authority of significant value at Gladesville and Artarmon".
<P>

211  	It is to be kept in mind that any appeal by Mr Sourian in
relation to ANZ is, in the first instance, an appeal against the
Master's
decision dismissing Mr Sourian's notice of motion of 29 June 1998, in which he
sought an order giving leave to join ANZ
as a defendant, and I have held that
the Master made no error in dismissing the notice of motion.  However, I would
summarily dismiss
the claim for conspiracy against the first and the fifth
defendants.  My reasons include:-
<P>

212  	As to overt act (i) the only error which ANZ arguably made was
to show the indebtedness on the fully drawn advance account
as an indebtedness
of Magic rather than of Mr Sourian.  Overt act (ii) is simply a restatement in
different words of overt act (i).
 Overt acts (iii) and (iv) are untrue.  In
his statement made to the police Mr Kelly did disclose the properties of Magic
and of
Mr Sourian.  Generally, the overt acts alleged are incapable of
establishing the conspiracy alleged, the proper plaintiff in a claim
for
conspiracy, if any claim existed, would be Magic and the conspiracy alleged, to
provide false information to the prosecution
authorities, involves a
contravention of the principle of immunity from civil proceedings, apart from
malicious prosecution, of witnesses
and persons who makes statements.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

213  	In the Sourian proceedings I have held that all the claims made
by Mr Sourian should be summarily dismissed, except the claims
for malicious
prosecution made against the first defendant and two of the claims for
malicious prosecution made against the second
defendant.  I consider that Mr
Sourian should be given a further opportunity properly to plead the claims
which I have not summarily
dismissed.  The long vacation will commence shortly
and Mr Sourian should be allowed a sufficient time in which to have a properly
drawn statement of claim prepared.  
<P>

214  	I make the following orders.
<P>

<b>Sourian Proceedings</b>

18 September 1998 that the plaintiff's notice of motion of

216  	2.	I allow the appeal against the order of Master Harrison of
18 September 1998 that the proceedings generally be dismissed.
<P>
