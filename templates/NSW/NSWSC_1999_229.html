MASTER MACREADY
<P>

Friday 26 March 1999
<P>

<b>4346/97 WILLIAM EDWARD JACKSON v GRACE MAKALESI JACKSON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  This is an application under the <b>Defacto
Relationships Act</b> for the adjustment of the parties' property interests.
There is also in a cross claim filed by the defendant a claim for damages
for
assault in respect of several instances of violence, alleged by the defendant
against the plaintiff during the period of the
parties' cohabitation.  The
parties are agreed that they lived together in a defacto relationship between
December 1986 and 18 June
1997.  On one occasion during that period the
defendant left the home in which the parties resided but returned about ten
days later.
 
<P>

2	The plaintiff was born on 5 February 1941 and is now aged 58 years of age.
The defendant was born on 4 November 1951 and is now
aged 47 years.  She is of
Fijian descendent but is now an Australian citizen.  The parties met in June
1983 and at that stage the
plaintiff was living on a ship anchored in Suva
harbour.  There is some difference between them as to whether or not they lived
together
on the ship or in separate residences.  That ship was sold in January
1984 and thereafter the plaintiff lived on another ship the,
"North Sky" also
anchored in the Bay of Islands, Suva harbour.  In March 1984 the association
between them changed to the extent
that the defendant moved to her sister's
property at 14 Foster Street, Suva.  
<P>

3	On 29 July 1984 a child, Damian, Francis, Valentine, Jackson, was born as
result of the relationship between the parties.  At
that stage the plaintiff
also moved to the unit at 14 Foster Street, Suva and lived with the defendant
and their son.  Later in the
year the plaintiff travelled to North Korea on a
venture concerning the sale of a ship and returned some time later.  At the end
of 1984 the plaintiff returned to Australia in order to endeavour to purchase
HMAS Melbourne and from that period until October 1985
the plaintiff was in
Australia and the defendant in Fiji.  The plaintiff returned to Fiji for a week
and arrangements were made for
the defendant and her son to apply for
settlement in Australia.  In mid 1986 the defendant and her son came to Sydney
and lived with
the plaintiff for several weeks before returning to Fiji.  The
defendant and the parties' son, Damian, were given approval to migrate
to
Australia in December 1986 and they came to Australia on 22 December 1986.  The
parties lived together thereafter in rented accommodation
at Bondi.  In early
1987 the plaintiff, who had skills as a mechanical engineer, commenced work
with Australian Skilled Engineering
and in the early part of the year the
defendant commenced employment with the National Australia Bank as a bank
officer at the Double
Bay branch.  
<P>

4	In 1990 the plaintiff changed his position of employment and on 17 October
1991 the parties purchased in joint names the unit
at 3/38 Mitchell Street,
North Bondi.  The purchase price was $165,000 and a bank loan was taken out for
$120,000.  This was at a
discount rate due to the defendant's employment.
There were expenses comprising stamp duty of $4,265, legal costs of $1,500 and
loan
fees of $630.  The equity supplied by the parties at that stage was
$51,395.  I will return in due course to the contributions to
this equity.
This is a matter of some dispute on the evidence.  After the purchase the whole
of the defendant's salary from the National
Bank was deposited to pay off the
mortgage.  The plaintiff, from his income, met the parties' other expenditure.

<P>

5	In 1992 there was an incident when Damian who was in the care of the
plaintiff received a gash under one of his eyes.  I will
return to the details
of this later when considering the parenting contributions.  
<P>

6	Towards to the end of 1992 a company, Austhold Pty Ltd was incorporated and
this was used as a company for the purposes of the
plaintiff making available
his services to various employers.  He then was employed by the company as was
the defendant for the purposes
of doing its book work.  On 18 June 1997 the
defendant alleges that the plaintiff assaulted her and, as a result, she left
the parties'
residence with the child, Damian.  They moved to the defendant's
sister's home and subsequently to a friend's residence.  She has,
since that
time, remained living in rented accommodation and the plaintiff has remained in
the unit meeting all the outgoings including
repayment of the mortgage.  
<P>

7	On 9 July 1997 the defendant cashed a term deposit which she had some time
previously placed in their joint names and retained
these funds for her own
use.  She used the funds to discharge credit card and other debts.  On 21
August 1997 the plaintiff withdrew
the sum of $4,198.57 from a passbook account
in the name of the defendant in trust for the child, Damian, in order, so he
says, to
reimburse himself for expenditure relating to the child, Damian.  The
withdrawal was signed by the defendant.  
<P>

8	At the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff had assets which
consisted of savings of approximately $50,000 and plant
and machinery which he
estimated had a value of $35,000.  That plant and machinery was later assigned
to the company Austhold Pty
Ltd when that company took over the business of
providing the plaintiff's services on a contract basis.  The plaintiff also had
a
Valiant motor vehicle the value of which does not appear in the evidence.

<P>

9	The only asset of the defendant of any substance at the commencement of the
relationship was the defendant's entitlement to be
paid a sum from a provident
fund in Fiji.  Apparently this entitlement arises from her employment in Fiji
as employers contribute
to the fund on a statutory basis for all their
employees.  She had been working since she was 21 years of age in other words
for
some 13 years by the time the relationship commenced in 1986.  She alleges
that her entitlement at this stage was some $15,000. 
Although conceding that
she did have some entitlement the plaintiff denies that it was anything like
$15,000 or that it was used
as the defendant suggests for the purchase of the
unit which occurred in 1991.  
<P>

10	At the conclusion of the relationship the plaintiff had his joint interest
in the unit, 3/38 Mitchell Street, Bondi.  The parties
are agreed that that
unit has a present value of $310,000.  They are also agreed that as at the date
of the conclusion of the relationship
the amount owing to the bank was
$65,573.55.  The amount owing to bank on the loan at the time of the hearing is
agreed by the parties
at $55,583 leaving an equity in the property at the
present time of $254,417.  
<P>

11	The plaintiff also held one of the two shares of $1.00 each in the company,
Austhold Pty Ltd.  A question regarding the value
of that was raised and
evidence was given by Mr Holebrook in which he made a valuation based upon
future maintainable earnings. 
The company had made a loss in 1996 and 1995 and
according to Mr Holebrook it made a profit in the year ended 30 June 1997 of
some
$9,000.  Applying his capitalisation basis he came up with a value of the
total company of $9,383.  However, it turns out that the
income for 1997 was
artificially increased because some $15,000 of long service leave and
redundancy entitlements to which the plaintiff
was entitled were paid into the
company's account and treated as gross income for the year ended 30 June 1997.
This was an incorrect
treatment of it and, accordingly, there is no basis for
Mr Holebrook's valuation.  
<P>

12	Mr Bentwich gave evidence of the net assets of the company at 30 June
showing that there was a net deficit of $8,161.  Accordingly
he valued each
share at $1.00.  In these circumstances this would appear to be the correct
value of the share.  Ultimately the company,
which is purely a medium for
providing the plaintiff's services is of no value to the defendant but the
plaintiff asks that in due
course the remaining share which is held by the
defendant be transferred to him.  The plaintiff also had at the date of
separation
the use of the Toyota Hiace utility which was valued in the
company's accounts at some $7,000.
<P>

13	The defendant, at the conclusion of the relationship, had her interest in
the jointly owned property which I have referred to
above, one share in the
company Austhold Pty Ltd and a Ford Falcon sedan.  There is no evidence of the
value of the Ford Falcon sedan.
 However it was one which was purchased during
the relationship using as a trade a Toyota Corono.  The Toyota Corona had also
been
purchased during the relationship.
<P>

14	As I have recounted in the chronology, shortly after the conclusion of the
relationship, the defendant transferred a deposit
of $15,000 in the joint names
of the parties to herself.  The plaintiff says that the $15,000 which she did
appropriate to herself
was used to pay off various credit cards and other debts
which she had at that stage.
<P>

15	I turn to the question of financial contributions to the property of the
parties.  The major property is the unit which was purchased
in October 1991.
The plaintiff has produced documentary evidence showing that he was the holder
of 40,000 units in what became Canberra
Consolidated Investments Pty Ltd on 30
November 1984.  He has also produced documentary evidence showing that this
increased by 3,612
units in June 1985 and that those units were redeemed on 31
January 1987 for a total sum of $56,696.  Thereafter there are a number
of term
deposits made by the parties with the National Australia Bank both individually
and in their joint names.  This documentary
evidence certainly gives substance
to the plaintiff's claim that he had funds which he said he brought to the
relationship.  
<P>

16	The defendant, as I have indicated, maintained that she had an entitlement
to some $15,000 which, once she came to Australia,
she withdrew from her
Provident Fund and used for the purposes of increasing the parties' savings and
ultimately the purchase of
the unit.  The defendant has produced no records to
substantiate the amount of her entitlement.  Letters were written late last
year
to the various Fijian authorities in order to obtain details but those
authorities have not responded.  So far as statements from
her bank are
concerned, she did enquire from her employer about past statements and found
that the banking records had been destroyed.
 However, she was aware that the
bank maintained Microfish copies of destroyed documents and she has not sought
to obtain those documents.
<P>

17	When the plaintiff made application for entry for settlement in Australia
she completed an application form.  This form had a
provision for her to insert
details of her capital and assets.  However, nothing was inserted in the space
in that form.  The defendant
says she just overlooked the matter.
<P>

18	There are a number of term deposit records which were tendered in evidence
which were produced from the records of the plaintiff.
 These deposit slips
commenced in 1988 and there were two deposits in the name of Grace M. Jackson,
one for $8,000 and one for $2,000
each for 90 days commencing 15 July 1988.
The $2,000 was rolled over on 13 October for a further 90 days  and on 11
January for a
further 90 days and on 11 April for six months.  There are no
documents for a rollover of the $8,000. On 26 November 1988 there was
a term
deposit for $10,000 in both names which seems to have been rolled over for 89
days on 24 February and 79 days on 6 March.
 
<P>

19	In August 1989, there is a term deposit for $3,000 in the names of both
parties, one in October for some $2,358 for 46 days in
the name of the
defendant.  On 24 May 1990 there was a deposit for 90 days in the sum of
$40,000 in both joint names.  This was rolled
over in August 1990 for 90 days,
on 20 November for 90 days on 18 February for 90 days and on 19 May for 90
days.  By this time it
had grown into $44,986.30.  Thereafter in June 1991
there is a deposit in the defendant's name of $2,000 on term deposit until 17
August 1991.  In August a deposit in the plaintiff's name in the sum of $29,231
and another deposit in her name in the sum of $50,000.
 There also was another
deposit of $33,500 in her name.  How these last three deposits are explained is
unknown.  They certainly
exceed any of the parties' estimate of what was then
held on deposit.
<P>

20	If one reviews this evidence one finds that there is no contemporaneous
document produced by the defendant to support her version
of the amount that
she had in the Provident Fund.  It is surprising that she did not refer to it
in her application for entry as
no doubt that would have enhanced her chances
of entry.  It may have been something that did not occur to her as being an
asset at
that time.  On the other hand the defendant certainly had sufficient
assets in 1987 to indicate that he was the source of the funds
of the various
monies on deposit which were ultimately used for the purpose of purchasing the
unit.  There is, however, the unexplained
evidence about how the funds were
placed on deposit initially in 1988 in the name of the defendant in amounts of
$8,000 and $2,000
and maintained in her name for some time.  The plaintiff has
not given a full account in his evidence of how or why the funds were
placed in
the defendant's name.  The parties' savings were also used to purchase a Toyota
Corolla for $4,000 which was traded in
as a Ford Falcon shortly thereafter
which purchase required the use of a further $2,000 from savings.  The parties
are at issue on
whose savings were used to make these payments.  The defendant
maintained it was her savings.
<P>

21	In the circumstances I am prepared to accept that $15,000 was provided by
the defendant from her Provident Fund.  In coming to
this conclusion I have
regard to not only the documentary evidence but the reliability of the two
parties.  The defendant endeavoured
to give her evidence carefully and there is
nothing which suggested to me that she was not giving it truthfully.  The
plaintiff in
the witness box was not always satisfactory.  Important matters in
this regard were:-
<P>

22	1.	He refused to accept an error in his affidavit where he stated his income
as approximately $1,500 per week.  Although this
was wrong it was certainly not
done, I would have thought, with the intention of deceiving the Court because
in the affidavit he
had clearly set out what were both parties' taxable income.
However it did indicate a stubborn inability to accept that what he had
put was
inaccurate.  
<P>

23	2.	I found him unsatisfactory in his answers to questions about household
duties.
<P>

24	3.	He was prepared to make allegations against the defendant about matters
concerning the parties' son without a proper basis.
<P>

25	On this basis the initial contributions to the unit by each of the parties
in cash I would put as to the plaintiff $42,395 and
as to the defendant $9,000.
I accept that the defendant supplied $6,000 for the two cars.  There is
evidence given by the plaintiff
of the parties' taxable income.  For the
plaintiff his taxable income over the period was some $345,000 and the
defendant's $212,000
making a total of $552,000.  Apart from one matter these
funds were employed by the parties in the repayment of the mortgage and
also
for the other joint purposes of the relationship.  The only area where they
were not so employed concerns the education of the
daughter of the plaintiff by
his marriage which predates the matters with which I am concerned.  The
defendant alleges that between
1993 and mid 1995 the plaintiff paid for his
child Zoe's education with the Church of England Ladies' College, Canberra
$2,500 per
term amounting to some $25,000.  This is denied by the plaintiff.
There is no other evidence on the matter and, accordingly, I propose
to accept
the defendant on this matter.  One should then deduct from the available income
of the defendant this sum.
<P>

26	The proportion of the incomes of the contribution of each of the parties to
their joint purposes is as to the plaintiff, 60.2
percent and the defendant
39.8 percent.
<P>

27	It would be inappropriate to credit the defendant with all the repayments on
the mortgage just because her salary was used for
this purpose.  Applying the
ratios I have referred to above to the amount by which the principal was
reduced from $120,000 down to
$65,573 at separation one finds a contribution by
way of principal to the mortgage for each of the parties as follows:-
<P>

Plaintiff  $32,765
<P>

Defendant  $21,662
<P>

28	Thus the contributions to the unit overall are:-
<P>

Plaintiff     $75,160  i.e.  71%
<P>

Defendant     $30,662  i.e.  29%
<P>

29	Each party had a financial resource which was their superannuation
entitlement.  The plaintiff's at the time of the hearing was
approximately
$18,000 and the defendant's $14,123.  These resulted from employers'
contributions only.
<P>

30		In <b>Green v Robinson</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%2096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 96</a> the Court, inter alia, dealt
with the way superannuation should be dealt with.  His Honour, the President,
at p 103 of the judgment
had the following to say in relation to
superannuation:
<P>

	"It is as erroneous to ascribe the superannuation payments to the separate and
differentiated income of the parties as it is to
ignore superannuation
altogether.  Despite equal pay legislation, and industrial decisions to the
same end, it is well known that
in Australia, female earnings are typically
lower than male earnings. Inherent in the notion that each 'owns' the
superannuation
entitlements accumulated from his or her income, in an
inescapable bias against vulnerable (usually female) members of a marriage
or
marriage-like relationship.  This is a bias which the Act, far from condoning,
forbids.  By section 3(1), the Act requires, in
relation to 'de facto partners
or either of them', that the financial resources, which must be taken into
account under section 20(1)
of the Act, are to include entitlements under a
superannuation scheme.  This is therefore something which, in the exercise of
the
section 20(1) discretion, the Court must view as belonging not to Mr
Robinson separately however he actually banks or notionally
receives the
contingent benefit, but to the financial resources of the parties which need to
be adjusted, having regard to the contributions
'made directly or indirectly'
by them.  Conformably with the language of the Act and applicable jurisprudence
which has developed
in the Family Court on analogous problems, it is my view
that Ms Green made an indirect contribution to Mr Robinson's superannuation
entitlements.  Just as he did to hers.  The only difference is that his
entitlement was more substantial.  This was because of its
longer duration and
because of his higher base income.
<P>

	I shall assume that the contributions to superannuation made before the
relationship commenced to be disregarded.  See <b>Lipman v Lipman </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2013%20FAM%20LR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 13
FAM LR 1</a>;  DFC 95-068 (SCNSW).  Both parties argued the case on this basis,
although it is not without controversy and contrary opinions exist.
 See e.g.
<b>In The Marriage of Gill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%209%20FAM%20LR%20969" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 9 FAM LR 969.</a>
<P>

	The funds must therefore be reduced pro rata for the contributions made before
1974.  I agree generally in the approach of Cole
JA to this adjustment.  But,
with respect, the error in his Honour's approach, is to require, in effect,
proof by evidence of the
direct or indirect contributions made by Ms Green to
Mr Robinson's accumulating superannuation entitlements during the relationship.
Such proof is not required in cases under the Family Law Act.  In my view, the
express mention of superannuation entitlements in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto
Relationships Act</a>, makes it plain that Parliament accepted that ordinarily,
partners to such relationships would be making at least indirect, if not
direct, contribution to the accumulation of the form of savings which
superannuation constitutes.  That, in my view, gave Ms Green,
for the period of
the relationship at least, such a stake in that aspect of the 'financial
resources' of Mr Robinson, as must be
reflected in a 'just and equitable
order', designed to adjust the interests of the partners, as section 20(1) of
the Act requires."
<P>

31		Powell J at p 110 of his judgment referred to the need to establish that
one of the parties had in some way contributed to the
other's superannuation
entitlements and that by reason of that contribution, it was "just and
equitable" that some order based upon,
or derived from, those entitlements
should be made.  Cole JA dealt with the matter at p 118 of his judgment and
inclined to the view
that there was no evidence in the case to suggest that the
appellant had made any contribution, direct or indirect, to the respondent's
present superannuation entitlement, it being a deduction from his service pay.
He held that a similar situation pertained to the
appellant's
superannuation.
<P>

32		It is not easy to reconcile the different views but it would appear from
the comments of Powell J and Cole JA that there must
be some factual matter
which enables one to form the view that there had been a contribution to a
spouse's superannuation entitlements.
 A common example of this would be a
partner who stays at home to look after children thus enabling the other
partner to go to work
and earn a superannuation entitlement.
<P>

33		In this case we are considering a situation where both the parties were
working and there is no evidence which would allow one
to come to a conclusion
that one party contributed to the other party's superannuation.  The plaintiff
had his superannuation with
a National Australia Bank scheme as did the
plaintiff.  There is no evidence of contributions to those schemes by Austhold
Pty Ltd
but I assume that this occurred.  The majority of the defendant's
superannuation would have come from her employer the National Bank.
 To the
extent that Austhold Pty Ltd made some contributions based upon her salary of
$80 per week this was in respect of services
which she performed for the
company.  In the present circumstances, therefore, it is inappropriate to make
any adjustment by having
regard to the superannuation entitlements.
<P>

34	I turn to the non-financial contributions which are at the heart of one of
the major disputes in this case.  I will first deal
with the contribution as a
homemaker.  It seems fairly clear on the evidence that the greater burden of
time with the child, Damian,
fell upon the defendant.  The plaintiff seems to
have worked during the week and also invariably worked on Saturdays.  He
commenced
work early in the morning when he usually took the child, Damian, to
his swimming training about 5 a.m.  The defendant would pick
up the child from
training and take him to school until such time during his upbringing when his
school and training venues coincided.
He would then go straight to school.  The
defendant would tend to pick up the child, Damian, after school.
<P>

35	The questions concerning the plaintiff's conduct towards the defendant and
the child, Damian, have to be considered.  The first
of these, which is not
said to be the subject of a claim for damages for assault, was the use of
offensive language by the plaintiff
throughout the period of the relationship.
According to the defendant the plaintiff used abusive and racist language
towards her
from February or March 1987 until separation in June 1997.  The
details of that language which can only be described as appalling,
is set out
in paragraph 26 of the defendant's affidavit and I do not intend to reproduce
it in this judgment.  The plaintiff denied
it except for occasions when he was
prepared to concede that he often said to the defendant, "Get off your lazy
black arse".  Apparently
to him there was nothing untoward in this
statement.
<P>

36	The specific assaults alleged are as follows:-
<P>

37	In 1987 the parties returned home from the Bondi Diggers Club where they had
had dinner with friends when the plaintiff, according
to the defendant, dragged
her out of the taxi by her hair and pulled her up the stairs to the unit.  Once
inside he smashed her on
the right hand side of her mouth which led to blood
coming from her mouth.
<P>

38	In 1993 the defendant alleges that at their home the plaintiff grabbed her
from behind, put both hands around her neck, tightened
his grip and shook her
violently. Apparently, according to the defendant, the plaintiff held her
throat from some five minutes until
she fell to the floor and blacked out.  She
went to work but did not stay there but went first to a friend's place and
ultimately
to a Lodge at Marrickville which was a women's refuge.
<P>

39	On 10 September 1996 the defendant was asleep in the unit in Damian's room
when the plaintiff entered and, according to her,
"stomped on her chest".  
<P>

40	On 18 June 1997 during an argument the defendant alleges that the plaintiff
swore at her and wrenched her handbag off her right
shoulder.  He then struck
her with the handbag and knocked her off balance.  This was the incident which
led to her leaving the relationship.
<P>

41	There was evidence from a number of independent persons who were called on
the defendant's behalf about some of these incidents
and the language used by
the plaintiff.  The plaintiff for his part denied the language to the extent I
have indicated and the assaults,
except that he concedes that in 1997 he
grabbed her handbag from the defendant.  He says he went through it to find out
what she
had been spending her money on when she said she had been shopping.
<P>

42	There is abundant evidence from independent persons, mainly employees of the
National Bank, which attest to the severe bruising
which the defendant suffered
in the 1993 incident.  It was so bad that she could not stay at work and she
was so upset that, in any
event, she could not do so.  The bruising was clearly
apparent on her dark skin.  I am satisfied that this event, which the plaintiff
in substance denies, happened as described by the defendant.  I have no doubt
that the defendant was terrified by what happened.
 In coming to this
conclusion I also note that the plaintiff in the witness box appeared to be a
person who could very easily be
angered.  He was very angry about these
proceedings although this may have been linked to the custody difficulties the
parties were
having in respect of their son, Damian.  
<P>

43	In respect of the incident in 1987 there is evidence from a couple who lived
in the same building and had been with the parties
to dinner.  Kerin Pell gave
evidence of conversations which supports the defendant's version of the story,
namely, that she was pulled
from the taxi by her hair, dragged upstairs and
taken into the unit.  Mrs Pell who did not witness the incident, but heard of
the
incident from her husband, went in next door to comfort the defendant and
found her in a terrified condition lying on a mattress
on the floor.  
<P>

44	I am also satisfied that this incident occurred as the defendant describes
it.  Generally, given the independent evidence and
the plaintiff's obvious
denial of the matters which may appear clear on other evidence, I would have
great difficulty in accepting
the plaintiff's evidence over that of the
defendant's.  Accordingly I accept the defendant's evidence in respect of the
other incidents
including an incident which occurred when Damian suffered an
injury in 1992.  According to the plaintiff that was simply because
he and
Damian, who had learnt Karate, were sparring.  The plaintiff, I might add, had
been a boxer and was quite used to fighting
or sparing.  According to the
defendant the incident occurred when Damian came home, apparently having been
to a swimming meeting
at which he recorded a bad time.  According to her the
plaintiff became very angry when he heard this news because he was obviously
closely involved in Damian's swimming and wanted him to do well.  The plaintiff
apparently hit Damian.  A social worker was called
and in the presence of the
social worker the plaintiff admitted hitting Damian and said he would not do it
again.  
<P>

45	The defendant tendered a number of medical reports from a psychiatrist which
dealt with the injuries that she  had suffered.
 In those reports Dr
Christopher Canaris concluded in a report made on 6 May 1998 that the symptoms
which she then described to him
were consistent with the diagnosis of post
traumatic stress disorder which had receded somewhat but was far from
completely resolved
following her departure from her husband.  In a report in
March 1999 he concluded that she had made a stable recovery as a consequence
of
getting away from the man who she alleges persecuted and undermined her for
many years.  He saw no need for any specific treatment
at that stage.  
<P>

46	Unfortunately the matters relied upon by the psychiatrist in coming to his
conclusion included a matter quite unrelated to the
particular assaults and bad
language with which I am concerned.  This wan an allegation of sexual abuse and
no evidence of this was
given before me.  In the circumstances I would not be
comfortable in finding that such post traumatic stress syndrome as she may
have
suffered for a short period was attributable to the assaults or language on
their own.  
<P>

47	It should be noted that a defence of Statute of Limitations has been pleaded
in respect of these assaults.  In respect of one
of them, namely, the 1987
incident, that clearly is statute barred.  
<P>

48	The question arises as to how these matters should be treated.  The
defendant's submissions on this aspect were less than clear
and it is perhaps
best that I deal with some matters of principle in relation to how they should
be viewed in the context of the
adjustment to be performed under the Act before
finally deciding the matter.  It is important, of course, that double counting
not
occur as it would be inappropriate for the matters to be taken into account
on the property adjustment and also to give a verdict
against the plaintiff for
damages in respect of these assaults.  Perhaps before leaving the actual
incidents themselves I should
record that the defendant did not seek any
treatment for her injuries.  The other matter to note is the nature of the
injuries. 
These have been described, to the extent to which there is evidence,
in the recounting above and certainly in respect of the 1993
incident the
defendant suffered extensive bruising to her neck.  There has been no claim for
special damages such as economic loss.
<P>

49	I turn to the question of what effect the assaults may have in the
adjustment process.  The defendant relied on two cases under
the <b>Family Law
Act, Doherty v Doherty </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20FLC%2092%2d652" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) FLC 92-652</a> and <b>Marando v Marando
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FamCA/1997/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FamCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20FLC%2092%2d754" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) FLC 92-754.</a>  In the first of these cases the Full Court said at page
82,683:-
<P>

	"On page 26 the trial Judge made reference to the appellant's drinking habits
and to domestic violence and aggression, which he
exhibited towards the
respondent and the children, particularly to S.  Although the trial Judge did
no more than record these events,
it is clear from his findings that the wife's
contribution as homemaker and parent may have been increased as a result
thereof.
<P>

	Although the domestic violence complained of related to a relatively small
period of time at the end of the marriage, nevertheless,
his Honour would, in
my opinion, have been entitled to have found that because of the appellant's
conduct, the respondent's contribution
diminished as a consequence, leading to
the overall weighting based upon contribution in favour of the wife being
increased, albeit
only slightly, having regard to the facts of this case."
<P>

50	Of interest is the reference to such conduct either increasing one party's
contribution or diminishing the other party's contribution.
<P>

51	In <b>Marando v Marando </b>at 84,168-9 Gee J had the following to say about
the issue of domestic violence.
<P>

	In my opinion however, the wife over the very long period of cohabitation made
a much greater contribution than the husband to
the welfare of the family,
particularly as homemaker and parent. I am satisfied on the evidence that in
her homemaker and parenting
role the wife in that role and by way of general
contribution to the family's welfare carried out responsibilities well beyond
the
norm.  She had the responsibility of the home and the children almost
entirely without the husband's assistance for a very long period
of time.
Amongst other things, she thereby enabled him to work and earn income over and
above his full time work as well as his full
time work. In this family she was
the uniting force and the one who provided the support, love and affection
necessary to maintain
this particular family unit over a long time.
<P>

	This was made especially hard by the husband's abuse and denigration of her
and the children in the ways described by them in their
evidence, which I
largely accept on this issue, as well as by his attitude to &#180;women's work'
and by his drinking which necessitated
the wife working especially hard and
harder than would be usual in normal situations as homemaker, parent and as the
prime navigator
of the welfare of this family through the many seas of problems
and difficulties which confronted them over the years.
<P>

	These are special factors of the kind to which the Full Court drew attention
in Ferraro v Ferraro <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FamCA/1992/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FamCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=16%20Fam%20LR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">16 Fam LR 1</a>, especially at pages 38, 39 and 47, that being
a decision affirmed in McLay v McLay  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=20%20Fam%20LR%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">20 Fam LR 239</a> at pages 248 to 249, and is
no doubt what Baker J had in mind when speaking for the Full Court in Doherty v
Doherty  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=20%20Fam%20LR%20137" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">20 Fam LR 137</a> at page 141. His Honour's remarks, although, in my
respectful opinion, obiter and given in an extempore judgment, are entitled to
great respect. They do not represent new law. It has been suggested in some
quarters since that judgment was delivered that they
have, but I disagree with
that suggestion.
<P>

	The remarks of Baker J in Doherty's case were simply an expression, in the
context of domestic violence, of the passages in Ferraro's
case cited above.
Neither Ferraro's case nor Doherty's case purported to overrule Soblusky (1976)
2 Fam LR 1, nor Ferguson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%204%20Fam%20LR%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 4 Fam LR 312</a>, where investigation of fault or
misconduct per se was deprecated. Any intention to overrule Ferguson was
deprecated in Ferraro's
case at page 39, and I am, with respect, unable to
accept that either Fogarty J or Baker J, who were members of the Full Court in
both Ferraro and Doherty, would have intended such decisions to be overruled
without expressly saying so.
<P>

52	In <b>Green v Robinson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%2096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 96</a> Cole J at 119 after discussing
the dictionary definitions of "homemaker" adopted the definition as "one who
creates and maintains
a comfortable and welcoming ambience for the members of
their household".  He went on to say at page 119:-
<P>

	"However, even such a second meaning is inadequate if it is intended to convey
that only one person in a household may be responsible
for the creation or
maintenance of such a welcoming ambience for it is clear, in my view, that each
party to a relationship, be it
of marriage or of a de facto relationship, may
contribute to the homemaking in which that relationship subsists. Parties to
the relationship
may, depending upon their various capacities, skills,
inclinations, interests, available time and other factors, contribute
significantly
to the making of a home. The concept of "homemaker" or "making of
a home" has a different and wider connotation than housekeeping
or maintaining
a house. It involves the creation of an emotional ambience of stability.
<P>

	To take but three examples. A person, not infrequently the male in the
relationship, may have skills related to home improvements
which are exercised
for the mutual advantage of the parties in the relationship. That is an aspect
of homemaking for it permits the
more pleasant enjoyment of the domestic
relationship. To similar effect, a person, most frequently the female in the
relationship,
may practice cooking and decorating skills which also are aspects
of homemaking for they similarly lead to a comfortable and welcoming
ambience
in the home in which the parties in the relationship live.  And each, both the
male and female partners, may bring to the
relationship aspects of stability,
and attitudes of tolerance and understanding critical to the creation of a
home. It is important
to recognise that contributions as a homemaker may be
qualitative as well as quantitative, and that a lesser quantitative but higher
qualitative contribution may be of equal or even greater importance and value
to the relationship and the partners and children than
a seemingly greater
quantitative contribution.
<P>

	The width of aspects of contribution, and in some instances the amorphous
qualities which a party may bring as his or her contribution
as a homemaker to
a relationship, highlights the difficulty of trying to quantify in precise
money terms the contribution of each
party. It lends emphasis to the need for
the Court in most instances to exercise a significant element of judicial
assessment in
determining whether it is just and equitable that a property
adjustment be made.
<P>

53	Clearly his Honour includes the qualitative aspects as well as the
quantitative.  Accordingly in the adjustment process it is
possible to take
account of these actions of the plaintiff in assessing his homemaker
contributions.  Whether it is appropriate to
do so rather than give a judgment
for assault is the next question.
<P>

54	The language used by the plaintiff was not said to cause an apprehension of
physical contact and thus would not amount to an
assault.  The defendant's
evidence did not indicate how such statements increased the difficulty of the
work she did in her capacity
as a parent and homemaker.  No doubt it caused her
distress and hurt.  In contrast in the case of assaults the time spent
recovering
would have an obvious impact on her capacity.
<P>

55	The homemaker contributions put forward by the plaintiff are the execution
of minor maintenance and repairs to the unit, managing
finances and assistance
with household chores.  The defendant gave more detail in relation to household
matters and it would seem
that her input was far greater in this area.  To the
extent that he puts forward a claim for homemaker contributions the quality
of
that contribution should be judged bearing in mind his language.  This should
not be seen as a matter of penalising the plaintiff
for his denigration of the
defendant but more an assessment of the quality of the plaintiff's
contribution.
<P>

56	In respect of the four assaults it seems to me that to the extent that the
performance of the defendant's homemaker contributions
was affected by the
assaults, that fact ought to be taken into account in her favour in assessing
them.  The time, a period of some
weeks, is of minor significance in the
overall time frame of the relationship.
<P>

57	The apprehension, contact and the injuries arising from the assault and
battery is another matter.  These are serious matters
and are no less
reprehensible because they occur within a domestic arrangement.  They should be
separately treated to show the Court's
disapproval of such matters.  This
course is adopted from time to time in the Family Court.  See <b>In the
Marriage of Kennon </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=22%20Fam%20LR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">22 Fam LR 289</a> at 296 where Coleman J, who was there
concerned with exemplary damages said:-
<P>

	"This is a case where the message must be spelled out to persons such as the
respondent that they cannot assault and beat wives
or de facto wives and escape
civil liability simply on the basis that it was `a domestic'.  I know of no
principle which renders
an assault and battery in a domestic context less
reprehensible than that in any other context."
<P>

58	These reasons, in my view, are also applicable where the claim is merely for
compensatory damages for assault and battery without
any claim for aggravated
or exemplary damages.
<P>

59	Earlier I have described the injuries, time to recover and apprehension of
the defendant.  She was forced to a women's refuge
because of that
apprehension.  There was no claim for exemplary or aggravated damages.  I fix
the damages for the assaults as follows:-
<P>

	(a) 1993               $10,000
<P>

	(b) 10 September 1996  $2,000
<P>

	(c) 18 June 1997       $3,000
<P>

60	Other areas which have to be considered are the parenting contributions.  As
I have already indicated the defendant indicated
and the plaintiff concedes
that more often the parenting fell upon the defendant.  However, it is clear
that the plaintiff became
intensely involved in Damian's swimming activities.
Before the parties split up Damian had reached a level where, as a junior
swimmer,
he was one of the top three for his age in Australia.  He was doing
very well.  Unfortunately his swimming career seems to have come
to a halt as a
result of some accidents which Damian has had since the conclusion of the
relationship.  I have no doubt there was
extensive input by the plaintiff but
whether or not it may ultimately be of great benefit is called into question by
the violence
he has demonstrated to Damian on one occasion as a result of him
having bad results at a swimming carnival.  As I have found before,
this
certainly occurred and one would have to conclude that overall the defendant's
contribution to the parenting was greater than
that of the plaintiff for the
period during which the parties were living together in a defacto relationship.
This was a period of
eleven years.
<P>

61	Another matter which should be addressed in this final adjustment process is
the submissions which were made about the significance
of initial contributions
to the property.  The defendant's submission compared s 79 of the <b>Family Law
Act</b> and s 20 of the <b>Defacto Relationships Act</b> and noted the
similarity of the two sections.  Reliance was then placed on a principle said
to have been adopted in the Family Law
cases that the initial contribution of a
party to an asset is usually eroded by the passage of time.  Reference was made
to <b>Way v Way </b>(1996) FLC 92.702.  Particular reference was made to the
adoption by the Full Court of comments made by Fogerty J in <b>Marriage of
Money </b>(1994) FLC 92.485.  His Honour said:-
<P>

	"An initial substantial contribution by one party maybe eroded to a greater or
lesser extent by the later contributions of the
other party even though those
later contributions do not necessarily at any particular point outstrip those
of the other party."
<P>

62	There has been criticism of this approach in an article by Anthony Dickie in
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=71%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">71 ALJ 423.</a>  Recently the Full Court in <b>Pearce v Pearce </b>unreported 10
June 1998 seems to be retreating from the principle.  In paragraphs 24 to 28
the Full Court dealt with the matter. 
The Court concluded the discussion in
paragraph 28 in these terms:-
<P>

	In our opinion it is not such much a matter of erosion of contribution but a
question of what weight is to be attached, in all
the circumstances, to the
initial contribution.  It is necessary to weight the initial contributions by a
party with all other relevant
contributions of both the husband and the wife.
In considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this
case
of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that
contribution.  In the present case that use was a substantial
contribution to
the purchase price of the matrimonial home.  See also <b>Campo and Campo
</b>(unreported, Full Court (Ellis, Lindenmayer and FinnJJ)), Sydney, delivered
19 May 1995 at pages 21 and 22 of the joint judgment)
and <b>Zahra and Zahra
</b>(unreported, Full Court Sydney, delivered 3 October 1996, per Ellis J at
page 10)."
<P>

63	In my view the principle is no more than a recognition of the fact that as
time passes later contributions whether they be of
a homemaker, parenting
nature or other financial contributions may well be of more significance than
the initial capital contributions.
 In this case the period of the relationship
is eleven years and the increase in the value of the unit is from $165,000 to
$310,000
over 8 years.  This is consistent with inflationary trends.  In my
view the shortness of the periods means that substantial weight
has to be given
to the fact of the initial contributions. 
<P>

64	The present net equity in the unit is $254,417 and is the only substantial
asset requiring an adjustment.  The defendant has
retained the Falcon car.  The
unit was purchased in 1991 and over the six years the equity (based on present
value) increased from
$51,395 to $254,417.  Using the percentage contribution
to the capital would see the present equity shared as to $180,636 to the
plaintiff and $73,781 to the defendant.  
<P>

65	The parenting and homemaking contributions have been discussed earlier and
strongly favour the defendant.  The plaintiff has
had the benefit of the
property but met the outgoings including mortgage repayments up until recently.
The plaintiff wants a transfer
of the unit and the share in Austhold Pty Ltd in
return for a payment to the defendant of slightly in excess of $50,000.  The
defendant
seeks an order for payment to her of 70 percent of the joint assets.
Presumably the plaintiff is to retain the Hiace truck owned
by the company and
the defendant is to retain the Falcon car.
<P>

66	In order to allow the plaintiff to retain the property and have the benefit
of his post separation payments, I think that the
appropriate adjustment is
that the defendant receive $140,000 by way of adjustment.  The defendant is to
have a verdict for the assaults
in the sum of $15,000.  The parties can bring
in short minutes and argue costs.
<P>
