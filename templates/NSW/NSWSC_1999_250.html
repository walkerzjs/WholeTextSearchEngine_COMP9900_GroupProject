<b>2893/97	IVAN UNGAR v HADDONSTONE PTY LTD (In Administration)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	Short minutes of order have been brought in this morning to complete these
proceedings pursuant to the judgment that I delivered
on 22 December 1998.
There is no controversy about the form of the order I propose to make as to the
substance of the proceedings.
<P>

2	In respect of costs, Roderick Mackay Sutherland, the administrator, was
joined as an additional defendant at the trial for the
purpose of an
application that he personally pay the costs of the proceedings, and that
application was pursued today upon the basis
of criticisms made by me of Mr
Sutherland's conduct in the reasons for judgment that I delivered on 22
December 1998.
<P>

3	I have come to the conclusion that Mr Sutherland's conduct was not such as
ought lead me to order him to pay any of the costs
personally.  It is true that
I quite distinctly criticised his conduct and I was and am of the view that
that conduct was incorrect
in the circumstances.  However, it was a situation
in which in carrying out his duties he fell into error.  However, I am not of
the view that the conduct was such as to require, or justify, a making of an
order for costs against him personally.  It was a case
where the process went
wrong.
<P>

4	The other matter of controversy that has been agitated concerning costs is
that the plaintiff was offered the result that it in
fact obtained by the
judgment in an open letter sent by facsimile transmission on 17 October 1997,
which offer remained open until
5pm on Thursday, 23 October 1997.  Criticism
has also been made on behalf of the defendants of the plaintiff's course of
conduct
prior to that time in making various claims that it did; those claims
did not include at any time the result in fact procured.  The
plaintiff, on the
other hand, criticised the administrator's and company's conduct in proceeding
to make this offer to one creditor
to vary the regime relating to its claim
behind the backs of other creditors.  As to the latter criticism, I do not
concur in the
proposition that there was anything wrong with the
administrator's or the company's conduct in this regard.  So far as I am
concerned,
all they did was simply to make a sensible offer of compromise, so
sensible as it turns out, that it exactly coincided with the result
of the
proceedings.  Equally, as to the first criticism of the plaintiff, whatever the
plaintiff was claiming, the defendants had
not made an offer of this magnitude
prior to 17 October 1997.  It seems to me that the plaintiff ought have its
costs up to a week
after the making of that offer, although thereafter the
company ought have its costs of the proceedings.
<P>

5	I propose to make a costs order along those lines, and also to order the
plaintiff to pay Mr Sutherland's costs of the unsuccessful
costs application
that it has made against him.  I make the orders contained in the draft short
minutes of order initialled by me
and placed with the papers.
