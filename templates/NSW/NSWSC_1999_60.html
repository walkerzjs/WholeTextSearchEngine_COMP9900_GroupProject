JUDGMENT: 
<P>

- 21 -
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By a notice of motion filed on 12 February 1999 the
plaintiff, Susan Elizabeth Vial, seeks substantively an order that the
plaintiff
have summary judgment pursuant to Part 13 rule 2 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  In addition, the plaintiff by that notice of motion
seeks, in the
alternative, that the plaintiff have judgment by admission pursuant to Part 18
rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules, and,
further, an order that the cross-claim
of the defendant, Antonio Stefano Cossa, be struck out pursuant to Part 15 rule
26 of the
Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

2	The substantive proceedings were instituted by summons filed by the plaintiff
on 13 December 1991.  That summons seeks relief
in respect to a deed made
between the parties on 6 December 1990.  The principal item of relief sought in
the summons is an order
that the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of
$364,000, pursuant to clause 2 of the deed.
<P>

3	The defendant on 21 March 1997 filed a document entitled "cross claim".
Somewhat curiously (since the proceedings were instituted
by a summons, which
sought merely relief) the cross claim was in the form of a pleading. It pleads
certain facts and in addition
seeks relief.  
<P>

4	The facts which the cross claim pleads include, in paragraph 1, the making of
the agreement (which was the deed to which I have
already referred), and, in
paragraph 2 various terms and conditions of that deed, including the provision
of clause 2 thereof, that
the defendant would pay to the plaintiff the sum of
$400,000 by weekly instalments of $1000, commencing from the date of the
agreement
until the said amount was paid.
<P>

5	It would appear that the parties were in a de facto relationship in the 1980s
and that upon the termination of that relationship
the present defendant,
Antonio Stefano Cossa, instituted proceedings against the present plaintiff,
Susan Elizabeth Vial, being proceedings
5766 of 1990 in th Equity Division,
whereby orders were sought adjusting the interests of the parties in property
pursuant to the
provisions of the <i>De Facto Relationships Act </i>1984.
<P>

6	Orders were made in those proceedings on 6 December 1990.  To those orders
was annexed the deed to which I have already referred.
<P>

7	For a period after the date of that deed the defendant paid to the plaintiff
sums of $1000 a week. It would appear that there
were then negotiations and
discussions between the parties and, so it is asserted on behalf of the present
defendant, there was an
agreement between himself and the plaintiff that he
should pay to the plaintiff, and that she should accept in fulfilment of the
terms of the deed, not $1000 a week but $700 a week. That assertion is disputed
by the plaintiff.  Nevertheless the defendant for
a period paid to the
plaintiff the sum of $700 a week. The defendant has not paid to the plaintiff
that sum or any other sum since
28 June 1996.
<P>

8	I have already recorded that the principal claim of the plaintiff sought in
the notice of motion which is presently before me
is a claim for summary
judgment pursuant to the provisions of Part 13 rule 2 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  
<P>

9	Sub-rule (1) of that rule provides:
<P>

	Where, on application by the plaintiff in relation to any claim for relief or
any part of any claim for relief of the plaintiff

<P>

	(a) there is evidence of the facts on which the claim or part is based; and
<P>

	(b) there is evidence given by the plaintiff or by some responsible person
that, in the belief of the person giving the evidence,
the defendant has no
defence to the claim or part, or no defence except as to the amount of any
damages claimed, 
<P>

	(c) the Court may, by order, on terms, give such judgment for the plaintiff on
that claim or part as the nature of the case requires.
<P>

10	The principles upon which such summary judgment may be given are well
recognised.  The Court will not make such an order for
summary judgment where
there is a real question to be tried.  It is for the plaintiff to establish
that the present is a case which
entitles it to have the Court make an order
for such summary judgment.
<P>

11		The plaintiff seeks to rely upon the specific provisions of the deed which
entitled the plaintiff to payment of $400,000 by
the defendant.   The plaintiff
by her evidence says in her affidavit of 25 November 1996 that to that date the
defendant had paid
the sum of $252,100, leaving a balance outstanding of
$147,900.  In her affidavit of 12 March 1998 the plaintiff altered that amount
slightly, by saying that since the date of the deed the defendant had paid to
her a total of $252,150 and that the amount outstanding
was the balance between
that figure and the $400,000, --- that is, an amount of $147,850.  
<P>

12	The plaintiff in that affidavit, by paragraph 4, fulfilled the essential
requirement of paragraph (b) of subrule (1) of Part
13 rule 2 by saying, "I
believe that the defendant owes me the said amount of $147,850 under the deed
and has no defence to the whole
or any part of my claim for those moneys".
<P>

13	The plaintiff by that affidavit (in paragraph 5) puts in issue the assertion
of the defendant in his affidavit evidence that
the plaintiff had said to him
words to the effect, "I will not insist on strict enforcement of my rights
under the deed".
<P>

14	The defendant by the cross claim in the form in which it has been prepared
and filed admits the execution of the deed and admits
that certain payments
were made under that deed. The evidence of the defendant sets forth details of
the payments asserted to have
been made under the deed. That evidence discloses
that no payments have been made since 28 June 1996.  I note that there appears
to be a discrepancy between the evidence of the plaintiff as to the total
amount paid to her by the defendant, which she says was
$252,150, and the
evidence of the defendant, who says that the total amount was $303,800.
<P>

15	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, there being a deed between
the parties, the plaintiff is entitled to enforce
her legal rights under that
deed and to receive payment of the total sum of $400,000, that since some of
the amounts have already
been paid, credit should be given to the defendant for
those amounts and that the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment for the
outstanding balance.
<P>

16	The cross claim which has been filed asserts essentially that by reason of
the conduct of the parties, which is particularised
in that cross claim, the
parties have by their conduct revoked the agreement, or, alternatively,
consented to the revocation of the
agreement; further by the cross claim it is
asserted that the agreement has ceased to have effect.
<P>

17	I would here note that the cross claim speaks of the agreement; the summons
speaks of the deed. The document is in fact a deed,
although by its terms it is
recognised to be a separation agreement under the provisions of Part 4 of the
<i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>.  I shall refer to it as "the deed".
<P>

18	Whilst it was the submission of the defendant, a submission consistent with
the assertions to which I have just referred, made
in the cross claim, that the
deed has been revoked or has ceased to have effect, the argument of the
defendant could be more precisely
stated by saying not that the deed has been
revoked, but rather that in, consequence of the conduct of the parties, either
there
has been a binding and legally recognisable agreement that the plaintiff
would not seek to enforce the terms of the deed or that
the plaintiff is by
some principle of law precluded from enforcing its terms.
<P>

19	Since the cause of action relied upon by the plaintiff in the present
proceedings is a cause of action arising out of a deed,
the rights of the
parties under that deed, including the plaintiff's present cause of action can
be released or varied only by a
further deed between the parties.  
<P>

20	In <i>Commissioner of Stamp Duties v. Bone </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/UKPCHCA/1976/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] UKPCHCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20135%20CLR%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 135 CLR 223</a><i>,</i><b>
</b> a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upon appeal from
the High Court of Australia, Lord Russell of Killowen
in giving the decision of
their Lordships said, at 229:
<P>

	A debt can only be truly released and extinguished by agreement for valuable
consideration or under seal.
<P>

21	That passage was cited  by the High Court of Australia in <i>Federal
Commissioner of Taxation v. Orica Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20154%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 154 ALR 1</a> in the joint
judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ at 33.
<P>

22	In equity however and even in the absence of a further deed, an agreement
for valuable consideration to release or vary a contract
under seal would be
enforced (see <i>Federal Commission of Taxation v. Orica Limited</i>).
<P>

23	In the instant case there is evidence of negotiation which took place
between the parties. The defendant asserts that there was
more than
negotiation, that there was in fact a binding agreement between the parties.

<P>

24	In an application for summary judgment the Court must not proceed to give
summary judgment where there is a real question to
be tried.  It seems to me
however that even if one accepts the assertion of the defendant, an assertion
which is denied by the plaintiff,
that there was an agreement between the
parties that the plaintiff would accept $700 a week instead of $1000 a week, as
provided
in the terms of the deed, nevertheless even the existence of such an
agreement between the parties does not of itself preclude the
plaintiff now
from enforcing her rights under the deed. That is because for the past two and
a half years the defendant has not abided
by the terms of the agreement which
he says came into force and bound the parties in variation of the deed.
<P>

25	The payment of a lesser amount is not sufficient consideration for the
variation of a deed.  (see <i>Foakes v. Beer </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1884/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1884] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%209%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 9 AC 605</a>, a decision of
the House of Lords). In <i>Musimeci v. Windadell Pty Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34
NSWLR 723</a> Santow J at 739 referred to the part payment of a debt and said:
<P>

	This proposition pre-dates any doctrine of consideration and provides that
part payment of a debt or the promise thereof does not
afford consideration:
<i>Pinell's case </i><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1572/290.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1572] EngR 290</a>; (1602) 5 Co Rep 177a;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=77%20ER%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">77 ER 237</a> (already accepted as early
as 1455, Anon YB 33 Henry VI (47 pl 32). That proposition received the approval
of the House of Lords
in <i>Foakes v. Beer </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1884/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1884] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%209%20AC%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 9 App Cas 605</a> and has not
been over-ruled.
<P>

26	The fact that the plaintiff accepted a lesser amount does not discharge the
liability of the defendant under the deed.  If it
can be established that there
was an agreement, albeit not under seal, between the parties that the plaintiff
would accept $700 a
week instead of $1000 a week, then the plaintiff was
precluded from enforcing her rights under the deed whilst the defendant
continued
to pay the $700 a week. He has not done so since 28 June 1996.
Accordingly, even accepting the evidence of the defendant as the terms
of such
an agreement, the plaintiff cannot thereby be precluded now from enforcing her
rights under the deed.
<P>

27	The defendant further submits that the terms of the deed are such that the
Court should not in any event allow the plaintiff
to rely upon it.  He submits
firstly that it is harsh and unconscionable.  But the defendant does not,
either in the cross claim
or in his evidence, assert any equity which would
generate a right to prevent enforcement by the plaintiff on the basis of mere
harshness
or alleged unconscionability.  The only fact which appears to be
relied upon by the defendant in support of this assertion that the
terms of the
deed were harsh and unconscionable is the fact that a piece of real property
the sale of which was contemplated by the
deed and for which a reserve price of
$600,000 was nominated, in fact realised only $474,000.  
<P>

28	It does not seem to me that that fact could possibly result in the deed
being regarded as harsh and unconscionable. At the time
when the deed was
entered into both parties expected that a price of $600,000 would be achieved.
That the ultimate sale price was
considerably less than that amount does not in
my view affect a determination of whether or not the deed when it was executed
by
the parties contained terms which were harsh and unconscionable.  It was
commercial reality and the condition of the real estate
market which resulted
in the proceeds of the sale of that property being considerably less when it
was eventually sold than the parties
had at some earlier time expected them to
be.
<P>

29	In any event, even if somehow or other it could be argued that the
considerable diminution in the proceeds of sale constituted
something which was
unfair to the defendant, nevertheless that does not of itself have the
consequence argued for on behalf of the
defendant, that the plaintiff should be
deprived of her legal right to enforce the terms of the deed and to bring this
present claim
for the moneys owing to her under that deed.
<P>

30	As I have already observed, no equity is asserted in the cross claim and
there is no evidence to support the existence of such
an equity which would
generate a right of the nature presently said by the defendant to prevent
enforcement of the plaintiff's rights
under the deed.
<P>

31	In this regard also the defendant has referred to the provisions of Part 4
of the <i>De Facto Relationships Act </i>and in particular to the provisions of
section 46 and of section 50 of that Act.
<P>

32	Section 46 provides:
<P>

	Except as otherwise provided by this Part, a cohabitation agreement or
separation agreement shall be subject to and enforceable
in accordance with the
law of contract, including, without limiting the generality of this section,
the <i>Contracts Review Act</i>, 1980.
<P>

33	Section 50 provides:
<P>

	Without limiting or derogating from the provisions of section 46, on an
application by a de facto partner for an order under Part
III a court is not
required to give effect to the terms of any cohabitation agreement or
separation agreement entered into by that
partner where the court is of the
opinion ---
<P>

		(a) that the de facto partners have, by their words or conduct, revoked or
consented to the revocation of the agreement; or
<P>

		(b) that the agreement has otherwise ceased to have effect
<P>

34	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that section 50 of the
<i>De Facto Relationships Act </i>has operation in the circumstances of the
present proceedings and, in particular, in the circumstances of the present
application
by the plaintiff for summary judgment.  
<P>

35	I am of the view that that submission is misconceived and is incorrect.  The
present proceedings relevantly are proceedings for
the payment of money under
the terms of a deed.  They are not proceedings which fall within the
description contained in section
50 of "an application by a de facto partner
for an order under Part 3". There were such proceedings between the present
parties,
being proceedings number 5766 of 1990, in which Mr Cossa was the
plaintiff and Miss Vial was the defendant.  The present proceedings
are
proceedings 6224 of 1991, in which Miss Vial is the plaintiff and Mr Cossa is
the defendant.The present proceedings are proceedings
for the enforcement of
the deed between the parties.
<P>

36	The final ground upon which the defendant submits that the plaintiff should
not be entitled to rely upon the rights given to
her under the deed and should
not be entitled to enforce the deed in accordance with its terms, is the ground
of estoppel. It is
submitted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff is
estopped from relying upon her legal rights arising under the deed.  The
Full
Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in <i>Mortgage Acceptance
Nominees Limited v. Australia Thoroughbred Finance Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2069%20SASR%20302" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 69 SASR
302</a> had occasion to consider the principles relating to estoppel. That court
was constituted by Doyle CJ and Bollen and Lander JJ.  At
305 Doyle CJ said:
<P>

	"First, as should be obvious, the principle which underlies promissory
estoppel is not one which is directed to the enforcement
of voluntary
promises."
<P>

37	In the circumstances of the instant case, it will be appreciated that if
there was a mere acquiescence or voluntary promise by
the plaintiff to accept a
lesser amount than $1000 a week, the principle of promissory estoppel would not
apply. But I have already
observed that, since in an application for summary
judgment the Court should not attempt to resolve any disputed questions of
fact,
and since the defendant asserts that there was a binding agreement
between the parties that the plaintiff would accept $700 a week
rather than
$1000 a week, it is appropriate that, for the purposes of the present
application, I should accept that the parties had
entered into such an
agreement.
<P>

38	Accordingly, until 28 June 1996 the plaintiff would have been estopped from
enforcing her legal rights under the deed.  However,
because the defendant has
chosen since that date not to make any payments, the plaintiff is no longer
estopped from enforcing her
rights.
<P>

39	In addition, in <i>Mortgage Acceptance Nominees Limited </i>Doyle CJ said,
at 306:
<P>

	The second relevant point which emerges is that the detriment which is
identified as a basis for the estoppel must be a detriment
which results from
the person asserting and relying upon the estoppel having acted upon the
promises or representations from which
the estopped party is ultimately not
permitted to depart.
<P>

40	There is no evidence --- indeed there is no such assertion contained in the
cross claim --- that the defendant has acted in such
a way, in reliance upon
the alleged agreement to which I have referred, that he has suffered
detriment.
<P>

41	Further, it is also relevant that, in any event, a person who is alleged to
be the representor in a relationship giving rise
to promissory estoppel may (to
use the word appearing in the authorities) resile from a promissory estoppel on
giving a sufficient
notice.  See <i>Ayodeji v. Biscoe </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%203%20All%20ER%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 3 All ER 556</a>,
where Lord Hodson said at 559:
<P>

	This equity is, however, subject to the qualification (a) that the other party
has altered his position, (b) that the promisor
can resile from his promise on
giving reasonable notice, which need not be a formal notice, giving the
promisee a reasonable opportunity
of resuming his position, (c) the promise
only becomes final and irrevocable if the promisee cannot resume his
position.
<P>

42	In the circumstances of the instant case the correspondence between the
solicitors for the parties and the institution of the
present proceedings
clearly constituted notice by the plaintiff to the defendant that she was no
longer relying on any agreement
between the parties that she would accept a
lesser sum for the sum of $1000 as set forth in the deed.
<P>

43	Further, as I have already observed, there is no evidence to suggest that
the defendant in reliance upon the continued acceptance
by the plaintiff of the
lesser sum for the greater sum altered his position in any way, let alone to
his detriment.
<P>

44	Further, as I have already observed, the defendant for the past two and a
half years has not chosen to abide by the agreement
which he asserts has given
rise to the estoppel precluding the plaintiff from enforcing her legal
rights.
<P>

45	It has been suggested that the loss of the use of the motor car which was
the subject of agreement and subsequent negotiations
between the parties has
constituted some detriment to the defendant.  I am not satisfied that that is
so, and I certainly am not
satisfied that the defendant altered his position to
his detriment in reliance upon the negotiations or upon any final agreement
between the parties.
<P>

46	I have been taken to the further decision of the Supreme Court of South
Australia in <i>Je Maintiendrai Pty Ltd v. Quaglia </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2026%20SASR%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 26 SASR 101</a>, in
which the principle of promissory estoppel was considered by the Full Court of
the Supreme Court of South Australia.  The facts
in that case are somewhat
different from the facts in the instant case, since that case concerned an
alleged reduction in rental
for an indefinite period and where the lessor,
after accepting the reduced rent for eighteen months, then claimed payment of
the
arrears of the full rent.
<P>

47	In the instant case I do not understand the defendant at the time of the
negotiations with the plaintiff or at any other time
to have been asserting
that he was liable to pay to the plaintiff any amount less than the $400,000
specified in the deed.  There
is no suggestion in the instant case that the
plaintiff is attempting to obtain payment of any greater sum than the $400,000.

<P>

48	The grounds upon which the defendant argues that the plaintiff is deprived
of the right to enforce the terms of the deed are
not that the defendant should
pay some amount less than the $400,000 but that, because of negotiations
relating to the size of the
instalments to be paid and other negotiations
relating to the motor vehicle and its use, the plaintiff is estopped from
enforcing
the deed.  But I have already emphasised that, whilst I would agree
with that submission if the defendant had complied with the terms
of the
agreement which he himself sets up in the evidence, he has signally failed to
comply with those terms.
<P>

49	In all the circumstances therefore I am satisfied that there is no real
issue to be tried in this matter, that there is no legal
ground upon which the
plaintiff should be deprived of enforcing her rights under the deed, and that
the plaintiff is entitled to
summary judgment for the difference between the
amount already paid by the defendant and the amount of $400,000.
<P>

50	Since there appears to be a dispute in the evidence as to the precise
amount, I will at this stage direct entry of summary judgment
for the plaintiff
in the amount which she asserts in her affidavit and which is the amount sought
or almost the amount sought in
the notice of motion. But I will reserve to the
defendant liberty to apply for variation of that amount within a specified
period.
 I would expect that the parties would be able to do some calculation
as to how much has actually been paid.
<P>

51	I will also make an order of the nature sought in the notice of motion
dismissing the cross claim of the defendant.  It will
be unnecessary for me to
grant the relief sought in the alternative paragraph 2 of the notice of motion,
that the plaintiff have
judgment by admission pursuant to Part 18 rule 3.
<P>

52	AITKEN:  I ask for costs and I also ask that interest be paid on the amount
that is ultimately found to be owing, at the Supreme
Court rate, from 30 June
1996 and I ask for that on the basis that from that period of time on we have
been kept out of our money.
<P>

53	OTTESEN:  There is no provision under the deed for interest to be paid.
<P>

54	<b>MASTER</b>:  But if your client had abided by what he claims was the
agreement between the parties this matter would never have arisen.
<P>

55	I make the following orders:
<P>

	(1)	I direct that on or after 22 February 1999 judgment be entered for the
plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $147,850
together with interest
upon such sum from 28 June 1996 at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

	(2)	I reserve to the defendant liberty to apply to me on twenty-four hours'
notice on or before 19 February 1999 for an order varying
the sum of $147,850
referred to in order (1) hereof.
<P>

	(3)	I order that the cross claim filed by the defendant on 21 March 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

(4) 	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of the notice of
motion filed by then plaintiff on 12 February 1999
and of the proceedings.
<P>
