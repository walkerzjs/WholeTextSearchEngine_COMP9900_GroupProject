<b><u>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT - On admissibility of MFI 15; see page
1373</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  It is necessary for me to rule upon the
admissibility in the defendants' case of the document marked for identification
15.  This
is a letter on the letterhead of the Australian Chinese Newspapers
Pty Limited.  It is under the hand of James Mok, advertising manager.
 It is
dated 26 June 1995 and is addressed to Mr Adam Baxter, Manager, Multi-Cultural
Affairs, Telecom Australia, Melbourne.  It
is a short letter and it is
convenient to set it out here:
<P>

"Dear Mr Baxter,
<P>

We write to express our concern that we have been required to pay a commission
of 20% to your Agent, Ethnic Communications, in order
to receive Telecom
advertising in our Newspaper.  This commission we have paid reluctantly but the
position has now arisen where
they are calling for increased commissions to be
paid which we can ill afford.
<P>

We do not wish to lose Telecom advertising but consider this matter to be most
intimidating and call upon your assistance.
<P>

Yours sincerely
<P>

James Mok, 
<P>

Advertising Manager.
<P>

c.c. Mr Colin Harvey."
<P>

2  	When dealing with questions of validity of particulars of truth
on 5 February 1998, David Levine J approved a particular, broadly
in the terms
that the Chinese Daily Newspaper Advertising Manager was intimidated by ETCOM
in relation to Telecom advertising in
that newspaper.  The letter was
discovered, as part of the discovery process, by the solicitors for the
plaintiffs.  How the document
came into their possession it is not known.  It
was first referred to in the evidence in this case on 9 November 1999 during
the
course of cross-examination by Mr Littlemore for the defendants of Mr
Assaf.  A number of questions were put to the witness in relation
to this
letter, starting at transcript 444.  It is fair to say that each of the
questions was the subject of objection by Mr Hughes
for the plaintiffs, but
rulings by me allowed the following evidence, at transcript p445:
<P>

"Q.	You knew the Australian Chinese Daily complained to Telstra that you were
demanding 20 per cent on Telstra advertising which
they could not afford?
<P>

A.	I knew the Australian Chinese Daily wrote to Telstra and asked for what
Telstra asked them (sic).
<P>

Q.	You knew they considered your attitude to be intimidatory, didn't you?
<P>

A.	No, I didn't know that.  I know they wrote to Telstra and told them what
they considered.
<P>

Q.	Have you seen the letter?
<P>

A.	I have seen the letter."
<P>

3  	There was further objection.  Mr Littlemore called for the letter
in question and sought access to it.  It was produced by Mr
Hughes and access
was granted.  The document was marked for identification 15.  Mr Littlemore
said (at transcript 446) by way of
a question:
<P>

"Q.	I show you both documents (mfi 15 and copy thereof).  You told the jury
that the Chinese Daily did not complain that they found
your conduct
intimidating, didn't you?  You did say that, didn't you?
<P>

A.	I still say because I know what came after when the client wrote to the
Chinese Daily and they confessed they did it without
any knowledge of any
intimidation."
<P>

4  	Mr Littlemore asked the witness to look at the letter. Mr Hughes
objected and submitted it was inadmissible.  I allowed the
witness to be shown
the letter.  Mr Littlemore said (at transcript 447):
<P>

"Q.	Please read it out?
<P>

A. 	`We don't wish to lose Telecom advertising but consider this matter to be
most intimidatory and call upon your assistance'.
<P>

Q.	I put it to you that the conduct of which the Australian Chinese Daily
complained was typical of your conduct towards the ethnic
newspapers that would
not agree to your rate for the Aged Pension News in 1992."
<P>

5  	That question was withdrawn and the following question was
put:
<P>

"Q.	I put it to you a complaint was made by the Australian Chinese Daily and
was a truthful one.  What do you say?
<P>

A.	It was not truthful.
<P>

Q.	I put it to you they were in fact intimidated by your conduct as they said
in the letter?
<P>

A.	They said they were not."
<P>

6  	I then asked the witness would he answer "yes" or "no".  There
must have been some statement to attract my intervention which
is not recorded
on the transcript.  In any event, the witness said, "No, it was not
intimidating."
<P>

7  	There the matter remained until the close of the oral evidence
when Mr Littlemore, sought to tender the letter, mfi 15, submitting
that it
fell within the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</u> 1995</a>, which deals with
exception to the hearsay rule enshrined in business records that comply with
the terms of the section.  I have
no difficulty accepting the submission that,
prima facie, the document on its face constitutes a business record.  However,
I do
have difficulties with subs (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a>, which  provides that:
<P>

"The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the
representation) if the representation was made:
<P>

(a)	by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal
knowledge of the asserted fact, or
<P>

(b)	on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who
had or might reasonably be supposed to have had
personal knowledge of the
asserted fact."
<P>

8  	The crucial "asserted fact" here is to be found in the final
paragraph of the letter:
<P>

"We do not wish to lose Telecom advertising but consider this matter to be most
intimidating and call upon your assistance."
<P>

9  	It is significant that the personal pronoun "we" is used
throughout this letter, which, I reiterate, was signed by the advertising
manager.  No doubt he had authority so far as advertising within the newspaper
was concerned, subject to directions from superior
officers, whoever they might
be, and certainly the Board.
<P>

10  	For the purposes of subs(2), it cannot in my view be overlooked
that this letter purports on the face of it, one might reasonably
accept, to be
written on behalf of the company, as distinct solely from expressing the view
of Mr Mok or containing the representation
of Mr Mok.  Bearing in mind its
importance, I would not be prepared to construe it for present purposes, so
that the question of
admissibility need only be resolved by reference to the
letter being a view of, or a representation by Mr Mok.  Whether or not he
had
authority to speak on behalf of others is not known, other than what is
contained in the letter itself, and I would not be prepared
in the light of the
evidence relating to the letter to draw that inference.
<P>

11  	I have very grave doubts, therefore, whether the letter falls
within the terms of subs (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a>, so as to exclude the operation of the
hearsay rule.  However, there is another extremely significant aspect to this,
and that is
that no evidence has been put before the jury as to the
availability or non-availability of the author of this letter, Mr Mok.  One
must bear in mind that this letter is relied upon as part of the defence of
justification to the "bullying" imputation.  It must,
therefore, go to the
question of whether the defendants have established that that imputation is
substantially true.
<P>

12  	The fact that Mr Mok was not called and no evidence is before
the jury as to why he was not called means that the plaintiffs
are in the
position that if this letter goes before the jury as evidence of the truth,
they cannot evaluate the reliability of the
evidence, insofar as it is evidence
of the truth, except by reference to Mr Assaf's denials.
<P>

13  	It was submitted by Mr Littlemore that the defendants are
entitled to rely upon the wording of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a>, and that this
letter falls within the provisions of subs (2).  That leaves the plaintiffs in
the position, he submitted, that if
they wish to  challenge the correctness of
the letter then the obligation is upon them to call Mr Mok, or, presumably, to
lead evidence
as to why he could not be called.  
<P>

14  	I find it extraordinarily difficult to accept that the
revolutionary provisions in the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u>, so far as hearsay evidence
is concerned, were ever intended to result in a situation such as that.  If Mr
Mok were called by the
plaintiffs he could be cross-examined by counsel for the
defendants on this particular letter.
<P>

15  	It seems to me, from my reading of the Report and various cases
since the Act was enacted that one reason for the inclusion
in the Act of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a>
and other discretionary and mandatory provisions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.11" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3.11</a> is to provide
courts with the remedy of being able to mitigate the effects of provisions such
as the hearsay provisions which have
found their way into the Act.  I
acknowledge absolutely, as Mr Littlemore has put to me, that the phrase
"unfairly prejudicial" in
paragraph (a) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135</a> means evidence which is
unfairly prejudicial in the sense that it means more than evidence which is
prejudicial in the sense that
it is evidence adverse to a party.  It must
demonstrate actual prejudice to the party which could operate, despite the
general rules
of evidence in the provisions in the Act, in a distinctly
prejudicial way to a party.
<P>

16  	For the reasons which I have briefly outlined, if this letter in
the present state of the evidence were to go before the jury,
even allowing for
the fact that it is already before them by way of the cross-examination of Mr
Assaf, it could unquestionably, in
my view, operate to the prejudice of the
plaintiffs.  The jury would have the letter before them with no countervailing
evidence
other than the denials by Mr Assaf in cross-examination.
<P>

17  	In summary, therefore, I am of the view, for the reasons set
out, that the letter, by reason of its tending on the face of
it to speak on
behalf of the company as a whole which would embrace presumably or possibly the
Board as well as superior officers
to the Advertising Manager, does not fall
within the terms of subs(2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69.</a> However, if I am wrong in that view and the
letter does correctly fall within the provisions of subs(2), I am firmly of the
view
that the situation falls within the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135(a)</a> of the Act, and would
reject it on that discretionary basis.
<P>

18  	Accordingly MFI 15 is rejected.
