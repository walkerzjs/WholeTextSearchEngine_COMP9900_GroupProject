<b><u>020524/94  -  EDWARD PALMER  v  FRANK BELAN &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>020115/95  -  DENIS BONER  v FRANK BELAN &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

<b>	The Litigation</b>
<P>

1	Three actions for Defamation were commenced as the result of the publication
of a letter (Ex B), and a leaflet (Ex C) in the course
of a union election.
The union was the National Union of Workers, and the publication was said to
have taken place in July 1994.
<P>

2	The three actions were heard together, without a jury.  The parties to the
actions were as follows:
<P>

&#183;	Edward Palmer v Frank Belan
<P>

&#183;	Edward Palmer v Frank Belan and Arthur Benjamin Casey
<P>

&#183;	Denis Boner v Frank Belan and Arthur Benjamin Casey
<P>

3	The first action is concerned with the letter signed by Mr Belan (Ex B).  The
second and third actions are concerned with a leaflet
which accompanied that
letter (Ex C).
<P>

4	Mr Edward Palmer was, at one time, the Secretary of the Federated Millers and
Manufacturing Grocers Employees' Association of
Australasia, New South Wales
Branch ("the Millers' Union").  Mr Denis Boner was the Assistant Secretary of
the same union.  In 1992,
in circumstances which will shortly be described, the
Millers' Union amalgamated with a number of other unions to form the National
Union of Workers.  A party to the amalgamation, and the most significant union
in the proposed conglomerate, was the Federated Storemen
and Packers' Union of
Australia, New South Wales Branch ("the Storemen and Packers' Union").  Mr
Frank Belan was the State Secretary
of that union.  Upon amalgamation he became
the State Secretary of the amalgamated union, the National Union of Workers.
<P>

5	The National Union of Workers was divided into Divisions, one being known as
the Food 1 Division.  Former members of the Millers'
Union became members of
the Food 1 Division.  Upon amalgamation, Mr Palmer was made the Secretary of
that Division.  Mr Boner, his
former assistant, was made an Organiser.
<P>

6	The National Union of Workers held an election in August 1994, as required by
the Rules.  Mr Belan stood for the office of State
Secretary.  He organised a
ticket, known as "The Frank Belan Team".  Neither Mr Palmer, nor Mr Boner (for
reasons which will be explained),
was a member of that team.  Mr Casey (the
second defendant) was, however, part of the team.  He stood in opposition to Mr
Palmer
for the office of Secretary of the Food 1 Division.  Mr Boner was a
candidate in the same election.  He sought the office of organiser.
 The Frank
Belan Team included alternative candidates for that position.
<P>

	<b>Background</b>
<P>

7	Before examining the publications which are the subject of these actions, it
is convenient to set out the background, and to resolve
a number of factual
issues which arise in the context of certain defences.  I am, of course,
conscious that the onus in respect of
some matters is upon the plaintiff, and,
in respect of others, upon the defendants.  Most of the facts, however, were
not in doubt.
 Where, during the hearing, significant controversy attached to a
particular matter, I will identify that controversy, and, where
relevant to its
resolution, refer to the onus of proof.
<P>

8	Discussions concerning amalgamation began in 1990.  Mr Palmer, in 1993,
provided an account of these discussions to the Industrial
Court of New South
Wales (Hill J).  I will later describe the circumstances giving rise to that
case.  Mr Palmer's evidence included
the following:  (T 99/100)
<P>

	"Q.	Was there specific discussion that you can recall in relation to sick pay
or annual leave in relation to the Millers' liabilities?
<P>

	A.	Yes, Frank told me that he didn't want them, and we were to get rid of them
and that he would only accept four weeks annual
leave when we entered or moved
over to his building at 1 Bridge Street."
<P>

9	In September 1990, the Executive of the Millers' Union approved, in
principle, an association with the Storemen and Packers' Union,
pending
amalgamation.  The Minutes of the Executive Meeting for 31 October 1990
included the following:  (Ex D, p 415)
<P>

	"The Secretary fully explained how he and the executive saw the future of the
union, and what steps we should now start to take
to secure the future.  Which
would include not only forming an association with the NUW, but also the fact
we would have to clear
our liabilities (financial) which would mean the
disposal of our building. ..."
<P>

10	Authority was given to Mr Palmer to take the steps necessary to bring about
the amalgamation.
<P>

11	The new union, to be known as the National Union of Workers, was to comprise
five amalgamating unions, of which the Millers'
Union was one, and the Storemen
and Packers' Union another.  The smaller unions, including the Millers' Union,
would, from a certain
date, move into the Storemen and Packers' building.
Their membership subscriptions would be paid to the Storemen and Packers'
Union,
and that union would be responsible, thereafter, for the day to day
running costs of the union.  Separate accounts would be maintained,
identifying
each union, until full amalgamation had been achieved.
<P>

12	In that context, the auditors for the Millers' Union (A J Williams &amp; Co)
furnished the following advice to the Executive
on 19 November 1990:  (Ex D, p
418)
<P>

	"We refer to our recent telephone conversation when you advised us of certain
procedures to apply from 1 January 1991. ...
<P>

	<i>Employee Entitlements</i>
<P>

	It is proposed that employee entitlements will be cleared or reduced prior to
1 January 1991.  The taxation aspects require consideration.
<P>

	<i>Annual Leave</i>
<P>

	Annual leave and loading paid on termination is taxed in full ...
<P>

	<i>Long Service Leave</i>
<P>

	As all leave has accrued after 1978, the tax treatment is the same as for
annual leave. ..."
<P>

13	The letter then dealt with the issue of "Retiring Allowances".  It is the
payment of these allowances which is dealt with by
the publications (Exs B and
C) about which complaint is made.  The advice of A J Williams &amp; Co said
this:  (Ex D, p 419)
<P>

	"<i>Retiring Allowance</i>
<P>

	Except for a few days accrual in respect of T Hough, benefits have accrued
since 1 July 1983.
<P>

	Where payment is made on termination of employment it is taxed as an `untaxed
eligible termination payment'.  The rate of tax is
16.25% where the recipient
is aged 55 or more and 31.25% at less than age 55.
<P>

	The payment may be `rolled' into a superannuation fund or approved deposit
fund.
<P>

	Payment made during employment will be taxed as ordinary income. ..."
<P>

14	The letter also dealt with Sick Leave which had not been taken, and
concluded with these words:
<P>

	"It may also be possible to arrange for benefits not to be paid out but to be
`preserved' in the amalgamated union."
<P>

15	Mr Palmer, acting on the resolution of the Executive, sought a buyer for the
union premises.  On 27 November 1990 he reported
an offer for the building, and
that space within the new premises of the National Union of Workers would be
ready for occupation
on 1 January 1991.
<P>

16	The rule of the Millers' Union dealing with retiring allowances was <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 54.</a>
An issue arose concerning the construction of that rule.  Mr Palmer sought
advice from the unions' solicitors, W G McNally &amp;
Co.  The advice was
furnished on 5 December 1990, and was in these terms:  (Ex D, p 420)
<P>

	"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 54</a> of the union rules provides:
<P>

	`The General Secretary/Treasurer, Assistant Secretary, Organisers and
Permanent clerical staff shall be granted, on retiring or
removal from office,
three week's holiday at current rate of salary at the time, for each completed
year of service;  unless such
removal be due to any misdemeanour to which they
were a party thereto.'
<P>

	I am advised that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 54</a> replaced <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 53</a> which provided:
<P>

	`The General Secretary/treasurer and Organisers shall be granted, on retiring
or removal from office, one week's holiday at current
rate of salary at the
time for each completed year of service;  unless such removal be due to any
misdemeanour to which they were
a party thereto.'
<P>

	I am asked to advise as to whether service before the amendment to the rule
attracts holidays at the rate of one week or three
weeks.  The current <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 54</a>
is capable of only one interpretation.  The officials and clerical staff
described in the rule are entitled upon retirement or removal
from office to
holidays at the rate of three weeks per year of service calculated by reference
to his total service both before and
after the rule amendment."
<P>

17	In the proceedings before Hill J, Mr Palmer gave the following evidence
concerning his discussions with Mr Belan on the subject
of the retiring
allowances payable under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 54.</a>  He said this:  (T 100)
<P>

	"Q.	What did Mr Belan say, if anything, about these matters, about the
retirement?
<P>

	A.	Well I do recall mentioning it was a matter that would have to be addressed
and Mr Belan's response, as I recall, stated something
similar to it was a
problem for the Millers and they would have to address it."
<P>

18	On 18 December 1990, the Executive of the Millers' Union held a further
meeting.  The Minutes recorded the following:  (Ex D,
p 415/416)
<P>

	"The Secretary gave a full report on advice received from our solicitors and
auditors re the union's assets and liabilities.  The
advice being as follows: -
once the mortgage is cleared, a term deposit to cover the officials and staffs
retirement benefits be
purchased, covering this liability.
<P>

	With regards to annual leave and sick pay, the following annual leave - any
leave in excess of four weeks be paid out, and the
appropriate rate of tax
paid.
<P>

	Sick pay - any entitlements to be paid out in accordance with the Federal
Milling Industry Award, with the appropriate tax being
paid.
<P>

	Moved the report be received and adopted and that the Secretary be authorised
to act on the advice received.
<P>

	Moved P Walters, seconded W Price."
<P>

19	On 29 January 1991, the Executive held a further meeting.  The Minutes
included the following:  (Ex D, p 416)
<P>

	"Letter from A J Williams re the obligations of the union with regards to the
Retirement Benefit to officials and staff on amalgamation
with the NUW.
<P>

	Williams advised sufficient funds must be preserved in a term deposit until
such time as the union is deregistered (this happens
on amalgamation).  The
benefits can then be transferred to a superannuation plan or paid out.
<P>

	Moved the correspondence be received and noted and that the secretary be
authorised to act accordingly (sic) to this advice.
<P>

	Moved E Palmer, seconded P Walters."
<P>

20	On the same day (29 January 1991), the Millers' executed an agreement with
the Storemen and Packers'.  The agreement was expressed
to run for a period of
six months, the parties being confident that amalgamation could be achieved in
that time.  No provision was
made to carry forward benefits or entitlements
existing within the Millers' Union.  The agreement made the following
provision, referring
to the obligations of the Storemen and Packers' to
officials who would be absorbed into the new body:  (Ex D, p 417)
<P>

	"1.	The Principal hereby agrees:
<P>

	...
<P>

	(6)	To attend to the payment of the salary of the Secretary, Assistant
Secretary and Organisers of the Trade Union for the duration
of the Agreement
in accordance with the rate specified in Schedule `B' hereto and shall,
furthermore, make provision for any leave
entitlement in law accruing to the
Secretary, Assistant Secretary and Organisers of the Trade union during the
operation of this
Agreement only."
<P>

21	On the day the agreement was executed, the sale of the Millers' building was
completed.  On 30 January 1991, Mr Palmer used approximately
$45,000 of the
proceeds to open a term deposit in the name of the Millers' Union, known as
"The Retirement Allowance/Long Service
Leave Fund".
<P>

22	The Executive of the Millers' Union met once more on 26 February 1991.  Mr
Palmer tabled a report from the auditors covering
the period up to the time of
the new arrangements with the Storemen and Packers' Union.  He also reported on
the disbursement of
the proceeds of the building sale.
<P>

23	On 19 March 1991, the various unions which had agreed to amalgamate, to form
the National Union of Workers, signed a Federation
Agreement.  On 29 October
1991, the solicitors for the Millers' Union, W G McNally &amp; Co, wrote to Mr
Palmer in relation to the
payment of officers of that union once amalgamation
had been achieved.  The advice was in these terms:  (Ex D, p 421)
<P>

	"Upon the completion of amalgamation under the <i>Trade Union Act</i>, the
amalgamation is registered and the registration of each union party to the
amalgamation is cancelled (Regulation 32).  Upon
amalgamation the officials of
the union will accordingly cease to be officials.
<P>

<i>	</i>Redundancy means that the availability of work of a particular kind and
in a particular place is finished, or lessened or is expected
to finish or
lessen.  I am of the view that upon amalgamation the officials of the union
will become redundant and their ETP as defined
earlier will be taxed at the
pre-1 July 1983 rate irrespective of when it accrued ..."
<P>

24	On 12 February 1992, the Industrial Registrar approved a scheme of
amalgamation.  The scheme required that members should approve
the proposed
amalgamation.  A poll was conducted on 12 March 1992.  The membership in each
union voted in favour of amalgamation.
 The result was announced by the
Electoral Commissioner on 18 March 1992.  Before that announcement, and on the
day following the
poll (that is, 13 March 1992), the Millers' Union drew
cheques in favour of Messrs Palmer and Boner (and others) in respect of the
amounts said to be payable to them under Rule 54.
<P>

25	On 25 March 1992, the Executive of the Millers' Union met once more.  The
Minutes recorded the following:  (Ex D, p 422/423)
<P>

	"The Secretary gave a full report, on the aspect of the clause in the rules
relating to the Officials and Staff Retiring Allowance,
in the light of our
amalgamating to form the NUW, NSW Branch.  Secretary advised he had spoken with
the President, the union's solicitors
and the union's Auditors, on what the
format should be.
<P>

	The Secretary advices (sic) the rule of the Association was very explicit with
regards to the Retiring Allowance <i>RULE</i> <i>54.  </i>W G McNally written
letter of advice was tabled and discussed, as was the letter from A J Williams
&amp; Co, which talked about freezing
the allowance at the time of entering the
Federation's Agreement with the other amalgamating unions.
<P>

	...
<P>

	That seeing <i>as superannuation had been made available</i> to the officials,
and staff <i>from 1 February 1991</i>, all parties agreed to waive their time
right under the rules for the period from 1 February 1991 to date.
<P>

	However, the benefit of accrual ie 3 weeks per year of service should be
calculated at the enhanced rate of pay as provided for
the Federation. ..."
<P>

26	The Minutes then dealt with the issue of taxation.  This was another issue
which was included in one of the publications which
is said to be defamatory
(Ex C). When the retiring allowances under Rule 54 were paid to Messrs Palmer
and Boner (and others) the
tax was withheld in the belief that the Union was
responsible for its payment.  Advice was later received from the auditors, A J
Williams &amp; Co, that the payment of taxation was the responsibility of the
individuals concerned.  Since the monies had not been
paid by the Millers'
Union (Ex D, p 424), cheques were drawn on 29 May 1992 in favour of Mr Palmer
for $339.19 and Mr Boner for $170.60,
being the amounts withheld.
<P>

27	In September 1992, Mr Belan approached Mr Palmer.  He had become aware of
the payments under Rule 54.  He was disturbed by them.
 Indeed, he believed,
that the payments were "socially and morally wrong" (T 36).  The following was
put to Mr Palmer by counsel
for Mr Belan as to what was said:  (T 36)
<P>

	"Q.	Indeed, `I am sorry to have to do that you know, I worried about it all
weekend, but that is virtually misappropriation'?
<P>

	A.	Yeah, misappropriation was mentioned, I remember that."
<P>

28	Mr Belan, when cross-examined, gave the following evidence:  (T 96)
<P>

	"Q.	I asked you about what Mr Molomby had said, that it was virtually
misappropriation what he had done, they were your words,
wasn't it?
<P>

	A.	No, my words, `was wrong', `was wrong'.
<P>

	Q.	You used the word, `misappropriation'?
<P>

	A.	As I can recall it I used words, `wrong'.
<P>

	Q.	I want you to just think long and hard, when you were talking about this
matter did you use any words to the effect of misappropriation
as you
understood it?
<P>

	A.	Not that I can recall.
<P>

	Q.	You believed he had misappropriated union funds, didn't you?
<P>

	A.	I believe that the money he paid himself and the others was ...
<P>

	HIS HONOUR:  Q.	  Could you answer that question, did you believe that he had
misappropriated union funds?  That's a simple question,
if you just answer that
question rather than some other question?
<P>

	A.	Yes, yes.
<P>

	HOLMES:  	Q.	Had you told him so?
<P>

	A.	I could have.
<P>

	Q.	The fact is you know you told him that, didn't you?
<P>

	A.	I don't know, I could have told him."
<P>

29	On 15 October 1992, Messrs Turner Freeman, solicitors, provided advice to
the National Union of Workers that officers of the
former Millers' Union were
not entitled to any payment under Rule 54.  On 19 October 1992, Mr Belan wrote
to the officers of the
former Millers' Union, including Messrs Palmer and
Boner, requiring reimbursement, and stating the following:  (Ex D, p 411)
<P>

	"Such refund is sought as the subject payments were not authorised by Rule 54
....
<P>

	Clearly, you did not retire nor were you removed from office and the condition
precedent for the payment of 13 March 1992 was not
satisfied nor was the
payment made on 29 May 1992 authorised by the rules ..."
<P>

30	Mr Belan, on the authority of the Committee of Management, required the
reimbursement within seven days, adding:  (Ex D, p 411)
<P>

	"I confirm that in requiring the repayment neither myself nor the Committee of
Management have considered the issue of the responsibility
for the payment nor
whether any culpability or impropriety was involved by any individual in
respect of the subject payments."
<P>

31	On the same day, 19 October 1992, Mr Palmer spoke to Mr Belan concerning the
repayment of the money.  He sought a special meeting
of the Branch Secretary's
to consider the issue.  Such a meeting then took place.  However, Mr Belan and
the other Secretaries advised
Mr Palmer that, even if the monies were repaid,
they would not guarantee that charges would not be laid (Ex E, p 478).
<P>

32	On 22 October 1992, Mr McNally, solicitor for Messrs Palmer and Boner, wrote
to Mr Belan in these terms:  (Ex F, p 115)
<P>

	"In order to avoid costly litigation we sought and obtained instructions from
our clients to seek Senior Counsel's advice to resolve
the conflict.  We are
now advised by Richard Kenzie QC that the original advice given to the union
was in his view correct and that
of Turner Freeman incorrect.
<P>

	We trust that this now resolves this issue."
<P>

33	A copy of the advice was furnished.
<P>

34	On 28 October 1992, the Committee of Management met and resolved to charge
Messrs Palmer and Boner and one other former officer
of the Millers' Union.
The charges against Mr Palmer were as follows:  (Ex D, p 412)
<P>

	"(i)	Committing substantial breaches (two) of the rules of the union in that
he failed to carry out directions and instructions
of the State Secretary to
refund to the union each of the said sums of $21,368.72 and $339.19;
<P>

	(ii)	Committing substantial breaches (2) of the rules of the union in that he
failed to act in accordance with lawful directions
of the Committee of
Management in that he failed to comply with a request from the State Secretary
of the union to refund each of
the said sums of money;  and
<P>

	(iii)	Misappropriation (two) of the funds of the union in that he failed to
refund to the union each of the said sums of money."
<P>

35	The $21,368.72 mentioned in the first charge was the amount paid to Mr
Palmer under Rule 54, and the smaller sum ($339.19) was
the taxation mistakenly
deducted from the amount which the union believed to be payable.
<P>

36	Similar charges were laid against Mr Boner.  The charges were returnable, in
each case, before the Committee of Management on
11 November 1992.
<P>

37	On 30 October 1992, Mr Belan wrote to Messrs Palmer and Boner in the
following terms:  (Ex D, p 414)
<P>

	"Due to the current circumstances in relation to the charges being laid
against Edward Palmer and Denis Boner, it is my view that
it would be in the
best interests of the organisation and all concerned that Edward Palmer and
Denis Boner be relieved from all official
duties as from today's date, until 11
November 1992, when the charges will be heard."
<P>

	<b>Proceedings Before Hill J</b>
<P>

38	The Industrial Court of New South Wales is given jurisdiction to require a
union to observe its rules (s 441 Industrial Relations
Act, 1991), and to cease
conduct which is oppressive to its members (ss 497, 498).  On 3 November 1992,
an application was lodged
on behalf of Messrs Palmer and Boner (and one other
officer) for orders restraining the Committee of Management from proceeding to
hear the charges.  Various bases were identified which, it was suggested,
amounted to oppression or failure by the union to observe
its rules.
<P>

39	The matter proceeded before Hill J over a number of days.  The applicants
were Messrs Palmer and Boner (and another officer of
the former Millers'
Union).  The respondents were members of the Committee of Management.  All but
Mr Belan submitted to the order
of the Court (save as to an order of costs).
Mr Belan, as third respondent, therefore, had the carriage of the action.  Mr
Palmer
gave evidence at some length, as did Mr Boner.  Mr Belan, however, was
not called.  His Honour made the following comments upon the
central
controversy which separated the parties:  (Ex D, p 452)
<P>

	"Mr Palmer gave evidence that the matter of the payments was discussed with Mr
Belan both prior to and after the making thereof
in the context that it was a
condition of the proposed amalgamation that the Millers' and other amalgamating
unions would discharge
their liabilities prior to amalgamation.  This is
confirmed by documentary evidence including the minutes of the meetings of the
Millers' Executive."
<P>

	
<P>

40	His Honour added:  (Ex D, p 452)
<P>

	"Mr Palmer impressed me generally as a person of credit with a firm belief in
the correctness and propriety of his position in
the matter."
<P>

41	Although Mr Palmer lacked precision in his recollection of some matters,
Hill J said this:  (Ex D, p 452)
<P>

	"He was unwavering as to the substance of his evidence of relevant discussions
with Mr Belan despite lengthy and searching cross-examination.
 His evidence
was largely supported by Mr Boner whom I consider was honest and
straightforward in his answers to questions again
despite some imprecision as
to matters of detail..."
<P>

42	His Honour's conclusion was as follows:  (Ex D, p 452)
<P>

	"Significantly Mr Belan, with whom most of the relevant conversations
allegedly took place, did not give evidence despite strong
challenges by his
counsel during cross-examination of Messrs Palmer and Boner, to the truth of
the fact that the conversations ever
took place and/or to the witnesses'
correct recollection of any which may have taken place.  In all of the
circumstances I have no
reservations in accepting the substance and truth of
the evidence of both Messrs Palmer and Boner on these matters."
<P>

43	His Honour returned to the same issue when he came to deal with the question
of costs.  Mr Whitlam QC appeared for Mr Belan.
 His submission at the
conclusion of the evidence was summarised by Hill J in these terms:  (Ex E, p
472)
<P>

	"... ultimately it had been put to the Court by Mr Whitlam QC, as he then was,
that the honesty or integrity of the applicant Mr
Palmer was not in issue
although a good deal of Mr Palmer's cross-examination had premised that both
his veracity and motives were
suspect and in issue ..."
<P>

	
<P>

44	In the same judgment, Hill J said this:  (Ex E, p 477/478)
<P>

	"It must be borne in mind that the evidence, uncontroverted as it turned out,
was that the subject-matter of payments for accrued
but untaken annual leave
and sick leave and the retirement allowances under r 54 of the Millers were the
subject of discussions with
Mr Belan as far back as 1990 and as late as March
of 1992.  This in the context of it being, understandably, a condition of
amalgamation
that the amalgamating unions should first clear their financial
liabilities and not bring them over to the amalgamated union.  It
was beyond
doubt on the evidence that the payments were made by the Millers to the
applicants on the basis of the advice of the union's
solicitor, Mr McNally, and
its auditor, Mr Wales, despite the issues raised by the third respondent about
timing and complete satisfaction
of procedural requirements.  Furthermore, the
entitlement of the applicants to the retirement allowance was confirmed in the
joint
opinion of senior and junior counsel;  all of this was known to the LCOM
prior to the passing of its resolution on 19 October 1992
notwithstanding that
a copy of counsels' written opinion was not then available.  It was
subsequently made available and distributed
to the COM meeting held on 28
October 1992;  that meeting had been scheduled in order to consider the outcome
of the resolution of
19 October.  The matter had also been the subject of prior
investigation and deliberation at meetings of the Finance Committee and
the
Branch Secretaries."
<P>

	<b>Did Mr Belan Direct Mr Palmer?</b>
<P>

45	An important issue in the context of the defence of comment, which will be
dealt with below, is the truth or falsity of the following
statement which
appeared in the leaflet about which complaint is made (Ex C):
<P>

	<b>", BELAN TOLD ME TO PAY OUT ALL THE OFFICERS ..</b>
<P>

<b>	Palmer"</b>
<P>

46	In the context in which it appears, as discussed below, the statement is
characterised as being false.  Was it, as a matter of
probability, false to
suggest that Mr Belan had told Mr Palmer to pay out all the officers?  Although
Mr Belan did not give evidence
before the Industrial Court, he gave evidence
before me.  Mr Belan's evidence, however, did not include testimony as to
whether he
had, or had not, given a direction to Mr Palmer, as asserted by Mr
Palmer.  When cross-examined as to whether Mr Palmer's evidence
before Hill J
(extracted above) had been brought to his notice, Mr Belan gave an unresponsive
answer which may suggest that he denied
having given any such direction (T 100;
see also p 108).  The judgments of Hill J (Exs D and E) were, however, by
agreement, placed
before me "as evidence of the facts" within them.  It was
accepted that Mr Palmer gave the evidence set out above on oath before
Hill J
(T 159).  In July 1993, Mr Palmer (as well as Mr Boner and another officer)
published a document which purported to summarise
the litigation, and its
outcome.  It included the following:  (Ex G, p 2)
<P>

	"The State Secretary elect, Frank Belan had made it quite clear the new
organisation would not pay the amalgamating unions' debts,
their liabilities
would have to be cleared where-ever possible.
<P>

	Including, but not restricted to, untaken sick leave, (where payout of untaken
sick leave was authorised) Accrued annual leave
(no more than 4 weeks would be
acceptable) and retirement or loss of office payments.  These debts of the
union were to be cleared
before the union ceased to exist.  The other unions, I
presume, were told the same thing, because they did in fact do exactly as
we
did."
<P>

47	In the context of the election, a further pamphlet was published, which
carried a photograph of Mr Palmer, which included the
following words,
attributed to Mr Palmer:  (Ex 1)
<P>

	"When we amalgamated with the NUW, Belan told me to pay out all the Officers
and Staff of the Millers and Grocers Union.  <b>I did this in accordance with
the rules.  Belan set me up.</b>  The court upheld this.  Don't be misled by
what Belan and his henchmen have been saying."  (emphasis in the original)
<P>

48	Mr Palmer, when cross-examined, accepted the accuracy of that statement,
although insisting that he would have worded the statement
somewhat differently
(T 60).
<P>

49	Like Hill J, I was impressed by Mr Palmer.  I accept, as a matter of
probability, that Mr Palmer was directed by Mr Belan to
discharge all
liabilities before amalgamation.  The Millers' Union was required to pay out
all entitlements under the law and the
rules.  It was obviously sensible that
it should do so.  It was also fair, since no arrangements had been made to
preserve such entitlements
within the new structure.
<P>

	<b>The Silver Bullet</b>
<P>

50	I have interrupted the account concerning the events which occurred before
the publication in order to deal with an issue which
will be important later in
this judgment.  Returning to the chronology, the evidence concluded before Hill
J in late 1992.  His Honour
reserved.
<P>

51	On 12 March 1993, at a time when the judgment of Hill J was reserved, an
incident occurred concerning Mr Boner.  Mr Boner was
in the habit of wearing a
hat.  He placed his hat in his office on a shelf which was at about eye level
with his desk.  He then returned
to his car to retrieve some documents.  He was
absent from his office for five or ten minutes.  Mr Boner described the scene
upon
his return:  (T 70)
<P>

	"I came back into the office and went upstairs and on the crown of the hat was
a bullet, had a silver tip on it, and it was pointed,
it was facing.  When I
walked up to the desk it was actually facing, point at me."
<P>

52	Mr Boner immediately recognised the bullet and the shell.  He had seen it
many times before on Mr Belan's desk.  Mr Belan was
in the habit of playing
with it, separating and rejoining the shell with the silver bullet.  When
cross-examined, Mr Boner said this:
 (T 86)
<P>

	"Q.	One thing is clear, isn't it, everybody must have known Mr Belan had
something like this?
<P>

	A.	Everyone who had gone into his office and noticed it, I would say that
would be correct.
<P>

	Q.	Anyone who saw this on the hat was likely to associate it with Mr Belan,
weren't they?
<P>

	A.	It would be fair to say that, yes.
<P>

	Q.	Not exactly something you would call a top secret mission of destruction,
is it?
<P>

	A.	No, but I felt it was a threat."
<P>

53	A number of officials of the union were in the office, in the immediate
vicinity.  They included Mr Belan.  Mr Boner invited
those present to examine
the position of the bullet.  He described the reaction of Mr Belan in these
words:  (T 70)
<P>

	"Q.	And did you confront him about the bullet?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I did.  I actually called him into my office and I just basically
said, `look, at this' and he went to handle the bullet.
 I said `leave it
alone.  I'm, going to pass this on to my solicitors'."
<P>

54	Mr Belan acknowledged that the bullet and shell were his, and had been in
his office (T 93).  He agreed with Mr Boner's account
of their confrontation (T
93).  He acknowledged that Mr Boner appeared to be upset (T 94).  He denied,
however, that he had placed
the bullet upon Mr Boner's hat, or that he knew who
had done so.  His office door was always open.  Many had access to the area,
and could have removed the bullet.
<P>

55	Although the evidence is spare, and the matter can never be free from doubt,
I believe it is probable that Mr Belan was responsible
for placing the bullet
on Mr Boner's hat.  It was his bullet.  He had the opportunity.  He was nearby,
at a time when Mr Boner was
absent from his office.  His relations with Mr
Boner, which had previously been cordial, had soured.  He had charged Mr Boner
with
misappropriation, and other matters besides.  Mr Boner (and others,
including Mr Palmer) had challenged his actions in the Industrial
Court.  I
further accept that the action of Mr Belan was intended to be menacing.
<P>

	<b>The Judgment of Hill J</b>
<P>

56	On 28 June 1993. Hill J delivered his judgment.  It was wholly adverse to Mr
Belan.  His Honour found that Rule 54 conferred
benefits, in the nature of
retirement benefits, based upon past service.  His Honour said this:  (Ex D, p
436/437)
<P>

	"However. In my opinion the applicants did, by operation of law, cease to hold
office and employment in the Millers consequent
upon its going out of
existence;  while provision was made for the taking up of alternative offices
and employment the offices which
they thereafter took up in the union were in
fact and in law quite different to their former offices.  <b>They were
therefore entitled both as a matter of law and merit to the retirement
allowance</b>."  (emphasis added)
<P>

57	His Honour elaborated upon the merits.  He said this:  (Ex D, p 437)
<P>

	"Their qualifying service also ceased - no service thereafter could count;
and in terms of merit, the cessation of qualifying service
follows because
thereafter they qualified as officers of the new union for retirement benefits
under the same superannuation scheme
previously applicable to officers of the
Storemen and Packers.  It appears on the evidence that all officers of the
union now enjoy
the benefits of a retirement scheme which provides for 10% and
2% contributions by the union.  However, prior to this the only `retirement'
benefits scheme for officers and permanent clerical staff of the Millers were
those provided by rule 54 and, seemingly in recent
years, the minimum
occupational superannuation provided in industry generally."
<P>

58	The charges against Messrs Palmer and Boner (and another officer)
presupposed an absence of entitlement under Rule 54 (Ex D,
p 441).  Moreover,
the inference arising from the terms of the resolution by the Committee of
Management (authorising Mr Belan to
seek reimbursement) was that it had
prejudged the issues which were the subject of the charges (Ex D, p 446).  His
Honour reached
the following conclusion:  (Ex D, p 451)
<P>

	"I have also formed the view that participation in the adjudication of the
charges by the other respondents who participated in
the passing of the
resolution of 19 October 1992 would deny procedural fairness to the
applicants."
<P>

59	Whilst it was open to the Committee of Management to seek the repayment of
monies which it believed (mistakenly in his Honour's
view) were payable to the
union, the action taken at the direction of the Committee was neither proper
nor appropriate.  Hill J made
the following comment:  (Ex D, p 454)
<P>

	"But it was, in my opinion, neither proper nor competent for the COM and/or
the third respondent to seek to convert demands for
payment into directions and
then for the third respondent to take punitive action under the rules against
Mr Palmer on the basis
that he had committed a substantial breach of the rules
by failing to carry out directions or instructions given to him in respect
to
his obligations and duties as an officer of the union."
<P>

60	Elsewhere, his Honour said this:  (Ex D, p 466)
<P>

	"The fair and reasonable course to have been adopted on behalf of the  union
following the refusal of the `instructions' for repayment
was to have
instituted proceedings for recovery in a competent court rather than to seek to
enforce the claim or punish the applicants
by resort to the disciplinary
provisions of the rules."
<P>

	<b>Mr Belan's Awareness of These Proceedings</b>
<P>

61	Mr Belan, when he gave evidence before me, claimed to be almost completely
ignorant of the proceedings before Hill J, and the
judgment of his Honour.  He
did not attend the hearing, on advice.  He acknowledged that he was provided
with reports from time to
time, upon the basis of which he gave instructions (T
97).  However, Mr Belan said this:  (T 101)
<P>

	"Q.	Leaving aside the advice as to whether you should take part in the
proceedings, did they ask you for your comments on what
had been alleged
against you in the proceedings?
<P>

	A.	No."
<P>

62	Mr Belan claimed that he was not aware that Mr Palmer had given evidence
that he had been directed by him to pay out the officers
(T 101).  He also
claimed not to have read Hill J's judgment.  He was therefore unaware of the
various comments made by his Honour,
some of which have been extracted
above.
<P>

63	I do not accept Mr Belan's evidence.  I do not believe that he was ignorant
of the evidence being given by Messrs Palmer and
Boner before the Industrial
Court.  Nor was he unaware of the remarks of Hill J.  First, Mr Palmer was
cross-examined at length,
and in some detail.  One would expect, in the
ordinary course, that the solicitors for Mr Belan would report to him during
the case,
in order to obtain instructions.  Indeed, Mr Belan acknowledged that
this occurred (T 97).
<P>

64	Secondly, in the context of another document (Ex G), which asserted that Mr
Belan had given directions to Mr Palmer, Mr Belan
again asserted ignorance.  On
this occasion, however, his assertions contradicted earlier evidence where he
acknowledged that he
had read the document when it was first distributed in
Melbourne (T 108).
<P>

65	Thirdly, Mr Belan's professed lack of familiarity with Mr Palmer's evidence
was inconsistent with the testimony of Mr Casey,
the second defendant.  Mr
Casey, when cross-examined concerning his knowledge about statements which
appeared in the leaflet (Ex
C) (the matter the subject of complaint), said
this:  (T 151)
<P>

	"Q.	The only source of the information, any person you spoke to about what
should go in that document was Mr Belan?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did you check with any other person or document as to whether the contents
were true or correct?
<P>

	A.	From time to time Frank showed me some documents and he also told me what
happened in the court case."
<P>

66	The cross-examination continued:  (T 152)
<P>

	"Q.	Tell me what documents you were shown by Mr Belan, as far as you
remember?
<P>

	A.	I think there was some transcript from the court case as well as some
ledgers or some - I don't know what they call them - balance
sheets that show
the change of money from one column to another."
<P>

67	Mr Casey later added the following:  (T 152/153)
<P>

	"A.	... I know that he read the transcript.  He showed me parts of it and he
would say, `Look , this is' - opened the transcript
and said, `Look, this is
what happened here'."
<P>

68	Fourthly, as I will shortly describe, Mr Belan launched, and then abandoned,
an appeal against the decision of Hill J.  He could
not responsibly have done
so without first examining the critical findings of his Honour's judgment, or
without being aware of those
findings through their having been read or
carefully explained to him.  The judgment of Hill J is admittedly long (63
pages).  However,
it is interspersed with headings.  There is, for instance, a
heading (p 433) identifying the following subject:  "Entitlement of
the
Applicants under Rule 54 of the Millers".  I believe, as a matter of
probability, that Mr Belan was aware of the various findings
that I have set
out above.
<P>

	<b>Publication of Pamphlet (Ex G)</b>
<P>

69	Notwithstanding the terms of his Honour's judgment, Mr Palmer and Mr Boner
(as well as other officers of the Millers' Union)
continued to be the subject
of "innuendo in the workplace" (T 26).  The Court decision was long, and
delegates, therefore, did not
read it.  A short pamphlet was prepared (Ex G),
summarising the background, and the findings of the Court.
<P>

70	Copies of the pamphlet were printed for distribution to all the members of
the Food 1 Division.  However, before its distribution
was completed, a
complaint was made that its dissemination was disrupting the running of the
union.  A direction was sought from
the State Secretary prohibiting its
circulation.  The issue came before the Branch Committee of Management meeting
of 16 August 1993.
 The Minutes of that meeting included the following:  (Ex
J)
<P>

	"1.	Internal dispute regarding Palmer, Boner and Hough regarding pamphlets
which were circularised at national Conference and to
some members at Kellogg
and other sites.  This circulation was not approved by the Branch Committee of
Management but Ted Palmer
advises that Food Division 1 gave approval.  Frank
Belan commented that he has tried to keep the matter away from the membership
and general public ..."
<P>

71	Although the Minutes do not record a direction that the document (Ex G), no
longer be distributed, Messrs Palmer and Boner thereafter
stopped distribution.
Mr Palmer said, and I accept, that only city members (a little more than 25% of
Food 1 Division) received a
copy.  The vital country centres were not provided
with the document.
<P>

72	The payment of benefits to former officers of the Millers' Union was plainly
a sensitive issue with the membership, and was recognised
as such by Messrs
Belan and Casey.  Mr Casey, on 15 July 1993, whilst still a delegate of the
Food 1 Division at the Kellogg site,
sent a letter to Mr Belan (signed by five
others) complaining about Mr Boner.  The letter included the following:  (Ex
H)
<P>

	"We the NUW NSW Branch delegates, Kellogg site have moved a motion of no
confidence in our organiser, Denis Boner and demand his
replacement by another
organiser for the following reasons:
<P>

	1.	...
<P>

	2.	The dispute between Denis Boner and the NUW NSW Branch over his entitlement
due to the merger of the unions have caused a loss
of confidence with the
membership of the NUW NSW Branch at the Kellogg site ..."
<P>

	<b>Hill J's Judgment on Costs</b>
<P>

73	When Hill J gave judgment on 28 June 1993, he reserved the question of
costs.  Further submissions on that issue were then made.
The applicants
(including Messrs Palmer and Boner) sought indemnity costs.  His Honour gave
judgment in respect of this issue on
8 October 1993.  In the course of that
judgment he acknowledged the test which he was obliged to apply.  He said this:
(Ex E, p 475)
<P>

	"It is unnecessary to traverse the cases in any detail;  they demonstrate in
one form or another special or unusual circumstances
which manifest themselves
in improper or unmeritorious conduct by the unsuccessful party ..."
<P>

74	In addressing that issue, his Honour made the following remarks:  (Ex E, p
475/476)
<P>

	"That having been said there is no doubt that in this  case a significant
number of matters directly involving Mr Belan were extensively
pursued in
cross-examination, clearly on instructions, in a situation where the third
respondent did not put on an affidavit and
where he was not called, and no
application was made to call him, to give evidence in reply;  nor were any
other witnesses called
by the third respondent in rebuttal of matters to which
Messrs Palmer and/or Boner attested and on which they were cross-examined
on a
basis which put into issue the veracity and/or the accuracy of their evidence.
Mr Shaw put that this resulted only in some forensic
disadvantage to the third
respondent - a mere forensic technicality as it were.  But there is much more
to the matter than that.
 In a case where facts are deposed to by one party and
are strenuously challenged and their truth and/or correctness put in issue
by
the other party, such as occurred in this case, and that other party does not
then give evidence nor call any other witness in
rebuttal, without any or any
sufficient explanation, the clear and commonsense inference to be drawn is that
his and/or their evidence
on those matters will not assist their case.  The
rational conclusion is that the facts put in issue are true and were known to
be
so."
<P>

75	His Honour added, referring to the charges:  (Ex E, p 476)
<P>

	"In my opinion, those charges, on the particulars and the facts, bordered on
the vexatious."
<P>

76	An order was made that the respondents (being the Committee of Management)
pay the applicants' costs upon an indemnity basis.
<P>

77	An appeal was lodged against the decision by Hill J on the merits, and on
the question of costs.  As mentioned, the appeal on
the merits was abandoned.
The appeal against the order for costs, however, proceeded.  It was heard by
the Full Court of the Industrial
Court of New South Wales in late 1993.  The
order for indemnity costs against Mr Belan was confirmed, although an
adjustment was
made to the order against other members of the Committee of
Management.  In the course of the Full Court's judgment (Cahill Dep CJ,
Maidment and Hungerford JJ), the following remarks were made:  (Ex F, p 120)
<P>

	"It is our view that the decision by his Honour to award costs on an indemnity
basis as against Mr Belan was not only open to him,
but was also correct.  In
this respect we would dismiss the appeal."
<P>

	<b>The Election</b>
<P>

78	In August 1994 the National Union of Workers held an election.  Nominations
were called some time before April 1994.  In approximately
May 1994, Mr Belan
met with officers of the union to discuss the forthcoming election.  Mr Palmer
described what occurred in these
words:  (T 27)
<P>

	"A.	There was a meeting of the branch offices, all the branch offices.  At
that branch meeting Belan declared his intention to
stand as secretary and
sought all the officers unqualified support for that position.  If you felt you
couldn't do so you were asked
to leave the room.  I think it went somehow like
that.
<P>

	Q.	What did you do?
<P>

	A.	A couple of his own officers left the room first.  I was considering my
position.  Denis Boner left and I then felt that I could
not give the
unqualified support, in view of the past circumstances, to Mr Belan so I
left.
<P>

	Q.	After you left did you then continue to discharge your duties as secretary
of the Food 1 Division between about April/May through
to the election time in
August of 1994?
<P>

	A.	In a manner of speaking.  I was delegated duties that mostly dealt with
sites that would not be voting for me.  Old storeman
and packer sites."
<P>

79	Mr Belan gave the following evidence in relation to this incident, in the
context of the publications about which complaint is
made:  (T 128/129)
<P>

	"Q.	And so it would be part of your expectation that it would harm him by him
having less prospects to win the election?
<P>

	A.	I didn't mean to harm anybody, I just wanted to win the election and keep
my job and another 35, 40 people.  They attacked me,
I didn't attack them.
They ran ticket against me, I didn't run ticket against them.  They walked out
of caucus, I didn't walk out
of caucus.  They tried to unseat me.  I was only
defending myself.  The attack was ...
<P>

	Q.	This caucus, what was that that you were referring to?
<P>

	A.	The caucus was that we held normally prior to every election every four
years of officers and the executive to determine the
tickets that will be put
together and run at the elections.  Mr Palmer and Mr Boner, Mr McConville and
Mr Gooch decided not to be
on that ticket."
<P>

80	There were two broad groups of candidate.  There was the Frank Belan Team,
and the McConville Rank and File Team.  Mr Boner was
a member of the Rank and
File Team.  He appeared in a group photograph in campaign literature of that
team, circulated during the
course of the campaign (Ex 2).
<P>

81	Mr Palmer believed that he also was on the Rank and File ticket.  However,
he was clearly mistaken, as he acknowledged.  The
ticket made no suggestion as
to who, in the contest between Mr Palmer and Mr Casey, should receive support
from voters who favoured
the Rank and File Team (Ex 3).
<P>

82	Nonetheless, Mr Palmer did attend a number of meetings of the Rank and File
Team.  He contributed, in a modest way, to its call
for donations.  At one such
meeting he was told what was being said about him in the workplace.  Mr Palmer
gave the following evidence:

	"... The second meeting they advised me I was getting - I think the term was
slander in the rice area and had been called a thief
and a crook and that if I
didn't do something about it or get down there any chance I had of winning any
election was right out of
the question.  And that's how this document came to
be produced.  They offered to put something out to maybe try and reverse the
trend in the rice area predominantly because that was the largest area
membership and it was my understanding it would be dealing
with rule 54 and the
case that had been gone before the Commission."
<P>

83	A document was then produced (Ex 1), to which reference has been made.  The
document is important.  The defendant alleges that
it constituted an attack by
Mr Palmer upon Mr Belan.  It, therefore, justified (under the defence of
qualified privilege) the publications
about which complaint is made.  I will
later examine, in the context of that defence, whether the document can be
characterised as
an attack, and if so, whether it was Mr Palmer's attack.  The
document put out by the Rank and File Team following this conversation
included
a photograph of Mr Palmer.  Alongside the photograph was the statement, already
referred to, which, for convenience, I repeat:
<P>

	"When we amalgamated with the NUW, Belan told me to pay out all the Officers
and Staff of the Millers and Grocers Union.  <b>I did this in accordance with
the rules.  Belan set me up.</b>  The court upheld this.  Don't be misled by
what Belan and his henchmen have been saying."  (emphasis in the original)
<P>

84	The document continued as follows:
<P>

	<b>"Under Frank Belan, our Union is run by the Officials, and does not listen
to its members.  We need a Union that cares about its members
- from both small
and large workplaces.</b>
<P>

	<b><u>Frank Belan's incompetent administration:</u></b>
<P>

&#183;	Lost almost $1.1 million of members' money last year.
<P>

&#183;	Wasted $1/4 million of members' money by suing our division of the Union
(see above)
<P>

&#183;	Spent Union money trying to get Belan's right-hand man elected to
Parliament.
<P>

&#183;	Belan doesn't understand the Milling Industry - he only cares about
getting your vote.
<P>

&#183;	Has seen mass-resignations of Organisers and Officials.
<P>

&#183;	Has not faced an election in over a decade - it's time he did!
<P>

	<b>Make sure you vote for the candidates that will look after the members, not
after themselves." </b> (emphasis in original)
<P>

	
<P>

	<b>The Publications Complained Of</b>
<P>

85	It is against this background that the Frank Belan Team campaign office
despatched the two publications which are the subject
of these actions (Exs B
and C).  They were sent to 5,000 Food 1 Division members in the one envelope.
They were not attached to each
other.  The first document (Ex B) is a letter
dated 27 July 1994 on the letterhead of the Frank Belan Team.  It is signed in
facsimile
by Mr Belan.  The text of the letter was as follows:  (Ex B)
<P>

	<b>"ATTENTION ALL FOOD 1 MEMBERS</b>
<P>

<center>	<b>A MESSAGE FROM THE STATE SECRETARY</b>
<P>

	Dear Members,</center>
<P>

	Recently, you may have received a pamphlet which I believe was issued by Ted
Palmer.  This pamphlet contains the misleading and
deceitful statement that I,
as State Secretary of this union, permitted the officials of the old Millers'
union to pay an unjustifiable
and indeed wrongful retirement benefit when in
fact, they had continuation of employment under the amalgamated union.
<P>

	I would like to bring to your attention the statement made in this pamphlet -
"Belan Set Me Up".  Indeed, at no time did I ever
Set Palmer Up.
<P>

	The FACTS are:
<P>

	1.	By the abovementioned statement, Palmer confirms that there was some
questionable and indeed dubious decisions made regarding
the amalgamation with
the NUW.
<P>

	2.	If Palmer in hindsight believes that his statement is true, then why
doesn't he simply pay the money back to the union?
<P>

	3.	Why didn't he settle this matter with the union solicitors rather (than)
fight bitterly to keep the money?
<P>

	4.	Why didn't he direct the other union officials involved to repay the large
sums of money involved?
<P>

	5.	In fact, it was Ted Palmer who authorised those payments to union officials
involved - NOT ME.
<P>

	By making these ridiculous claims, Ted Palmer is trying to distance himself
from a situation he was responsible for, could have
corrected at any time, but
chose not to.
<P>

	In light of this, it is little wonder that I as State Secretary no longer have
any confidence or trust in Ted Palmer's ability
to look after the interests of
Food 1 Division members.
<P>

	Indeed, I believe Ted Palmer is NOT supported by any other official in the
National Union of Workers NSW Branch, and they would
be foolish to give him
support.
<P>

	In a week's time you will be voting for a person to represent your union.  I
ask you to support a candidate with commitment to
the union cause and workers'
rights.
<P>

	<b>SUPPORT ARTHUR CASEY FOR THE POSITION OF SECRETARY FOOD 1</b>
<P>

<center>	Yours fraternally,</center>
<P>

	FRANK BELAN"  (emphasis in original)
<P>

86	The letter was accompanied by a two sided leaflet (Ex C).  The leaflet, on
side 1, was in these terms:
<P>

	<b>"IMPORTANT NUW FOOD 1 MEMBERS</b>

<P>

<b>	*	After paying themselves redundancy they kept working full time as Federal

<P>

	</center>
<P>

	<b>The Imputations</b>
<P>

88	Only Mr Palmer sued in respect of the letter.  The following imputations
were said to arise from that publication:
<P>

(a)	The plaintiff deliberately and dishonestly misappropriated union moneys.
<P>

(b)	The plaintiff to hide his misappropriation of union moneys deliberately and
falsely implicated an innocent person as being responsible
for the
misappropriation of union money.
<P>

89	Messrs Palmer and Boner sued both Mr Belan and Mr Casey in respect of the
leaflet accompanying the letter (Ex C).  The imputations
relied upon, in each
case, were as follows:
<P>

(a)	The plaintiff as a union official stole moneys from his union.
<P>

(b)	The plaintiff deliberately commenced court action to stop his stealing of
union funds being detected.
<P>

(c)	The plaintiff to hide his stealing of union funds deliberately and falsely
implicated an innocent person as being responsible
for such stealing of union
funds.
<P>

90	The defendants challenged the capacity of each publication to give rise to
these imputations.  Levine J found that each publication
was capable of giving
rise to the imputations pleaded (although he rejected an earlier version of
imputation (c) in Ex C) (unreported,
29 March 1996;  unreported 3 April
1996).
<P>

91	The issue for the Court is whether the imputations do in fact arise.  In
determining that issue, the publications themselves,
and the context within
which they were published, are relevant.
<P>

92	Should the two documents be regarded as two publications, or one?  The
actions have been pleaded upon an assumption that Exhibits
B and C are separate
publications, giving rise to separate imputations.  In the action by Mr Palmer,
the imputations said to arise
from the letter (Ex B) are similar to the
imputations said to arise from Ex C (paras (a) and (c)).  The wording is
slightly different
("misappropriation" being the key word in respect of Ex B,
whereas "stealing" is asserted in Ex C), but they are otherwise the same.
 In
circumstances where both publications were included in the same envelope, where
nothing else was in that envelope, and both dealt
with the same subject matter,
should not the two documents be regarded as the one publication?  Counsel for
the plaintiff and the
defendant submitted that, for practical purposes, it does
not matter which way the issue is resolved.  The damages, were the plaintiffs
to succeed, ought to be the same.  If they were the one publication, the
plaintiffs would have to acknowledge there was no substantial
difference
between the imputations alleged in respect of Ex B, and those alleged in paras
(a) and (c) in respect of Ex C.  The better
view, in my opinion, is that the
two documents together should be regarded as the one publication.  However, at
the urging of the
parties, I will approach the matter in the way in which it
has been pleaded, namely, as two separate publications.
<P>

93	Examining the publications, as would an ordinary reasonable reader, without
a morbid or suspicious mind, and without being avid
for scandal (<b><i>Farquhar
v Bottom </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20380" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 380</a>, per Hunt J at 385/386) what impression is
made?  Each publication must be looked at in its entirety.  In determining
whether the
imputations arise, one is not bound by the literal meaning of the
words used.  Imputations may arise by insinuation, as well as by
direct
statement.  Hunt J summarised the principles in these words in <b><i>Farquhar v
Bottom</i></b> at 385/386:
<P>

	"The ordinary reasonable reader does not, we are told, live in an ivory tower.
He can, and does, read between the lines, in the
light of his general knowledge
and experience of worldly affairs:  <i>Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd</i> ([1964]
AC 234 at 258);  <i>Jones v Skelton</i> ([1963] SR (NSW) 644 at 650);  <i>Lang
v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd</i> ([1970]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20NSWR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 NSWR 408."</a>
<P>

94	In <b><i>Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd</i></b>, referred to by Hunt J, Lord
Devlin made the following observation at 277:
<P>

	"It is very difficult to draw the line between pure construction and
implication, and the layman's capacity for implication is
much greater than the
lawyer's.  The lawyer's rule is that the implication must be necessary as well
as reasonable.  The laymen reads
in an implication much more freely;  and
unfortunately, as the law of defamation has to take into account, is especially
prone to
do so when it is derogatory..."
<P>

95	Lord Devlin added (at 285):
<P>

	"It is the broad impression conveyed by the libel that has to be considered
and not the meaning of each word under analysis.  A
man who wants to talk at
large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to
exclude the suggestion that there
is also fire;  but it can be done."
<P>

96	Dealing, first, with the letter (Ex B), the context is important.  The
letter was published to working men and women who were
members of a trade
union, the National Union of Workers, Food 1 Division.  It may be assumed that
they are persons who had paid their
yearly subscription of union fees.  Mr
Palmer is the subject of Exhibit B.  He was a person standing for election to
the position
of the Secretary of Food 1 Division.
<P>

97	The publication drew attention to a payment made to Mr Palmer as a
retirement benefit.  The payment was branded "unjustifiable
and, indeed,
wrongful".  The defendant acknowledged, in argument, that "wrongful" was
capable of suggesting criminal conduct.
<P>

98	The letter dealt with the attempts by Mr Palmer to justify his actions.
Essentially he asserted that he was acting upon superior
orders, namely those
of Mr Frank Belan.  That statement was condemned in various ways:
<P>

&#183;	It was described as "misleading and deceitful".
<P>

&#183;	It was contradicted by stating that it was "Ted Palmer who authorised
those payments to union officials involved - NOT ME"
(emphasis in the
original).
<P>

&#183;	It was described as a "ridiculous" claim.
<P>

99	The ordinary reasonable reader, in the context of a trade union, with a
certain amount of loose thinking, and reading between
the lines, would have the
broad impression that Mr Palmer had taken union money to which he was not
entitled.  Moreover, he had invented
a story to cover up his crime.  He had
blamed Mr Belan for something which was his own doing.  I am persuaded by the
plaintiff that
the imputations do arise.
<P>

100	The defendant argued that the unstated premise of the letter (as well as
the leaflet, Ex C) was that there had been a court
case, which Mr Palmer had
won.  I am not persuaded, however, that the ordinary reasonable reader would
have that understanding. 
The court case is not given much prominence in
Exhibit B (unlike Ex C).  There is an oblique reference to it in "Fact (4)".
The impression
is given that Mr Palmer fought bitterly, no doubt by resorting
to lies, to avoid having to give the money back.
<P>

101	If one examines Exhibit B against the background of Exhibit C (which was in
the same envelope, and therefore part of the context),
the impression of lies
to cover up wrongdoing is reinforced.  Indeed, it is not clear from that
publication (Ex C) that the court
case had been concluded, and that Mr Palmer
had won.
<P>

102	Turning to Exhibit C, and dealing with the imputations in paragraphs (a)
and (c) (being, broadly, those equivalent to the imputations
said to arise from
Ex B), the context is the same.  What is the broad impression which the leaflet
would make upon the ordinary reasonable
reader, being a trade unionist in the
midst of an election?  The imputations use the word "stealing".  Stealing is
taking something
that does not belong to you.  Relevantly, the suggestion is
that the plaintiffs have taken union funds belonging to members ("members'
money").  The leaflet uses the words "took", and "taking".  Under the heading
"The Payouts" it exposed the plaintiff's method, namely:
<P>

&#183;	They "paid themselves redundancy even before the amalgamation was
declared".
<P>

&#183;	They used "blank pre-signed cheques".
<P>

&#183;	They used union funds to reimburse tax deducted from their payments.
<P>

103	On page 2, again, the word "taking" is used.  The leaflet included the
following:
<P>

	"Palmer doesn't deny <u>taking $46,525.51</u> out of the union"<b>
</b>(emphasis in the original)
<P>

104	The leaflet also exposed the absence of any justification for taking union
funds.  It said this:
<P>

&#183;	They took redundancy payments but did not have one day off work.
<P>

&#183;	After paying themselves redundancy, they kept working full time as
Federal and State officials of the NWU.
<P>

&#183;	Under the heading "Sometimes you just can't believe your ears" the
leaflet recites a number of famous "lies" ("I am not a
crook ... ", Richard
Nixon;  "I did not inhale ... ", Bill Clinton;  "... No child will be living in
poverty", Bob Hawke).  In that
context they include the statement by Mr Palmer
"Belan told me to pay out all the officers", with the clear implication that it
was
false.
<P>

&#183;	"Palmer doesn't deny taking $46,525.51 out of the union.  He just wants
you to blame Frank Belan."
<P>

105	The defendants argued, first, that there was no accusation of stealing.
The plaintiffs were already in control of the funds.
 However, I believe that
the ordinary reader would regard a person as having stolen funds, whether or
not those funds were under
his control, if he diverted them improperly to his
use.  Lawyers may call such conduct misappropriation, or by some other label.
An ordinary reader, who is a trade union member, would regard taking funds that
do not belong to you as stealing.
<P>

106	Secondly, the defendants again assert that the assumption behind the
article is that the plaintiffs had taken court action and
won.  The leaflet
invites the membership to make an independent judgment upon that result.
However, as already explained, I believe
that there are difficulties in that
suggestion.  It is not clear that the court case is over, and has been won.
<P>

107	I am persuaded that imputations (a) and (c) do arise from Exhibit C.
<P>

108	Imputation (b) combines two ideas.  I have dealt with the first already,
namely whether the leaflet, as a whole, suggested that
the plaintiffs had
stolen union funds.  I believe that imputation does arise.  The second idea is
that, having done that, the plaintiffs
took defensive action to avoid being
found out.  The leaflet opens with these words:
<P>

	"Palmer and Boner commenced the court action to stop the Committee of
Management looking at their use of union funds."
<P>

109	The defendants made the following submission in respect of this
imputation:
<P>

	"In addition to the difficulties discussed above in relation to `stealing',
this imputation confronts the fact that the words of
the publication do not
speak of `detection' but of `looking at' - implying that the payments were
already known."
<P>

110	However, the clear implication, arising from the leaflet, is that the
Committee of Management wanted to follow the money trail
to detect and expose
the wrongdoing which the leaflet then does expose.  I believe that imputation
(b) also arises.
<P>

111	The defendants conceded that, were I to find (as I now have) that the
imputations arose, that they were defamatory of each of
the plaintiffs.
<P>

	<b>The Publication by the Defendants</b>
<P>

112	In <b><i>Webb v Bloch </i></b>([1928] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20CLR%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 CLR 331)</a>, Isaacs J quoted with
approval the following, on the issue of publication:  (at 364)
<P>

	"In <i>Parkes v Prescott</i> ((1869) LR, Ex 169 at p 173), Giffard QC quotes
from the second edition of <i>Starkie</i>:  `All who are in any degree
accessory to the publication of a libel, and by any means whatever conduce to
the publication, are to
be considered as <i>principals in the act of
publication</i>:  thus if one <i>suggest</i> illegal matter in order that
another may write or print it, and that a third may publish it, all are equally
amenable for the act
of publication when it has been so effected.'  In <i>R v
Paine</i> ((1696) 5 Mod 163 at p 167) it is held:  `If one repeat and another
write a libel, and a third approve what is wrote, they are all
makers of it;
<i>for all persons who concur, and show their assent or approbation to do an
unlawful act, are guilty</i>:  so that murdering a man's reputation by a
scandalous libel may be compared to murdering his person;  for if several are
assisting
and encouraging a man in the act, though the stroke was given by one,
yet all are guilty of homicide."  (emphasis in original)
<P>

113	Here, Mr Belan acknowledged his responsibility for the dissemination of
both the letter and leaflet (Exs B and C).  They were
shown to him.  He read
them.  He gave his approval.  He signed the letter.  It was his expectation
that they would be distributed
to members of the Food 1 Division.
<P>

114	The actions against Mr Casey arise out of the publication of the leaflet,
Exhibit C.  Mr Casey made no concession that he was
responsible for the
distribution of that document.  He acknowledged that he was responsible for the
preparation of the letter, Exhibit
B.  His campaign manager, his brother
Thomas, prepared that letter, which was then shown to Mr Belan for approval.
However, his brother
had not prepared the leaflet, Exhibit C.  He did not know
who had.
<P>

115	Mr Casey did, however, recall having seen Exhibit C before its
distribution.  It was shown to him at the campaign office of
the Frank Belan
Team by a campaign worker.  He believed it was shown as a matter of courtesy.
The decision had already been taken
by Mr Belan to distribute the leaflet.
<P>

116	Mr Casey recalled folding the letters (Ex B) so that they could be placed
in envelopes, and thereafter sent to Food 1 members.
 He saw other campaign
workers folding other material.  However, at no time, in his view, did he
personally authorise the distribution
of the leaflet, Exhibit C.
<P>

117	The recollection of Mr Belan, as to the involvement of Mr Casey was
somewhat different.  Both Exhibit B (the letter) and Exhibit
C (the leaflet)
were designed to assist Mr Casey, by denigrating his rival, Mr Palmer (as well
as Mr Boner in the case of Exhibit
C).  The leaflet, indeed, included these
words:
<P>

	"VOTE `x' ARTHUR CASEY AND THE FRANK BELAN TEAM"
<P>

118	Mr Belan gave the following evidence:  (T 113)
<P>

	"Q.	Before the adjournment your evidence was pretty clear, wasn't it, that
both documents were given to you by Mr Arthur Casey,
weren't they?
<P>

	A.	And authorised by me, yes.
<P>

	Q.	That was your clear recollection before the adjournment, wasn't it?
<P>

	A.	Yes, still is."
<P>

119	I believe, as a matter of probability, that Mr Belan's version is correct.
Mr Casey was the beneficiary of both documents. 
He took it upon himself to
arrange a response to Exhibit 1.  The two documents, Exhibits B and C. are said
to be that response. 
Both documents went out together in the same envelope.
Mr Casey's assertion that he arranged one, but not the other, and had no idea
who arranged the other, even though it dealt with the same subject, and he was
the beneficiary, is improbable.
<P>

120	Mr Casey's responsibility for the publication of the leaflet is apparent
from other evidence which he gave.  He said this: 
(T 154)
<P>

	"Q.	You understood that you were agreeing to Mr Belan on occasions during the
campaign putting out brochures on behalf of the Frank
Belan team which would be
included on your behalf?
<P>

	A.	Frank put out - the word we use is campaign material on behalf of the
entire team."
<P>

121	Elsewhere, Mr Casey said this:  (T 155)
<P>

	"Q.	You were prepared to go along with Mr Belan deciding to spend funds on
your behalf?
<P>

	A.	I was prepared for Frank, as a member of the team, to get campaign material
out that would protect my position."
<P>

122	I believe, in these circumstances, that Mr Casey published Exhibit C.
<P>

123	The plaintiffs, therefore, have established that the defendants published
defamatory imputations concerning them.  I shall now
deal with the defences
raised by the defendants.
<P>

	<b>Defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></b>
<P>

124	The defendants, late in the hearing, with the consent of the plaintiffs,
filed amended defences in each action.  The defences,
in each case, pleaded the
defence provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>, that, in the circumstances
of publication of the matter complained of, the person defamed was not likely
to suffer harm.
<P>

125	Counsel for the defendants, in submissions, did not seek to support that
defence (T 160).  The defendants, of course, bear the
onus.  The publication
concerned rival candidates in an election.  The imputations were serious.  The
plaintiffs were each accused
of stealing union funds, and falsely implicating
an innocent person in their crime.  The issue was known by the defendants to be
sensitive.  Serious harm to the plaintiffs was likely.  The defence, therefore,
is not made out.
<P>

	<b>Qualified Privilege at Common Law</b>
<P>

126	The defendants rely upon the defence of qualified privilege at common law.
It is said to arise in two ways:
<P>

&#183;	First, the statements were made on a subject matter in which both the
defendants, and the persons to whom the statements
were made, had a legitimate
common interest.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, the statements were made in reply to an attack, namely the
publication of the document bearing Mr Palmer's photograph
(Ex 1).
<P>

	<b>Qualified Privilege Through a Common Interest</b>
<P>

127	The letter (Ex B) and leaflet (Ex C) were, of course, published during a
union election.  They were described as "campaign literature".
 Broadly, they
deal with the conduct of rival candidates.  They were, if true, relevant to the
fitness for office of such candidates.
 The publications were distributed by
mail to Food 1 members.  They were distributed, therefore, to electors in the
forthcoming election,
and to no-one else.
<P>

128	The defendants submitted that communications to electors by candidates in
the course of an election are quintessentially communications
on an occasion of
qualified privilege.  The law presumes that the defendant believes the truth of
the assertions being made (<b><i>Radio 2UE Pty Limited v Parker</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)

129	Attention was drawn to <b><i>Braddock v Bevins</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%201%20KB%20580" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 1 KB 580</a>,
where the Court of Appeal took what <b>The Australian Defamation Law and
Practice</b> described as a "robust" approach to the issue (Tobin &amp; Sexton
para 14,025).  The plaintiff was a member of the House of Commons.
 She was
also an active supporter of a particular candidate running for office on the
Liverpool City Council.  The rival candidate
published an election address to
the electors of the relevant Ward.  The plaintiff alleged the address defamed
her.  On the issue
of qualified privilege, the Court of Appeal said this:  (p
590)
<P>

	"In principle, and quite apart from such assistance as can be derived from
authority, we should have thought it scarcely open to
doubt that statements
contained in the election address of one candidate concerning the opposing
candidate, provided they are relevant
to the matters which the electors will
have to consider in deciding which way they will cast their votes, are entitled
to the protection
of qualified privilege.  The electors clearly have an
interest in receiving a communication of that kind.  Indeed, the task of the
electors under democratic institutions could not be satisfactorily performed if
such a source of relevant information bona fide given
were to be cut off by the
fear of an action for libel.  As will be seen, there is a good deal of
authority for the view that qualified
privilege extends to communications by
one elector to another in relation to a candidate at an impending election.  It
would be curious
if the interest and duty subsisting between one elector and
another were to be rated higher in this respect than the interest and
duty
subsisting between an elector and a candidate, and we are unable to see any
ground for such a distinction ..."

circumspect.  Statements were made in the course of a parliamentary by-election
to the press.  They characterised
the leadership of the New South Wales Labor
Party as a "dictatorship".  Evatt J said this:  (at 672)
<P>

	"One further matter:  I disagree with the opinion expressed in the Supreme
Court that the facts proved showed that the occasions
of all seven speeches
were `unquestionably privileged' (Maxwell AJ).  Of course it is possible that a
privileged occasion will arise
in relation to a speech at a public or an
election meeting.  But the common law warrants no such general doctrine of
privilege as
was here asserted on behalf of the defendant, and apparently by
the majority of the Full Court.  The general question of privilege
I had
occasion to discuss in the recent case of <i>Telegraph Newspaper Co v Bedford
</i>((1934) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=50%20CLR%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">50 CLR 632).</a>  In my opinion the theory that privilege attaches to
<i>every</i> occasion upon which speakers at election meetings choose to
broadcast before large gatherings opinions or information about one or
other of
the candidates cannot be supported."
<P>

131	Here, of course, the publication was confined to the members of the Food 1
Division.  The material was published only to those
people who had a common
interest (cf <b><i>Guise v Cauvelis</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1947/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2074%20CLR%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 74 CLR 102).</a>

377):
<P>

	"The interest relied on as the foundation of privilege must be definite.  It
may be direct or indirect, but it must not be vague
or insubstantial.  So long
as the interest is of so tangible a nature that for the common convenience and
welfare of society it is
expedient to protect it, it will come within the
rules."
<P>

133	In <b><i>Austin v Mirror Newspapers</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 354</a>, the Privy
Council defined the common law requirement in these words:
<P>

	"... an interest material to the affairs of the recipient of the information
such as would, for instance, assist in the making
of an important decision or
the determining of a particular course of action."
<P>

134	Applying that test, the occasion would appear to be one of qualified
privilege.  However, the plaintiff drew attention to the
remarks of O'Connor J
in <b><i>Hay v The Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1906] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%203%20CLR%201002" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 3
CLR 1002:</a>  (at 1016)
<P>

	"The privilege here, if it is to be of any value at all, is to publish, not an
expurgated edition, but a complete report of the
resolutions of the conference
as they were arrived at, to all the members of the Institute, in order to give
them that right which
they possess as members to have placed before them a full
and accurate account of everything said and done.  If that is the nature
of the
occasion, <i>prima facie</i> it is the duty of the Institute to publish to
members of the Institute the determination of the resolutions of the conference
just
as they were passed."
<P>

135	The authorities emphasise the importance of the particular circumstances in
each case.  Evatt J (in <b><i>Telegraph Newspapers Co Limited v Bedford</i></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2050%20CLR%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934) 50 CLR 632</a> at 657) described the characterisation of the occasion as one
of "extreme delicacy to determine whether, in any given circumstances,
the
claim of privilege should be allowed".  No doubt the electors had an interest
in receiving an accurate account of the competing
versions of the court action,
and what the court had found.  The plaintiff submitted, however, that the
electors could have no interest
in a misleading, expurgated version of those
facts.
<P>

136	The submission has some attraction.  It can hardly be in the interests of
electors that they should receive misinformation.
 In the case already referred
to (<b><i>Telegraph Newspapers Co Limited v Bedford)</i></b> Evatt J said this:
(at 655)
<P>

	"Considerations of public good and public policy run through all the common
law cases on this topic.  In the year 1837, in <i>Todd v Hawkins</i> ((1837) <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1837/322.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1837] EngR 322</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=8%20C%20%26%20P%2088" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">8

good of all that communications between parties situated as those were, should
be
free and unrestrained.'"
<P>

137	The importance of considerations of public policy were also identified by
Jordan CJ in <b><i>Andreyevich v Kosovich</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 47 SR (NSW) 357</a> at
362:
<P>

	"Whether or not an occasion is one of qualified privilege depends upon
considerations of public policy.  The cases on this point
were collected by
Evatt J in <i>Telegraph Newspaper Co Ltd v Bedford</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2050%20CLR%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934) 50 CLR 632</a> at
655-658.  All the circumstances in which the defamatory statement for which
privilege is claimed was made must be taken into account,
and, in the light of
them, it must be determined whether it is in the interest of the community,
that is, the good of society in
general, that the statement, though defamatory,
should be made with impunity.  It is of course not necessary that the facts of
the
particular communication should be of interest to the public at large.  It
is necessary only that it should be for the general good
of the community that
such a communication should be made with impunity so far as the law of
defamation is concerned.  <i>Howe v Lees</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/67.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 67</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2011%20CLR%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 11 CLR 361</a> at 368-9;
Austin Digest 404."
<P>

138	I believe that the plaintiffs' submission, in the end, amounts to a
requirement  that the defendant establish the truth of what
has been said, and
that they behaved reasonably in the circumstances (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22(1)(c)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a>) before they can claim privilege.  Ordinarily these are not requirements
of an occasion of qualified privilege.  Falsity, and extravagance
may be
relevant in the context of malice.  But that is a different issue.  I therefore
believe that the publication was made on an
occasion of qualified privilege.
<P>

	<b>Reply to Attack</b>
<P>

139	I should deal with the second basis upon which the defendants put their
case.  Upon the analogy of the criminal law, a person
may defend himself
against written or verbal attacks.  As with the criminal law, however, the
response must be reasonably commensurate
with the attack, although "no nice
scales will be used" (<b><i>Adam v Ward</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281917%29%20AC%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1917) AC 309</a>, per Lord Dunedin
at 330).
<P>

140	Here, a number of issues arise:
<P>

&#183;	First, can the original document (Ex 1) be characterised as an
attack?
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, if it can, whose attack was it, and does it matter?
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, do the documents, Exhibits B and C, amount to a reply to an
attack?
<P>

141	Dealing with these issues, Exhibit 1 (supra p 32), was a documents which,
itself, was said to have been produced because Mr
Palmer had been "slandered"
in the rice growing area, where there were many Food 1 members.  The document
included a photograph of
Mr Palmer, and a statement attributed to him.  The
balance of the leaflet was highly critical of Mr Belan's administration, and
was
unquestionably an attack.  The documents ultimately published by Mr Belan,
however, (the letter (Ex B) and leaflet (Ex C)) were not
directed towards these
criticisms.  Rather, they responded to the quotation attributed to Mr
Palmer.
<P>

142	That quotation asserted that Mr Belan had directed Mr Palmer to pay out the
officers of the Millers' Union in accordance with
the rules.  It also said that
"Mr Belan set me up".  The statement concluded with a warning (from Mr Palmer)
that members "should
not be misled by what Belan and his henchmen have been
saying".
<P>

143	I believe these words amounted to an attack upon Mr Belan, and his
administration.  The imputation was that Mr Belan, through
his allies, was
spreading lies concerning certain payments to officers of the Millers' Union;
that, in fact, he had ordered those
payments, and later denied his involvement,
thereby setting up Mr Palmer.
<P>

144	It is not necessary that the defendants, in order to claim the privilege,
need to respond to the whole of the attack, or do
so on the one occasion.
Provided the response (Exs B and C) can be characterised as a reply to the
attack within Exhibit 1, or any
part of it, that, in my view, is enough.
<P>

145	Whose attack was it?  The document, Exhibit 1, does not identify a
publisher.  It carried the photo of Mr Palmer, and a statement
attributed to
him.  It was otherwise anonymous.  The campaign slogans in the lower part of
the document resembled other literature
promoted by the Rank and File Team.
<P>

146	Mr Belan, in his letter, Exhibit B, opened with these words:
<P>

	"Recently, you may have received a pamphlet which I believe was issued by Ted
Palmer."
<P>

147	There is no suggestion that Mr Boner had anything to do with the production
or publication of Exhibit 1.  However, Mr Palmer,
before its publication,
discussed the desirability of producing a document with members of the Rank and
File Team.  It came to his
notice, through that team, that accusations of
dishonesty were being made against him.  He did not compose the leaflet,
Exhibit 1,
nor furnish the photograph or quotation which were used.
Nonetheless, he discussed the nature of the response which should be put
out (T
45).  He knew a document would be produced (T 47).  He assumed that he would be
shown that document before it was disseminated.
 Although in some respects he
waivered in his answers, I accept the following evidence which he gave:  (T
53)
<P>

	"Q.	You didn't ask them to show it to you after the approval before they put
it out, did you?
<P>

	A.	I was an ex-union official.  You always want to see anything that's put out
under presumably your signature or under your -
so I'm quite certain in my own
mind I had said, `You let me see it before it goes out?'  I'm certain I would
have asked to see it
before it went out, but I didn't get to see it."
<P>

148	He was not shown the document before its dissemination, and was
disappointed when he saw it.  He would have worded differently
the quotation
attributed to him (T 60), although he did not disown the accuracy of the words
"Belan Set Me Up".  There was, incidentally,
no evidence before Hill J, or
before me, that, in giving the direction to discharge liabilities, Mr Belan had
deliberately led Mr
Palmer into a trap.  Rather, it appears, as will be
discussed below, that Mr Belan may not, when giving the direction, have
appreciated
the monetary implications under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 54</a> of the Millers' rules.
<P>

149	Was Mr Palmer responsible, in these circumstances, for Exhibit 1, such that
it may be characterised as his attack?  With some
hesitation, I believe that he
was.  He discussed its production.  He gave his approval to the production of a
document.  He assumed
he would be shown a copy of the draft.  In the context of
an election, where time was of the essence, the adoption of a passive role,
where he made no inquiry, and did not supervise what was being done in his
name, does not, in my view, relieve him of responsibility
for what was
produced.
<P>

150	I, therefore, move to the third question:  can the publications, Exhibits B
and C, be characterised as a reply to an attack?
 There is little doubt that
each purported to be a response to Exhibit 1.  Exhibit B specifically quoted
the words "Belan Set Me
Up" and dealt with the general subject matter of
retirement benefits.  Likewise, Exhibit C repeated words taken from the
quotation
attributed to Mr Palmer, namely:
<P>

	<b>",BELAN TOLD ME TO PAY OUT ALL THE OFFICERS .."</b>
<P>

<center>	<b>Palmer</b></center>
<P>

151	The leaflet, Exhibit C (unlike Ex B), repeatedly named Mr Boner as well as
Mr Palmer.  Although Mr Boner had nothing to do with
the attack, the victim
may, in his response, deal with the complicity of third parties, provided the
allegations against them are
not wholly unconnected with the defence
(Gillooly,<b> The Law of Defamation in Australia and New Zealand</b>, p 178).
In <b><i>Loveday v Sun Newspapers Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2059%20CLR%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 59 CLR 503</a>, Dixon J
said:  (at 520)
<P>

	"But, if A attacks B and in order to defend himself B reasonably publishes
defamatory matter of C, who has been no party to the
attack, B's privilege will
protect him as against C (<i>Coward v Wellington</i> ((1836) <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1837/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1837] EngR 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7%20C%20%26%20P%20531" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">7 Car &amp; P 531</a>;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=173%20ER%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">173 ER 234)."</a>
<P>

152	The plaintiff submitted that the privilege was a shield and not a sword,
whereas the publications, which were supposedly a response
to Exhibit 1, were
in the nature of a counter offensive, not warranted by the attack.  Attention
was drawn to <b><i>News Media Ownership v Finlay</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20NZLR%201089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) NZLR 1089</a>,
where North P said this:  (at 1095)
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>"Mr McKay was right when he submitted that while violence of
language is not in itself enough to take away privilege even though it
may
provide evidence of malice, yet privilege is lost if the reply becomes a
counter attack raising allegations against the plaintiff
which are unrelated or
insufficiently related to the attack he made on the defendant.  In other words
he cannot claim the protection
of privilege if he decides to bring fresh
accusations against his adversary."
<P>

153	When responding to an attack, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish
between response and counter attack.  Indeed, Dixon J
in <b><i>Penton v
Calwell</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2070%20CLR%20219" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 70 CLR 219</a>, appeared to contemplate that a measure of
counter attack was permissible.  He said this:  (at 233)
<P>

	"When the privilege of the occasion arises from the making by the plaintiff of
some public attack upon the reputation or conduct
of the defendant or upon some
interest which he is entitled to protect, the purpose of the privilege is to
enable the defendant on
his part<b> freely to submit his answer, whether it be
strictly defensive or be by way of counter-attack</b>, to the public to whom
the plaintiff has appealed or before whom the plaintiff has attacked the
defendant.  The privilege is given
to him so that he may with impunity bring to
the minds of those before whom the attack was made any bona fide answer or
retort by
way of vindication which appears fairly warranted by the occasion."
(emphasis added)
<P>

154	The publications complained of and the response dealt with the same subject
(Ex 1).  They dealt with the payment of benefits
to former officers of the
Millers' Union, and the court action.  They did not introduce fresh
allegations.  The response (Exs B and
C) certainly had considerably more punch
than the attack.  Nonetheless, I believe it was within permissible limits.
<P>

155	I further believe that the defence is available to both defendants, not
simply Mr Belan.  The attack (Ex 1) named Mr Belan.
 However, it was a document
issued in the context of an election in which Mr Belan was leading the Frank
Belan Team.  An attack upon
him was an attack upon the team.  Mr Casey was a
member of that team.  He was entitled to participate (by publication) in the
response.
<P>

	<b>The Inclusion of Irrelevant Material</b>
<P>

156	The privilege attaches only to statements relevant to the occasion, or
which are in reply to the attack.  The following statement
in Exhibit B seems
to me to be irrelevant to any attack in Exhibit 1:
<P>

	"Indeed, I believe Ted Palmer is NOT supported by any other official in the
National Union of Workers NSW Branch, and they would
be foolish to give him
support."
<P>

157	However, that statement may be regarded as material which the defendants
were entitled to communicate to electors, protected
by their common
interest.
<P>

158	Exhibit C, in the reference to $46,525.51, included payments for accrued
leave, sick pay, holiday pay and other entitlements.
 The sum relating to the
retirement benefits under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 54</a> was, in the case of Mr Palmer, $21,368.72.
The inclusion of the higher amount was, implicitly, the inclusion of irrelevant
material.
<P>

159	However, I believe, subject to the plaintiff establishing malice, that the
defence of qualified privilege at common law has
been made out.
<P>

	<b>Qualified Privilege Under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></b>

160	The defendants rely upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>.  It is in these
terms:

<P>

	(b)	the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to him
information on that subject;  and
<P>

	(c)	the conduct of the publisher in publishing that matter is reasonable in

<P>

	there is a defence of qualified privilege for that publication."
<P>

161	It is convenient to move directly to a consideration of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22(1)(c).</a>  The
matters relevant to the satisfaction of that requirement were considered in
<b><i>Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20NSWLR%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1 NSWLR 697</a>,
where Reynolds JA said this:  (at 712)
<P>

	"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 22(1)(c)</a> calls for the consideration of a wide range of matters.
Some are to be found in the published material itself and the manner and
extent
of its publication, and others from the whole of the surrounding circumstances.
The connection between the subject and the
defamatory imputation remains
relevant.  It may be tenuous, or it may be real and substantial.  If what was
said includes comment,
it is reasonable to consider whether it was fair and
whether it followed logically from facts known or stated.  Questions of the
exercise of care before the defamatory utterance are also relevant, and
questions as to whether the maker of the statement knew whether
he was likely
to convey a misleading impression.  These are but examples of what I conceive
to be involved in the inquiry to be made
by the judge in order to determine
whether the defendant has satisfied him that it was reasonable of him to defame
the plaintiff
in the way he did."
<P>

162	A helpful analysis has also been provided by Hunt AJA in <b><i>Morgan v
John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 374</a>, where his Honour said
this:  (at 387)
<P>

	"In my opinion, all of those cases support the following propositions in
relation to the requirement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22(1)(c)</a> that the conduct of the defendant in
publishing the matter was reasonable in the circumstances;
<P>

	(1)	The conduct must have been reasonable in the circumstances to publish each
imputation fround to have been in fact conveyed
by the matter complained of.
The more serious the imputation conveyed, the greater the obligation upon the
defendant to ensure that
his conduct in relation to it was reasonable. ....
<P>

	(2)	If the defendant intended to convey any imputation in fact conveyed, he
must ... have believed in the truth of that imputation.
<P>

	(3)	If the defendant did not intend to convey any particular imputation in
fact conveyed, he must establish:
<P>

	(a)	that (subject to the same exceptions) he believed in the truth of each
imputation which he did intend to convey;  and
<P>

	(b)	that his conduct was nevertheless reasonable in the circumstances in
relation to each imputation which he did not intend to
convey but which was in
fact conveyed."
<P>

163	Having given a number of illustrations, his Honour continued:  (at 388)
<P>

	"(4)	The defendant must also establish:
<P>

	(a)	that, before publishing the matter complained of, he exercised reasonable
care to ensure that he got his conclusions right,
(where appropriate) by making
proper inquiries and checking on the accuracy of his sources;
<P>

	(b)	that his conclusions (whether statements of fact or expressions of
opinion) followed logically, fairly and reasonably from
the information which
he had obtained;
<P>

	(c)	that the manner and extent of the publication did not exceed what was
reasonably required in the circumstances;  and
<P>

	(d)	that each imputation intended to be conveyed was relevant to the subject
about which he is giving information to his readers."
<P>

164	Turning to the evidence, broadly, there are two possibilities.  The first
is that Mr Belan, as he proclaimed, was ignorant of
the evidence before Hill J,
and the judgments given by his Honour in respect of the merits and costs (apart
from the orders made).
 On this view, Mr Belan had failed to undertake what may
be thought to be basic research before publishing Exhibits B and C.
<P>

165	The second alternative is the one that I favour as a matter of probability
(supra p 26).  Mr Belan was well aware of the evidence
of Mr Palmer.  He was
well aware of the critical findings of Hill J, both as to the merits of his
dispute with the former officers
of the Millers' Union, and the order for
costs.  Notwithstanding that awareness, he nonetheless published Exhibits B and
C.
<P>

166	In either case, it appears to me plain that Mr Belan is not able to satisfy
the stringent requirements of the test formulated
in respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22(1)(c).</a>
The documents published, in the conclusions they offer, are, in a number of
respects, inaccurate.  I will deal more fully with those
inaccuracies in the
context of the defence of Comment below.  The documents complained of (or at
least Ex C) purported to deal with
the court case, and the retiring allowances,
and yet omit the following matters (which appear in the various judgments of
Hill J),
which I regard as fundamental to an accurate and reasonable
presentation of the facts:
<P>

(a)	That the retirement allowances related to past service.
<P>

(b)	That  no provision had been made to carry forward such benefits in the new
Union.
<P>

(c)	That, in these circumstances, his Honour had found that Mr Belan had
directed the Millers' Union, as one would expect, to discharge
all liabilities
before the amalgamation took place.
<P>

167	To publish the imputations contained in Exhibits B and C, in circumstances
where these matters were omitted, was misleading
and unfair.  Mr Belan knew
only too well that the impression created was misleading.  His conduct, as
publisher, in these circumstances,
was, therefore, not reasonable in my
view.
<P>

168	Is Mr Casey able to take advantage of the defence provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22?</a>  Mr
Casey gave evidence that he relied upon Mr Belan for the facts.  He saw some
transcript of the court case.  He also was shown
certain ledgers.  However, he
did not read the judgments of Hill J, although he had been put on notice of its
terms, having read
the plaintiffs' pamphlet (Ex G).
<P>

169	I do not believe that Mr Casey's conduct in publishing Exhibit C was
reasonable, he having not done what I regard as basic research.
 I am not
satisfied that either defendant has made out the defence of Qualified Privilege
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>.
<P>

	<b>The Defence of Comment</b>
<P>

170	It is convenient to postpone, for the moment, the consideration of whether
the plaintiffs have proved that the publications
were actuated by malice, and
to consider, instead, the defence of Comment which is also raised.
<P>

171	The defence is dealt with in Division 7 of the Act.  A number of conditions
must be satisfied before the defence is available,.
<P>

172	First, the defendants must establish that the imputations were conveyed as
a comment, rather than as statements of fact (<b><i>Radio 2UE Sydney Pty
Limited v Parker</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 448</a>, per Clarke JA at 468).  This is
done by establishing two matters (<b><i>Bickel v John Fairfax &amp; Sons
Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 474)</a> per Hunt J:  (at 490)
<P>

	"(a)	whether the ordinary reasonable reader would have understood the
statement as having been intended by its author to be an
expression of opinion
upon sufficiently indicated material;  and
<P>

	(b)	whether the opinion is one which an honest man might have held on that
material."
<P>

173	Secondly, the comment must satisfy one or other limbs of s 30(3), which is
in these terms:
<P>

	"30(3)	  The defences under this Division are available as to any comment if,
but only if:
<P>

	(a)	the comment is based on proper material for comment;  or
<P>

	(b)	the material on which the comment is based is to some extent proper
material for comment and the comment represents an opinion
which might
reasonably be based on that material to the extent to which it is proper
material for comment."
<P>

A statement of fact which is substantially true is proper material for comment
(s 30(2)).  Hunt J in <b><i>Bob Kay Real Estate v Amalgamated Television
Services Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 505</a>, explained the difference between
the requirements of s 30(3)(a) and (b) in these terms:  (at 517)
<P>

	"The point made is that, where the defendant has established that the whole of
the basis for the comment is proper material for
comment, what was published is
comment if the opinion is one which might <i>honestly</i> be based on that
material;  but where the defendant has only established that part of the basis
for the comment is proper material
for comment, what was published can be
defended as comment only if the opinion is one which might <i>reasonably</i> be
based upon that which has been established to be proper material for comment.
The difference between the two concepts is substantial:
 cf <i>Turner v
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%201%20All%20ER%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 1 All ER 449</a> at 461.  It is obvious
from what was said there, I suggest, that a jury would be quite lost if the
trial judge did not tautologically
use the word `honest' in order to draw a
distinction between the two concepts involved."
<P>

174	Thirdly, the comment must relate to a matter of public interest (s 31).
<P>

175	Having satisfied these requirements, the defence may yet be defeated if the
plaintiff were able to show that, at the time the
comment was made, it did not
represent the opinion of the defendant (s 32(2)).
<P>

176	Dealing with these issues somewhat out of order, it is convenient to
dispose of the third condition, namely that the comment
must relate to a matter
of public interest.  A useful commentary upon the concept of public interest
was provided by Lord Denning
in <b><i>London Artist v Littler</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1968/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] EWCA Civ 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%202%20QB%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 2
QB 375</a> at 391:
<P>

	"I would not myself confine it within narrow limits.  Whenever a matter is
such as to effect people at large, so that they may
be legitimately interested
in, or concerned at, what is going on, or what may happen to them or to others,
then it is a matter of
public interest on which everyone is entitled to make
fair comment."
<P>

185 CLR 183</a> at 215.
<P>

178	In the context of a union election, the candidates were entitled to have
their say, and the electors, no doubt, were interested
in what they had to say.
I believe comments relating to the union election were comments relating to a
matter of public interest
within the meaning of s 31.
<P>

179	Turning next to the second condition, the plaintiff asserted that a number
of statements in Exhibits B and C were false, so
that the defendants were
obliged to satisfy the more stringent requirements of s 30(3)(b).  I will now
deal with that suggestion.
<P>

180	In respect of Exhibit B, the letter signed by Mr Belan, the plaintiff
asserted that the following facts within that letter were
false:
<P>

	(a)	"This pamphlet contains the ... statement that I, as State Secretary of
this union, permitted the officials of the old Millers'
union to pay .... (a)
retirement benefit when in fact, they had continuation of employment under the
amalgamated union."
<P>

	(b)	"In fact, it was Ted Palmer who authorised those payments to union
officials involved - NOT ME."
<P>

	(c)	"... Ted Palmer ... was responsible for" (the payments).
<P>

	(d)	(Ted Palmer) "fought bitterly to keep the money".
<P>

181	I have dealt with the first three matters (paras (a) to (c)) already (supra
pp 17-19).  I am satisfied, as a matter of probability,
that Mr Belan told Mr
Palmer to pay out the officers of the Millers' Union before amalgamation, as
required by law (in respect of
annual holidays etc), and the union rules (in
respect of retirement benefits under Rule 54).  I accept, therefore, that the
defendants
have not demonstrated, as a matter of probability, that the
statements in (a), (b) and (c) are substantially true.
<P>

182	In respect of para (d), the plaintiff asserted that it was simply untrue to
suggest that Mr Palmer had fought bitterly to keep
the money.  On 19 October
1992 (supra p 13, para 31), Mr Palmer spoke to Mr Belan concerning the
repayment of the money.  A special
meeting of Branch Secretaries was convened.
Mr Palmer was advised that, even were the money repaid, no guarantee could be
given that
charges would not be laid (Ex E, p 478).  That conversation took
place before charges were laid on 28 October 1992 (supra p 13).
 Indeed, Hill J
made the following comment before determining that it was appropriate to award
indemnity costs (Ex E, p 478):
<P>

	"In my view the applicants made all reasonable attempts to settle the matter;
and they made those attempts prior to the institution
of these proceedings and
indeed prior to the actual laying of charges by Mr Belan - which were laid on
28 October 1992 in accordance
with the resolution of the COM on that day."
<P>

183	The defendants, therefore, have not satisfied me that the matter asserted
in para (d) is substantially true.
<P>

184	Accordingly, in respect to the publication of Exhibit B, para (a) to (d)
cannot be regarded as proper material for comment.
<P>

185	Turning, then, to the leaflet, Exhibit C, the plaintiff asserted the
following facts were false (Ex R):
<P>

	(a)	"Palmer &amp; Boner commenced the court action to stop the Committee of
Management looking at their use of union funds."
<P>

	(b)	Under a heading "The Payouts", the publication asserted that the
plaintiffs "paid themselves redundancy", "took redundancy
payments" and did
certain things "after paying themselves redundancy".
<P>

	(c)	"They used union funds to re-imburse tax deducted from their payments."
<P>

	(d)	The statement "Belan told me to pay out all the officers ... Palmer" in
the context of the heading "Sometimes you just can't
believe your ears!", and
the three "great lies" which were recited.  The plaintiffs say that it was
false to suggest that Mr Palmer's
statement was a lie.
<P>

	(e)	"Palmer doesn't deny taking $46,525.51 out of the union", where only
$21,368.72 related to payments under Rule 54.  Only that
sum, and the tax
related to it ($339.19), formed the basis of the charges, and the case before
Hill J.  It was false to suggest the
higher sum.
<P>

	(f)	The statement that "the court case" was commenced "over members' money" is
false.  That was not the reason for the court case,
and it was not members'
money.
<P>

186	Dealing with each of these matters, in respect of para (a), the plaintiff
asserted that the court action was to prevent oppression,
and a departure by
the union from its Rules.  The order sought was to restrain the Committee of
Management from proceeding to hear
the charges.  It was not aimed at preventing
the Committee from examining, if it chose, the use of union funds by former
officials
of the Millers' Union.
<P>

187	There is some merit in that submission.  However, the Committee of
Management was proposed to examine the use of union funds
by Messrs Palmer and
Boner (and another officer).  They had in mind doing so, no doubt, in the
context of the charges which had been
preferred.  On balance, I believe that
the statement is substantially true, and accordingly is proper material for
comment.
<P>

188	Turning next to para (b), Rule 54 referred to these payments as a "retiring
allowance".  The difference in the nomenclature
is important.  A retiring
allowance suggests a payment for past service.  That is precisely what Hill J
found was the nature of the
payment.  The word "redundancy", coupled, as it was
on two occasions in Exhibit C, with a statement (which was true) that the
officials
did not have a day off work, was quite misleading (cf <b><i>R v Lord
Kylsant</i></b> (1932) 1 KB 442).  It may be permissible to use the word
"redundancy" loosely to describe the payment (cf McNally &amp; Co letter
29
October 1991 (supra p 9, para 23)), provided that it is made clear, first, that
the payment was, under the union rules, an accrued
benefit based upon past
service;  secondly, that no provision had been made for it to be carried
forward into the National Union
of Workers;  and, thirdly, that the officers
had no security of tenure in that union, but held office subject to being
re-elected
every four years.  I believe that, in the context in which it was
used in Exhibit C, the word "redundancy" was false.  The defendants,
therefore,
have not persuaded me that it was substantially true, and therefore, proper
material for comment.
<P>

189	The statement in para (c) was also false.  Tax was deducted which the
auditors advised should not have been deducted.  The responsibility
for the
payment of tax rested with the individual officers, not the union.  It was not
true to describe the money paid for the purposes
of reimbursement as "union
funds".  That statement falsely suggested that the officers had used money to
which they were not entitled
to discharge a liability which was truly theirs.
I do not, therefore, regard the statement in para (c) as proper material for
comment.
<P>

190	Paragraph (d) has been dealt with.  It was false to suggest that Mr Belan
had not told Mr Palmer to pay out all the officers.
 He had.  The statement,
likewise, was not proper material for comment.
<P>

191	Dealing with para (e), it was not substantially true, in the context of the
court case, and the reference to "redundancy" (being
Rule 54 payments) to speak
of Mr Palmer "taking $46,525.51".  He was paid $21,368.72.  It is repeated at
the end of the same page
("Did Palmer tell you about his $46,525.51 payout?").
The reference to "payout" is a reference to "the payouts" described on page
1
of the leaflet.  They, in turn, are referable to the court case, and Rule 54.
The figure in the leaflet, therefore, is false. 
The statements which include
that figure are not proper material for comment.
<P>

192	Finally, para (f) is a misdescription of the nature of the court case, and
the entitlements of Messrs Palmer and Boner to payments
under Rule 54.  It was
false to describe such monies as "members' money".  Accordingly, that statement
is not proper material for
comment.
<P>

193	Accordingly, the defendants have not satisfied s 30(3)(a).  For the
purposes of dealing with s 30(3)(b) it is convenient to
assume, in the
defendants' favour, that the imputations to which the publications gave rise
were conveyed as comment, rather than
as statements of fact.  The issue then
becomes whether, based on the material within Exhibits B and C which is
substantially true,
the comment made by the defendants represents an opinion
which might reasonably be based upon such material.  Both publications are
emasculated when one disregards that material which is not proper material for
comment.  I do not believe, based upon what remains,
that it can be said that
the defendants have established that the comments made represent an opinion
which might reasonably be based
upon such material.
<P>

194	Finally, there are issues arising under s 32(2).  The principle is
encapsulated in Gillooly <b>The Law of Defamation in Australia and New
Zealand</b>, in these words:  (at 140)
<P>

	"Where the defendant is the maker of the comment, the s 32 defence will only
be forfeited if the plaintiff proves that `the comment
did not represent the
opinion of the defendant' (s 32(2)).  The motives of the commentator (including
whether he or she is actuated
by malice) are irrelevant - the issue is whether
the commentator genuinely believed in the truth of the comment (<i>Bickel v
John Fairfax &amp; Sons </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%20475" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 NSWLR 475</a> at 491, 493).  Hence if a
defendant asserts that he or she did not intend to convey the imputation found
by the tribunal of fact
to have been conveyed by way of comment, then the
defence must fail since `a person who states that he did not intend to convey a
particular defamatory imputation cannot reasonably be taken to have held the
opinion represented by that imputation' (<i>Lloyd v David Syme</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3
NSWLR 728</a> at 736, per Lord Keith)."
<P>

195	Here the defendants may each be regarded as the maker of the statements.
The plaintiffs' administered interrogatories to each
defendant, asking whether
they intended to convey each of the imputations which the Court has now found
were conveyed.  Each defendant
responded in the negative.  This is a further
reason why the defence of Comment is not made out. 
<P>

	<b>Was the Publication Actuated by Malice?</b>
<P>

196	Having found that the defence of qualified privilege at common law was
established by the defendants, it is necessary to consider
whether the
plaintiffs have established that the defendants were actuated by malice.
<P>

197	The onus rests upon the plaintiffs to prove malice.  Judges and juries are
enjoined "to be very slow to draw the inference that
a defendant was so far
actuated by improper motives as to deprive him of the protection of the
privilege ..."  (per Lord Diplock,
<b><i>Horrocks v Lowe</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 135</a>
at 149).
<P>

198	The motivation of the defendant, in publishing the defamatory material, is
crucial.  Lord Diplock, in the same case, said this:
 (at 149)
<P>

	"So he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless some other dominant
and improper motive on his part is proved.  `Express
malice' is the term of art
descriptive of such a motive.  Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular
sense of a desire to injure
the person who is defamed and this is generally the
motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove."
<P>

199	Knowledge that someone will be injured by the publication is not enough, if
the defendant is nevertheless acting in the bona
fide protection of his own
legitimate interests.
<P>

200	Lord Diplock, in the same case, added:  (at 149/150)
<P>

	"The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be
inferred from what he did or said or knew.  If it be proved
that he did not
believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence
of express malice, for no sense of
duty or desire to protect his own legitimate
interests can justify a man in telling deliberate and injurious falsehoods
about another,
save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty
to pass on, without endorsing, defamatory reports made by some other
person."
<P>

201	Mr Casey, on this issue, is unquestionably in a different position to Mr
Belan.  I will refer to those differences later in
this judgment.  Lord Diplock
formulated the following test, relevant to Mr Casey, in these words:  (at
150)
<P>

	"If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or
caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as
in other branches of the
law, treated as if he knew it to be false.  But indifference to the truth of
what he publishes is not to
be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or
irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true."
<P>

202	Express malice may arise where it is proved that the defendant misused the
occasion for some purpose other than that for which
the privilege is given.
Lord Diplock said this:  (at 150)
<P>

	"The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant
is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to
protect the relevant
interest, but to give vent to his personal spite or ill will towards the person
he defames.  If this be proved,
then even positive belief in the truth of what
is published will not enable the defamer to avail himself of the protection of
the
privilege to which he would otherwise have been entitled."
<P>

	
<P>

203	Lord Diplock added:  (at 151)
<P>

	"It is only where his desire to comply with the relevant duty or to protect
the relevant interest plays no significant part in
his motives for publishing
what he believes to be true that `express malice' can properly be found."
<P>

204	The written submissions of the defendants sought to encapsulate these
principles in these words:
<P>

	"To succeed on malice, the plaintiffs had to prove that the defendants
either:
<P>

	(a)	lacked an honest belief in the truth of the matters complained of;  or
<P>

	(b)	were motivated by some other dominant or improper motive."
<P>

205	They added, drawing upon the speech of Lord Diplock in <b><i>Horrocks v
Lowe</i></b>:
<P>

	"The privilege is not to be destroyed by carelessness, impulsiveness,
irrationality (150B-C), prejudice, relying on intuition instead
of reasoning,
leaping to conclusions on inadequate evidence, failing to recognise the cogency
of contrary material (150D), dislike,
indignation (151A), obstinacy,
pig-headedness, stupidity, obtuseness (152A-B), even gross and unreasoning
prejudice (152G)."
<P>

206	Did Mr Belan have an honest belief in the truth of what he published in
Exhibits B and C?  Mr Belan gave the following evidence
in respect of each
publication:  (T 92)
<P>

	"Q.	At the time you signed the document did what was in it express opinions
which you held?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Have you changed those opinions in any respect?
<P>

	A.	No, no."
<P>

207	Mr Palmer was cross examined as to his understanding of Mr Belan's views.
He said this:  (T 64)
<P>

	"Q.	Mr Belan ... already raised with you, expressed disagreement to you, over
the payment of the retirement allowance first in
late September or perhaps
early October 1992, correct?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	You have already agreed with some of the things that were said in that
initial conversation.  The attitude he expressed then
never changed, did it,
that was the position he took throughout?
<P>

	A.	Probably."
<P>

208	I have accepted that Mr Belan directed Mr Palmer to discharge all
liabilities before amalgamation, including those arising under
the rules.  I,
nonetheless, accept that when the payment under Rule 54 came to Mr Belan's
notice in September 1992, he was disturbed.
 He may well have believed, at that
time, that such payments were "socially and morally wrong" because the officers
of the Millers'
Union had continuity of employment with the National Union of
Workers.
<P>

209	However, the Court is not dealing with the publication of Mr Belan's views
in September 1992.  I recognise that people may stubbornly
cling to their
beliefs, and yet be honest.  They may do so, notwithstanding evidence that
appears to demonstrate that their beliefs
are wrong.  They may even do so when
their beliefs are put to the test, in a court of law, and found wanting.
People are not always
rational, and yet they may be honest.
<P>

210	In this matter, however, I do not believe that Mr Belan was irrational.
Nor do I believe that his views were unchanging in the
years that followed
September 1992.  I have formed the view that Mr Belan lacked an honest belief
in the truth of a number of statements
in the publications, Exhibits B and C.
Many of the statements appearing in the publication were simply false, and
false to his knowledge.
 They do not depend upon any change in view on the part
of Mr Belan.  They were fundamental to the message which Mr Belan sought
to
convey by each publication.  Substantially, they formed the basis for the
imputations which were conveyed.
<P>

211	First, both publications repeatedly stated that the State Secretary, Mr
Belan, did not give a direction to Mr Palmer to pay
out the officers of the
Millers' Union.  At the time of each publication in July 1994, Mr Belan,
however, knew that he had given
such a direction, and that it was false to
suggest otherwise.
<P>

212	Secondly, Mr Belan knew that Mr Palmer had not "fought bitterly to keep the
money".  An offer of repayment had been made, and
repeated the same day (19
October 1992) (supra p 13, para 31) to the Branch Secretaries.  It was
rebuffed.  The offer was a prominent
aspect of the judgment of Hill J on costs.
That judgment (unlike the judgment on the merits) was not long.  Hill J awarded
indemnity
costs.  He did so, in part, precisely because Mr Palmer had made
every reasonable effort to settle the matter beforehand.  I believe,
as a
matter of probability, that Mr Belan was aware of the terms of Hill J's
judgment on costs.  It had, no doubt, significant financial
implications, since
the matter had been protracted.  Mr Belan gave instructions to appeal.  I find,
therefore, that Mr Belan had
no honest belief in the statement which suggested
that Mr Palmer had fought bitterly to keep the retirement money.
<P>

213	Thirdly, the repeated use of the phrase "redundancy payment" in Exhibit C,
and the coupling of that phrase with references to
continuity of employment by
Messrs Palmer and Boner was, I believe, deliberately misleading.  Whatever Mr
Belan's first impression
of the payments under Rule 54 (in September 1992), I
do not accept that that impression endured.  In October 1992, Mr Belan, and
other members of the Committee of Management, were provided with an opinion of
Mr Richard Kenzie QC dealing with the payments under
Rule 54.  The opinion was
provided shortly before charges were laid on 28 October 1992.  Mr Kenzie
appeared for the plaintiffs before
Hill J.  It can be inferred that the opinion
put before the Committee of Management was the same as the submission made by
Mr Kenzie
to the Industrial Court, which Hill J summarised in these words:
(Exhibit D, p 435)
<P>

	"I agree with the submissions of counsel for the applicants that the rule was
a `cover the field' provision intended to confer
benefits in the nature of
`retirement' benefits based on past service to the Millers and should not be
narrowly construed."
<P>

214	In June 1993 Hill J, in the extracts which have been quoted, found that the
plaintiffs were entitled to the payments under Rule
54 "as a matter of law, and
of merit" (supra p 22).  Mr Belan appealed.  He then withdrew his appeal
(except on costs).  He was the
only respondent to have contested the matter
before Hill J.  He was the one who gave instructions to lawyers, and received
advice
from them.  He was, as he acknowledged, a dominant figure in the union.
I infer from his involvement in this process that he knew
of the findings in
respect of Rule 54, and eventually had an understanding of the merits.  I
infer, therefore, before he gave instructions
to withdraw the appeal, that he
knew, first, that Mr Palmer had given evidence, which had been accepted by the
Judge, that he had
directed the discharge of all liabilities before
amalgamation;  secondly, that the payments under Rule 54 were in the nature of
accrued
benefits relating to past service;  and thirdly, that no provision had
been made in the rules of the National Union of Workers to
carry forward such
benefits.
<P>

215	I am prepared to accept that Mr Belan may have harboured a residual feeling
of grievance in respect of the Rule 54 payments,
arising from the rate of pay
adopted when calculating those entitlements.  Rule 54 provided that the
officers' entitlement was to
be calculated at the "current rate of salary"
(supra p 6).  Upon absorption into the federation, and before amalgamation,
officers
of the Millers' Union received a pay increase, presumably to bring
them in line with other unions in the federation.  On 25 March
1992, the
Millers' Union passed the following resolution (Ex D, p 423) (supra p 10, para
25):
<P>

	"That seeing <i>as superannuation had been made available</i> to the
officials, and staff <i>from 1 February 1991</i>, all parties agreed to waive
their time right under the rules for the period from 1 February 1991 to
date.
<P>

	However, the benefit of accrual ie 3 weeks per year of service should be
calculated at the enhanced rate of pay as provided for
the Federation. ..."
<P>

216	Hill J made the following remarks in the course of his judgment:  (Ex D, p
442)
<P>

	"... it is sufficient to say that those salary rates were used following and
in accordance with advice provided to the Millers
by its solicitors, W G
McNally &amp; Co.  In my opinion, they were, in law, the correct rates to use
for the purposes of the calculation
despite that they resulted only from the
agreement to associate and amalgamate with the other unions.  <b>While in all
of the circumstances it may have been more prudent and appropriate to have
exercised the same restraint in relation to
salary rates </b>as was exercised
in relation to the calculation of the years of service this consideration does
not in my view affect the legality
of what was done."  (emphasis added)
<P>

217	If Mr Belan believed that the rate of payment was wrong, and extravagant,
he could have said so.  No doubt the law would have
protected him.  However, he
chose not to do so.  Instead, without any belief in the truth of what he was
alleging, he attacked the
fact that any payment had been made under Rule 54,
and imputed stealing to those who had received such payments.  Mr Belan, I
believe,
knew the payments under Rule 54 were retirement benefits, and were
called a "Retirement Allowance" under the rule.  He also knew
they were
benefits for past service, so that continuity of employment was irrelevant.  I
believe, therefore, he had no honest belief
in the misleading description of
these benefits in Exhibit C.
<P>

218	Thirdly, I accept, as a matter of probability, that Mr Belan knew that it
was quite misleading, and indeed false, to suggest
that the plaintiffs had used
union funds to reimburse taxation deducted from their payments.  The issue of
taxation was dealt with
throughout the hearing before Hill J, and in the course
of his Honour's judgment.  I believe it probable that (for the reasons
previously
stated), Mr Belan either read or was made aware of Hill J's findings
on this, amongst other, issues.  The monies had been withheld
by the union in
the mistaken belief that it was responsible for the payment of taxation.  The
auditors disabused the union.  It was
the responsibility of the officers who
had been paid the allowances.  The union had not made these payments.
Accordingly, the taxation
withheld was refunded, so that the persons
responsible could attend to its payment.
<P>

219	Fourthly, I have little doubt that Mr Belan knew that Mr Palmer had been
paid approximately $21,000 under Rule 54, and not $46,000.
 The figure of
$21,368.72 was the amount which Mr Belan had directed Mr Palmer to pay.  That
sum thereafter appeared in two of the
charges laid against Mr Palmer by Mr
Belan.  The correct amount of the payments under Rule 54 (namely $21,368.72)
appeared on a number
of occasions throughout the judgment of Hill J.  The
larger figure (which, if it can be justified, presumably included other
entitlements,
such as annual holidays etc) was simply part of the
misinformation which, I believe, was designed to harm Mr Palmer.
<P>

220	In each of these four respects, I find that Mr Belan did not have an honest
belief in the truth of the statements which appeared
in the publications.  In
publishing the material with these falsehoods, he was actuated by malice.  He
wished to harm the electoral
prospects of Messrs Palmer and Boner, and,
thereby, enhance his own, and those of Mr Casey.
<P>

221	Mr Casey was differently placed to Mr Belan.  He had not lived through the
court case before Hill J, nor the appeal.  His knowledge,
therefore, was
incomplete compared to that of Mr Belan.  Indeed, his knowledge concerning the
retirement benefits and court case
substantially derived from Mr Belan (T 151).
He had been made a member of the Frank Belan Team.  He was the candidate
nominated by
the team in opposition to Mr Palmer.  He was a young man, entering
union politics.  He had previously been a delegate.  Mr Belan,
the leader of
the team, was a seasoned union official.  He plainly dominated Mr Casey.  Mr
Casey, nonetheless, was the beneficiary
of the attack made by Exhibit C upon Mr
Palmer.
<P>

222	Mr Casey knew that Mr Belan had lost the court case.  He knew that the
court had determined that the payments to officials from
the Millers' Union
were legitimate (T 152).  He must surely have appreciated, therefore, that Mr
Belan's version may be suspect.
 Yet he did not read the judgment of Hill J.
It did not occur to him to do so (T 157).
<P>

223	Mr Casey, however, did read a pamphlet published by the plaintiffs (and one
other officer) in July 1993.  It was a document
designed to inform the
membership of the outcome of the litigation before the Industrial Court (Ex G).
That pamphlet should also
have alerted Mr Casey to the possibility that Mr
Belan's version was false, and had been found by the court to have been false.
The
pamphlet included the following:
<P>

	"The amalgamation process however did not address the question as to what
would happen to previously accrued benefits under different
rules and acts of
the various unions, ....."
<P>

224	It continued:
<P>

	"The State Secretary elect, Frank Belan had made it quite clear the new
organisation would not pay the amalgamating unions' debts,
their liabilities
would have to be cleared where-ever possible.
<P>

	Including, but not restricted to, untaken sick leave, (where payout of untaken
sick leave was authorised) accrued annual leave
(no more than 4 weeks would be
acceptable) and retirement or loss of office payments.  These debts of the
union were to be cleared
before the union ceased to exist.  The other unions, I
presume, were told the same thing, because they did in fact do exactly as
we
did."
<P>

225	The pamphlet referred to advice that had been provided to the union by
solicitors and auditors, which the officials had acted
upon.  It then said
this:
<P>

	"All the orders sought were granted against the Branch Committee of
Management, completely vindicating your officials, executive,
auditors and
legal advisors of any wrong doing.  I would add, all the Branch Committee of
Management except the State Secretary,
Frank Belan, agreed to abide by the
court's decision."
<P>

226	I believe that the appropriate inference, in the circumstances, is that Mr
Casey published Exhibit C recklessly.  He neither
considered, nor really cared,
whether it was true or false.
<P>

227	It was submitted by the defendants that it was not open to infer an absence
of honest belief in the material published, since
neither defendant was cross
examined upon that basis.  The cross examination was confined to the sources of
their knowledge, which
is a different issue.  No doubt it would have been
helpful to me had Mr Belan been cross examined as to his beliefs.  It may have
been fairer to have done so.  Nonetheless, I believe that the issue was
sufficiently raised in the documentary material which was
tendered, without
objection, and especially the judgments of the Industrial Court.  I believe
that the findings that I have made,
therefore, are appropriate.
<P>

228	There was also evidence of malice, in the sense of spite, upon the basis of
which the plaintiffs' submitted that the defendants
(and specifically Mr Belan)
were motivated by "some other dominant or improper motive" in publishing the
material.  The basis of
that suggestion can be summarised as follows:
<P>

&#183;	First, the cordial relationship between the plaintiffs and Mr Belan
soured in September 1992 as a result of the dispute concerning
the Rule 54
payments.
<P>

&#183;	Second, Mr Belan then charged the plaintiffs with various offences under
the union rules, including misappropriation.
<P>

&#183;	Third, the validity of those charges was then litigated.  Whilst
awaiting judgment there was the incident concerning the
silver bullet (supra p
19), which I accept was intended to be menacing to Mr Boner.
<P>

&#183;	Fourth, the judgment of Hill J was given on 28 June 1993.  It was the
first in a series of reversals for Mr Belan at the
hands of the plaintiffs.  He
was trenchantly criticised in the course of the judgement.
<P>

&#183;	Fifth, there was the further judgment on 8 October 1993 concerning
costs.  It was a further reversal, and included yet more
criticism.  Indemnity
costs were ordered against, amongst others, Mr Belan.
<P>

&#183;	Sixth, there was the confirmation by the Full Court of the costs order
by Hill J, singling out Mr Belan.
<P>

&#183;	Seventh, there was the pamphlet (Ex G) in July 1993 prepared by the
plaintiffs (and one other officer).  They repeated the
criticisms of Hill J,
and added their own.
<P>

&#183;	Eighth, in May 1994 Mr Belan called a meeting to determine the ticket in
the forthcoming union election.  He called for unqualified
support.  Messrs
Boner and Palmer did not feel themselves able to give that support.  They
walked out of the meeting.  Mr Boner thereafter
joined the opposition team (the
Rank and File Team).  Mr Palmer was also associated with that team, and stood
in opposition to Mr
Belan's candidate, Mr Casey.
<P>

&#183;	Ninth, there was a further episode involving Mr Boner in May 1995.  I
will deal separately with that issue, and then return
to the question of
malice.
<P>

229	Mr Boner and Mr Palmer both lost the election.  They each left the
industry.  Mr Boner obtained employment as an Enterprise
Bargain Facilitator
for the New South Wales Furnishing Industry Association.  He was appointed for
a twelve month period, beginning
in January 1995.  On 2 May 1995, he attended a
meeting at Dunlop Bedding.  Mr Casey, and delegates from the National Union of
Workers,
were present at that meeting.  Mr Casey came into the meeting room
late.  He apologised.  He then made the following statement, according
to the
recollection of Mr Boner:  (T 74)
<P>

	"... and he indicated he had been instructed by the state secretary that the
delegates of the NUW and himself were not allowed
to sit in on meetings that an
ex-official of the NUW was at because he was taking action against the state
secretary in court and
he wanted to get legal advice, and with that the meeting
was sort of stopped."
<P>

230	On 12 May 1995 Mr Boner received a telephone call from the manager of
Dunlop Bedding.  He recounted that call in these words:
 (T 75)
<P>

	"... he informed me verbally over the telephone that a delegate, on site
delegate had come to him and indicated that they would
not be attending any
other meetings where I was in attendance."
<P>

231	On 31 May 1995 there was a further incident.  A similar meeting had been
arranged at the premises of Nobby's Kitchens.  The
National Union of Workers
were represented at that site.  Mr Boner described what happened in these
words:  (T 75)
<P>

	"About 25 minutes, may be longer, Alice Green who was an organiser and I think
a spokesperson for the unions on that site - there
were three divisions of the
CFMEU on that site - indicated that they were supporting the NUW in whatever
action they decided to take
and that (they) would not attend any meeting where
I was in attendance."
<P>

232	Mr Casey acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Boner's account (T 142).  He
declined to be in the same room (T 143).  He gave his
reasons in these words:
(T 142)
<P>

	"My reason was that we had an ongoing defamation case and I was told by the
State Secretary and received legal advice to say that
it would be detrimental
to me to be in the same room as him because either Dennis - Dennis could say
that I said things to him that
could be used in the defamation case."
<P>

233	Mr Belan, who gave Mr Casey the direction not to participate, described his
reasons for that instruction as follows:  (T 111)
<P>

	"Q.	And Arthur Casey had said to the meeting that he had been instructed by
the State Secretary, yourself, that delegates of the
NUW and Arthur Casey were
not allowed to sit in on meetings with an ex-official of the NUW because he was
taking action against the
State Secretary?
<P>

	A.	No, that was not, that is not what I - what I said, I said that we should
not participate in discussions until such time as
we get legal advice in
respect of the matter because of the proceedings in court.  Legal advice.  I
made it very clear that there
should be legal advice because there may be
problems with it."
<P>

234	His evidence continued:
<P>

	"Q.	Did you ever get legal advice?
<P>

	A.	Yes we did.
<P>

	Q.	When was that?
<P>

	A.	Soon after that we rang up lawyers and they said `Maybe it's better if you
didn't participate' because in addition to it, in
addition to it I didn't think
that it would be a fair and reasonable outcome or discussion if you have people
discussing the issue
that they are in conflict over, the legal issues."
<P>

235	These conferences occurred after the plaintiffs had issued the Statements
of Claim for defamation against the defendants, these
being the actions which
are presently before the Court.  I accept that the presence of Mr Boner on 2
May 1995, in such circumstances,
was awkward.  He was the plaintiff, and Mr
Casey the defendant.  It was reasonable that Mr Belan should seek legal advice,
and that
Mr Casey should refrain from participating in any conference pending
that advice.  If the episode were to end there, one would think
nothing of it.
However, it does not end there.  There was, thereafter, a refusal to deal with
Mr Boner, not only by Mr Casey, but
by other delegates.  More than that, other
unions were apparently persuaded to join in the boycott.
<P>

236	No lawyer was called to confirm the advice allegedly given.  One could
understand advice that Mr Casey should refrain from speaking
to Mr Palmer on
the subject of the litigation, or indeed, any aspect of the National Union of
Workers' affairs, relating to a time
when Mr Boner was an officer of that
union.  It is difficult to understand how a lawyer could advise the course that
was in fact
pursued.  Such a course was unfair to Mr Boner, jeopardising his
role as a Facilitator.  It was also capable of being regarded as
malice in the
defamation proceedings.  Indeed, the solicitors for the plaintiffs, some time
after (1 August 1995), sent a letter
to the defendants calling upon the
National Union of Workers to cease such conduct.  The same letter stated that
the episodes would
be relied upon as evidence of malice.
<P>

237	Returning to the issue of malice, should it be inferred, upon the basis of
the nine matters identified, that Mr Belan acted
out of malice in publishing
Exhibits B and C?  Before answering that question, I should deal with a
submission by the defendants,
based, in part,  upon the remarks of Hunt J in
<b><i>Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1 NSWLR 1</a>, where his Honour said this:  (at 22/23)
<P>

	"There are many reasons why it should be made clear, prior to final addresses
and by way of cross-examination or otherwise, not
only that the evidence of the
witness <i>is</i> to be challenged but also <i>how</i> it is to be challenged.
Firstly, it gives the witness the opportunity to deny the challenge on oath, to
show his mettle under attack
(so to speak), although this may often be of
little value.  Secondly, and far more significantly, it gives the party calling
the
witness the opportunity to call corroborative evidence which in the absence
of such a challenge is unlikely to have been called.
 Thirdly, it gives the
witness the opportunity both to explain or to qualify his own evidence in the
light of the contradiction of
which warning has been given and also, if he can,
to explain or to qualify the other evidence upon which the challenge is to be
based.
 It is this third reason for the application of the first rule in or
aspect of <i>Browne v Dunn</i> which is applicable in the present case."
(emphasis in original)
<P>

238	The Reply (in respect of each action) alleged that the defendants had an
improper motive, being an intention to injure the plaintiffs.
 Particulars were
sought.  The particulars referred to the succession of court cases, and the
adverse findings made in each (Ex Q).
 They added:
<P>

	"b)	This substantial loss in Court angered Mr Belan.  Mr Belan's unlawful and
wrongful conduct had been exposed and Mr Belan had
been embarrassed and damaged
by this Court case.
<P>

	c)	Because of the Court case referred to above, Mr Belan was motivated in
publishing the matter complained of by way of bitterness,
spite and desire to
defame and denigrate Mr Palmer, so Mr Belan could get even with Mr Palmer
because of the Court case.
<P>

	d)	Mr Belan in publishing the matter complained of sought to misrepresent and
deceive the readers of the matter complained of about
what happened in the
Court case and what was the real position regarding the retirement
benefits."
<P>

239	In the course of the hearing, Mr Belan gave the following evidence:  (T
101)
<P>

	"Q.	Mr Belan I then turn to the court case.  That court case generated a
certain amount of ill-feeling in you towards Mr Palmer
and Mr Boner, didn't
it?
<P>

	A.	No, it did not.
<P>

	Q.	You recall Mr Boner giving evidence that he had previously been a friend of
yours?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	And visited homes and the like?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	That stopped as a result of this dispute, didn't it?
<P>

	A.	Not by me.
<P>

	Q.	My question was that stopped, didn't it?
<P>

	A.	Yes, it did."
<P>

240	Mr Belan recognised that the payment of retirement allowances to the
officers was a sensitive issue with the electors (T 109).
 He was repeatedly
asked whether, in publishing Exhibit C, he intended to hurt Messrs Boner and
Palmer, or their case.  He responded
to one such question in these words:  (T
128)
<P>

	"Q.	And so it would be part of your expectation that it would harm him by him
having less prospects to win the election?
<P>

	A.	I didn't mean to harm anybody, I just wanted to win the election and keep
my job and another 35, 40 people.  They attacked me,
I didn't attack them.
They ran ticket against me, I didn't run ticket against them.  They walked out
of caucus, I didn't walk out
of caucus.  They tried to unseat me.  I was only
defending myself. ..."
<P>

241	The defendants, in these circumstances, made the following submission:
<P>

	"... what the plaintiffs must prove is that the defendants in publishing the
matters complained of were motivated to no significant
extent by the interests
of the current election, but by a dominant motive to `get even with' the
plaintiffs because of the case in
the Industrial Court.  No such motivation was
ever suggested to, or explored with, either defendant.  The closest it came
with Mr
Belan was the relatively remote point of whether the court case, at the
time it occurred, generated a certain amount of ill-feeling
in him towards the
plaintiffs (p 101, lines 11-27).  Even a positive answer to this question would
not have taken the plaintiffs
the necessary distance on this issue, because the
real issue is whether, some substantial time later, such ill-feeling not only
persisted,
but persisted to the extent that it was the dominant motive for the
publications.  This essential question was not approached."
<P>

242	They added:
<P>

	"Each defendant was cross examined on whether he realised that the
publications would damage the plaintiffs (Mr Belan at p109-112,
page 125 line
33 - p126 line 36, p128 line 6 - p130 line 35, Mr Casey p158 lines 1-15) but
this is not the essential question.  Given
the inevitability of wishing
`damage' to the opposition in any election campaign, in the sense that the
publishers wish themselves
to win and the opposition to lose, the essential
question is whether the defendants' dominant motive for wishing to inflict such
damage was a desire to `get even' because of the court case, rather than to win
the election.  This essential question was not approached."
<P>

243	Again, I believe the issue has been sufficiently raised.  I accept that the
nine matters listed above either gave rise to ill-will
on the part of Mr Belan
towards the plaintiffs, or illustrated that ill-will.  I accept that, in
publishing the material which Mr
Belan knew to be false, he was attempting to
injure the plaintiffs' reputations.
<P>

244	I do not accept that the defendants' submissions accurately formulate the
test in circumstances where the person publishing
the material does not
honestly believe in the truth of what is being published.  I do not believe
that Mr Belan was setting out to
"get even" with Mr Palmer or Mr Boner for
their victories in the Industrial Court.  Had they not stood for election, he
would have
ignored them, although still regarded them as "the enemy".  However,
they stood in opposition to his candidates.  He, therefore,
chose to publish
documents which he knew to contain falsehoods, and which he intended would
damage their reputations.  That was his
dominant purpose.  He was not, in
short, seeking to put before the electors the truth as he saw it.  Hence, the
communication was
not, in my judgment, one in which he was acting bona fide in
the protection of his own legitimate interests (and those of Mr Casey)
(cf<b><i> Horrocks v Lowe </i></b>Lord Diplock p 149).
<P>

245	Mr Casey again was in a different position to Mr Belan.  There was not
evidence of malice, in the sense of personal spite, in
respect of Mr Casey.  Is
Mr Casey infected by Mr Belan's express malice?  It is an issue in respect of
which there is room for doubt
on the authorities (see Tobin &amp; Sexton paras
18060-18065).  I have described the circumstances of publication (supra p 44
ff).
 Mr Casey was prepared to allow Mr Belan to publish brochures on his
behalf, he being the leader of the Frank Belan Team.  I believe
that Mr Casey
is, in these circumstances, visited with Mr Belan's malice.  The principle was
identified by Jordan CJ in <b><i>Dougherty v Chandler</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1946/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] NSWStRp 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2046%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 46 SR
(NSW) 370</a> at 375/6 in these words:
<P>

	"Where several defendants are charged with joint defamation, and express
malice is established against one only, it has been said
that the express
malice of the one is fatal to the success of a plea of privileged occasion or

<P>

	<b>Damages</b>
<P>

246	The plaintiffs have established that they were defamed by the defendants.
The defences raised by the defendants have either
failed, or been defeated by
the presence of malice.  It is, therefore, necessary to consider the issue of
damages.
<P>

247	Section 46(2) of the Act provides that the damages recoverable, where a
person has been defamed, shall be "in accordance with
the common law, but
limited to damages for relevant harm."  The words "relevant harm" are defined
as "harm suffered by the person
defamed" (s 46(1)).
<P>

248	The claim in each case is for general damages.  No claim is made for
special damages.  The broad principles were stated by Windeyer
J in <b><i>Uren
v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%2d66%29%20117%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965-66) 117 CLR 118</a> at 150:
<P>

	"When it is said that in an action for defamation damages are given for an
injury to the plaintiff's reputation, what is meant?
 A man's reputation, his
good name, the estimation in which he is held in the opinion of others, is not
a possession of his as a
chattel is.  Damage to it cannot be measured as harm
to a tangible thing is measured.  Apart from special damages strictly so called
and damages for a loss of clients or customers, money and reputation are not
commensurables.  It seems to me that, properly speaking,
a man defamed does not
get compensation for his damaged reputation.  He gets damages because he was
injured in his reputation, that
is simply because he was publicly defamed.  For
this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of
the
plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done.
Compensation is here a solatium rather than a monetary recompense
for harm
measurable in money.  The variety of the matters which, it has been held, may
be considered in assessing damages for defamation
must in many cases mean that
the amount of a verdict is the product of a mixture of inextricable
considerations.  One of these is
the conduct of and the intentions of the
defendant, in particular whether he was actuated by express malice."
<P>

249	The textbooks speak of damages for injury to reputation, and damages for
"hurt feelings" (although incorporated within the one
award).
<P>

250	The damages should reflect, first, the position and standing of each
plaintiff, secondly, the seriousness of the imputations,
and, thirdly, the
degree of harm.  The extent of publication is relevant.  There is a difference
between defamatory statements published
through the media to the world at
large, and publication to a small audience.
<P>

251	There is, in this matter, as well, an issue as to whether the conduct of
the defendants calls for aggravated (compensatory)
damages.  The award of
damages should take into account aggravating factors, if they are present.
Where there is conduct which may
be characterised as "improper, unjustifiable
or lacking in bona fides" (<b><i>Triggell v Pheeney</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2082%20CLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 82 CLR 497</a>
at 514) which causes harm to the plaintiffs, aggravated damages may be
appropriate.  Harm, in this context, means an increase in
the hurt to feelings
occasioned by the publications.  If, by the presence of matters of aggravation,
the hurt to feelings is exacerbated,
the award of damages should reflect that
fact.
<P>

252	Where there is express malice, is that relevant to the assessment of
damages?  Section 46(3)(b) of the Act is in these terms:
<P>

	"46(3)  In particular, damages for defamation:
<P>

	(a)	...
<P>

	(b)	shall not be affected by the malice or other state of mind of the
publisher at the time of the publication complained of or
at any other time,
except so far as that malice or other state of mind affects the relevant
harm."
<P>

253	In <b><i>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2 NSWLR 749</a>, the
Court (Moffatt P, Hope and Reynolds JJA) said this:  (at p 805)
<P>

	"In the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission on Defamation (LRC
No 11, p 137, par 226), it was stated:  `But the
malice or other state of mind
of the publisher has been treated as affording grounds for enhancing or
aggravating damages even where
it has not been shown to have increased the harm
suffered by the plaintiff.  An enhancement or aggravation of damages in these
circumstances
comes close to the allowance or exemplary damages.  We think that
it ought not to be allowed.  Hence we supplement s 46(2) by the
explicit
statement in s 46(3)(b).'
<P>

	We are of the opinion that the legislation achieves this effect.  It follows
that it is for a plaintiff who seeks to recover compensatory
damages, and to
include a component for particular personal hurt and affront arising from some
state of mind on the part of the publisher,
to point to evidence tending to
show that it caused some harm suffered by the person defamed over and above
what might ordinarily
be expected to follow."
<P>

	<b>The Effect Upon Mr Palmer</b>
<P>

254	Mr Palmer arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom in 1968.  He entered
the milling industry.  He worked with a number of
employers.  He became a
foreman miller, which is the highest classification under the Award (T 24).  Mr
Palmer was active in the
Millers' Union, first as a delegate, and later as an
elected member of the Committee of Management.  He became President of the
State
Branch of the Union.  In 1982 he was made an Organiser.  He later became
Branch Secretary, first in an acting capacity, and then
as the elected holder
of that office (in 1984).
<P>

255	He remained Branch Secretary until the amalgamation in 1992, when the
Millers' Union was absorbed into the National Union of
Workers.
<P>

256	The affiliation of the Millers' Union with the Labor Council meant that Mr
Palmer, as Branch Secretary, attended meetings of
that Council as a delegate (T
24).  The State Branch of the Millers' Union was part of a larger federal body.
Mr Palmer held various
offices in the federal organisation (including Trustee
and Vice President) (T 24).
<P>

257	Mr Palmer, through his office with the Millers' Union, became involved in
various public bodies.  He was appointed to the Board
of Studies of TAFE,
concerned with the cereal milling course.  He held a position with the Dairy
Industry Training Council, concerned
with food industry training courses.
<P>

258	Mr Palmer heard of the publications (Exs B and C) before he saw them.  He
received a number of telephone calls.  Some were from
his supporters, conveying
information as to their contents.  Others were abusive.  Mr Palmer gave the
following evidence:  (T 29)
<P>

	"Q.	Can you remember the words to the effect that were used in those
conversations?
<P>

	A.	As I say, there were a number of them, some rang me, and I would assume my
supporters, saying, `Are you aware that ... is out
in the workplace?  You
better do something about it because it's very damaging, it's telling a load of
lies' etcetera, etcetera.
 I also received phone calls saying `So it's true,
you had your hand in the till.  You're a thief, you stole money from the
union.'
 And very upsetting.
<P>

	Q.	How did you feel when you received the matter complained of, those
publications, through the mail?
<P>

	A.	Well, astounded in a way.
<P>

	Q.	Why were you astounded?
<P>

	A.	Well, I couldn't have believed that the thing would have sunk to that
level.  Anyway, it did.  I mean, to me that is untrue,
the people who put that
out, particularly the secretary, was aware of what happened in the Industrial
Commission, he had the decision
and yet here I am being called a thief again as
I see it.
<P>

	Q.	After you received it did the telephone calls continue?
<P>

	A.	Yes, they did."
<P>

259	Mr Palmer took steps to change his telephone number.
<P>

260	The publication, of course, came in the midst of an election.  Mr Palmer,
as part of his campaign, visited various union sites.
 He received a very
hostile reception (T 30):
<P>

	"A.	I had great difficulty in some areas of even holding a meeting, people
just walked away, `We know all about you' and that leaflet
was thrown at me at
one site, but anyway.
<P>

	Q.  You said, `but anyway' and raised your hand to me to say stop, you have to
tell us?
<P>

	A.	All right, I had that document thrown at me because it said it explained
everything about what I had been doing with the union's
money.  They assumed
that I had taken $46,000.
<P>

	Q.	Where was that?
<P>

	A.	That was at Enfield as I recall.
<P>

	Q.	You said they assumed that you had taken $46,000, what were the words that
were being said to you?
<P>

	A.	`You had $46,000 of the union's money and you come here and want us to vote
for you.  You've got to be joking.'  Things like
that.
<P>

	Q.	Do you recall at the moment any other types of comments that were said to
you?
<P>

	A.	We had our hand in the till.  `We always knew that all union officials are
dishonest, that proves it.'"
<P>

261	Mr Palmer was forbidden access to a number of sites.  Where he was given
entry, there were occasions where no-one would talk
to him (T 30).  Before the
publication of Exhibits B and C he had been able to address meetings at these
sites.
<P>

262	Mr Palmer was defeated in the election.  He attempted to get work in the
industry.  He was obviously experienced, and well connected.
 Yet, he was
unsuccessful.  He described what happened in these words:  (T 31)
<P>

	"Q.	What happened then?
<P>

	A.	As I previously stated, I had held a position in the federal milling
industry of a foreman miller equivalent.  I had approached
a few of the
employers that I knew and they just said, `Sorry'."
<P>

263	Mr Palmer persevered for three or four months, trying to get work.  He then
realised that he was not going to get work in the
industry (T 31).  He
therefore left the milling industry, choosing instead to obtain qualifications
as a taxi driver.  He has since
earned his living as a casual taxi driver.
<P>

264	Mr Palmer also gave the following evidence:  (T 31)
<P>

	"Q.	How have you felt about knowing that that material in the exhibits B and C
have been out in the workforce and the membership
of the Food 1 Division since
they were published?
<P>

	A.	I was most upset about it because there are people out there still today
who would think that I'm a thief."
<P>

265	To vindicate his reputation he has been obliged to take the present action.
There was some publicity associated with the hearing
of this claim, and to a
wider audience (Ex M).  This publicity, naturally, added to his distress.
<P>

266	I accept the account Mr Palmer has given concerning the effect of the
publications upon him.
<P>

267	In 1994, Mr Palmer was a person of some stature within the milling
industry, and the union movement.  The accusations were serious.
 As Union
Secretary of the Millers' Union, he was ultimately responsible for husbanding
the finances of that Union.  The imputation
was that he misappropriated, or
stole, from the Union, and, thereafter, took action to cover up that theft.
The cover up came about
in a number of ways.  He deliberately and falsely
implicated an innocent person, Mr Belan, by suggesting that he was responsible
when, in truth, it was Mr Palmer who was responsible.  Further, he commenced a
court action to prevent the theft being detected.
 The amount involved was
substantial, namely, $46,525.51.
<P>

268	There is no doubt that these accusations were hurtful to Mr Palmer, and
damaging to his reputation.  He was shunned in the workplace,
and exposed to
harassment.  The damage to his reputation came at a time when his reputation
was of the utmost importance, because
he was seeking re-election.  I do not
doubt that his chances of winning the election were diminished by reason of the
publications.
<P>

269	Mr Palmer ultimately lost the election.  I cannot infer, however, that he
lost office because of the publication.  He may have
done so.  However, the
plaintiff bears the onus of establishing issues of causation as a matter of
probability.  I know nothing about
the election beyond the fact that Mr Palmer
lost and Mr Casey won.  I cannot, in these circumstances, infer that the loss
of office
was part of the harm which Mr Palmer suffered as a result of these
publications.  There is, as mentioned, no claim for special damages.
<P>

270	Nor, it seems to me, can I infer that his inability to obtain employment in
the industry after the election was a consequence
of the publication.  No
employer was called.  No-one came forward to say that, having seen the
publication, they chose not to hire
Mr Palmer because they suspected he may be
a thief.  Even though Mr Palmer was well credentialled, and experienced, his
inability
to obtain work may have had many causes other than the publications.
It may have been a reflection of his age.  It may have reflected
an over supply
of persons with his qualifications.  It may simply have reflected the
employers' appreciation of industrial politics,
and that it would be unwise to
hire someone on the losing side.
<P>

271	There is evidence, nonetheless, from which it can be inferred that Mr
Palmer was especially stung because of the malice which
lay behind the
publication.  The imputations were false, and, in the perception of Mr Palmer,
known by their publisher, Mr Belan,
to be false.  Mr Palmer, in the passage
already quoted (supra p 95), adverts to this issue when he gave the following
answer:
<P>

	"Well, I couldn't have believed that the thing would have sunk to that level.
Anyway, it did.  I mean, to me that is untrue, the
people who put that out,
particularly the secretary, was aware of what happened in the Industrial
Commission, he had the decision
and yet here I am being called a thief again as
I see it."
<P>

272	Mr Palmer had taken the issue to the Industrial Court to sort out his
rights.  His position had been vindicated.  He knew, as
the Judge had found,
that Mr Belan had directed him to discharge all liabilities before
amalgamation.  I believe, in these circumstances,
it is appropriate to include
aggravated (compensatory) damages.
<P>

273	The publication was to a limited audience, namely, approximately 5,000
members of the Food 1 Division of the Union.  However,
from the viewpoint of Mr
Palmer, these were the people who mattered.  He had entered the milling
industry in 1968.  He had made his
life in that industry, and the union
movement.
<P>

274	The two publications were, of course, in the same envelope.  If they are to
be regarded as two publications (supra p 38, para
92), the one provided the
context for the other.  I believe that an overall sum of $90,000 damages is a
proper and just sum for their
combined effect.  There is some artificiality in
dividing that sum between Exhibits B and C, given that they were in the same
envelope.
 However, the leaflet (Ex C) was, I believe, the more damaging.  I
would divide that sum into $65,000 for Exhibit C, and $25,000
for Exhibit B.
<P>

	<b>The Effect Upon Mr Boner</b>
<P>

275	Mr Boner entered the work force in the late 1960s.  He worked on the
Strathgarden Dam in Tasmania.  In 1972 he began working
in the stockfeed
industry, as a shift miller.
<P>

276	In 1986 Mr Boner became an Organiser for the Millers' Union.  He remained
an Organiser for approximately five years until elected
Assistant Secretary.
He held that position until February 1992 when, under the Federation Agreement,
he took up the position of Organiser
with the National Union of Workers.
<P>

277	By virtue of his various offices with the Millers' Union, Mr Boner
performed a number of other functions.  He was, on three
occasions, a delegate
to the ACTU National Conference.  He served on the Food Industry Training
Council.
<P>

278	Mr Boner described his reaction upon seeing Exhibit C (and Ex B) in these
words:  (T 71)
<P>

	"Q.	And how did you feel when you received those?
<P>

	A.	Total disbelief, angry, having to see that we had been accused of being
crooks, myself and Mr Palmer.  Having to again relive
the court case that we'd
taken on to stop.  Mr Belan taking proceedings against us and as a result of
that ..."
<P>

279	He added:  (T 72)
<P>

	"A.	As a Union organiser from time to time you visit sites and talk to people
about issues that were going on in the Union and
if you like at the time
campaigning, talking, about the issues that were every day work place, and I
was an organiser for quite some
time, and on site basis, and people would raise
issues with you from time to time.  And some of the comments that came back at
some
of those meetings were `We always believed Union officials can't be
trusted.  This sort of thing proves it.  Why don't you resign',
and words to
that effect.
<P>

	Q.	How did you feel when people spoke to you about the pamphlet and the
letter?
<P>

	A.	I worked hard.  I felt very disappointed.  I felt we had gone through this
case, we were vindicated in that case, and here this
was coming up again in the
form that it was, wasn't even raised in the case in respect of the fact we were
crooks, and I just felt
devastated by it all.
<P>

	Q.	When you visited these establishments did you have a conversation with a Mr
Clyde Stewart?
<P>

	A.	Yes.  I had taken some rostered days off.  We had rostered days off, and I
visited the Riverina because at that time it wasn't
the area I had been
allocated as an official by the state secretary, Mr Belan.  And in the Riverina
at Deniliquin Clyde was actually
on the site - Clyde Stewart was on the site
when I visited the site, and he sat in on a small gathering of people there and
he stood
there and said `why don't you resign, you can't be trusted."
<P>

280	Mr Boner had never previously experienced difficulty with that site.  He
gave another illustration of the reaction of workers
after the publication:  (T
72)
<P>

	"Q.	Did you have a particular incident at Albury?
<P>

	A.	Yes.  A delegate there of long standing who I had a lot of respect for, a
fellow Felix Janowski.  Felix and I had a working
relationship for about five,
maybe six years, and I always felt welcome when I visited that site, and during
the particular visit
on my rostered days off he said `I don't want you here.  I
don't want you to speak to the people any more.'"
<P>

281	Mr Boner was also told not to visit the Kellogg's site again.
<P>

282	Mr Boner, like Mr Palmer, was defeated in the election.  He attempted to
obtain work in the industry.  He responded to advertisements
placed by
employers with whom he had a good working relationship before the publications.
He was unsuccessful.  He gave the following
evidence:  (T 73)
<P>

	"A	I applied for a couple of jobs within the industry that I came out of that
had been advertised.  Some of the employers who were
advertising the jobs I
knew because I had formed a working relationship with them over that time, and
words given to me, probably
not exactly in the way they said them, but `we
would have great difficulty employing you because the NUW is still on these
sites.
 You would have to negotiate directly with the NUW on any sort of
position that we had.'"
<P>

283	Mr Boner, therefore, left the industry.  He has not maintained an
association with previous colleagues (T 75).  He explained
why in the following
evidence:  (T 75/76)
<P>

	"A.	I felt that we no longer had the same relationship that we had prior to
it.  I felt that there were some doubts in their mind,
whether or not we were
to be trusted or not and whether the allegations made against us were true, and
I felt ashamed, I suppose,
with all of this, even though it was all vindicated
it kept on coming back and coming back."
<P>

284	Ultimately, Mr Boner obtained a position in late 1994 as Enterprise Bargain
Facilitator with the New South Wales Furnishing
Industry Association.
Reference has been made to his work with that association already (supra p 83).
It was whilst working in that
capacity that the incident occurred at Dunlop
Bedding in May 1995, which has already been described.  Mr Boner gave the
following
evidence concerning his feelings as Mr Casey made his announcement to
the meeting that he would not remain in the same room:  (T
74)
<P>

	"Q.	How did you feel by his conduct?
<P>

	A.	I thought, here we go again.  I only just gained employment in this job.
It was for a period of 12 months.  I was hoping if
I did the job well I would
continue on after the 12 months, and I felt this job was being threatened by
his actions."
<P>

285	Mr Boner worked for twelve months as a Facilitator.  His contract was not
extended.  For a time thereafter he performed casual
work.  In September 1996
he obtained a position as Industrial Relations Manager with CSR Limited.  He
still holds that position.
<P>

286	I accept the account of Mr Boner concerning the effect of the publications
upon him.
<P>

287	Mr Boner, like Mr Palmer, had made his life in the milling industry, and
the union movement.  He had risen to the position of
Assistant Secretary of the
Millers' Union, and later the position of Organiser with the National Union of
Workers.  The accusations
against Mr Boner were grave.  Indeed, to the working
men and women who received Exhibit C, the accusation of dishonesty in the
handling
of union funds (representing their subscriptions) was extremely
serious, as were the allegations of cover up.
<P>

288	It is clear that Mr Boner was hurt by the imputations arising from the
article, and that his reputation suffered.  When he entered
the workplace
during the election campaign he was ridiculed and shunned.  As with Mr Palmer,
the damage to his reputation came at
a time when his reputation was of the
utmost importance in his quest for re-election.  Again, I do not doubt that Mr
Boner's chances
of re-election were diminished by reason of the publication.
<P>

289	Mr Boner lost the election.  I cannot, in assessing damages, attribute that
loss to the publication for the same reasons as
I gave in respect of Mr
Palmer.
<P>

290	Nor, it seems to me, am I able to infer that Mr Boner's inability to obtain
employment in the industry, after the election,
can be attributed to the
publication of Exhibit C.  He was told by employers (T 73) that "we would have
a great deal of difficulty
employing you because the NUW is still on these
sites".  Such a statement is consistent with his being, in the employers'
perception,
part of the losing faction.  He was not passed over because of his
damaged reputation.  There is, in the case of Mr Boner, as with
Mr Palmer, no
claim for special damages.  I, therefore, put that aspect to one side.
<P>

291	The extent of the publication was as already described.  It was sent to
people with whom Mr Boner had spent his working life
for the past twenty years.
He felt, thereafter, that they harboured mistrust.  He, therefore, did not
maintain associations that
he had built up during those years.
<P>

292	Mr Boner, like Mr Palmer, was especially stung because the publication
contained a number of falsehoods.  The issues had been
already litigated and
resolved in their favour.  In his perception, therefore, they were known to be
false by the publisher, Mr Belan.
 This is a matter which justifies, in my
view, aggravated (compensatory) damages.
<P>

293	There is a further aspect.  It operates as an aggravating factor in the
case of Mr Boner, although not present in respect of
Mr Palmer.  The actions of
Messrs Belan and Casey in refusing to deal with Mr Boner in his capacity as an
Enterprise Bargain Facilitator
for the New South Wales Furnishing Industry
Association, were (apart from the initial confrontation at Dunlop Bedding on 2
May 1995)
unjustifiable and lacking in bona fides.  Mr Boner, attempting to
make a new start, immediately thought (in his words) (T 74), "Here
we go
again".  With some justification, he believed his position as a Facilitator was
threatened.
<P>

294	I believe, in the circumstances, that the appropriate award in the case of
Mr Boner is $75,000.
<P>

	<b>Orders</b>
<P>

295	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1.	In matter no. 20115/95 between Denis Boner and Frank Belan and Arthur
Benjamin Casey, a verdict for the plaintiff against both
defendants, jointly
and severally, in the sum of $75,000 plus costs.
<P>

2.	In matter no. 20524/94 between Edward Palmer and Arthur Benjamin Casey and
Frank Belan, a verdict for the plaintiff against both
defendants, jointly and
severally, in the sum of $65,000 plus costs.
<P>

3.	In matter no. 20523/94 between Edward Palmer and Frank Belan, a verdict for
the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of
