<P>

<b>Wednesday, 14 July 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>30003/99 -	CLAYTON ROBERT CROKER v EDWARD PERKS &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  By his summons filed on 11 January 1999, the
plaintiff seeks against the first defendant, Edward Ernest Perks the following
orders:
<P>

	1.	An order that personal property in detention be returned.
<P>

	2.	The order of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal be set aside.
<P>

	3.	The sum of $100,000.00.
<P>

	4.	Damages.
<P>

2  	The summons was amended pursuant to directions made by the
Administrative Law List Judge to add the Residential Tenancies Tribunal
as a
defendant.  The Tribunal has filed an appearance and submits to the orders of
the Court save as to costs.
<P>

3  	According to the evidence of the first defendant, which I accept
as accurate and truthful, he is and was at all material times
a part owner and
the manager of premises at 33 Cooper Street, Surry Hills.  The premises contain
fifteen rooms which are available
for occupation on a weekly basis.  There is
no minimum or maximum time set for which a person can stay.  No written
agreement is
entered into by any person staying in a room.  The first defendant
keeps a key to each of the rooms and enters them as necessary
to check on their
cleanliness.  Most rooms are cleaned weekly and common areas are cleaned daily.
A person wishing to stay pays a
fee for the room and is provided with sheets,
bedding, pillows, pillow slips and a towel.  There are two kitchens and three
bathrooms
which are shared by all the occupants of the rooms.  Each person
taking a room is shown a list of house rules.
<P>

4  	The first defendant has an office on the premises and he is
present there between 8.30am and 6.30pm on each weekday and at other
times on
Saturdays.
<P>

5  	I accept that this was the state of affairs during the time
leading to the events complained of by the plaintiff.
<P>

6  	On 9 September 1998 the plaintiff went to see the first defendant
and asked whether there was a room available.  The first defendant
told him
that there was at $100 per week.  He explained about the supply of sheets and
the like and about the rules for sharing the
kitchen and the bathroom.  He told
the plaintiff about the cleaning arrangements and gave him a printed list of
rules.  One of the
rules was as follows:
<P>

<b>12. Tenancy</b> - Your room is let on a casual basis.  Occupation may be
terminated at any time by either party for any reason.
<P>

7  	The rules were set out under a heading including the words Moira
Private Hotels.
<P>

8  	I accept the evidence of the first defendant that the plaintiff
stayed in the premises for about ten weeks and paid each week
the amount he was
required to pay.
<P>

9  	On 12 November 1998 his rent was due for payment and the first
defendant asked the plaintiff where his rent was.  The plaintiff
said that he
could not pay.  Later on the same day, the first defendant handed the plaintiff
a Notice to Pay.  It was dated 12 November
1998 and set out certain material
before stating:
<P>

Your rent is overdue and must be brought up to date by paying $100 on or before
19.11.98.
<P>

Should you fail to meet this request your room will be emptied of all personal
belongings and stored at your cost.  On payment of
outstanding monies your
goods will be returned.
<P>

10  	The Notice was signed by the first defendant.
<P>

11  	Six days later the first defendant again asked the plaintiff to
pay rent and the plaintiff said that he was too busy to see
the first
defendant.
<P>

12  	Two days later the plaintiff put a note under the first
defendant's office door.  The substance of it stated that the plaintiff
had
consulted the Department of Fair Trading and had been advised that the first
defendant had to give sixty days' notice requiring
the plaintiff to leave the
premises.  The note threatened or promised to call the police if the first
defendant attempted to evict
the plaintiff.  When he received the note the
first defendant opened the door and found the plaintiff on the other side.  He
told
him that he would have to leave and the plaintiff refused.
<P>

13  	Later that day the police arrived at the request of the first
defendant and escorted the plaintiff from the premises.
<P>

14  	Before the plaintiff left the premises, the first defendant told
him to take all his belongings but the plaintiff said that
he could not take
them all and that he had nowhere to put them.  The first defendant said that he
would store them at the premises
and that the plaintiff could leave them there
for a week until he found somewhere else to put them.
<P>

15  	The plaintiff, the first defendant and the attending police
officers moved the plaintiff's goods into a room adjoining the
one the
plaintiff had occupied.  The first defendant locked the room, put the key in an
envelope and had the plaintiff sign his name
on the envelope.  That was done in
the presence of the police and at their suggestion.
<P>

16  	Thereafter the plaintiff did not return for his belongings and
the first defendant was obliged to move them to storage in another
building.
<P>

17  	The first defendant has provided the Court with an inventory of
the goods dealt with in that manner.
<P>

18  	The plaintiff made a complaint to the second defendant, the
Tribunal.
<P>

19  	During the hearing of the claim on 4 December 1998, the first
defendant asked the plaintiff what he wanted to do about his
belongings.  The
plaintiff refused to talk about them.
<P>

20  	The Tribunal is constituted by s 80 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies
Act 1987</a>.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s83.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 83</a> it has such jurisdiction as is conferred and such functions
as are conferred or imposed on it by or under the Act or any other Act.
<P>

21  	By subs (3) it has jurisdiction in respect to the claim by a
landlord or a tenant under a rental tenancy agreement in respect
of a rental
bond.
<P>

22  	There are various means by which a party to an agreement by
which premises are occupied may bring a claim before the Tribunal.
 For
example, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> a landlord shall not willingly contravene or fail to comply
with an order that a tenant's rent shall not exceed an amount specified
by the
Tribunal.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 53</a> provides for the termination of rental tenancy agreements.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">S
64</a> provides for applications by landlords for orders terminating tenancies and
ordering possession.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 65</a> provides for the suspension or refusal of orders for
termination.  So far as the present case is concerned, it is in respect of
rental
tenancy agreements that the Tribunal has jurisdiction.  The term "rental
tenancy agreement" is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> of the Act as follows:
<P>

<b>residential tenancy agreement</b> means any agreement under which a person
grants to another person for value a right of occupation of residential
premises for the
purpose of use as a residence:
<P>

(a)	whether or not the right is a right of exclusive occupation,
<P>

(b)	whether the agreement is express or implied, and
<P>

(c)	whether the agreement is oral or in writing, or partly oral and partly in
writing,
<P>

23  	The definition continues:
<P>

and includes such an agreement granting the right to occupy residential
premises together with the letting of goods.
<P>

24  	It is not all occupied premises which come within the purview of
the Act.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 6</a> of the Act provides that:
<P>

This Act does not apply to a residential tenancy agreement
<P>

...
<P>

(d)  if the tenant is a boarder or a lodger.
<P>

25  	By subs 2(b) the Act does not apply to any part of a hotel or
motel.
<P>

26  	The precise nature of the complaint made by the plaintiff to the
Tribunal has not been put into evidence in this Court.  However,
the Court has
a document issued by the Tribunal on 7 December 1998 entitled "Notice of
Order".  Relevantly, that document says this:
<P>

The application is dismissed because:
<P>

Having considered the material placed before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied
(at the civil standard of proof) that the grounds
required to make the orders
sought have been established.  The premises operate as a boarding house and the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction.
<P>

27  	By s 111 of the Act no appeal lies from an order of the Tribunal
except as provided by ss 107 and 110.
<P>

28  	S 110 has no application here because it deals with applications
by parties to proceedings before the Tribunal for orders varying
or setting
aside orders made in proceedings before the Tribunal.  The intention is that
those applications be heard and determined
by the  Tribunal itself.
<P>

29  	By s 107(2) an appeal applies to this Court if in the
proceedings before the Tribunal the Tribunal decides a question with
respect to
a matter of law.  A party to the proceedings who is dissatisfied with the
decision may appeal to the Supreme Court against
the decision.
<P>

30  	There is no provision for an appeal against a finding of
fact.
<P>

31  	Of course, a finding of fact without evidence itself constitutes
an error of law.  However, the plaintiff in argument before
this Court conceded
that there was evidence from the first defendant before the Tribunal to the
same effect as was given here, namely,
that the premises were occupied as a
boarding house.  It was submitted, nevertheless, that the Tribunal ought not to
have come to
that conclusion because the evidence was untrue.
<P>

32  	It seems to me that the Court has no power to enquire into the
process by which the Tribunal decided to accept the evidence
before it that the
premises was occupied as a boarding house.
<P>

33  	The Tribunal having reached that finding, the conclusion which
rested upon it that it lacked jurisdiction seems to me to have
been inevitable
in view of the provisions of s 6(1)(d) of the Act.
<P>

34  	The plaintiff's claim to have the Tribunal's determination set
aside fails.
<P>

35  	The plaintiff claims the return of his goods.  I accept the
evidence of the first defendant which I have summarised above and
the effect of
which is that the plaintiff has had a number of opportunities to remove his
goods from the places where the first defendant
has kept them.  I am satisfied
that he has not received his goods because he has failed to make reasonable
arrangements to collect
them.  The first defendant makes no claim to them and
they continue to be available for the plaintiff to collect if he will only
assert his reasonable rights.
<P>

36  	In these circumstances no occasion arises for the Court to make
any order for the return of personal property.
<P>

37  	The plaintiff makes a claim for damages.  Insofar as his claim
rests upon any challenge to the Tribunal's determination or
on the assertion
that the first defendant has detained his goods, it fails for reasons which I
have already explained.
<P>

38  	In an affidavit sworn on 3 March 1999 the plaintiff asserted a
large number of facts in support of his claim for damages. 
He said that the
premises were of poor condition and very untidy, that persons who took drugs
came to the premises from time to time
and that the indicia of drug use were
found upon the premises from time to time and that on one occasion people broke
into the premises.
 The plaintiff asserts that he was obliged to call in the
police to see to these matters but that they would not assist him.
<P>

39  	The plaintiff asserts that the Notice of Demand for rent
amounted to demanding money with menaces constituting a crime.  He
asserts that
on an occasion when they spoke about rent, the first defendant assaulted him by
pushing him in the chest.  He asserts
that the entry by the first defendant
into the plaintiff's room on occasions constituted some kind of entry with
criminal intent.
 He asserts that correspondence passing between the first
defendant and the plaintiff amounted to false representation or the use
of a
false instrument constituting criminal offences.  There is no substance in any
of these assertions.
<P>

40  	The plaintiff claims to have suffered damage by interruption to
his law studies and in other ways.  I am not satisfied that
the plaintiff has
suffered damage at all, but if he has I am satisfied that it has not been
occasioned by anything done or neglected
to be done by the first defendant.
<P>

41  	The plaintiff's claim for damages fails.
<P>

42  	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

43  	The plaintiff must pay the costs of the first defendant in an
amount to be agreed or assessed.
