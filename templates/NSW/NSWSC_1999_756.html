<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

WEDNESDAY 28 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>11963/1998</u>	<u>BARBARA JOY MCDONALD v FRANCIS NEIL MCDONALD &amp;
ANOR.</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The proceedings were commenced by a Statement of Claim filed on
28 August 1998.  The process named one defendant only (the present
first
defendant).  The second defendant was added as a party on 12 December 1998 (on
an application made by him).
<P>

2  	The late Graeme Charles McDonald (the deceased) was killed in a
light plane crash in July 1975.  The plaintiff is the widow
of the deceased.
They had separated prior to his death.  The first defendant is a brother of the
deceased.  The second defendant
is the son of the deceased and the plaintiff.
He has a sister who is not a party to these proceedings.
<P>

3  	The first defendant is the executor and trustee of the will of
the deceased.  The beneficiaries are the plaintiff, the second
defendant and
his sister.
<P>

4  	For some time after 1976, the first defendant conducted a family
farming business (including on the property known as South
Studleigh).  In his
capacity as trustee, the first defendant remains the registered proprietor of
the property.  In October 1990,
he gave a mortgage over the property to Elders
Rural Finance Limited (Elders).  There was default under this mortgage.
<P>

5  	Until 1 July 1992, the first defendant resided at 208 River Road
Deniliquin.  Between mid 1992 and 6 January 1994, both the
plaintiff and the
second defendant resided at the property.  The second defendant went into
occupation after tenants vacated the
property.  He continues to reside at the
property and operates a farming business thereon.  He does repair and
maintenance work and
pays for running expenses.  In March 1993, the first
defendant commenced to reside at 147 Mulgrave Road, Cairns.
<P>

6  	The second defendant claims certain arrangements have been made
with the plaintiff.  He claims inter alia to be entitled to
remain in
possession of the property.  There is also a claim in respect of title to the
property itself.  The Court has been informed
that the claim to possession is
supported by his sister.
<P>

7  	The property was under the threat of sale by Elders.  Thereafter,
action was taken which has led to disputation and confusion.
 In October 1992,
the plaintiff raised about $93,000.00 and the second defendant raised
$73,000.00.  These moneys were used to buy
out the Elders mortgage (the
property itself could not be used as security because it stood in the name of
the first defendant).
 On 9 November 1992, the mortgage was transferred from
Elders to the plaintiff.
<P>

8  	At this stage, it may be convenient to digress from the narrative
to make a few observations.  The resulting situation would
seem to throw up
real doubt as to whether or not the first defendant was thereafter in a
position of being regarded as liable to
pay moneys under the mortgage.  A
purpose of the transferred mortgage appears to have been to secure the moneys
raised to pay out
Elders (the allegation of constructive trust has been made).
If this was the case, it is unclear as to what arrangements were made
(if any)
for repayment.  No moneys have since been paid under the mortgage.
<P>

9  	It appears that the plaintiff and the first defendant have been
on bad terms for many years.  In recent years, the relationship
between the
plaintiff and the second defendant has deteriorated and is now hostile.
Disputes between them led to proceedings being
commenced in the Equity Division
(in 1994).  In those proceedings, inter alia, the second defendant's claims to
possession and the
property are propounded.  The plaintiffs are the second
defendant and his sister.  The defendant is the plaintiff.  The first defendant
is not a party.  The Statement of Claim appears to be in need of surgery.  The
proceedings appear to have stagnated.  The Court has
been told that this has
been due to the impecuniosity of the second defendant.
<P>

10  	These proceedings might be seen as an attempt to engender some
activity to resolve what appears to be a very messy and stagnant
situation.  It
is a situation which so far has not been capable of resolution by compromise.
It is unfortunate that other avenues
were not pursued to deal with this
problem.
<P>

11  	These proceedings are founded on alleged default under the
mortgage by the now first defendant.  The alleged default is in
respect of
failure to pay both principal and interest.  (A Default Notice claims
$327,946.94 as at 30 April 1998).  The demand was
first made in 1998.  The
plaintiff seeks possession of the property.  No Amended Statement of Claim has
been filed since the adding
of the second defendant.  As the pleadings
presently stand, no claim is pleaded against him (although he is the only
defendant in
occupation).  Both defendants have filed a Defence.
<P>

12  	The proceedings presently come before the Court pursuant to an
application brought by the plaintiff (an Amended Notice of Motion
was filed in
Court on 12 July 1999).  She seeks either summary judgment or a striking out of
Defences.
<P>

13  	The plaintiff has sworn three affidavits.  Her solicitor (Mr
Kent) has sworn two affidavits.  He has been cross-examined. 
Each of the
defendants has sworn an affidavit.
<P>

14  	It is well settled that summary judgment is a discretionary
remedy which should only be granted in what might be described
as a clear case
(see inter alia <u>Webster v Lampard</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d1993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-1993) 177 CLR 598).</a>  The
applicant bears the onus of satisfying the Court that relief should be
granted.
<P>

15  	It is not said that the plaintiff is entitled to summary
judgment as against the second defendant.  It is conceded that there
is one
Defence (that of estoppel) which needs to proceed to trial for determination.
The plaintiff merely asks that all other Defences
be struck out.  This relief
is sought on the basis that none of these Defences raises a defence at law to
the plaintiff's claim for
possession.
<P>

16  	In the case of the first defendant, the plaintiff seeks the
striking out of all Defences and the entry of judgment.
<P>

17  	The position of the first defendant is somewhat unusual.  Whilst
the real dispute is now between the plaintiff and the second
defendant he is
taking a most active role in defending the proceedings.  This may be due, at
least in part, to the way in which the
claim has been formulated.  He sees
himself as representing the interests of the beneficiaries (yet the
protagonists to the real
dispute are the disputing beneficiaries).
<P>

18  	The real matter in issue between the parties is that which is
raised in the equity proceedings.  This is a matter which needs
to be
determined at trial.  Despite the vagaries of the pleadings, it is in substance
the matter sought to be agitated as a Defence
by the second defendant (and it
involves the position of the first defendant under the mortgage).  The
determination of that matter
could be expected to effect a resolution of these
proceedings.  In the equity proceedings, it could be expected that the question
concerning the bringing of the mortgage to an end would also be determined
(this would require the addition of the first defendant
as a party to those
proceedings).
<P>

19  	I now turn to the Defence filed by the first defendant.  On one
view, he is an unnecessary party to these proceedings.  However,
the plaintiff
has chosen to join him as a defendant and proceed against him on the basis of
his default under the mortgage.  The
allegations of default have been put in
issue.  If these allegations are really material to the claim for possession,
they should
be determined by the resolution of the equity proceedings.
Paragraph 4 contains material which alleges that the plaintiff is not
entitled
to take any action to enforce the mortgage without the consent of the second
defendant and that the second defendant has
not given such a consent (see inter
alia (c) and (d)).  It is common ground that these allegations do not raise a
Defence to the
plaintiff's claim.  Accordingly, they are liable to be struck
out.  Paragraph 5 alleges a Defence under the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act
</u>1994</a> (the Act).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8</a> prohibits enforcement action until at least 21
days have elapsed after the giving of notice required by the section. It was
not said
by the plaintiff that the section did not have application in the case
of the first defendant.  There is material which throws up
questions of fact as
to whether or not such notice has been given in accordance with the section.
<P>

20  	This is an issue which is thrown up because the plaintiff has
chosen to take enforcement action against the first defendant
under the
mortgage to recover possession of the property.  It has no bearing on the real
matter in dispute in the equity proceedings
which could be expected to be
determinative of the problems had by the parties.  It perhaps does no harm to
stress that the first
defendant is not in occupation and that, although no case
is pleaded against him, the second defendant's claim to remain in occupation
does not arise from the mortgage.
<P>

21  	I now turn to the Defence filed by the second defendant.  It may
be observed that it is not the product of elegant draughtsmanship.
 Whilst it
is not pleaded in the same form, there are paragraphs in the Defence which seek
to raise the substance of what is asserted
in the equity proceedings as the
basis for relief.  It involves inter alia the matter of the estoppel.  Whilst
these paragraphs could
be enhanced by amendment, I am not satisfied that the
Court should strike them out.  Paragraph 13 makes the unsustainable allegation
that the proceedings are not maintainable without the consent of the second
defendant.  This paragraph is liable to be struck out.
 Paragraph 18 seeks to
raise a Defence that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the requirements
of the Act.  The second defendant
has not sought to persist with the stance
that he falls within the ambit of the Act.  Accordingly, this paragraph is
liable to be
struck out.
<P>

22  	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to relief by
way of summary judgment.  The application for summary judgment
is refused.
Paragraph 4 of the Defence of the first defendant is struck out.  Paragraphs 13
and 18 of the Defence of the second defendant
are struck out.
<P>

23  	There has been argument as to costs of the application.
Largely, the defendants have been successful on the issues agitated
between the
parties.  The plaintiff has had some success.  The issues on which she had
success occupied little time during the hearing.
 The general rule is that
costs follow the event.  In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied
that there should be a departure
from that rule.  I order the plaintiff to pay
the costs of the application.
<P>

24  	It may be that the parties will now be seeking other orders and
directions.  If that is the case, arrangements can be made
for the listing of
the proceedings to deal with these matters.
