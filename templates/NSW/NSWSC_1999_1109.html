070031/99	<b>REGINA   v   LMW</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

(On application for permanent stay)
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  When an indictment was presented yesterday charging
LMW with the manslaughter of Corey Davis, Mr Zahra, who appears
for the young
child so charged, made an application for a permanent stay of proceedings.  Mr
Zahra relied upon an affidavit of his
instructing solicitor, Matthew Johnston,
sworn today, and upon newspaper reports and a video relating to the accused.
<P>

2  	The deceased, who was a young child, indeed some years younger
than the accused, met his death by drowning on 2 March 1998.
 The accused
eventually appeared at the Bidura Children's Court and committal proceedings
were heard on 28 and 29 January 1999. 
There were media reports on these
proceedings.  The hearing of evidence on the dates I have mentioned was
followed by submissions
by counsel on 23 March 1999 and then on 28 April 1999
the learned magistrate made his decision, itself the subject of extensive
reporting
by the media.  The learned magistrate made it clear that the evidence
satisfied him that the accused had caused the death of the
deceased, and that
the accused knew what he was doing was wrong, but the magistrate went on to
determine that the evidence was not
strong enough to justify a manslaughter
trial before a jury.  The magistrate was reported as saying:
<P>

<i>"With a best will in the world, the Supreme Court is a court for adults, and
many members of the community would find a child defendant
to be quite out of
place in that environment...The circumstances of the case are such that a jury
would be more likely to interpret
the incident as an act of bullying that went
wrong."</i>
<P>

3  	The magistrate's decision was followed promptly by a decision
taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 4 May 1999 to
proceed against
the accused on an ex officio indictment.  Hence the indictment which has
prompted the present application.
<P>

4  	Mr Zahra seeks a permanent stay of proceedings upon the basis
that the publicity which has been given to this matter is such
that the accused
cannot have a fair trial.  That application is opposed by the Crown.
<P>

5  	The material which has prompted this application comprises
newspaper reports tendered as Exhibit A and a video recording of
televised
programmes tendered as Exhibit B.  That material has been supplemented by
further newspaper reports tendered by the Crown
as Exhibit 1.  
<P>

6  	I have closely considered all this material.  It would not be
useful for me to set out in this judgment the detail of the various
articles,
nor would it be useful for me to set out what I saw and heard in the video,
Exhibit B, played in Court.  All this material
merited close attention and I
have endeavoured to give it close attention.  It is, I consider, a fair
assessment that the media material
in question includes 
<P>

(i)	material in the form of reporting on what occurred at the committal
proceedings;
<P>

(ii)	reporting of the decision of the magistrate and his reasons;
<P>

(iii)	there has been reporting in the form of comment on the case and on the
concept of criminal responsibility for those below
the age of fourteen years.
The material tendered included comment on this by the magistrate presiding at
the committal proceedings,
comment by a psychiatrist, and comment by the
Attorney General.  There was also reference to observations by the Director of
Public
Prosecutions leading to the decision to issue an ex officio indictment.
The media recorded expressions of opinion as to the desirability
of altering
the law concerning the age of criminal responsibility, although not, I observe
so as to reduce it to the age of the accused
at the time of the drowning of the
deceased;
<P>

(iv)	the video material took the form of reporting on the outcome of the
proceedings before the magistrate and there was then an
interview with the
grandmother of the deceased that dealt with her distress at the decision of the
magistrate, and her perception
that the accused should be punished. 
<P>

(v)	The material tendered also dealt with the grandmother's assertions that the
deceased had been subjected to bullying treatment
by the accused prior to the
date on which the deceased met his death.
<P>

7  	Mr Zahra submitted that the combination of the above features of
the media material rendered this a most unusual case, and distinguished
it from
the outcome of stay applications in those authorities to which I shall shortly
refer.  The effect of all this material, Mr
Zahra submitted, is such that it
would prevent the accused having a fair trial at any time and, alternatively,
that it would have
the effect of preventing the accused from having a fair
trial now or in the immediate future.  Hence the application was put forward
in
the alternative, that is to say as one seeking a permanent stay of proceedings
and, alternatively, as one seeking an adjournment
until the adverse effect of
the publicity has settled down.
<P>

8  	There can be no question but that a person charged with a
criminal offence is entitled to a fair trial by a tribunal which is
both
independent and impartial:  see <i>R v Yuill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2069%20A%20Crim%20R%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 69 A Crim R 450</a> at 452.
In each case where an application is made for a stay of proceedings because of
adverse publicity, there is a need for the
court to make a judgment on the
particular facts before it:  again see <i>Yuill</i> at 454.
<P>

9  	Indeed, in <i>Yuill</i> Kirby A-CJ, as he then was, expressed the
considerations which I must heed in the following passage of his judgment at pp
452-454:
<P>

<i>"1.	Every person is entitled to a fair trial according to law by an
independent and impartial tribunal.  This is in fact a basic human
right.  It
is recognised as such in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, Art 14.1.  It is a basic right which
is also recognised and enforced by
the common law in Australia: see Dietrich <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20177%20CLR%20292" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 177 CLR 292</a> at 299-300; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=64%20ACrimR%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">64
ACrimR 176</a> at 178-179.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Another basic right, in a society such as ours, is that of freedom of
expression and to receive information and ideas orally, in
writing, in print
and other media.  This is also referred to in the International Covenant, Art
19.2.  It too is reflected in the
law of this country: see, eg, Australian
Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20177%20CLR%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 177 CLR 106</a> at 140.  The right
of free expression, constitutional rights apart, may be subject to
restrictions, as provided by law.  In this
jurisdiction, the restrictions are
provided in the form of restrictions in the nature of law of contempt and
restrictions designed
to otherwise ensure a fair trial for persons accused of
serious crimes. </i>
<P>

<i>3.	Against the background of the right to receive information and the
realities of the operations of the modern media of communication
of
information, it is inevitable that there will sometimes be pre-trial publicity
of cases which are to come before courts, including
cases involving criminal
trials.  The law imposes limitations, as I have said.  Sometimes those
limitations can be quite drastic
as recent decisions of the High Court and this
Court in relation to pre-trial publicity involving contempt of court
demonstrate:
see, eg, Hinch v A-G (Vic) (No 2) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 15</a> at 27; A-G
(NSW) v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 368.</a>  But just as courts are
obliged in the real world to accept that certain delays in the hearing of cases
are inescapable, they have
frequently said that they must accept a certain
amount of publicity of matters of public interest: cf Bell v DPP (Tas)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%20937" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985]
AC 937</a> at 953. That is the nature of our society. </i>
<P>

<i>4.	The test of fairness which governs an application such as the present
involves balancing the interests of the accused and of society
in the fair
trial of allegations of criminal offences and the interests of society to bring
to trial, without delay, persons accused
of such offences. The public has a
high interest in the timely disposition of charges of serious offences and in
the conviction of
those who are found guilty of crime: see, eg, Carver v A-G
(NSW)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2029%20A%20Crim%20R%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 29 A Crim R 24</a> at 30.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	Given the nature of the modern media as an attribute of a society such as
ours, it is inevitable that there will be publicity of
facts and opinions which
will sometimes come to the attention of potential jurors in a pending criminal
trial.  The law does not
ignore this possibility. It does not necessarily
disqualify the jurors concerned.  Nor does it necessarily require the
adjournment
of a hearing of a trial to avoid the risk of the contamination of
the jury: see Murphy <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20167%20CLR%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 167 CLR 94</a> at 99; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=40%20A%20Crim%20R%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">40 A Crim R 361</a> at 364-365.  To
require, in every case, a stay or adjournment would effectively destroy the
jury system which is such a vital feature
of the administration of justice and
especially of criminal justice: cf Hubbert  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2029%20CCC%20%282d%29%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279</a> at 291.
</i>
<P>

<i>6.	Courts will assume that jurors, properly instructed, will accept and
conform to the direction of the trial judge to decide the
case solely on the
evidence placed before them in the court: see Demirok <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20137%20CLR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 137 CLR 20</a> at 22.
There is an increasing body of judicial opinion, lately expressed, to the
effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists,
jurors, when they take on the
solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom,
differentiate between gossip,
rumour, news and opinion which they hear before
the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial for which
they
are empanelled. Judge Herron made observations in this case which indicate
that such is his conviction and experience. His Honour's
expression of opinion
parallels that of many other judges. </i>
<P>

<i>7.	Of course a question still remains in each case whether the intensity,
proximity and nature of the media coverage of the particular
accused or the
particular circumstances or the particular crime is such as to occasion the
risk of unfairness to the accused so as
to prejudice the accused's right to a
fair trial either for a time after the publicity or ever: see Glennon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20173%20CLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
173 CLR 592</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=60%20A%20Crim%20R%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">60 A Crim R 18.</a>  A judgment is called upon in each case having
regard to the particular facts which are proved.  So much was said in Jago v
District
Court (NSW) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 23</a> at 60; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20A%20Crim%20R%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 A Crim R 307</a> at 334.  It is
pointed out that, in this case, the publicity which is relied upon for the
adjournment or stay is considerably less
than that which has occurred in recent
years in respect of other criminal trials allowed to proceed.  Reference was
made to Murphy.
 Reference was also made to the judgment of Seaman J in
Connell, Lucas and Carter (No 3)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%208%20WAR%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 8 WAR 542</a> and to Lewis  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2063%20A%20Crim%20R%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 63 A Crim
R 18</a> at 41..."</i>
<P>

10  	Then in <i>R v Glennon</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20173%20CLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 173 CLR 592</a> Mason CJ and
Toohey J, in their joint judgment said:
<P>

<i>"...a permanent stay will only be ordered in an extreme case (Jago (1989)
168 CLR at 34) and there must be a fundamental defect `of
such a nature that
nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve
against its unfair consequences' (Barton
(1980) 147 CLR at 111, per Wilson
J)."</i>
<P>

11  	See also <i>R v Bell</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 8 October 1998)
and <i>R v Milat</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 26 February 1998).
<P>

12  	As I pointed out to Mr Zahra in the course of his thorough
submissions, my own experience both at the Bar and on the Bench
has convinced
me that juries can generally be expected to act conscientiously and to heed
directions given by the trial judge as
to how they should go about their task
as jurors.  It is not to be assumed that even if a juror or jurors read and
remembered any
of the material which has been placed before this Court in
support of the accused's application, that such juror or jurors would
ignore
directions given in the course of the trial that the jury should determine this
case only upon the evidence placed before
it at the trial and in accordance
with principles upon which it is directed by the trial judge.  The dicta of
Kirby A-CJ above cited
are very much in point here.
<P>

13  	It is only in an extreme case that a permanent stay of criminal
proceedings would be ordered:  see <i>R v Glennon</i> (supra), and having
reflected upon the material that has prompted the present application, I am not
persuaded that the circumstances
render this an extreme case.  
<P>

14  	The further question arises however as to whether the
circumstances warrant some postponement of the trial beyond the present
time.
In my opinion they do not.
<P>

15  	The publications the subject of evidence corresponded generally
in point of time with the committal hearing.  The earliest
publication appears
to have been on 4 September 1998 when the Daily Telegraph published an article
that the accused was to be charged
with manslaughter, but then the articles
find their setting in the period from the end of January 1999 when evidence was
given in
the committal proceedings up to the point of time when the decision to
proceed by way of ex officio indictment was reported on 5
May 1999.  It follows
that a period in excess of six months has now elapsed since the last
publication to which the Court's attention
has been directed.  It seems to me
that in the interests of justice it is appropriate that the trial proceed now
and that no postponement
is warranted.
<P>

16  	I am confident, allowing for the possibility that the jurors who
will be empanelled to try this case read and saw the material
to which my
attention has been drawn, that the jury will try this case consistently with
their oaths or affirmations, heeding and
conforming to the directions that will
be given that the matter is to be determined solely on the evidence given at
the trial and
in accordance with the relevant directions as to legal
principles.
<P>

17  	I conclude therefore, having considered the various publications
in the light of the relevant principles, that the application
for a permanent
stay of proceedings, or indeed any stay of proceedings, should be refused, and
I make an order accordingly.
