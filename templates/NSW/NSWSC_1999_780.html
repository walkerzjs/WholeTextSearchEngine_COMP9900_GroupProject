<P>

<b>2084/99	JANICE HUTCHINS &amp; ORS   -v-   ANDREW WILY &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>    There is presently before me a notice of
motion filed on 12 July 1999 by Andrew Hugh Jenner Wily described therein as
the first
defendant (although I shall refer to him in this judgment as the
defendant). By that notice of motion that defendant seeks, substantively,
an
order that the summons filed by the plaintiff on 18 June 1999 be struck out and
an order that the amended summons filed on 7 July
1999 be struck out.
<P>

2   	The proceedings were instituted by summons filed on 18 June
1999.  That summons named three plaintiffs, being Janice Hutchins
as the first
plaintiff, Courtway Enterprises Pty Ltd as second plaintiff and Leunan Pty Ltd
as the third plaintiff.  Three defendants
were named to that summons, being
Andrew Wily as the first defendant, Lex Nominees Pty Ltd as the second
defendant and Development
Property Australia Pty Ltd as third defendant.
Subsequently, by leave granted in that regard by Bergin J, an amended summons
was
filed on 7 July 1999.  It does not emerge with clarity whether the leave
which her Honour granted extended to a leave to remove plaintiffs
and to add
defendants or whether that leave was limited only to the relief sought by the
plaintiffs in the proceedings as originally
constituted.
<P>

3   	However the amended summons discloses Janice Hutchins
(described therein as the first plaintiff) as being the only plaintiff.
 Five
defendants are named in the amended summons, being Andrew Hugh Wily as first
defendant (and I assume that he is identical to
Andrew Wily the first defendant
named in the summons), Lex Nominees Pty Ltd as second defendant, Development
Property Australia Pty
Ltd as third defendant, John Brickwood as fourth
defendant and Leunan Pty Ltd (in liquidation) as fifth defendant.  The second
and
third defendants named in the amended summons are identical to the second
and third defendants named in the summons.
<P>

4   	By the amended summons the plaintiff claims the following
relief, as set out in prayer 2, against the first defendant, "Pursuant
to
section 503 of the <i>Corporations Law </i>an order that the first defendant be
removed as liquidator of the fifth defendant".  The plaintiff also seeks as
relief consequential
to an order made in the terms of prayer 2, an order by
prayer three that another liquidator be appointed liquidator of the fifth
defendant.
<P>

5   	Section 503 of the <i>Corporations Law</i> is as
follows:
<P>

The Court may, on cause shown, remove a liquidator and appoint another
liquidator.
<P>

6   	Both the plaintiff and the defendant through their
respective legal representatives were in agreement that an application invoking
the power of the Court under section 503 of the <i>Corporations Law </i>can be
brought only by a creditor or a contributory of a company in liquidation. In
the instant case the liquidation of the fifth
defendant was a voluntary
liquidation. It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff did
not have the standing to
bring the present application.  The plaintiff asserts
that she is a creditor of the fifth defendant. The first defendant submits
that
there is no evidence to substantiate that status.  The plaintiff has never
lodged with the first defendant a proof of debt.
 The plaintiff attended the
first meeting of creditors of the fifth defendant, but only in her capacity as
a representative of another
creditor and not asserting that she attended in her
own capacity as a creditor herself.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff did not attend and was not represented at the
second meeting.  At the adjournment of the second meeting of creditors
the
plaintiff appears to have been in attendance, but is not described as
representing either herself or any other creditor.
<P>

8   	There was, in the face of objection by the defendant,
admitted into evidence on behalf of the plaintiff a copy of a bank statement
of
the account conducted by the plaintiff with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia
at Guildford, which discloses that on 25 January
1999 there was withdrawn from
that account an amount of $5030.
<P>

9   	There is no evidence before the Court which discloses what,
if anything, was done with the amount thus withdrawn, or in any
way to connect
that withdrawal with the fifth defendant.  There is no evidence before the
Court which in any way supports the submission
that the plaintiff is a creditor
of the fifth defendant.  Since it is conceded by the plaintiff through her
solicitor that, in order
to have the standing to make the claim for removal of
the first defendant as liquidator of the fifth defendant, the plaintiff must
be
a creditor or a contributory of the fifth defendant, and since it is not
suggested on her behalf that she is a contributory but
only that she is a
creditor of the fifth defendant, and since there is no evidence whatsoever to
support that assertion, it follows
that the first defendant is entitled to have
the proceedings against him dismissed, and I propose so to order.
<P>

I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that the proceedings brought by the plaintiff against the first
defendant be dismissed.
<P>

(2)	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the first defendant of the
notice of motion filed by the first defendant on 12 July
1999 and of the
proceedings.
<P>
