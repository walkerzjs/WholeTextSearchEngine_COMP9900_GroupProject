<b>51/1991 - SMITH &amp; ORS   v   PACIFIC TRADING ENTERPRISES LIMITED &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	On 2 May 1991 the first defendant entered into a written agreement, which was
executed under seal, in Western Samoa to purchase
a 54 metre fishing vessel,
which was based there, from the second and third plaintiffs.  The first
defendant's obligations under
that agreement were guaranteed by the second and
third defendants, who were its directors.  The first plaintiff was a party to
the
agreement and referred to in it as "the Beneficiary".
<P>

2	Clause 2 provided that the first defendant would pay for the vessel firstly,
by paying the amount currently owing on her, including
interest accrued to a
specified date, to the Development Bank of Fiji, and secondly, by paying to the
first plaintiff, or as he should
direct in writing, $(A)30,000 by bank cheque.
These payments were made.  Thirdly, there was to be payment to the first
plaintiff
of:-
<P>

	<b>".. 20% of the net proceeds of fishing operations carried out by the vessel
for three consecutive fishing seasons (`the Instalment'),
commencing with the
1991/2 season.  The minimum Instalment paid by the Company to the Beneficiary
shall be United States $80,000
and the maximum shall be United States $180,000
if 20% of the net proceeds of fishing operations in value exceeds United States
$80,000
payable by 30th June in each year."</b>
<P>

3	Fourthly, the first defendant was to negotiate with the first plaintiff's
creditors in Fiji, who had furnished supplies and services
to the vessel:-
<P>

	<b>"And where it is deemed appropriate, assume responsibility for payment of
debts owing to such creditors as at the date of this contract,
payment to be
made within the period in which the Company pays the Instalment to the
beneficiary."</b>
<P>

4	Clause 5 provided that the guarantors guaranteed the performance of all the
obligations of the first defendant, including payment
by it to the first
plaintiff "under this Agreement".
<P>

5	On 5 December 1991 the plaintiffs issued a Statement of Claim in which they
pleaded the agreement and various provisions of it.
 In paragraph 7 it was
pleaded that in breach of the agreement the first defendant "failed to make any
payment in respect of the
1991 season".  I do not understand this allegation as
the first season for which the agreement made provision was the 1991/1992
season,
the payment being due on 30 June 1992.  Perhaps nothing turns on
this.
<P>

6	In the alternative it was pleaded that it was an implied term of the
agreement that the first defendant would not do anything
to deprive the
plaintiffs of the benefit of the agreement and, in breach thereof, the first
defendant "has commenced" negotiating
for the sale of the vessel to a person or
persons resident outside Fiji, whereby the first plaintiff would be deprived of
the benefit
of the payment of the net proceeds of fishing operations
contemplated by clause 2.
<P>

7	Further, and in the alternative, it was pleaded that in breach of the
agreement the first defendant failed to utilise the vessel
for fishing
operations, thereby depriving the plaintiffs, and in particular the first
plaintiff, of the benefit of the agreement.
<P>

8	In paragraph 11 it was pleaded that by reason of the breach or breaches
alleged the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage.
<P>

9	Declarations were sought that the first defendant was not entitled to sell
the vessel prior to compliance with clause 2, and that
the title of the first
defendant was subject to the title or interest of "the plaintiff" to secure
performance of the agreement.
 A general claim was made for damages, although
it was not particularised, and an order was sought restraining the first
defendant
from selling the vessel.  Ancillary relief was claimed. 
<P>

10	It was common ground that the vessel was sold by the first defendant to Asia
Pacific Business Associates Limited on 18 December
1991, as Carruthers J found
in a judgment he gave on 16 March 1992.
<P>

<b>The Course Of The Proceedings</b>
<P>

11	The matter came before Carruthers J on 4 December 1991, on an ex parte
basis. His Honour granted the plaintiffs leave to serve
a Notice of Motion for
Summary Judgment and a Statement of Claim outside the State of New South Wales,
the Statement of Claim being
filed on 5 December 1991.  He ordered that service
of those documents be effected personally on or before 11 December 1991,
abridged
the time for an Appearance to 18 December 1991, and made the Notice of
Motion returnable at 9.30am on 19 December 1991.
<P>

12	The matter came before his Honour on 20 December 1991 when there was an
appearance on behalf of the plaintiffs and the first
and second defendants.  He
noted the plaintiffs' undertaking as to damages and restrained the first and
second defendants from selling
or otherwise disposing of the vessel until
further order without first giving two days' notice in writing to the
solicitors for the
plaintiffs.  In fact the vessel had been disposed of on 18
December 1991.  He directed those defendants to file a Defence on or before
17
January 1992, stood the matter over to 4 February 1992 and granted liberty to
apply. 
<P>

13	On 16 March 1992 his Honour granted leave to the solicitor for the first and
second defendants to file a Notice of Ceasing to
Act and, conformably with the
finding he made on that day that the vessel had been transferred on 18 December
1991, he held that
the plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration that those
defendants had repudiated the agreement and were entitled to damages to
be
assessed.  He stood the matter over to a date to be fixed for an assessment of
damages and ordered the first and second defendants
to pay the plaintiffs'
costs.
<P>

14	On 19 February 1993, almost twelve months after his Honour had ordered that
damages were to be assessed, that matter came before
him.  There was an
appearance on behalf of the plaintiffs, but not on behalf of the first and
second defendants.  His Honour, according
to the Associate's Record of
Proceedings, ordered judgment for the plaintiffs against the first and second
defendants in the sum
of US$232,295, and that those defendants pay the
plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.
<P>

15	Although the judgment was entered on 25 March 1993, there are no reasons in
the file or to which the parties could refer me showing
how his Honour assessed
that amount.  I do not know what the components were.  No evidence, which must
have been before his Honour,
was sought to be tendered before me. 
<P>

<b>The Resurrection Of The Proceedings</b>
<P>

16	On 7 August 1998 the proceedings were listed before Hunter J, obviously at
the instance of the plaintiffs.  There was no suggestion
that any of the
defendants were given notice.  In a short judgment his Honour said:-
<P>

	<b>"In this matter Mr Taylor, for the plaintiff, seeks the directions of the
Court, unsupported by motion or affidavit, aimed at re-listing
of the matter
for the purpose of bringing before the Court the third defendant in proceedings
in which judgment has been previously
entered against the first and second
defendants at a time when the third defendant has not been served, that
defendant later being
served, it seems, imperfectly by service in Western
Samoa.  In any event, the third defendant did not participate in whatever
preceded
the judgment of this Court against the first and second defendants.
Whether that judgment followed a hearing on the merits or was
a summary
judgment or a judgment by default, one simply is not informed.</b>
<P>

<b>	In the circumstances I am prepared to direct the plaintiff to serve the
subject Statement of Claim upon the third defendant, that
service to be
personal service to be effected in the Australian Capital Territory.</b>
<P>

<b>	I list the matter for further directions on 18 September 1998.  If in the
meantime the plaintiff has occasion to reconsider its position
as against the
third defendant and desires to move formally in a manner different from that
the subject of these directions, then
it may do so on liberty to apply within
forty eight hours."</b>
<P>

17	It is not clear to me what his Honour was told about the proceedings, and Mr
G.I. Foster of Counsel, who appeared before me for
the plaintiffs but was not
then appearing, was unable to say.  The service on the third defendant, to
which his Honour was referring,
must have been the alleged service on 30 March
1992 to which the first plaintiff deposed in an affidavit he swore on 12 March
1996.
 The original of that affidavit was not before me, although a copy is an
annexure to an affidavit of Mr Peter John Brown, sworn on
17 February 1999.
Whether the third defendant was served on 30 March 1992 was a matter in issue
before me.  I am satisfied by his
evidence and also by the probabilities that
he was not.  He was cross-examined about the matter and he said that he could
not recall
receiving the Statement of Claim from Mr Smith.  He denied
discussing the Statement of Claim with him, and receiving such a document
from
him.  The probability, which strongly favours the view that he was not served,
is that when the proceedings came before Carruthers
J on 19 February 1993, i.e.
some eleven months after the alleged service, no attempt was made to obtain
judgment against him, and
there was no suggestion that he had been served.
There is no conceivable reason why, if he had been served, an attempt would not
have been made to obtain judgment against him and, as the chronology
demonstrates, the plaintiffs had plenty of time to take whatever
step may have
been necessary to proceed against him.
<P>

18	I do not understand the second paragraph of Hunter J's reasons to be in any
way stating that service of the Statement of Claim,
pursuant to the direction
he gave, would have any legal effect or significance.  There was no originating
process before his Honour,
and I cannot imagine he would have made any order
affecting substantive rights without giving the party against whom the order
was
sought the right to be heard.  It was rather a machinery step to be taken
with a view to ascertaining the legal position after the
document had been
furnished to the third defendant.
<P>

19	It was not in issue that the Statement of Claim was handed to the third
defendant on 1 September 1998 and, on 9 September 1998,
his Honour vacated the
directions hearing date of 18 September 1998, stood the matter over to 25
September 1998 for further directions,
and directed the plaintiffs to notify
the third defendant accordingly.
<P>

20	On 25 September 1998 I made orders by consent directing that the plaintiffs
file any motion in relation to the service of the
Statement of Claim upon the
third defendant, together with any affidavits upon which they intended to rely,
on or before 23 October
1998, and that the third defendant file any further
affidavits upon which he intended to rely on or before 20 November 1998.  I
gave
certain other directions, by consent, including re-listing the matter "for
any further directions" on 11 December 1998.  The plaintiffs
would not have
been pursuing this course if they had thought that Hunter J's directions had
any greater effect than I have attributed
to them.
<P>

21	On 22 September 1998 the third defendant, for whom Mr T.S. Murphy of Counsel
appeared, filed a Notice of Motion seeking an order
setting aside the Statement
of Claim as against him; an order discharging any order extending the validity
for service of the Statement
of Claim; an order setting aside the service of
the Statement of Claim upon him; and, in the alternative, a declaration that
the
Statement of Claim had not been duly served upon him.  Certain additional
relief was sought.
<P>

22	On 23 October 1998 the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Motion seeking orders
that the period of leave in which to serve the Statement
of Claim out of the
jurisdiction, granted by the Court on 4 December 1991, be extended from 11
December 1991 to 30 April 1992; that
service of the Statement of Claim on the
third defendant on 30 March 1992 be confirmed; that the requirement to comply
with Part
7 rule 7(1) be dispensed with in respect of the service of the
Statement of Claim on the third defendant on 1 September 1998; that
in the
alternative the period of validity of the Statement of Claim for the purpose of
service under Part 7 rule 7 be extended to
2 September 1998; that service of
the Statement of Claim on 1 September 1998 be confirmed; and for consequential
orders.
<P>

23	On 11 December 1998 I gave certain further directions and, on 19 February
1999, I fixed the motion for hearing on 8 April 1999.
<P>

<b>The Hearing Of The Notices Of Motion</b>
<P>

24	On the hearing the affidavits of Mr Peter John Brown sworn on 23 October
1998 and 17 February 1999, and the affidavit of the
third defendant sworn on 1
January 1999 were read.  In each of his affidavits Mr Brown said, and objection
was taken to this successfully,
that he was the attorney by Power of Attorney
for the plaintiffs and "empowered to conduct these proceedings on their
behalf".  The
success of these objections led to four Powers of Attorney being
tendered: Exhibits 1, 2 and 3.  Exhibit 1 was a Power of Attorney
granted to Mr
Brown by the second plaintiff on 21 July 1998, being limited to:-
<P>

	<b>".. matters pertaining to certain Admiralty action being No 51/1991 in the
Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sydney Registry, relating
to it, arising from
it, or the subject matter therein, or any new proceedings against any of the
parties named in No 51/1991 arising
therefrom."</b>
<P>

25	It was stated to be a condition of the Power of Attorney that the second
plaintiff and any member of her family be indemnified
for any costs as a direct
or indirect result of having granted the Power of Attorney and of the
proceedings.
<P>

26	On 4 June 1998 the third plaintiff gave a Power of Attorney to Mr Brown
confined:-
<P>

	<b>".. to matters pertaining to certain Admiralty Action No 51/1991 in the
Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sydney Registry or relating
to it or arising
from it or in relation to the subject matter therein or to commence new
proceedings between the same parties or
against any other persons touching or
relating to the said subject matter."</b>
<P>

27	The Powers of Attorney given by the first plaintiff on 5 October 1995 and 18
November 1997, became Exhibit 3.  The first Power
of Attorney was limited to
the proceedings, but the second was in general terms in relation to commencing
proceedings against the
third defendant "now of 66 Goldner Crescent, Melba in
the Australian Capital Territory" to enforce any of the first plaintiff's
rights
arising from the agreement and to take other appropriate action in
relation thereto.  Once that was established it was not submitted
that Mr Brown
did not have status to bring the present Notice of Motion.
<P>

28	It appeared from Mr Brown's evidence that he has taken an assignment of the
benefit of one half of any moneys that might be recovered
from the third
defendant, although the terms of the assignment  were not explored.
<P>

29	There was no evidence from any of the plaintiffs as to why they had not
pursued the proceedings against the third defendant,
nor why they had elected
to proceed to judgment against only the first and second defendants.  Nor was
there any evidence from Mr
Brown in relation to this latter matter.  Mr Brown
gave evidence that he had tried to have the first plaintiff come to the
hearing,
but, apparently he declined: p.24.
<P>

30	In his affidavit of 23 October 1998 Mr Brown set forth the history of the
matter and he said that he was informed by the first
plaintiff that between
March 1993 and the time of the granting of the Power of Attorney the plaintiffs
wished to proceed against
the third defendant, but did not know of his
whereabouts.  He continued that during the early months of 1996 he instructed
solicitors
in both Fiji and Western Samoa to register the New South Wales
judgment in both countries and, at that time, he had no knowledge
of the
whereabouts of the third defendant, although, towards the end of 1996 he became
aware that he was residing in Canberra and
telephoned him.  He recounted
certain conversations with the third defendant, which were not seriously in
issue, the purpose thereof,
he said, being to try to reach a commercial
settlement with him.  This was not achieved.  However, of more significance, to
my mind,
is the fact that Mr Brown knew where the third defendant was from late
1996, but did not seek to effect service on him.  In paragraph
23 of the
affidavit, which was admitted subject to relevance and only as to Mr Brown's
belief, he said that from early 1996 he was
preoccupied with enforcing judgment
against the second defendant in Fiji and Western Samoa, and he did not consider
it practical
to continue proceedings at that time against the third defendant,
whom he believed had been "validly served on 30 March 1992".  He
continued that
he believed that the continuation of the proceedings against the third
defendant could and should wait until enforcement
of the judgment was well
under way against the second defendant.
<P>

31	In his affidavit of 1 January 1999 the third defendant set out the history
of the matter.  He said that he returned from Western
Samoa on 30 September
1993 and, thereafter, lived in Canberra and, from 22 December 1993 at his
present address.  He also carried
on business in Canberra, and he denied that
he organised his affairs to avoid service of the Statement of Claim.  I accept
his evidence
in this regard.
<P>

32	In paragraph 25 he said he no longer held any records of any substance in
relation to his involvement in the purchase of the
vessel, which were lost in
transit when he returned to Australia, and that since he was served with the
Statement of Claim he has
made a number of enquiries to attempt to locate
relevant documents to assist in any defence of the proceedings, which he may be
required
to mount.  He said the only documents that he had been able to obtain
were contained in a file from the Cook Islands in relation
to the transfer of
the ownership of the vessel during 1991 to Asia Pacific Business Associates
Limited, that he understood that the
first defendant was no longer trading, and
that if the leave sought by the plaintiffs was granted then he would be
"severely prejudiced
in defending these proceedings by reason of the effluxion
of time".  He added he had no records to assist him in relation to
circumstances
surrounding the purchase.
<P>

33	In paragraph 29 he said it was his belief that the agreement was breached by
the plaintiffs in that it was initially represented
that the vessel was sold as
a going concern, ready for the 1991/1992 fishing season.  However, upon taking
delivery it was discovered
she had substantial inherent defects requiring a
complete overhaul, and as such she was not ready for the 1991/1992 fishing
season.
 He said:-
<P>

	<b>"Due to the substantial period of time which has elapsed from the date
delivery was taken of the vessel in 1991, to the date that
I was served with
the Statement of Claim on 1 September 1998, together with the fact that I no
longer hold any documentation of any
substance in relation to the vessel, I
will have substantial difficulty in setting up any defence to the plaintiff's
(sic) claim."</b>
<P>

34	In paragraph 30 he said that during the period 1 December 1991 to 1
September 1997 he organised his affairs without any reference
to the
proceedings, and that he believed that he will suffer substantial prejudice if
the plaintiffs are granted the leave they seek.
<P>

35	None of this material was objected to nor seriously challenged. 
<P>

36	In his affidavit of 17 February 1999 Mr Brown set out some of the history of
the matter and some of the attempts he had made
to ascertain the whereabouts of
the third defendant.
<P>

37	I am quite satisfied that the third defendant did not attempt to conceal his
whereabouts, that he was not served with the Statement
of Claim on 30 March
1992, and that he was unaware that there were any proceedings brought against
him until approximately 1997:
Tp.8, although he was aware, prior to that, that
proceedings had been brought against the first and second defendants.  He said
the
first time he saw the Statement of Claim was on 1 September 1998: Tp.7.
<P>

38	The primary relief sought by the plaintiffs is that in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5
of the Notice of Motion.  Although the relief sought
in paragraphs 1 and 2 was
not abandoned, it was not pressed with any enthusiasm, and having regard to all
the circumstances I can
understand why this was so.  As I have said I am quite
satisfied that no service was effected on the third defendant on 30 March
1992
and, accordingly, that no basis has been established for making either of those
orders.
<P>

<b>The Relief Sought</b>
<P>

39	Part 7 rule 7, as it existed when the Statement of Claim was issued,
provided:-
<P>

<b>"(1)	For the purposes of service an originating process shall be valid for
two years from the date on which it is filed. </b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	The Court shall not extend the period of two years mentioned in
sub-rule (1).</b>
<P>

<b>  (3)	Nothing in this rule prevents the plaintiff from commencing fresh
proceedings by filing another originating process."</b>
<P>

	
<P>

40	The rule was amended in respect to proceedings commenced on or after 1
September 1998 to reduce the period referred to in sub-rule
(1) to one year
"unless the Court otherwise orders", and to delete sub-rule (2).
<P>

41	The Statement of Claim clearly was not served within the time provided by
sub-rule (1), as then applicable.  In these circumstances
Mr Foster submitted
that there was an irregularity, which I could cure pursuant to s.81 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970.  The decision of Master Allen, which was

authority for the correctness of both those propositions.  It is also authority
for the proposition that service may be
permitted beyond the two year period
notwithstanding that there is an argument that the defendant would thereby be
deprived of the
limitation period.  This is because, so it was reasoned, the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 requires proceedings to be commenced within the
limitation period, and proceedings are commenced by the filing of the
originating
process.  Service of that process is not a step in the commencement
of the proceedings, but in the prosecution of them.  The question
is whether I
should, in the exercise of my discretion, cure the irregularity.
<P>

42	The facts in <b>Rust v Barnes</b> were set out at length by Master Allen and
showed that although the Statement of Claim had not been served the solicitors
for the
defendant were well aware of the nature of the claim and had engaged in
considerable discussions with the solicitors for the plaintiff
concerning the
matter.  At p.737 the Master said:-
<P>

	<b>"In the light of the above facts, however, I have come to the conclusion
that the discretion conferred by s.81 of the Act should be
exercised in favour
of the plaintiff.  The service, albeit irregular, should not be set aside.  The
irregularity should be cured.
 I do not consider that injustice to the
defendant would be occasioned thereby.  So far as the defendant on the record
is concerned,
that is the driver of the other vehicle, he is protected by his
third party insurance.  If, on the other hand, one regards the substantive
defendant as being the GIO, the position is that the plaintiff's claim is one
which is extensively examined and considered before
the Statement of Claim was
served.  <u>The present case is far from being one in which the defendant has
become aware so belatedly of the existence of the claim against
it that it
would suffer substantial prejudice in preparing for trial.  There is not a
scintilla of evidence that any person who was
a material witness has ceased to
be available to give evidence</u>.  There is direct evidence that the defendant
driver himself is still available."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

That factual position is quite different from the one which confronts me.
<P>

43	Mr Murphy submitted that the evidence established that the third defendant
was prejudiced in a number of ways.  Firstly, he does
not now have certain
documents, which he considers relevant to his defence.  In cross-examination he
referred to certain company
records, which, assuming they are still retained in
Western Samoa, related to relatively formal matters including the incorporation
of the first defendant and other such material.  He also referred to the
absence of the minutes of the first defendant's meetings.
 He was
cross-examined about documents necessary to deal with various parts of the
claim, and he said that he had bank records, although
it appeared that he did
not have the primary records pursuant to which his obligations to make certain
payments arose.  He elaborated
on the absence of documents at Tp.10, and, in
relation to a claim under Clause 2(iii), he said he had "nothing that would be
of assistance
there": Tp.17.  As this must have been a substantial component of
the damages awarded by Carruthers J and would be a major part of
the claim
against the third defendant, the prejudice is obvious and severe.  He said he
had bank records, but no original statements
or documents: Tpp.17-18.
<P>

44	Secondly, Mr Murphy relied on the sheer period of time which had elapsed
without the third defendant's being given notice of
the claim against him.
Thirdly, he relied upon the desire to raise a defence or cross-claim that the
plaintiffs were in breach of
the agreement, and the difficulties in
establishing that so long after the vessel was acquired and, as the evidence
now established,
after she had been sunk.  The sinking only occurred "some time
last year": Tp.28, so that if the plaintiffs had pursued the proceedings
against him in a timely fashion, she would then have been available for
inspection.  Fourthly, he relied upon the absence of any
records in relation to
the fishing seasons and, fifthly, upon the matters set forth in paragraph 30 of
the third defendant's affidavit.
 Sixthly, he relied on the fact that it would
now be very difficult, as execution had been levied against the second
defendant, for
the third defendant to pursue his rights against his
co-guarantor.  Seventhly, he submitted that the plaintiffs had elected to
proceed
only against the first and second defendants and that they had failed
to give any evidence why they had adopted this course.  The
submission ran
that, for all the evidence disclosed, there may well have been good reason for
this.  He noted that Mr Smith had declined
to appear. On the other hand there
was some evidence from Mr Brown, to which I have referred, that from March 1993
the plaintiffs
wished to proceed against the third defendant, although the
significance of this evidence is difficult to understand.  I say that
because
the relevant reference to March was 30 March 1992, when it was asserted the
third defendant was served with the Statement
of Claim.  There is no particular
reason why March 1993 was a date of any significance, unless it was because it
was shortly after
Carruthers J gave judgment against the first and second
defendants.  The third defendant has never seen the documentation relied
on
before his Honour: Tp.18, and it was not identified to me.  However, because of
the absence of any evidence from the plaintiffs
one is left to speculate as to
their reason for not proceeding against the third defendant.  In my opinion the
Court should not be
placed in the position of speculating on these matters.
There was no suggestion that the persons, who were in a position to give
evidence as to why they did not proceed against the third defendant, could not
provide such evidence.  There has been ample opportunity,
consistently with the
directions given by the Court, for such evidence to be obtained.  They either
refused, in the case of the first
plaintiff, or did not do so in the case of
the others and without explanation.
<P>

45	I accept that all the matters, to which Mr Murphy referred in his
submissions, have occasioned substantial prejudice to the third
defendant, in
circumstances where he is in no way to blame for any of them and was kept
unaware that proceedings had been commenced.
<P>

46	Mr Murphy submitted that the substantial effluxion of time, without notice
that the proceedings were on foot against him, meant
that the third defendant
suffered the imperceptible prejudice which any litigant suffers by virtue of
that fact.  If he is now required
to consider the case it may well be that
witnesses are no longer available, that memories have faded and that evidence
has been lost.
 Certainly it is known that the vessel can no longer be
inspected.  It must also be borne in mind that the transactions took place
overseas, which only adds to the difficulty of accumulating the necessary
evidence.
<P>

47	In regard to the question of prejudice I respectfully refer to the statement
of Kirby P in <b>Williams v Minister, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a> &amp;
Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 497</a>, at p.513.  His Honour said:-
<P>

	<b>"There is no justice in a lopsided trial in which one person asserts claims
and the other is denied the opportunity to test, verify
and counter such
claims.  It is not just to force a party to trial at which that party is bereft
of evidence which has either disappeared
or been destroyed through the passing
of time or the dispersal or death of witnesses."</b>
<P>

48	It cannot be said in the present case that the third defendant has been
totally bereft of evidence, but I am satisfied that he
has been deprived of
evidence to a substantial degree.
<P>

49	In my opinion, this is solely because of the failure of the plaintiffs to
pursue their rights against him in a timely manner.
 As I have said there is no
blame which can be attached to him.
<P>

50	Mr Foster submitted that the plaintiffs were entitled to bring the
proceedings at least six years, and perhaps twelve years if
the agreement be
construed as a Deed, after the cause of action arose in 1991 and, thereafter,
would have a further two years in
which to serve the Statement of Claim.  The
submission ran that in respect of these proceedings the plaintiffs had at least
eight
years to commence and serve them, and perhaps fourteen years, and that if
the plaintiffs had adopted even the former approach all
the elements of
prejudice about which Mr Murphy complained would equally apply.  The submission
only points up the gross prejudice
a party can suffer when there is a delay in
bringing forward the proceedings and, no doubt, explains why the time within
which service
can be effected validly has been reduced by the recent
amendments.  However, strictly speaking, Mr Foster's submissions are correct,
but, in the present case in my opinion, they are not applicable and suffer from
the deficiency that the plaintiffs did not delay
in bringing the proceedings.
They instituted the proceedings expeditiously and, thereby, set the two year
period running.  It expired
in December 1993.  It does not, in those
circumstances, avail the plaintiffs to say that they could have refrained from
bringing
the proceedings until a much later date.  They did not, and they are
therefore fixed with the consequences of the rules applying
to the proceedings
they did commence and in circumstances where the third defendant knew that
proceedings were on foot against the
first and second defendants, but not
against him. Mr Foster elicited from the third defendant that he was aware of
the proceedings
against the first and second defendants.  But I am satisfied he
was not aware of those against him.  In this respect he could well
have been
lulled into a false sense of security.   In fact almost five years went by from
the time when service, at the latest, should
have been effected, to when the
Statement of Claim was handed to the third defendant.  Admittedly there had
been some discussions
between him and Mr Brown from late 1996.  However, it is
obvious from Mr Brown's recitation of those discussions that they never
appeared likely to lead a resolution of the matter.  The reason Mr Brown
advanced for not pursuing the proceedings is singularly
unconvincing.  One
would have thought that if he had been trying to bring about a settlement he
would have done so against the background
of forcing the third defendant to
face up to the proceedings.  More importantly for present purposes some
elements of prejudice may
have been removed or alleviated.
<P>

51	Mr Murphy also submitted that there was no challenge to the evidence of the
third defendant that he had arranged his affairs
on the basis that there were
no proceedings against him.  This was correct and disclosed another element of
prejudice.
<P>

52	Mr Foster further submitted that a number of matters on which Mr Murphy
relied were incapable of any precise evaluation, so far
as prejudice was
concerned.  He said one simply could not measure the prejudice in relation to
the non-availability of the vessel.
 He made a similar submission in relation
to certain other matters.  These submissions merely point up the problem
confronted by
the third defendant, that is that it is, at this stage, not
possible to quantify in any intelligible way the extent of the prejudice,
which
has been suffered.  As Mr Foster conceded it may be minimal or it may be great.
It is hardly open to the plaintiffs, who have
failed to act conformably with
the Rules and have been guilty of the most gross delay, to assert that the
third defendant now cannot
be precise about the extent of the prejudice
suffered.  The fact is that there is a concession that there has been
prejudice, which
may be great.  Even if the prejudice is minimal the various
events of prejudice, when aggregated, may be great.  Suffice it is that
there
is relevant and, I am satisfied, not insubstantial prejudice.  This has been
caused by the plaintiffs and it could well result
in a totally unfair trial if
the proceedings are allowed to go forward.
<P>

53	Mr Foster had, in my opinion, no real answer to the submission that the
third defendant would have great difficulty in mounting
a cross-claim against
the plaintiffs based on the condition of the vessel when she was received,
which the third defendant alleged
not to be consistent with the agreement.
Nor, as I have sought to say, was he able to explain why the plaintiffs had not
proceeded
earlier against the third defendant, save to the extent to which I
have referred.
<P>

54	Mr Murphy also submitted that his client would be greatly prejudiced because
the amount of the debt has now been substantially
increased by the addition of
interest under s.94 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b>.  In an attempt to deflect
this element of prejudice Mr Foster stated that he was instructed by Mr Brown,
who was in Court at all
times and certainly when the concession was made, that
Mr Brown would not pursue a claim for interest from the date on which the
Statement of Claim was filed.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

55	I have come to the conclusion that the third defendant has established that
he would be severely and irreparably prejudiced if
he was now required to
defend the proceedings in which, of course, I include bringing any cross-claim
in relation to the state of
the vessel or against his co-guarantor.  In all
these circumstances I am not disposed to remedy the irregularity in service in
the
exercise of my discretion.  There is another matter which is of importance.
The evidence is that the execution against the second
defendant has realised
some $45,000, and that the first defendant has no assets.  In those
circumstances, prima facie, the plaintiffs
will suffer some loss.  However,
that is entirely their own fault and had they acted with promptitude, such that
the prejudice to
which I have referred did not accrue to the third defendant,
they may not be in that position.  
<P>

56	There is a further matter which requires consideration.  The third defendant
guaranteed the obligations of the first defendant
under the agreement.  A very
real question arises as to whether the payment of damages for a repudiation of
the agreement was an
obligation undertaken by the third defendant as guarantor.
There was no evidence before me as to how Carruthers J assessed the damages,
but what must be clear is that his Honour was awarding a sum for amounts which
would accrue due, at least in part, in the future.
 In that sense the award
comprised an element, the extent of which was not disclosed, for pure damages,
as opposed to amounts bound
to be paid under the contract.  Mr Foster conceded
that this led to some doubt as to the extent to which the plaintiffs could
recover
against the third defendant, although he submitted that that should be
resolved on the hearing.  In my view it is a material matter,
although perhaps
not of the highest significance, to be taken into account when one is
determining how the discretion should be exercised.
 It is the more so when the
method by which his Honour assessed damages is not revealed.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

57	I am satisfied that the plaintiffs' Notice of Motion should be dismissed
with costs.  I consider that if I make that order there
is no need to make any
order on the third defendant's Notice of Motion.  However, I am satisfied that
notwithstanding that the third
defendant is entitled to his costs of his Notice
of Motion, although, for the assistance of the costs' assessor I record that
both
motions were heard together.
<P>

58	I order that the plaintiffs' Notice of Motion filed on 23 October 1998 be
dismissed with costs including the third defendant's
costs of his Notice of
Motion and that the Exhibits be returned.
