<P>

<b>1407/94	TEODORA STURAITIS   -v-   THE PUBLIC TRUSTE OF NEW SOUTH WALES   -
ESTATE OF KAZYS STURAITIS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.  By summons filed on 16 February 1994 the plaintiff,
Teodora Sturaitis, seeks an order for provision for her maintenance out of
the
estate of her late husband Kazys Sturaitis (to whom I shall refer as "the
deceased").
<P>

2   	The deceased died, aged seventy-two, on 8 September 1992.
He left a will dated 16 March 1992, probate whereof was, on 27 January
1993,
granted to the Public Trustee, the executor named in such will (who is the
defendant to the present proceedings).
<P>

3   	The assets of the decease consisted essentially of a house
property situate at and known as 35 Clarke Street, Bass Hill, which
had been
the matrimonial home of the plaintiff and the deceased at the time of his
death, together with amounts in various bank accounts.
 The assets presently
consist of the house property at Clarke Street and moneys totalling $47,679
held by the Public Trustee, representing
the other assets in the estate.
<P>

4   	By his will the deceased gave a legacy of $5000 to the
plaintiff.  He gave the balance of his estate to his niece Jane
Sturaite-Zumiene.
It would appear that an amount of $66,433, being the proceeds
of a life policy has been paid directly to the niece of the deceased
and has
not formed part of the estate of the deceased.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff was born on 19 October 1923 in Lithuania.
She is presently seventy-five years of age.  She graduated in medicine
in
Lithuania in August 1949 and for about forty years practised as a medical
doctor in State Hospitals in Lithuania. The plaintiff
was married for a short
period from 1958 to 1964.  The only child of the plaintiff died in July
1985.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff came to Australia on a visit in July 1989 at
the invitation of a cousin who was residing in Darwin.  She subsequently
visited Sydney.   She was on a six months visitor's visa.  The plaintiff in
November 1989 met the deceased, who also had been born
in Lithuania.  He had,
however, resided in Australia since the early 1950s.  
<P>

7   	The deceased at the time when he met the plaintiff had
recently been widowed.  The deceased had no children. The plaintiff
married the
deceased on 15 January 1990.  She subsequently obtained permanent residence in
Australia on 8 January 1992.
<P>

8   	The deceased at the time when he married the plaintiff was
aged seventy.  He was not in good health at that time.  He suffered
at the time
of his marriage and until his death from a number of health problems, which
included chronic bronchitis, hypertension
and arteriosclerosis, circulatory
obstructive disease, anxiety depression, advanced spinal degenerative
spondylosis and a determatological
problem.  Throughout the period of the
marriage he spent much of his time in bed, whilst the plaintiff cooked,
attended to the housekeeping,
did the shopping, attended to the washing, took
the deceased to his doctor and acted as a nurse.  There is in evidence a report
from
the treating doctor of the deceased, Dr A F Czyniewski dated 12 October
1992 (the statements wherein have not in any way been challenged
by the
defendant), which includes the following:
<P>

On 15 January 1990 he [the deceased] married a recently arrived Lithuanian
lady, a retired medical practitioner, who has become
well known to me,
particularly in assisting in his medical supervision, dermatological
applications and general domestic support.
 Mrs Teodora Sturaitis became
invaluable in assisting me in the management of a complex medical invalid.
<P>

That report is dated 12 October 1992, only a matter of a few weeks after the
death of the deceased.
<P>

9   	In mid-1992, from April to June of that year, the plaintiff
and the deceased paid a visit to Lithuania, where the plaintiff
still
maintained an apartment. The precise legal status of that apartment appears to
be complicated; but I gather that whilst the
plaintiff remains the legal owner
of the apartment she cannot dispose of it unless she makes certain payments to
the Government of
Lithuania; even then there appears to be a limitation upon
the way in which she can dispose of it, in that she must offer it first
to a
neighbour in the same apartment building.  In any event, the apartment appears
to have a relatively small value in terms of
Australian money.  The plaintiff
says that she estimates it to be worth approximately $(A)21,000.
<P>

10   	The deceased apparently originally did not intend to
accompany the plaintiff on the visit to Lithuania, although that visit
had been
discussed by both the plaintiff and the deceased from December of the preceding
year.  Only after the plaintiff had actually
arrived in Lithuania at the end of
February 1992 did the deceased inform her that he was proposing to come to
Lithuania. He, in fact,
arrived on 25 April 1992 where he was met at the
Vilnius airport by the plaintiff.
<P>

11   	Throughout the period whilst the plaintiff and the
deceased were both in Lithuania at the same time, it would appear that
the
deceased spent probably about one month staying with his relatives and,
according to the plaintiff, more than a month staying
in her apartment with the
plaintiff.  However, since the plaintiff and the deceased departed from
Lithuania on 11 June 1992 and arrived
together in Australia two days later, the
precise periods referred to by the plaintiff in her evidence, which would total
more than
two months, cannot be entirely accurate.  
<P>

12   	Nevertheless, whilst the deceased  was in Lithuania, he
made complaints to various relatives concerning the plaintiff.   
Those
complaints fell into two categories.  The first was that she had married him
only to obtain permanent residence in Australia.
The second was that she did
not look after him properly.
<P>

13   	In support of the first category of complaints there has
been tendered in evidence, as Exhibit 1, a statutory declaration
by the
deceased dated 6 February 1992, which has been produced from the records of the
Department of Immigration in answer to a subpoena
addressed by the defendant to
that Department.  The circumstances in which the deceased created that
statutory declaration have not
been disclosed in evidence to the Court.  That
statutory declaration refers to the fact that the plaintiff was the applicant
for
permanent residence.  The deceased then says:
<P>

I did not marry my wife for the purpose of enabling her to obtain permanent
residency status in Australia.  Subsequent to our marriage
my wife has become
very independent and no marriage relationship now exists between us, although
my wife still resides in my house
at 35 Clarke Street, Bass Hill.  My wife has
said to me, 'Wait till I get permanent residency, then we can separate.' I now
believe
that my wife married me for convenience so that she could obtain
permanent residency in Australia.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff was cross-examined concerning the content of
that document and especially concerning whether she had married
the deceased in
order to obtain permanent residence in Australia.  The plaintiff denied those
suggestions.  Apart from that statutory
declaration and apart from complaints
of a similar tenor which appear to have been made by the deceased to various
relatives during
the visit to Lithuania, there is no evidence to support the
suggestion that the marriage of the plaintiff to the deceased was motivated
by
a desire to obtain permanent residence, or was in any way a sham or was not a
true marriage.  Indeed, the plaintiff in her oral
evidence said that she was
not aware until after she had married the deceased that her marriage would have
entitled her to apply
for or obtain permanent residence in Australia.
<P>

15   	In her affidavit of 14 February 1994 the plaintiff, in
paragraph 17, refers to the fact that before her marriage the deceased
said to
her: 
<P>

I will leave the house, car and all my property to you and all my savings
except a small amount which I intend to leave to my brother
Peter John
Sturaitis in Lithuania.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff also referred to the fact that at their
wedding reception the deceased had said that he was intending to give
her his
motor vehicle as a wedding present.  However, he never transferred the
registration of that vehicle to the plaintiff's name.
 Counsel for the
plaintiff has informed the Court that the motor vehicle was, in fact, seriously
damaged in an accident in 1994 and
that in consequence the proceeds of the
insurance entitlement in respect of that vehicle now form part of the assets of
the estate
held by the Public Trustee.
<P>

17   	Evidence has been placed before the Court by the residuary
beneficiary, the niece of the deceased, concerning her financial
and material
circumstances.  During the visit to Lithuania of the plaintiff and the deceased
in 1992, the deceased gave to his niece
Jane an amount of $10,000 as a wedding
present.  (She married in 1992.) In addition, the plaintiff also gave to the
deceased's niece
the sum of $1000 which had been entrusted to her by the
deceased for that purpose before her departure from Australia.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff, as the widow of the deceased, is an
eligible person within paragraph (a) of the definition of that phrase contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  As such she has the
standing to bring the present proceedings.  Indeed, the plaintiff is the only
eligible person in relation to
the deceased. The chief beneficiary, the niece
of the deceased, is not an eligible person.  Indeed, the evidence discloses
that at
the time when he made his will the deceased had never met his niece.
He met her for the first time only a month or so later, during
his visit to
Lithuania.
<P>

19   	The plaintiff is and has since the death of the deceased
continued to live in the house at 35 Clarke Street, Bass Hill.  The
parties are
in agreement that the present value of that house property is between $215,000
and $220,000.
<P>

20   	The plaintiff has not been in employment since she came to
Australia.  She has been in receipt of a pension since the time
of her marriage
to the deceased. For the first two years of that marriage the plaintiff's
pension was, in fact, paid into the deceased's
bank account and, to that
extent, the deceased had control over the plaintiff's own financial position.
The plaintiff's pension is
presently in the sum of $181.35 a week.  She has no
other income.  From that amount she pays all outgoings in respect to the house
property and pays for all costs for her own upkeep and maintenance.  Apart from
clothing and personal effects the only assets of
the plaintiff consist of the
two bedroom flat in Lithuania and a very small amount, totalling a little over
$400, held by her in
a bank account and in a credit society account. The
plaintiff is in good health, although she does suffer from high blood
pressure.
<P>

21   	It is the plaintiff's desire to continue to reside in the
Clarke Street property, since she had a garden there where she is
able to grow
flowers and vegetables.  She enjoys gardening and the growing of vegetables
allows her to supplement her groceries in
this way.  The Bass Hill residence is
also close to the Lithuanian Club at Bankstown, which is the centre of the
plaintiff's social
activities.  She also attends the Lithuanian Catholic Church
at Lidcombe, which is close to Bass Hill.
<P>

22   	The parties have given estimates of the costs of the
present proceedings. The estimate given by the solicitor for the plaintiff
is
that her costs in these proceedings will be in the sum of about $15,000; whilst
that given by the solicitor for the defendant
is that the costs will total
about $20,000.
<P>

23   	The Court recognises that the marriage was of short
duration.  Nevertheless that fact does not absolve the deceased from
responsibilities
to his widow.  The deceased may, during the course of the
marriage, have come to believe that the plaintiff's motive in marrying
him was
to obtain permanent residence in Australia, a country which, under
cross-examination, she said she had come to like and where
she wished to
remain.  Nevertheless, that fact of itself, even if true, would not necessarily
absolve the deceased from his responsibilities
to make provision for the
plaintiff.
<P>

24   	It must be observed that even though the plaintiff
obtained permanent residency on 8 January 1992, she still continued to
remain
not merely occupying the same house property as the deceased until his death,
but also, and of consequence, continued to act
as his nurse and to assist Dr
Czyniewski in carrying out the medical treatment for the deceased and in taking
him to and from Dr
Czyniewski.
<P>

25   	The situation in which the deceased found himself with the
plaintiff, whether or not he suspected her motives in marrying
him, was clearly
one which suited the deceased, in that he had an unpaid housekeeper and an
unpaid medically qualified nurse to look
after him in his condition of
ill-health.  Further, for the first two years of their marriage he appears to
have had complete control
of the plaintiff's finances and income. 
<P>

26   	In the light of the denials by the plaintiff under oath
that she married the deceased only in order to obtain permanent residence
in
Australia, I am not satisfied that the complaints of the deceased either made
in his statutory declaration (the circumstances
giving rise to which have not,
as I have indicated, been revealed to the Court), or made to the various
relatives in Lithuania are
necessarily true. But even if contrary to that view
there was substance in those complaints and that belief, that fact of itself
does not discharge the deceased from an obligation to ensure that the plaintiff
had at least accommodation.
<P>

27   	If the terms of the will take effect, the plaintiff, on a
very small pension, totally without assets in Australia, and with
an asset in
Lithuania, which even if she could dispose of would give her very little in
Australian money, would be left totally without
any accommodation.
<P>

28   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established an
entitlement at least to the house property at Clarke Street, Bass Hill.
 That
entitlement, however, must be viewed in the light of any competing claims upon
the testamentary bounty of the deceased.  The
only such competing claim is that
of the deceased's niece.  She has already directly from the deceased received a
wedding gift totalling
$11,000. She has, since the death of the deceased,
received the proceeds of life policies totalling $66,433.  Those life policies
have enabled the niece and her husband to acquire a three bedroom apartment in
Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania in October 1995.
 In her affidavit she says
that they were able to purchase the apartment after she received money from the
deceased's insurance.
<P>

29   	The niece is presently unemployed. She and her husband
have a young daughter, who was born in 1994.  Her husband is a roofer.
 He
receives in the equivalent of United States currency about $180 a month.
According to her, they live very sparingly, and in her
affidavit she says,
"Because of our family's difficult financial conditions we cannot afford to
have another child."  The evidence
is silent as to whether the difficulty in
finding a job (to which the niece refers in her affidavit) is as a result of
the economic
situation in Lithuania, or as a result of her own personal
situation.  I allowed that evidence over objection by Counsel for the
plaintiff.  The niece is a qualified kindergarten teacher.
<P>

30   	I do not have any evidence of comparable cost of living
figures between Lithuania and Australia. But there are references
in the
affidavit of the niece of the deceased to her husband's monthly wage and to the
cost of food and telephone and car maintenance
as well as the cost of such
outgoings as electricity, heating, gas and water on their apartment.  It would
appear that the cost of
living in Lithuania is considerably less than that in
Australia, especially in Sydney.
<P>

31   	The niece has already received in consequence of the death
of the deceased a benefit which has been sufficient to enable her
to purchase a
three bedroom apartment in the capital of Lithuania.  I am not satisfied that
any competing claim of the niece, who
I have already observed is not an
eligible person and who had not even met her uncle, the deceased, at the time
when the will was
made in her favour, is such which should reduce, let alone
extinguish, any order for provision any entitlement to which the plaintiff
might otherwise have established.  I have already expressed my view that the
plaintiff is entitled to receive the Clarke Street house
property.  She should
receive that property absolutely.  The only other question remaining concerns
the balance of the estate.
<P>

32   	After the payment of the two sets of costs there will
remain about $12,000 in the hands of the Public Trustee. But of that
$12,000,
$5000 is an amount to which the plaintiff herself is entitled under the terms
of the will.  It seems to me that any balance
then remaining should also go to
the plaintiff, to enable her to have some little fund available to meet what is
obviously a very
limited lifestyle and to have some moneys available to meet
contingencies.  Accordingly, I propose to order that the plaintiff, in
lieu of
the benefit given to her by the will of the deceased, receive the entirety of
the estate absolutely.  I will formulate my
orders.
<P>

33   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that in lieu of the benefit given to her by the will of the late
Kazys Sturaitis ("the deceased"), the plaintiff receive
the entirety of the
estate of the deceased absolutely.
<P>

2.	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and the
costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

The exhibits may be returned.
