<b>50080/99	LEADENHALL AUSTRALIA LIMITED  &amp; ADVENT INVESTORS </b>
<P>

<b>PTY LIMITED  &amp;  NOBLE INVESTMENTS PTY LIMITED  v   PEPTECH
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	Leadenhall Australia Limited (Leadenhall), Advent Investors
Pty Ltd (Advent) and Noble Investments Pty Ltd (Noble), the plaintiffs,
are
related corporations which may be regarded as being under the control of
Timothy Owen Lebbon (Lebbon) who is a director of each.
 In these proceedings
the plaintiffs seek damages pursuant to section 1005 of the Corporations Law;
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 82</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act 1987</a>.  
<P>

2   	The allegations central to each, in substance, are the
same, namely of misleading conduct by Peptech Limited (Peptech) in relation
to
the decision of Leadenhall to enter into agreements with Peptech for the
allotment to Leadenhall of shares in Peptech and the
granting to Leadenhall of
options to subscribe for shares in Peptech.  
<P>

3   	Under the first agreement made on 31 July 1997 (the
allotment agreement) Leadenhall agreed to subscribe for 5,254,542 shares
at an
issue price of 62 cents and Peptech agreed to allot those shares and to grant
options to Leadenhall to acquire an equal number
of shares at  an exercise
price 62 cents and a further 1,313,635 shares at an exercise price of $1.00.
The acquisition price of the
shares was payable as to $1,000,000 by 5 August
1997 and, as to the balance of  $2,257,816, by 1 September 1997.  The options
were
exercisable up to 25 June 2002, with provision for adjustment of the
exercise price by a formula designed to protect against dilution
of Peptech's
issued shares during the first three years of the option period.  
<P>

4   	Leadenhall did not meet its obligations to make timely
payments under the allotment agreement, and there resulted a further
agreement
between Peptech and Leadenhall of 25 September 1997 (the substitution
agreement) under which the allotment agreement was
terminated and Peptech
agreed to allot to Leadenhall 1,612,903 shares in consideration of a payment of
$1,000,000 which Leadenhall
had made under the allotment agreement.  In
addition, Peptech granted Leadenhall 1,612,903 options at an exercise price of
62 cents
and 403,225 options at an exercise price of $1.00 as the same terms
and conditions as the allotment agreement.  
<P>

5   	Under the allotment agreement Peptech was to pay Leadenhall
"the sum of $250,000.00 by way of commission....in consideration
of
(Leadenhall) subscribing and procuring subscriptions for [the subject] Shares".
Under the substitution agreement that entitlement
to commission was waived and
Leadenhall and Peptech granted mutual releases in the following terms:
<P>

"4.	Leadenhall releases Peptech from any claims or causes of action which it
has or might otherwise have had against Peptech in
respect of the allotment
agreement or anything in any way relating to that agreement.
<P>

5.	Peptech releases Leadenhall from any claims or causes of action which it has
or might otherwise have had against Leadenhall in
respect of the allotment
agreement or anything in any way relating to that agreement."
<P>

6   	It was acknowledged that the substitution agreement was by
way of an "irrevocable and unconditional agreement of Leadenhall
to terminate
the allotment agreement". Leadenhall contends that it entered into the
substitution agreement on a `take it or leave
it' stance of Peptech and while
Leadenhall continued to be influenced by the misleading conduct of Peptech.

<P>

7   	The case against Peptech is attractive in its simplicity.
The allegations are that, in contravention of the listing rules (the
listing
rules) of Australian Stock Exchange Limited (the ASX), Peptech, in its Annual
Report for the year ended 30 September 1996
(the 96 report) failed to disclose
that some 14,976,825 of its securities were restricted securities (the
restricted shares) within
the meaning of the listing rules and failed to
disclose the terms of those restrictions: that in its half yearly report for
the period
ended 31 March 1997 (the half yearly report) Peptech incorrectly
reported that there were 134,159,197 ordinary shares issued and
the same number
quoted, whereas 14,976,825 of those securities were restricted shares and not
capable of being quoted:  that, in
negotiations with Leadenhall, Peptech failed
to disclose that certain of those restricted shareholders  proposed to sell
those shares
when released from escrow in August-September 1997 and that the
chief executive officer of Peptech proposed to facilitate those sales
(the
misleading conduct).  
<P>

8   	There is a related cause of action based upon s1002G(1) of
the Corporations Law (the insider trading claim).  The insider trading
claim
pursuant to s1005 of the Corporations Law seeks damages for misleading conduct
by Peptech in failing to disclose to Leadenhall
information which fell within
the ambit of Division 2A <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7.11" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7.11</a> of Ch 7 of the Corporations Law: Peptech being
an insider within the meaning of s 1002G(1).  The insider information is said
to be:
<P>

	(a) the existence and terms of the restrictions of the restricted shares;
<P>

	(b) instructions given on behalf of Peptech to its solicitor in relation to
the manner in which the 	restricted shares would come
out of escrow; and
<P>

	(c) the likelihood that certain shares in which Dr Roger Aston (Aston), a
director and chief 	executive officer of Peptech, held
a beneficial interest,
would be sold upon those restricted shares 	coming out of escrow.
<P>

In general terms those securities could not be traded under various restriction
agreements prior to, respectively, 29, 30 August,
2,3,3,4,6 September 1997.
<P>

9   	It is the plaintiffs' case that, on 25 September 1997,
Advent resolved to acquire from Leadenhall the beneficial interest in
the
options, the subject of the substitution agreement, and was influenced in
acquiring that interest by Peptech's misleading conduct:
further, that, on 25
September 1997, Noble resolved to acquire 900,000 of the shares allotted to
Leadenhall under the substitution
agreement at an exercise price of 46 cents
per share and that it, also, was influenced in acquiring the beneficial
interest in those
shares by Peptech's misleading conduct.
<P>

10   	The dates upon which the restricted shares were to come
out of escrow gained added significance from the terms of Leadenhall's
agreement (the on-sale) with an un-named Western Australian investor (the
on-sale investor).  That was an agreement entered into
about the same time as
the allotment agreement and provided for the investment by the on-sale investor
of $1,000,000 in the acquisition
from Leadenhall of Peptech shares.  The number
of shares to be acquired was determined by the acquisition price which was the
lesser
of Leadenhall's acquisition price of 62 cents under the allotment
agreement, or the average share price for the period 1 September
- 5 September
inclusive.  There were mutual undertakings by the on-sale investor and
Leadenhall not to trade on the stock exchange
any shares in Peptech in that
last mentioned period.  No mention was made, either in the on-sale agreement or
the allotment agreement,
of the fact that some 14,000,000 shares in Peptech
would be coming out of escrow in that period.  
<P>

11   	The restricted shares were the result of an issue of
14,976,825 ordinary shares in Peptech to certain shareholders in Peptech
(UK)
Limited (Peptech UK), as part of the acquisition by Peptech of the whole of the
issued shares in Peptech (UK). The Peptech UK
transaction was disclosed in the
96 report without any reference to the attendant embargo on trading in the
restricted shares imposed
pursuant to the listing rules.  The nature of the
transaction between the Peptech (UK) shareholders and Peptech was such as to
bring
the Peptech shares issued to the Peptech (UK) shareholders within the
definition of restricted securities within the meaning of Ch
19 of the listing
rules.  Pursuant to Ch 9 of the listing rules, restriction agreements were
entered into precluding any dealings
in those restricted shares up to the times
above mentioned.  
<P>

12   	Reginald Arthur Charles Keene (Keene) was called in the
plaintiffs' case to give expert opinion of the likely market effect
of  the
restricted shares coming out of escrow in August / September 1997.  He is a
private client adviser with Credit Suisse First
Boston Australia Equities
Private Limited.  He has been a stockbroker for over 30 years.  He was a
director and managing director
of Hattersly &amp; Maxwell Limited and committee
member of the ASX and its Vice-Chairman for a period of two years.  He was on
the
Sydney Listing Committee for a period in excess of 20 years, including a
period as its Chairman: it being the committee which was
consulted by the
National Listing Committee of the ASX.  Of the existence and terms of the
restricted shares in Peptech he gave the
following opinion evidence:
<P>

13   	
<P>

"3.	In my opinion :
<P>

(a)	the existence and terms of the Restricted Shares in Peptech Limited
<P>

("Peptech") were material matters to be known by a person acquiring shares and
options in Peptech on 31 July 1997 and on 25 September
1997 for the reasons set
out below.
<P>

(b)	The fact that 14,976,825 of the 134,157,197 issued shares in Peptech were
restricted securities that could not be dealt with
until on or about 6
September 1997 and that could be dealt with after that date, on 31 July 1997
and on 25 September 1997, was information,
if generally available, likely to
have a material effect on the price or value of the issued shares of Peptech in
that it would,
or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in
securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, buy or sell
shares in
Peptech.
<P>

4.	It can be expected, and the market anticipates, that when restricted
securities come out of escrow, that is, cease to be restricted
securities and
become tradeable, the holders of those securities, who have been prevented from
dealing with those securities, will
sell them or a substantial number of them
as  soon as, or shortly after, they cease to be restricted securities.  It can,
therefore,
be anticipated that with the selling pressure so created the market
price of the shares, of which the restricted securities form
part, will fall,
before (in anticipation) and after (by effect), the restricted securities
become tradeable. The effect on the market,
which is to depress the share
price, is likely to be greater than it otherwise would be if the price of the
shares was already in
decline, as in the case of the Peptech shares in the
relevant period, as may be seen from the graph which is annexure A to this
statement.
<P>

5.	      Neither  a short term investor nor a medium or long term investor
would normally 	      choose to acquire securities in
a company in which a
significant proportion of the 	       capital is represented by restricted
securities which will become tradeable
soon after 	        the investment,
because of the probability that the market price of the shares will    
<P>

              decline before and after the restricted shares became tradeable.
The normal and          
<P>

              prudent course in such a situation is to wait until after the
restrictions on trading are 
<P>

              lifted, to see what happens in the market and, if there is an
increase in volume of 
<P>

              selling, indicating a sale of former restricted shares, to wait
until most of the former 
<P>

              restricted shares have been cleared..."
<P>

14   	In cross examination he gave the following further
evidence:
<P>

"A.   ...almost certainly when other things being equal, when stock comes out
of escrow, especially if the amount is a significant
proportion of the issued
capital, as was the case in this stock and is the case generally in mining
companies where this is more
prevalent, generally speaking the market price
does fall, sometimes very substantially.
<P>

Q.   Can we take it step by step, please.  The market price falls, may I take
it, because what happens on those occasions that you
have in mind is that after
the shares are released from escrow there are sales on market?
<P>

A.   From the escrow stock, yes.  People who have been tied up, they haven't
been able to deal in the stock for one years, two years,
whatever, generally
speaking they are pretty anxious to cash in.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   ...There will be occasions when the market view is that the shares coming
out of escrow will be sold?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   And where, notwithstanding that expectation, after the shares come out of
escrow either they are not sold or not many are sold?
<P>

A.   Sometimes.
<P>

Q.   If the price has dampened in anticipation, it will rise after the
termination date?
<P>

A.   No.  Hardly - I couldn't imagine of a circumstance where that would
occur.
<P>

Q.    You say it always drops?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Never known it to rise?
<P>

A.   Never known it to rise.
<P>

Q.   Never known the anticipation to be of  sales and there in fact to be no
sales?
<P>

A.   Not to my knowledge, no."
<P>

(T 191.7 - 191.22 ...T 192.14 - 192.37)
<P>

15   	I do not understand it to be an issue that the holders of
the restricted shares included investors who were either anxious
to sell or
were under some financial pressure to sell, particularly in the case of  a
Russian institute group of shareholders whose
institute was operating on half
capacity due to a lack of financial resources.  These matters were known to
Aston.  In the interests
of those restricted shareholders, who may have wished
to sell upon the expiration of the escrow period, he gave instructions within
Peptech to facilitate an early sale.  Inquiries made by Lebbon at the end of
1997 disclosed that, in fact, there were sales by some
of the holders of
restricted shares in the months following the lifting of the restrictions. 
<P>

16   	Peter George Kennedy (Kennedy) was called in Peptech's
case.  He is the managing director of a public company involved in
funds
management.  He has some 19 years experience in the financial and equity
markets.  It was his evidence in chief that the information
regarding the
restricted securities was not material to a decision to invest in the shares or
options of a company where the investment
is based upon the company's perceived
fundamental value: it would only become material if it was reasonably
contemplated that the
shares or options the subject of the investment were
themselves to be sold at a time when it was reasonably contemplated that the
restricted securities also would be sold upon being released from escrow. 
<P>

17   	In cross examination he acknowledged that it was necessary
to distinguish between a long term and  a short term investor,
accepting that
in the case of a short term investor the information concerning the expiry of
the period of escrow could be material.
 More pertinent to the facts of this
case, Kennedy gave the following evidence in cross examination: 
<P>

"HAMMERSCHLAG:   Q.  Let's take an example... A potential buyer of Peptech
shares agrees that he will supply to a client - let's
assume it's someone in
your position as a specialist in boutique financial products.  He will supply
to a client of his so many shares
as are represented by a million dollars,
based on the weighed moving average price of those shares for the first five
trading days
in September.  You follow what I'm asking you?
<P>

A.   Yeah, I know exactly what you are asking.
<P>

Q.   Information about that escrow would be crucial to such a person, wouldn't
it?
<P>

A.   I would have to say that these things are very obvious in hindsight.
<P>

Q.   Yes, I'm not suggesting otherwise.  But it would be crucial ?
<P>

A.   It  would be one of a number of factors which would be important.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   What I am suggesting is that a prudent investor who knew that a large
parcel of shares was coming on to the market not previously
listed, who had no
pressure to invest, would wait to see what happened?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Because we are agreed, I think, that those shares coming on to the market
could have a profound affect - we can't talk about
what will happen, but as a
matter of prudence it must be envisaged that that could be an effect?
<P>

A.    Yes."
<P>

(T 357.17...T 357.21 - 357.38...T 363.22- 363.32)
<P>

18   	He concluded his oral evidence as follows:
<P>

"HIS HONOUR:  Q.  It seems to me that where this mythical (hypothetical)
investor is on-selling under an arrangement to sell at
his or her acquisition
price, or the average price, in this case in September 1997, whichever was the
less, that hypothetical investor
would be taking a very, very, big risk of the
share price being adversely effected, albeit for a very short time, at a very
critical
stage in his on-selling arrangements?
<P>

A.   Yes.  I mean - yes.
<P>

Q.   Why should he take that risk?
<P>

A.   The timing is really the crucial aspect there.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   I agree."
<P>

(T 367.17 - 367.30) (altered to correct transcript of evidence)
<P>

19   	In my view there was very little difference in the expert
evidence adduced in both cases.  The evidence reinforced a lesson
in logic that
if a very significant body of shareholders are legally precluded from trading
in shares for a period of twelve months,
the release from that restriction will
inevitably carry with it the possibility that some, if not all of those
shareholders, will
visit their investment alternatives, included amongst which
would be the option of disposing of their shares.  I have no doubt that
the
fact of the restricted shares coming out of escrow  at the very time that
Leadenhall had fixed a pricing mechanism for the on-sale
represented a risk to
Leadenhall and one which a prudent investor would not ordinarily choose to
undergo. 
<P>

20   	Lebbon was put forward in the plaintiffs' case as an
expert in securities.  He  holds a diploma from the Securities Institute
of
Australia and is a fellow of that Institute.  He is a contributor to an
industry publication called Business Sales Digest concerned
with the valuation
of options and shares in corporations.  He is a fellow of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales; of the Australian Society of CPAs
and of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  His experience in the
securities
industry extended over 16 years.  He is the Executive Director of
Leadenhall which holds a dealers licence under the Corporations
Law entitling
Leadenhall to carry on a securities business.  It is common ground that he is a
highly experienced participant in the
securities industry.  
<P>

21   	In those circumstances one has to ask why he would undergo
the risk of striking a price for on-selling Leadenhall's shares
in Peptech by
reference to a market in Peptech's shares prevailing at the very time that some
14,000,000 shares were coming onto
the market after twelve months in escrow.
Counsel for Peptech points to aspects of the allotment agreement that reflect a
willingness
on the part of Lebbon to undertake risks.  Under that agreement
Leadenhall was committed to acquire several million shares in Peptech
at a time
when Lebbon had no investor under contract to take the whole of those shares
and where he had no immediate access to funds
which would enable Leadenhall to
perform its obligations under the allotment agreement in a timely way.  More
significantly, it has
been submitted that there has been no misleading conduct
by Peptech: that Lebbon was well aware of the existence of the restricted
shares and the period of escrow: this prior to the allotment agreement.  
<P>

22   	The latter submission has more substance, in my view.
Whatever conclusion is reached on the issue of liability, I think, it
is clear
from the evidence that due diligence would have alerted an experienced dealer
in securities, such as Lebbon, to the existence
of the restricted shares, and
in turn, the terms of those restrictions.  The questions that have to be
determined are whether Lebbon
was in fact made aware of the existence of the
restricted shares and their period of escrow: if not, whether, as he asserts,
he would
not have caused Leadenhall to enter into the allotment agreement in
its terms, but for the misleading conduct of Peptech: and, if
so, whether his
shortcomings in investigating material available to Leadenhall concerning the
affairs of Peptech should debar Leadenhall
from recovering the damages sought
as not flowing from the misleading conduct of Peptech.  The resolution of those
matters is bound
up with the credibility or reliability of Lebbon and of
witnesses in the Peptech case.  As to that, nothing turns on my ability to
assess the evidence of those witnesses from their demeanour in the witness box.
If each of those questions is answered in favour
of Leadenhall, I think there
remains a challenging question as to the measure of the plaintiffs' damages.
<P>

23   	In posing the issues raised in those terms I have not
addressed the insider trading claim.  I have proceeded on the premise,
however,
that the existence of the restricted shares and the terms of those restrictions
were material to the decision of Leadenhall
to invest in Peptech.  I think it
is clear from the evidence that Leadenhall's interest in Peptech's shares and
options reflected
a mixture of short, medium and long term objectives and was
based on a perception that the shares in Peptech were undervalued.  The
evidence established that, initially, Leadenhall did not intend to be a long
term shareholder in Peptech.  As I understand Lebbon's
evidence, once he had
satisfied himself as to the underlying value of Peptech's shares, he embarked
upon an acquisition of several
million shares and options with the objective
of:
<P>

(a) disposing of the shares in an orderly way through investor clients or
institutions and retaining the options at a price represented
by the difference
between the acquisition price under the allotment agreement and the price
Leadenhall could achieve on on-sale;
<P>

(b) in conjunction with Peptech, embarking upon a course designed to increase
the market value of Peptech shares and options by:
<P>

(i) publishing the above-market price placement of Peptech shares under the
allotment agreement;
<P>

(ii) undertaking  "presentations" to possible investors of the perceived value
of Peptech's shares; and
<P>

(iii) effecting a  secondary listing of Peptech's securities on the London
market.
<P>

At the time of the allotment agreement, the acquisition price under the
agreement represented a premium of approximately twelve
cents on the prevailing
market price.
<P>

24   	I am not entirely clear on the full extent of the due
diligence exercise carried out by Lebbon. However, the evidence established
that a keystone to any analysis of Peptech's affairs lay in the obtaining of a
technical assessment of its substratum which was in
the nature of a
`bio-technological' business described as having the objective of :
<P>

"identify[ing] and develop[ing] clinically important, peptide-based drugs for
the treatment of diseases in the areas of cancer,
inflammation and infection...
[and of] becom[ing] a world leader in the development and registration of
peptide-based veterinary
products for use in the management of animal health
and fertility."
<P>

Peptides were described as "small-length chains of amino acid residues" having
therapeutic qualities.  
<P>

25   	For this purpose Leadenhall retained Story Pharmaceutics
Pty Limited to undertake an evaluation of Peptech's portfolio of
pharmaceutical
and veterinary products through the services of Dr M J Story (Story), who
reported to Leadenhall on 30 July 1997 (the
Story analysis).  It is apparent
from that report that any successful long term investment in Peptech was
dependent upon its potential
in its subject fields of research and development
being realised.  To that extent, investment in Peptech would have to be
classified
as speculative.  However, the conclusions reached in the Story
analysis were favourable and lent support for the view that the underlying
value of Peptech's business was not adequately reflected in its share price.
<P>

26   	Lebbon's evidence was that, in carrying out his
examination of Peptech's affairs, he placed significant reliance upon the
contents of the 96 report and the half yearly report, in conjunction with
Story's analysis and a publication of the ASX, Shares,
in deriving a
theoretical value of Peptech's shares.  In that exercise the nature of
Peptech's capital structure as revealed by Peptech's
reports and Shares was
important to Lebbon.  I accept that evidence which I think was supported by his
contemporaneous file notes.
 I think it is also clear that examination of the
reports of Peptech would not have revealed the existence of the restricted
shares.
<P>

27   	The only indication in those reports, in my view, of the
possibility of there being such a class of shares was to be found
in the note
to the accounts as follows:
<P>

"In August 1996 an issue of 14,976,825 shares at 54&#162; per share was made in
consideration for 5,955 fully paid ordinary shares
in Peptech<i> (UK)</i>
Limited." 
<P>

There is nothing that I can see either there or elsewhere in the 96 report or
the half yearly report to indicate that the shares
issued for the acquisition
of shares in Peptech (UK) involved a transaction to which Ch 9 of the listing
rules would apply.  
<P>

28   	There is some inconsistency in the 96 report in relation
to its description of Peptech's issued shares.  In note 20, the issued
and paid
up capital is identified as 134,157, 197 shares in addition to 179,995 ordinary
shares paid up to 1 cent.  However, in the
listing of the largest holdings "as
Recorded in the Share Register at December 9 1996", and the percentages "of the
total issued
shares" which those shareholdings were said to represent, the
number of issued shares so calculated was in the order of 119,000,000.
 If this
discrepancy had been picked up during an analysis of the 96 report and the
discrepancy referred to Peptech, it is probable
that the existence of the
restricted shares would have been revealed, based upon the evidence of Dawn
Mills (Mills) who had been
the Financial Controller for Peptech for the period
from 30 January 1989 to 23 February 1998.  
<P>

29   	It was Mills' evidence that in the initial preparation of
the draft of the 96 report she obtained information from Peptech's
share
registry and that it was only after the audit manager at Price Waterhouse
brought her attention to the existence of the restricted
shares that she
included those securities in the 96 report without disclosing that any of those
issued shares were the subject of
escrow under the rules of the exchange.
Certainly, there had been no intentional concealment by her of the fact that
there existed
that class of shares, as Peptech had circulated all of its
shareholders with that information in letters of 21 June 1996.  She was
ignorant of the obligation to disclose in Peptech's  report the existence of
the restricted class of shares.  
<P>

30   	However, I would not regard the failure of Lebbon to
detect this discrepancy in the 96 report as representing a lack of care
in
performing Leadenhall's due diligence exercise. Reading the 96 report and the
half yearly report in isolation, Lebbon was entitled
to proceed on the basis
that there were no Peptech shares to which Ch 9 of the listing rules
applied.
<P>

31   	At one stage of the hearing I think counsel for Leadenhall
toyed with the possibility of making a case against Peptech on
the basis of a
deliberate failure on its part to disclose material matter in relation to its
issued shares.  I am satisfied that,
although there were serious omissions and
mis-statements in Peptech's reports, relating to its share structure, they were
inadvertent.

<P>

32   	The nature and extent of the information concerning  the
restricted shares which was available to Leadenhall prior to the
allotment
agreement and, in turn, the substitution agreement, was the subject of dispute.
In substance, Peptech's case is that Lebbon
was told on more than one occasion
about the existence of the restricted shares, and was provided with written
material concerning
Peptech which contained references to the restricted
shares.  Most of this information, it was said, was provided prior to the
allotment
agreement with some written material furnished in the time that
elapsed between the two agreements.  Some of that evidence is uncontroversial.

<P>

33   	It was the evidence of David Baker (Baker), a principal of
the stockbroking company, Baker Young Stockbrokers Limited, of
Adelaide, that
he introduced Lebbon to the prospects of investment in Peptech at a meeting of
22 May 1997 and that following upon
an expression of interest in the company by
Lebbon, Baker forwarded to Leadenhall in May 1997 a Reuter's release and a
broker report
from each of Paul Morgan Securities, Ord Minnett and Bell
Securities in relation to Peptech (the broker reports).  
<P>

34   	Baker said that he had obtained that information from
Darryl Mellish (Mellish), the then Chief Operating Officer of Peptech.
 Mellish
confirmed that he provided information of that kind to Baker for the benefit of
an unnamed prospective investor in Peptech.
 I think there was some confusion
in the evidence as to which of several such reports in evidence were the
particular ones said to
have been forwarded to Leadenhall in May 1997.
Nothing, in my view, turns on that aspect.  
<P>

35   	The Paul Morgan report was dated 14 June 1996.  It
consisted of some 14 pages which outlined the background of Peptech, then
known
as Peptide Technology Limited, and summarised the history of Peptech.  In that
section there was included the following:
<P>

"<u>PTD Interest in Peptech (UK</u>)
<P>

PTD initially held a 75% interest in Peptech (UK), the remaining twelve
minority interests included the original Russian developers
of the drug GMDP
and Dr. Roger Aston.
<P>

PTD now holds 100% of Peptech (UK).  Minority interests have recently sold
their 25% stake in Peptech (UK) for 15,000,000 newly
issued shares in PTD to be
escrowed for one year."
<P>

The company's structure, its board members, and the products with which it was
involved, were covered in the report which offered
a value per share ranging
between 80 cents to $1.70, based on all fully paid up shares, including the
restricted shares.  
<P>

36   	The Ord Minnett paper was along similar lines offering a
value per share of $1.65 based on "Shares on issue" of "134 m". 
In a note to
that estimate the following clarification appeared:
<P>

""Shares on issue" includes 14.976m shares to be issued in exchange for the
outstanding 23.7% of Peptech (UK) for PTD to own 100%
of GMDP."
<P>

It made no mention of those shares being held in escrow. However, under a
section of the report dealing with financials, the following
appeared:
<P>

"The acquisition of the outstanding shares in Peptech (UK) is to be funded by
the issue of 14.977m shares in PTD at 54&#162; per
share which will be held in
escrow for at least one year."
<P>

Ord Minnett's report was more extensive than Paul Morgan's report and comprised
some 19 pages covering most aspects of the activities
of Peptech.  It was also
issued in June 1996.  
<P>

37   	Bell Securities' report was dated April 1997 and covered
similar territory to the other two reports, noting that the shares
issued for
the acquisition of the minority interests in Peptech "were escrowed for one
year".  
<P>

38   	Lebbon does not dispute that the broker reports were sent
as evidenced by Baker.  He simply has no recollection of receiving
them prior
to the allotment agreement and, in any event, he said that he would not have
regarded their contents as having any particular
value.  Even had he noticed
the reference to the restricted shares, he would have satisfied himself that
those were of historical
value only, having regard to the dates of the broker
reports and the contents of the 96 report and the half yearly report. I have
some difficulty with that evidence as examined later in these reasons.  
<P>

39   	According to Mellish he had a five hour meeting with
Lebbon on 18 July 1997, prior to Lebbon travelling to the United Kingdom
to
meet Aston, as part of, or preparatory to, the carrying out of Leadenhall's due
diligence exercise.  The meeting was attended
by Anthony Bates (Bates), the
then Chairman of Peptech, Mills, and  another employee of Peptech, Timothy
Trigg (Trigg).  Bates and
Trigg were not present for the whole meeting.  It was
Mellish's evidence that Lebbon made an inquiry of one of Peptech's products,
a
peptide known as GMDP, in response to which Mellish made the following
statement:
<P>

"You are right, GMDP is an important asset for the company, this is why Peptech
recently acquired the minority interests in Peptech
(UK), the company that
holds the GMDP intellectual property.  Approximately 15 million new Peptech
Limited shares were issued to
the minority shareholders and remain in escrow
until September 1997."
<P>

40   	According to Mellish, Lebbon received that information
without comment and without any display of surprise.  None of that
evidence is
corroborated by Bates or Mills.  Trigg was not called.  Bates gave evidence of
his meeting with Lebbon on 18 July 1997
in the following terms:  
<P>

"11.	At the time of the 18 July 1997 meeting with Tim Lebbon I was aware of
the
<P>

Peptech shares held in escrow.  I did not consider this to be an important
issue and paid very little attention to it.  In the context
of Peptech's
overall shareholding and its scientific activities, the fact that some shares
were held in escrow seemed to me to be
entirely commonplace and insignificant.
If the escrow period was mentioned at the meeting I would have paid no
particular attention
to it."
<P>

41   	Bates was unable to corroborate the evidence of Mellish
concerning any discussion with Lebbon about the restricted shares.
 Bates
further clarified par 11 of his statement in cross examination as follows:
<P>

"[Hammerschlag]  Q.   I have some difficulty in understanding what you have
said in par 11 of your statement.  I will tell you what
it says:  You say that
you didn't consider escrow to be an important issue and paid very little
attention to it in the context of
the Peptech overall shareholding and its
scientific activities.  The fact that some shares were held in escrow seemed to
you to be
entirely common place and insignificant. I have a little difficulty
in understanding that given your agreement that that could be
of substantial
importance to a potential investor.  Could you assist me?
<P>

A.   Could I explain the situation?  In my statement I did say that I did not
think it was overly relevant.  I saw that meeting
as being a briefing meeting;
a discussion meeting.  I did not see it as being you know the core discussion
around which an investment
would be made and I did assume that that matter
would have been covered elsewhere.  It was not.
<P>

Q.   You were not intending to make light of the issue of a possible escrow
shareholding I take it?
<P>

A.   That is not my intention.
<P>

Q.   Because you as an experienced man of commerce would understand that
knowledge about that subject could be crucial to a potential
investor?
<P>

A.   Yes, that is correct.
<P>

Q.   Especially if  a large parcel of shares were coming onto markets at or
about the time that the investor was about to make his
decision?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   And your experience would be I assume that when a large parcel of shares
previously in escrow hit the market it is almost inevitable
that there will be
a depression of the share price?
<P>

A.   I honestly couldn't say that I could state that.
<P>

Q.   That would be consistent with what your view of the market would be
wouldn't it?
<P>

A.   Well, again, can I explain it a little bit in terms of the nature of the
escrow, the nature of the shareholders who held the
escrowed stock, the timing
and the interest of the prospective investor I didn't see it being that
significant to my discussion.
<P>

Q.   Is this the discussion on 18 July of 1997?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.    Perhaps,  I have put the question badly,  what I was asking you was that,
let me just go back a step:  Your perception of
this 18 July meeting was it was
some preliminary exploration meeting?
<P>

A.   Yes, if I could say I saw that as an opportunity for Mr Lebbon to meet
with the Australian core prior to him going overseas.
<P>

Q.   It was not your perception where it was a serious meeting where Mr Lebbon
would make any decisions based on what was told to
him there?
<P>

A.   I saw the meeting as part of his due diligence to get to understand the
people in the company and it was not a meeting to make
that decision."
<P>

(T 341.33 - 342.36)
<P>

42   	However, it was clear from Bates' further cross
examination that he understood the importance of the existence of the
restricted
shares to an investor such as Leadenhall and the importance of the
errors in Peptech's public documents, as appears from the following:
<P>

"[Hammerschlag]  Q.  As a professional director knowing that there were that
many shares on issue which were escrowed you would
have ordinarily have
expected that to feature in the report?
<P>

A.   Yes, I would have expected that to be in the financial sector of the
report in the normal format of such disclosure.
<P>

Q.   Did you understand that Mr Lebbon was going to be restricted to
information that was in the public domain?
<P>

A.   Can I clarify, at the time of that meeting?
<P>

Q.   Yes?
<P>

A.   Yes,  I knew that the due diligence would be confirmed to that which was
in the public domain.
<P>

Q.   And you as a professional director would know that the most important
public disclosure of any listed entity is annual financial
statements?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   And perhaps second most important disclosure document is its half yearly
reports to the A S E.
<P>

A.   Yes, together with the on going disclosure documents.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   At this point in time something like 14 million of the number issued  were
not in fact quoted because they were in escrow,
were you aware of that?
<P>

A.   No.
<P>

Q.   You were aware that a large portion of shares were in escrow?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.    This section is intended to convey to the reader, I take it you will
agree with me, the distinction between those shares which
are issued and those
which are quoted, right ?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   That matter of the difference would be a matter that you as an experienced
company director would recognise as being quite
important, wouldn't you?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.    Yet this document incorrectly states that the number quoted equals the
number issued?
<P>

A.   (Witness nodded)
<P>

Q.    Right ?
<P>

A.    Yes.
<P>

Q.   Is this something that has been drawn to your attention for the first time
now?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   As a professional director do I take it that you would view that as a
quite important omission?
<P>

A.   I would view that as an important mistake.
<P>

Q.   Especially to a person who, restricted to public information, was about to
participate in a big private placement in this entity
at a premium to market
?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   As you understood it at the time,  and I suggest you would understand it
now, in the context of future capital requirements,
the coming on stream in the
short term of a large escrowed parcel could be an important feature?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   it would be important for anybody who was about to invest in an entity to
have complete information about a large parcel of
escrowed shares about to be
released, you would agree with that, wouldn't you?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.  It would be necessary for him to know precisely when they were coming out,
wouldn't it?
<P>

A.   I would think so.
<P>

Q.   Who held them?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   What the likely intentions of those persons were, with respect to selling
them.
<P>

A.   If that was available, yes.
<P>

Q.   And especially if there was knowledge that some one or more of those
escrowed shareholders were very keen to sell ?
<P>

A.   If that was known.
<P>

Q.    Yes, if it were known?
<P>

A.   Mm.
<P>

Q.   That kind of information would be crucial, would it not, for any proposing
investor to know?
<P>

A.   I would assume so.
<P>

Q.   That would be particularly the case, I suggest, in the case of an investor
whose investment was going to turn, amongst other
things, on the weighted price
of the shares concerned in the very week that the shares came out of escrow, do
you understand what
I'm putting to you?
<P>

A.   No, I don't understand the timing aspect of your question.
<P>

Q.   I want you to assume the following and I'm seeking your, in effect, as a
professional director, view on the following proposition.
 I want you to assume
the following facts, an investor takes a private placement in a company.
<P>

A.   Mm.
<P>

Q.   He enters into a back to back transaction with someone else to pass on
part of that private placement at a price calculated
to be the weighted average
of the shares during a particular week?
<P>

A.   Mm.
<P>

Q.    And during that very week 10 per cent of the company share capital is
about to come on the market because it was previously
escrowed.
<P>

A.   Mm.
<P>

Q.   To make that kind of decision, he would really have to have complete
information about the escrow, wouldn't he ?
<P>

A.  Under that circumstance, yes, he would.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   You would have understood that the details of and concerning escrow would
have been important to Mr Lebbon?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You would have expected there to be made available to him the escrow
agreements, wouldn't you?
<P>

A.   I believe so, yes.
<P>

Q.   You would have expected there to be made available to him the resolutions
relating to the issue of the escrowed shares, wouldn't
you?
<P>

A.   Well, I say yes but I also get concerned about our ability to disclose.
<P>

Q.   Yes, I'm talking about stuff that is in the public domain?
<P>

A.   Public domain, absolutely.
<P>

Q.   The terms of the escrow agreements, the escrow agreements between Peptech
and the stock exchange?
<P>

A.   As is in the public domain, yes.
<P>

Q.   You would expect those documents being made available to Mr Lebbon as
being crucial to his investment?
<P>

A.   I would believe so.
<P>

Q.   Did you have a belief that had occurred?
<P>

A.   I worked on the assumption, I had no evidence to say that it had
occurred.
<P>

Q.   Yes?
<P>

A.   I just assumed it would have occurred as part of the introduction to the
company.
<P>

Q.   Because you would have assumed that those who were representing Peptech in
the negotiations would have made that stuff available
to Mr Lebbon, wouldn't
you?
<P>

A.   I certainly didn't see myself as the deal negotiator there.  I just saw
myself as part of the meet the faces and I didn't see
our meeting as being, you
know, a commercial meeting as such."
<P>

(T 342.45 - 343.8 ...T 344.44 - 345.23...T347.1 - 348.3...T350.5 - 350.45)
<P>

43   	Aston gave similar evidence of his meetings with Lebbon
and  Baker in England between 23 and 25 July 1997.  In one of these
meetings
which was held at Cirencester, attended by a scientist and others in the employ
of  Peptech, Aston said that he gave a presentation
on Peptech's technology
portfolio in which the subject of GMDP was also raised.  It was Aston's
evidence that this gave rise to the
following interchange:
<P>

"During this presentation I reiterated the mechanism by which Peptech acquired
rights to GMDP from the Shemyakin Institute.  I also
made special reference to
Robert Bomford's key role in speaking Russian and being the link with the
Institute.  In the course of
the presentation I said words to the effect:
<P>

<i>`When Biokine was formed it had no cash to pay for acquisitions; as such, in
order to acquire the rights/patents to GMDP, it issued
shares to the Shemyakin
and the investors Ivanov and Andronova.  The founders of Biokine: Bomford,
Schober, McMillan and myself also
had stock in the company.  Shemyakin and the
Russian investors are still major share holders."</i>
<P>

Following this presentation in the boardroom we moved into another office for a
round table discussion.  Towards the end of the
meetings on that day Tim Lebbon
lent across to me and said words to the following effect:
<P>

"<i>Have any of the people who received shares in Peptech reduced their
shareholding?"</i>
<P>

And then I replied with words to the following effect:
<P>

<i>"I am sure some individuals may well have liked to sell a few of their
shares but this is not possible until the end of the escrow
period associated
with the Peptech shares issued in relation to the Peptech UK shareholdings.
The escrow period terminates in September
1997."</i>
<P>

Tim Lebbon then  inquired with words to the following effect:
<P>

"<i>What do you think the Biokine minorities will do? Do you think they will
sell?"</i>
<P>

I replied with words to the following effect:
<P>

"<i>I think that some shares will be sold by individuals but by and large I
believe that the minority shareholders are supporters of Peptech
and I don't
think there will be any dumping of shares.  Organisations such as Shemyakin,
which are major shareholders in Peptech,
are likely to sell some shares as they
are desperate for cash to sustain the functions of the Russian Institute.  The
Institute runs
its electricity at half power in order to be economical at the
moment.""</i>
<P>

44   	No other witness in Peptech's case corroborated that
evidence of the meeting.  In cross examination Aston said that that was
the
only occasion in which he had a clear recollection of conveying information to
Lebbon concerning the restricted shares, while
having a recollection of the
matter being raised with Lebbon in other meetings which he could not precisely
identify.  Lebbon denied
that any such conversations took place.
<P>

45   	Aston's credibility has been challenged on the basis that
his evidence is untrue.  However, I am not prepared to reject that
evidence, at
least to the extent that I accept that at some stage in Aston's dealings with
Lebbon and probably at the meeting at
Cirencester there was discussion about
the former Peptech UK shareholders and their loyalty to Peptech.  In cross
examination Aston
gave the following evidence:
<P>

"[HAMMERSCHLAG]  Q.   Incidentally, you were aware that the 1996 annual report
was a document given to Mr Lebbon and in respect
of which he was placing
reliance in his consideration of whether to invest in Peptech?
<P>

A.   Yes, that's true.
<P>

Q.   You knew that he was going to rely on that document?
<P>

A.   He was, yes.
<P>

Q.   Why didn't you tell him it was wrong in respect of your shareholding?
<P>

A.   I had mentioned that to him.
<P>

Q.   You had mentioned to him that the document was wrong in respect of your
shareholding?
<P>

A.   Can I elaborate?  We had discussed the issue of the escrowed shares on
various occasions.
<P>

Q.   Just hold on.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.  Just complete your answer?
<P>

A.   I was always very open with Mr Lebbon.  We discussed the shareholding in
Fiduciaire Rico (sic).  We discussed the escrow shares.
 We discussed issues
such as shareholding the Shemyakin, the Russian institute.  So I felt although
that there was an error in the
annual report of 1996 as records my shares, I
believe he was aware of the reason for that.
<P>

HAMMERSCHLAG:   Q.  One second Dr Aston, do you say that you discussed the
escrowed share position in respect of Peptech UK with
Mr Lebbon for more than
one occasion?
<P>

A.   I did indeed, yes.
<P>

Q.   In your statement, which the correctness you have sworn this morning,
there is reference to only one such conference, isn't
there?
<P>

A.   That is true.
<P>

Q.   What is the reason for the fact you have left out other conversations on
that subject?
<P>

A.   Peptech's counsel advised me to only refer to the instances of which I had
100 per cent certainty of."
<P>

(T 286.5 - 286.46)
<P>

This was again referred to in later cross examination of Aston as follows:
<P>

"HAMMERSCHLAG:   Q.  June 1997.  Although this was not said to the market, you
already had it in your mind and discussed it with
Mr Bates and Mr Mellish that
the London listing might be delayed. 
<P>

A.   It was delayed.  We were always at risk, yes.
<P>

Q.   You were considering Mr Lebbon's position in the context of him perhaps
providing interim funding if that occurred?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You were well conscious of the fact that that almost 11 per cent of the
company's share capital was coming out of escrow in
about a month's time.
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You were well aware of the fact that those shares coming out of escrow
could have  a profound effect on the price of Peptech
shares?
<P>

A.   They could have if they were sold, yes.
<P>

Q.   And you were also aware that Messrs McMillan and Shober were keen
sellers?
<P>

A.   I believe they might have wanted to sell, yes.  I don't know if they were
keen. 
<P>

Q.   You knew they had been unhappy with the lock up of their shares from the
start?
<P>

A.   I believe we all were, yes.
<P>

Q.   You included?
<P>

A.   Locking is not financially beneficial to the owner of a share, yes.
<P>

Q.   You understand, of course, that the escrow provisions are there for the
benefit of the shareholders as a whole, don't you?
<P>

A.  Absolutely, yes.
<P>

Q.   And you understood that to some extent you were in a position of personal
conflict?
<P>

A.   Indeed, yes.
<P>

Q.   And by 30 June 1997 the fact that the shares were coming out of escrow
shortly was a major factor being considered by the board
of directors in
relation to its fund raising strategy, wasn't it?
<P>

A.   I don't recollect that but I believe that, yes.
<P>

Q.   It would be consistent with your understanding, wouldn't it?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.   You agree with the proposition that the escrow period was coming to an end
at an important time for the company?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Mr Mellish had, after a meeting at which you were present in the week
ended 30 July 1997, suggested that the directors should
be rebriefed on the
subject, do you recall that?
<P>

A.  Vaguely, yes.
<P>

Q.   That was because it was understood by you and the other directors to your
knowledge that the coming out of the shares from
escrow could have a profound
effect on the company's prospects of raising capital?
<P>

A.   Can I explain?
<P>

Q.   Do you agree with the proposition or not?
<P>

A.   Not really, no.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.  If you have an explanation to offer, what is that?
<P>

A.   Of course the shares coming out of escrow, if everyone was to sell their
shares they would have a serious impact  on the share
price of the company,
there was no question there but, at the end of the day,  I knew all the
minorities well and I believed Peptech
had their support as loyal supportive
shareholders, and it was my understanding that there would be no aggressive
selling, or dumping
as one might say, of shares at the time.  I would say that
the coming off escrow of those shares was not a major issue in my mind
as
regards the company's share price.
<P>

HAMMERSCHLAG.   Q.  It was a significant issue though,  wasn't it?
<P>

A.   It was one that we certainly had to consider, yes.
<P>

Q.   For a full understanding of that position one needed to know the details
about the escrow shares, didn't one?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   This was something that was discussed with the directors in the we (sic)
very week Mr Lebbon made his investment, isn't that
right?
<P>

A.   I believe so, yes.
<P>

Q.   Why wasn't Mr Lebbon taken into your confidence about that?
<P>

A.   Well,  I did inform him that the shares were in escrow and I believe he
knew when they were coming off escrow. 
<P>

Q.   From what did he know that?
<P>

A.   Both from my discussions in July and my belief was from previous
discussions I had with him.
<P>

Q.   You say that you had previous discussions with him about the shares in
escrow?
<P>

A.    (Witness nodded)
<P>

Q.   Is there any note you have which supports that proposition?
<P>

A.   No, I am afraid not."
<P>

(T 288.16 - 290.11)
<P>

46   	The fact that those "previous discussions" were not
evidenced in Aston's statement of evidence in chief, I think, is sufficient
indication of a lack of any emphasis in those discussions upon restricted
shares.  One thing that does come out of that evidence
is the failure of Lebbon
to pick up the fact that the Russian institute shareholders and Fiduciaire Ryco
as a shareholder, or for
that matter Aston's shareholdings, did not appear in
the listing of the largest holdings in Peptech's share register as set out in
the 96 report.  While a number of the largest shareholders are listed in the 96
report as nominee holdings, it would not have been
particularly surprising for
Lebbon to have checked that list against his knowledge of Aston's holdings and,
probably, of the other
one time shareholders in Peptech UK. 
<P>

47   	The passing statements which Mellish and Aston are said to
have made to Lebbon concerning the restricted shares stand in strong
contrast
with the recognition within Peptech, as to the possible effect of the
restricted shares coming out of escrow upon Peptech's
need to raise further
working capital to support its product development program.  Peptech was in
urgent need of funds at the time
of its negotiations with Lebbon,
notwithstanding statements to the contrary made to Lebbon during negotiations.
I think it is fair
to say that the board of Peptech in considering its capital
requirements in mid 1997 viewed the situation concerning the restricted
shares
as germane to those considerations.  
<P>

48   	In my view that is reflected in the letter from Henry
Davis York to Mellish of 30 July 1997 and the memorandum to board members
from
Mellish of 4 August 1997.  The terms of those documents follow:
<P>

Henry Davis York to Mellish of 30 July 1997:
<P>

<b>"PEPTECH (UK) LIMITED</b>
<P>

In consequence of the discussion on Monday with several directors about the
final phase of the acquisition of Peptech (UK) Limited
you suggested that it
would be appropriate for a re-briefing to take place.
<P>

To this end I enclose copies of:
<P>

- chairman's letter to shareholders dated 21 June 1996;
<P>

- notice of general meeting held in Sydney on 16 July 1996; and
<P>

- sample Restriction Agreement
<P>

It will be seen from this material that Peptech Limited acquired 5,955 ordinary
shares in Peptech (UK) Limited (being the only issued
shares in the capital of
that company which it did not then own) in exchange for the issue of a total of
14,976,825 new ordinary
shares in its own capital at the rate of 2,515 shares
for one Peptech (UK) Limited share.
<P>

In accordance with the Listing Rules, the ASX imposed a one year escrow period
in respect of the new shares issued by Peptech Limited.
 As a result the
recipients of those shares have been prohibited from any dealings in the shares
for a period of one year which expires
on various dates in September 1997.  The
terms of the escrow arrangement are set out in the Restriction Agreement.  
<P>

The scrip for these shares, together with the Restriction Agreements, were
lodged with the National Australia Bank Limited at Brookvale
for the duration
of the escrow period.  They will be released in September 1997 on the written
authority of the ASX following which
the shareholders will be free to trade the
shares.
<P>

For the purpose of calculating the consideration for these transactions the new
shares in Peptech Limited were deemed to have a
market value of 54&#162; each
which was determined by reference to the closing prices for on-market sales
during the month of March
1996.
<P>

The possibility that some of the shareholders concerned may wish to realise
their shares once the escrow period expires needs to
be factored into the time
line of likely events for Peptech Limited over the next six months."
<P>

49   	The memorandum of Mellish to the Peptech board of 4 August
1997:
<P>

<center><b>"CONFIDENTIAL</b></center>
<P>


<P>

	...
<P>

At the last board meeting we discussed various fund raising strategies
involving the issuing of shares.  We also touched upon the
possible options for
restructuring the capital of the Company - for example, by consolidation,
reduction of capital, etc.
<P>

It was noted that the number of total Peptech shares on issue within 9 months
could be in the order of 200 million.
<P>

The "plan" that was developed on the whiteboard has now been reproduced for
your perusal (copy attached).  The timetable is rather
tight and needs closer
analysis.
<P>

The meeting also resolved to request management attempt to identify the
beneficial owners of Peptech shares for some of the larger
nominee holders.
The method of undertaking the process and a review of the possible consequences
is underway.
<P>

For a full understanding of our shareholding, especially for our new directors,
I have attached information about the 15 million
Peptech shares currently in
escrow, which supplement the material circulated with the last board papers.
<P>

I am sure that fund raising/ share structure/ shareholder attitudes will be an
important item at our next meeting.  Also attached
is a summary of our
authorised capital and current options."
<P>

50   	Mellish's oral evidence underlined the significance of the
restricted shares coming out of escrow in Peptech's consideration
of "fund
raising strategies" in mid 1997.  His evidence in cross examination follows:
<P>

"Q.   I apologise and withdraw that question.  In 1996, at the time of the take
out of the Peptech minorities and onwards, one of
the priorities at Peptech was
the raising of further capital, wasn't it?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Peptech was long on prospects but short of cash, wasn't it?
<P>

A.   It was short of cash.
<P>

Q.   By 30 July of 1997, I'm now jumping forward, you understand ?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.    Very high on the agenda at Peptech was its strategy to try and get money
in by way of investment or injection of capital,
wasn't it?
<P>

A.   Yes, it was.
<P>

Q.   Dr Aston considered that that was  a matter of urgent priority, didn't
he?
<P>

A.   Yes, he did.
<P>

Q.   The question of fund raising strategies was discussed at the board meeting
of the company which was held in the last week of
July of 1997.  Do you recall
that?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   What you discussed at that board meeting were the fund raising strategies
involving issues of shares?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.    There was discussed possible options for restructuring the capital of the
company?
<P>

A.   Yes,  I think there was.
<P>

Q.   Important in that context, namely fund raising strategies involving the
issue of shares, was the fact that 15 million shares
in Peptech were then in
escrow, but were about to come out?
<P>

A.   Yes, I think we were looking at the total picture.
<P>

Q.   At this meeting of the board of directors, it was suggested by you that
the directors be formally briefed with respect to the
circumstances relating to
the shares coming out of escrow because that would have, amongst others,
potentially a profound effect
on your capital raising strategies.   Would you
agree with that?
<P>

A.   I don't think it was the main purpose of the brief  but it was part of it,
yes.
<P>

Q.   In fact, your view was ---
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.   Was it a purpose?
<P>

A.   The main purpose of the brief was to look at assumptions and projections
of the total number of shares that would be out there
and whether there was a
sensible platform going forward.   So there was a number of different factors
in that and I think the ones
in escrow were just part of that total picture.
<P>

Q.   On the basis that they could well be coming on to the market when they
came out of escrow?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

HAMMERSCHLAG:   Q.   In fact, your view was that for a full understanding of
the process that was going to be undertaken, amongst
others - I'm not saying it
was the only consideration - but amongst others an important consideration was
the information concerning
the 15 million shares about to come out of
escrow?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   And one of the things you understood was that strategy could be profoundly
affected by the fact that something like 11 per
cent of the company's share
capital was coming on to the market in a month's time from 30 July ?"
<P>

(T 226.46 - 227.58...T 229.23 -229.27)
<P>

51   	Given the evidence of Keene, Kennedy, and Bates and the
recognition by Peptech in its internal records of the significance
of the
restricted shares coming onto the market in the context of planned capital
raising, it is very difficult to reconcile the
full knowledge of Leadenhall of
the details concerning the restricted shares with the pricing mechanism of
Leadenhall's on-sale.
 In that context it is not too difficult to give some
credence to Lebbon's evidence that information related to Peptech's share
structure
was material to his analysis of the advantages offered by investment
in Peptech.  
<P>

52   	Assuming Lebbon knew of the existence of the restricted
shares, acting prudently, Lebbon would have required to be satisfied
that the
emergence of the restricted shares onto the market would not materially affect
the terms of the allotment agreement and
the on-sale.  This could have been
done by ascertaining the restricted shareholders' attitude to their investment
once released from
escrow, or by just waiting for developments at the listing
of the restricted shares.
<P>

53   	How does one then approach the conflicting evidence of
what, if anything, was said about the restricted shares at the meetings
in
Australia and the United Kingdom in mid July 1997 between representatives of
Peptech and Leadenhall.  There is something internally
difficult about the
evidence in chief of both Mellish and Aston.  In the case of Aston's evidence,
as quoted earlier in these reasons,
the subject matter was raised by Lebbon's
question, namely:
<P>

"Have any of the people who received shares in Peptech reduced their
shareholding ?"
<P>

It is an unlikely question from someone who was aware of the escrow conditions
affecting the restricted shares.  This unlikelihood
was not removed in the
following cross examination of Aston:
<P>

"Q.   But on what you tell his Honour, you understood that Mr Lebbon already
knew that the shares were in escrow because you had
had that discussion
before?
<P>

A.   Indeed, yes.
<P>

Q.   Why didn't you say it to him, well, as you know?
<P>

A.   I'm not quite sure what you mean.
<P>

Q.   Well, you say Mr Lebbon asked you about this, why didn't you say, well, I
told you before?
<P>

A.   I think he wanted to ascertain what the Shemyakin would do once the escrow
period came off.  If you are asking me the phraseology
of the question, it was
rather ad hoc, as I think I indicated.   You know,  what do you think the
Shemyakin will do when the escrow
period was up.  He key concern was the
Shemyakin was, what you call, a weak shareholder in the company and that was
his primary concern.

<P>

Q.   Was his question, did he ask you what will the Shemyakin people do?
<P>

A.   I believe he did, yes.
<P>

Q.   He didn't ask you have any of these people who have shares in the Peptech
UK sold?
<P>

A.   He asked me that on other occasions, yes.  He asked me that for my own
shareholding.
<P>

Q.   That, of course, would be a nonsense question if he knew the shares were
in escrow, didn't he?
<P>

A.   The opportunity that I recollect is the first discussion I had with
Lebbon, which is not in my witness statement.  It was one
of the ones that I
was not 100 per cent certain of.
<P>

Q.   You say he asked you what will the Shemyakin people do?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   He didn't ask you, did he, have any of the people who received the shares
in Peptech reduced their shareholdings?
<P>

A.   On that occasion?
<P>

Q.   Yes?
<P>

A.   I don't believe he asked me that, no.
<P>

Q.   Why do you say he asked you that in your statement at page 6, Dr Aston?
<P>

A.   I would have to relook at the statement?
<P>

Q.   Yes, go back to the statement?
<P>

A.   Could you tell me where it is?
<P>

Q.   Yes, page 6.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   It's a separate document not in the folder.
<P>

HAMMERSCHLAG:  Q.   You got your statement?
<P>

A.   I do not.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.  Had you been in contact, Dr Aston, with the Shemyakin
principals about that time?
<P>

A.  I was in regular contact with all the Russian shareholders, and the
individual representatives.
<P>

Q.  And the owners and the neighbours in a sense are in the one interest, are
they?
<P>

A.   Yes, essentially.
<P>

Q.   And who would you deal with in relation to those people?
<P>

A.   Almost exclusively Professor Ivanov, who was the director of the
institute.
<P>

Q.   In relation to that did you specifically discuss with him the institute's
intentions in relation to their shareholding?
<P>

A.  I had on occasions, yes.
<P>

Q.  When was the last occasion before the end of July?
<P>

A.   It would certainly around there I would have talked to them about it, yes,
and enquired as to what their intent and financial
needs were, yes.
<P>

Q.   And the impression you were given was they were under financial
pressure?
<P>

A.   Indeed they were, yes.
<P>

Q.   Wouldn't that indicate that they would be obliged to dispose of all of
their shares?
<P>

A.   I knew the Russians on a personal basis very well and I felt comfortable
enough to discuss with them their shareholding, and
Professor Ivanov had often
said to me, "You advise me whether it's  - if you want me to hang on then I
will hang on, I will be a
loyal shareholder."  So I genuinely felt under no
circumstances would the Shemyakin go out into the marketplace and start
unloading
their shares.
<P>

Q.   Nevertheless they were operating at half capacity because of lack of
funds?
<P>

A.   Indeed, yep.
<P>

Q.   Pressure would be fairly significant on them, wouldn't it, to dispose of
these shares whether they liked it or not, despite
loyally (sic)?
<P>

A.   That is correct.  There was a lot of pressure on them but they were good
friends, good loyal shareholders and I believe I persuaded
them to hang on.
<P>

Hammerschlag:  Q.   Your statement is in front of you.  Have a look at page 6
Dr Aston?
<P>

A.   Okay.
<P>

Q.   You tell his Honour that Mr Lebbon lent across to you on this occasion
that you recall so vividly and he asked you have any
of the people who received
shares in Peptech reduced their shareholding.  You say he never said that?
<P>

A.   He did obviously.
<P>

Q.   That would be a nonsense question, wouldn't it?
<P>

A.   Could you point out where it says that?
<P>

Q.   Yes, at the foot of the page.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   What page?
<P>

HAMMERSCHLAG:  Q.  Page 6?
<P>

A.   It would appear so.
<P>

Q.   It would have been a nonsense question, wouldn't it?
<P>

A.   It would appear so, yes.
<P>

Q.   You didn't think this through, did you, before you signed this
statement?
<P>

A.   No,  I don't think it's that.  I mean, Mr Lebbon was very tired on that
day.  He may well have not thought of what he was asking.
<P>

Q.   Without looking at your statement, what is the best of your recollection
of what you responded to that question which you now
accept appears to be a
nonsense?
<P>

A.   I believe I would have said that none of the shareholders would have
disposed of any of their shares.
<P>

Q.   Did you say that some people would like to?
<P>

A.   I'm sure I would have said that, yes.
<P>

Q.   Who were they?
<P>

A.   That would have been the Shemyakin primarily.
<P>

Q.   Did you tell him when the escrow period terminated?
<P>

A.   I can not recollect off hand.  I believe he already knew that it was
September at that point.  I may have said it again."
<P>

(T 295.38 - 298.12)
<P>

54   	Mellish's evidence in chief suffers from a similar
difficulty in that it places his statement about the restricted shares
in the
context of an inquiry by Lebbon concerning one of Peptech's products.
According to Mellish his response contained the following
statement:
<P>

"Approximately 15 million new Peptech Limited  shares were issued to the
minority shareholders and remain in escrow until September
1997".
<P>

He added the observation that "Lebbon did not appear surprised by the escrow
period and made no comment on the fact that the shares
were held in escrow".
<P>

55   	The thing that strikes me about that evidence is that it
seems out of context with the matter being discussed and is a little
unusual
when put into the context of Mellish's evidence in cross examination, that at
the time of that meeting, it was his understanding
that the 96 report and,
presumably, the half yearly report, disclosed the existence of the restricted
shares: that on his understanding
this information was known to Lebbon as well
as through other material published about Peptech.  Given that understanding, I
would
have expected discussion on the subject matter of the restricted shares
to be expressed in somewhat different terms.  For that matter,
I would have
expected there to have been some detailed discussion about the restricted
shares coming out of escrow, given Peptech's
recognition of the importance of
that event to Peptech's prospective capital raising.  
<P>

56   	As a matter of credibility I would not be prepared to
reject, in toto, the evidence of Mellish, Aston or Lebbon on this issue
of
disclosure.  As stated, in assessing credibility I gained no assistance from
observing those witnesses in the giving of their
evidence.  I think it comes
down to a question of emphasis and what was assumed to be known by Lebbon at
the time of the July discussions.
 I am satisfied that these were discussions
involving Lebbon which dealt with the loyalty to Peptech of the major erstwhile
shareholders
in Peptech (UK) and that, in passing, some reference was made to
shares in escrow.  I am satisfied that there was no detailed discussion
on that
aspect and that Lebbon was not alerted to the possibility of 14,000,000 shares
being listed, out of escrow in September 1997
to coincide with the timing of
the determination of the acquisition price under the on-sale. 
<P>

57   	My principal reason for coming to that conclusion is that,
if there had of been a full and unequivocal disclosure in those
meetings that
some 14,000,000 shares in Peptech were unlisted, were being held in escrow and
that they were about to come out of
escrow in August/September 1997,  I find it
extremely difficult to accept that Lebbon would have treated that information
with comparative
disinterest.  
<P>

58   	Additionally, there is no suggestion in the evidence
adduced by Peptech that there was any substantial discussion in relation
to the
restricted shares at any of these meetings with Lebbon.  That is clear from the
evidence of Aston and Mellish and from the
absence of evidence from the other
representatives of Peptech to corroborate the fact that there was any
discussion at all concerning
the restricted shares.  Baker had been present at
the July 1997 meeting in England, and having regard to his involvement in the
allotment
of shares and options to Leadenhall, I find it surprising that he was
unable to corroborate discussions with Lebbon concerning  the
restricted
shares.  
<P>

59   	Further, none of the contemporaneous notes of those
meetings record any discussion concerning the existence of the restricted
shares.
<P>

60   	I am also of the view that there was no motivation on the
part of Peptech's representatives to emphasise this aspect of Peptech's
shareholding: that much I think is clear from the internal records of Peptech
showing the importance of the effect of the restricted
shares coming onto the
market in the board's consideration of Peptech's estimated capital requirements
and possible capital restructuring.
 In that context it should be kept in mind
that at the time of the July 1997 negotiations, Peptech was in urgent need of
funds. 

<P>

61   	When the strength of the evidence is taken into account as
to the importance in the market of the restricted shares coming
out of escrow,
as to the particular sensitivity of that aspect in the context of the terms of
Leadenhall's on-sale and to the reliance
placed by Lebbon on the 96 report and
the half yearly report which made no mention of any shares being held in escrow
and which included
the restricted shares in the shares reported upon as being
both issued and quoted, in my view, Leadenhall was entitled to expect
more than
passing references to the restricted shares in discussions between
representatives of Peptech and Lebbon prior to the allotment
agreement.  
<P>

62   	The provision to Leadenhall of the broker reports I think
occurred some time about May 1997.  There is some doubt about the
accuracy of
Baker's evidence that, in the week of his initial meeting with Lebbon on 22 May
1997, he forwarded the broker reports
on Peptech.  There is no record of them
having been sent.  There is a note of a communication from Lebbon to Baker of
24 May 1997
which commenced with "thanks for info" and then there followed a
series of notes by Lebbon which all appear to be based upon the
96 report and
give no indication of reliance on any of the broker reports.  
<P>

63   	As far as I have been able to discern there is nothing in
the communications between Leadenhall, on the one hand, and Baker
or Peptech on
the other, up to the time of the allotment agreement, which refers to the
information in the broker reports.  
<P>

64   	It is reasonably clear that in addition to the broker
reports there was also provided to Leadenhall a summary of announcements
relating to Peptech (the Peptech announcements) on 8 and 9 August 1997, by
facsimiles respectively from Mellish to Kevin Mak (Mak),
Leadenhall's business
analyst, and from Baker to Lebbon.  The significance of the Peptech
announcements is to be found in the references
to the restricted shares in the
following terms:
<P>

"16/07/96:  RESULTS OF MEETING: On 16/07/96, both resolutions proposed to the
meeting were passed, authorising allotment of ord.
shares as consideration for
the sale by the allottees of shares in Peptech (UK) Ltd.  New shares are likely
to be subject to escrow
conditions as restricted securities.  To consult with
the ASX on this issue."
<P>

65   	While Lebbon denied any knowledge of the existence of the
restricted shares via the broker reports prior to the allotment
agreement, he
admitted that by 12 August 1997 he had seen in the Peptech announcements some
1996 reference to shares of Peptech being
held in escrow and that from his
knowledge of the listing rules, he would have understood the period of escrow
to have been one year.
 
<P>

66   	Mak was not called to give evidence, a matter that was
commented upon in the submissions of counsel for Peptech.  In reply,
counsel
for Leadenhall stated from the bar table that no consideration had been given
to calling Mak.  That statement was accepted
by counsel for Peptech.  If an
adverse finding is open to be made in relation to the absence of Mak from the
witness box, I do not
see that agreement as affecting deliberation of the
appropriate inference to be drawn.
<P>

67   	12 August 1997 is a date of some significance in that, in
early August 1997, there was a significant drop in the share price
of Peptech
shares which drew inquiries of Peptech from Lebbon and the ASX.  Mellish
responded to Lebbon's inquiries by informing
him that the Peptech directors
shared Lebbon's concern about the fall in the share price.  At the same time he
informed the ASX that
Peptech was not able to offer any explanation for the
movement in Peptech's shares.  It was Lebbon's evidence that he did not
associate
the drop in share price with the restricted shares coming out of
escrow.  So far as he was concerned, there were no shares held in
escrow,
notwithstanding the information brought to his notice, shortly prior to 12
August 1997.  
<P>

68   	For reasons later examined, I am not satisfied that the
existence of the restricted shares, or their advent onto the market
had any
measurable effect upon the on-market share price in the last four months of
1997.  
<P>

69   	The approach I have adopted to the effect of this evidence
is to determine on the probabilities what the situation was at
the time of
entry into the allotment agreement, and in that context to take into account
whatever significance there is in Lebbon's
conduct in early August 1997 to the
extent that it may throw light on the pre-allotment agreement conduct.
Further, I think it is
necessary to establish the rights and liabilities in
relation to the events surrounding the allotment agreement before passing to
an
examination of the effect on those rights and liabilities of the substitution
agreement.
<P>

70   	The evidence of Lebbon is unequivocal that he had no
recollection of seeing any broker report prior to the allotment agreement
which
made any reference to the restricted shares.  He did not deny that the broker
reports concerning Peptech may have been received
from Baker prior to the
allotment agreement.  Lebbon's position in relation  to the reports is
substantially caught in the following
transcript of his evidence in cross
examination;
<P>

"Q.   Again, can I suggest to you that if you had had both these reports in
your possession and read in both of them statements
that the shares were held
in escrow, if you were concerned about that fact one matter that you would have
certained to clarify the
position with Dr. Aston if you spoke to him, is that
right?
<P>

A.   Not necessarily because there were other reports that made no reference to
escrow securities, other reports to say, use conditional
words and the annual
report does not disclose them.
<P>

Q.   You say, do you, that if you had seen these reports and read them in the
period from May to July 1997 that because the references
to shares being held
in escrow appear only in some reports and because there was no reference to
such shares in the annual report
you would have acted upon the footing, do you
say, that there were not restricted securities?
<P>

A.   I would have relied on the annual report.  With hindsight had I been aware
of that I cannot categorically say I would have
raised the issue with Aston.  I
mean in doing research there are certain milestones, if you like, which you
take as gospel, as major
markers.  The annual report is one of those and very
much one takes the attitude that in order to be efficient with one's time one
goes back to the last full disclosure by the company, be it financial, science,
information or whatever and work towards an interest
in that.  This is why we
say look at annual report as being the last complete matter.  It is the Nomura
report of June 1996 because
that was a fairly comprehensive document.
<P>

Q.   Do you accept the possibility that the two reports I have taken you to may
well have been read by you prior to 31 July 1997?
<P>

A.   It is a possibility.
<P>

Q.   And do you say that if you read those reports and saw within them a
reference to shares held in escrow you would have disregarded
such references
because you had other reports which made no references to such shares and
because you had an annual report also which
made no reference to such
shares?
<P>

A.   What I am saying is if I had these before July 1997, and I can't recall
that and had I read them I would not have paid any
particular attention to that
because that corporate information is confidential information.  I would have
looked and relied on from
the annual report.  There is nothing there that
flashes a red flag at me to say this is a real problem.  I don't recall reading
those
reports before then and I would have relied on the annual report because
that is the marker I talked about.
<P>

Q.   Just trying to understand - you mean by that answer what you are seeking
to suggest is that it is entirely possible you read
these reports but just
ignored the reference to them in escrow for the reason you stated?
<P>

A.   Had I read them, yes, but I don't accept that I read them.
<P>

Q.   Why is that you don't accept that you read them?
<P>

A.   Why?  Because I can not recall the precise date that I read them and the
focus of our investigation was not - by the way the
brokers report, the focus
of your investigation was by way of Michael Story's investigation of the
science and my review of the financials.
 I had no particular need to review
broker's reports.  It was in the main stay an important component of our
research that changed
in August."
<P>

(T 106.44 - 107.53)
<P>

71   	I have some difficulty in accepting the validity of that
reasoning.  It is common ground that Lebbon possessed expertise in
market
analysis of shares.  Leadenhall's interest in Peptech shares was not a simple
market transaction.  It involved a sophisticated
technical analysis of
Peptech's underlying value, upon which was dependent a substantial private
placement of shares and options
in favour of Leadenhall at prices well above
ruling market prices.  It was contemplated that Peptech, with the assistance of
Lebbon,
would stimulate interest, and hence a price rise, in Peptech shares by
publicising the placement at a premium and Story's favourable
technical review,
or at least the non-confidential elements of it: by arranging presentations
relating to Peptech's potential value
to prospective investors in various
Australian capital cities and by the listing of Peptech shares on the London
market.  It was
contemplated that Leadenhall would on-sell shares allotted to
it.  Leadenhall's interest accordingly was both short and medium to
long term
and the success of the transaction lay in developing market awareness of the
potential of Peptech's underlying business
and the intrinsic value of its
shares.  That strategy was expected to result in a significantly increased
market value of Peptech
shares.  In that setting the importance of the
existence of the restricted shares and of their emergence from escrow is
evident.
<P>

72   	The view I have come to is that, if the broker reports,
and, in particular, the references in them to the possibility of the
shares of
Peptech being held in escrow, had come to the attention of Lebbon prior to the
allotment agreement, it would have been
incumbent upon Leadenhall to raise the
matter with Peptech, notwithstanding the misleading nature of the 96 report and
the half yearly
report. 
<P>

73   	In my view, prudence would have dictated that course given
the "fundamental" importance of the possible existence of a substantial
body of
Peptech shares being held in escrow; particularly so when, in Lebbon's
understanding of the operation of the listing rules,
 any such restricted
shares would have been due to come out of escrow in mid 1997.  
<P>

74   	I think that conclusion is called for, notwithstanding
Lebbon's evidence, which I accept, that in "doing research there are
certain
milestones, if you like, which you take as gospel, which you take as major
markers", principal among which are the target
company's published reports.

<P>

75   	The evidence is, I think, unclear as to what happened
within Leadenhall to the broker reports forwarded by Baker prior to
the
allotment agreement.  I think it is reasonably clear, both from Lebbon's
evidence and his contemporaneous records, that he paid
no particular regard to
them in his due diligence exercise in relation to the Peptech shares.  It is
possible that they were handed
over to Mak, as Leadenhall's business analyst.
However, it was not suggested in cross examination of Lebbon that Mak, or any
other
member of Leadenhall's staff, had reported to Lebbon in relation to the
broker reports and, in particular, to the references in those
reports to shares
held in escrow.  I think that, in those circumstances, no adverse inference
should be drawn from the absence of
Mak from the witness box. 
<P>

76   	However Lebbon's evidence explaining his treatment of the
information in the Peptech announcements challenges credulity when
regard is
had to the movement in Peptech's share price at the time of that receipt of
that material in early August 1997.  I would
have thought that information
referring to the possibility of restricted shares having been created in mid
1996 with a likely escrow
period of twelve months warranted an enquiry by
Lebbon of Peptech: particularly in a climate of falling share prices.
<P>

Lebbon's evidence in cross examination was as follows:
<P>

"Q.   Do you agree with this, that by no later than August 1997 you had at
least read something about shares being held in escrow
within Peptech?
<P>

A.   That came to my knowledge by then, yes.
<P>

Q.   Did you consciously turn your mind, when you read the reference to the
conditions of escrow, whether you should pursue some
further enquiry about the
matter?
<P>

A.   No.
<P>

Q.   Did you, when you saw the reference to escrow conditions, enquire how that
could be reconciled with what appeared in the annual
report?
<P>

A.   No.
<P>

Q.   Do you say, when you read the reference to escrow conditions, you just
read it and thought nothing of it?
<P>

A.  Correct.
<P>

Q.   Can I suggest to you that either at about the same time or before 31 July
you read references to escrow in analysts' reports
and also thought nothing of
it, is that right?
<P>

A.   No.
<P>

Q.   Can I suggest to you that if you had known of shares being held in escrow
before you made the investment on 31 July, you also
would have thought nothing
of it?
<P>

A.   Absolutely not,  I would not have done the investment; it would have been
so fundamental to the transaction.
<P>

Q.   Can I ask you to turn next to page 831?  This is a letter that you wrote
to Peptech on 12 August 1997 expressing some concern
about how the market had
dropped?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q. By this date you had read, had you not, at least in the last document I took
you to, some references to shares being held in
escrow?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You knew from the annual report that the resolution in relation to the
Peptech UK allotted shares was made in July of 1996?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.  You used your knowledge of the Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rules that
if there were vendor securities which were restricted
to the escrow period, the
period would have been most likely one year?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   If you were otherwise minded to disregard a reference to escrow, didn't it
occur to you, if you were concerned about it by
12 August 1997, that a possible
explanation for a price drop might have had something to do with the shares
being in escrow?
<P>

A.   No, that's why I asked the question.
<P>

Q.   You didn't think in August 1997 that shares being held in escrow and
becoming released from --
<P>

A.   In August 1997 I wasn't aware there were shares in escrow.
<P>

Q.   Can I suggest to you that was for the reason you well knew, that the
market had an understanding that there were shares in
Peptech that were
restricted to securities?
<P>

A.   I beg your pardon?
<P>

Q.  You don't understand the question?
<P>

A.   No, I don't.
<P>

Q.   You knew, didn't you, from the various brokers' reports to which I have
taken you that it was widely known within those participating
in the market
that there were restricted securities in Peptech?
<P>

A.   No, I don't accept that.
<P>

Q.   Can I ask you to go to the document at page 833?
<P>

Peptech provided you on 12 August with a copy of the letter that had been
written to the Stock Exchange referring to a similar year,
is that right?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   And you read that letter that Peptech didn't have an explanation for the
price drop?
<P>

A.   Yes."
<P>

(T 113.1 - 114.28)
<P>

77   	I think the reality is that Lebbon paid scant regard to
that material, mainly because it was provided in response to Mak's
request for
information for the preparation of Lebbon's presentations that had been
scheduled for August 1997 and which were aimed
at enlivening the market in
Peptech shares.  I think this is reflected in Lebbon's evidence that
follows:
<P>

"Q.   ...Do you have any recollection at all of Mr Mak approaching you some
time on about 8 August 1997 and showing you the handwritten
note and the
detailed analyst's reports described on the following page?
<P>

A.   I have no specific recollection of that.
<P>

Q.   You don't have any recollection at all of assisting Mr Mak to locate the
materials described in the attached document headed,
"Detailed analyst's
reports"?
<P>

A.   I don't have a specific recollection of it, no.
<P>

Q.   Do you accept that consistently with your instructions to Mr Mak to help
you get the information, that by no later than early
August 1997 the
probabilities are Leadenhall had within its possession each of the three
reports which I've taken you to?
<P>

A.   No, I don't.
<P>

Q.   You know, don't you, from the tenor of this letter that what Mr Mak was
after was in particular any broker's research report?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You know that the response that he got back from Peptech included a
listing of the detailed analyst reports of which Peptech
were aware?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You know from this document that what Mr Mak was told was that you ought
to have each of the reports described?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   The probabilities are, aren't they, that Mr Mak sought out from you and,
if necessary, from other sources the analysts' reports
that Peptech had
identified.
<P>

A.   He would have sought them out.  Mr Mak was doing lots of other things at
that time and some things fell by the wayside.
<P>

Q.   We know in the circumstances you can't explain how each of those three
reports found their way into the possession of Leadenhall?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   If they hadn't been received before 8 August 1997 the probabilities are,
aren't they, that they were received shortly after?
<P>

A.   No.  They may have been received shortly after.  There were a number of
things Mr Mak had left to do.  This was leading up
to the presentations and he
was very busy."
<P>

(T 109.47 - 110.38)
<P>

78   	This adverse market movement in Peptech shares resulted in
Leadenhall releasing the on-sale investor from the agreement to
purchase a
portion of Leadenhall's shareholding in Peptech.  In doing so Leadenhall was
exposed to the somewhat daunting prospect
of satisfying it's commitment to find
over three million dollars for the shares allotted to it.  I think that is the
context in which
the following evidence of Lebbon should be viewed:
<P>

"Q.   Can you turn please to page 813?  This is the document I took you to
yesterday, you might recall.  It's a facsimile from Mr
Baker to you of 9 August
which attached a summary of reports made by Peptech and you might recall I took
you at page 815 to the entry
about halfway down the page for 16 July 1996
described as, "Results of meeting"; do you see that?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You told us yesterday that you in fact thought you glanced at this
document but did, in glancing, read that entry?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   You agreed, as I recall it, that although you read in that entry a
reference to the new shares likely to be subject to escrow
conditions, you
didn't act upon that matter by making any enquiry of Dr Aston or anyone else
about what had happened?
<P>

A.   Correct.
<P>

Q.   Was that for the reason, do you say, that you continued to prefer what was
in the annual report over any other piece of information
that you might come
into possession of relating to shares being held in escrow?
<P>

A.   I think that would have been for a number of reasons: One, we had already
done the deal, this being August, the transaction
being done some two weeks
earlier, secondly, it is not definitive, its says, "Likely to be subject to
escrow"; thirdly, there's no
subsequent announcement saying they are in
escrow.
<P>

Q.   You don't seriously suggest, do you, in relation to the fact that you had
already done the deal that you would remain you (sic)
mute about the complaint
relating to shares being held in escrow?
<P>

A.   If I thought they were in escrow I wouldn't have remained mute, you're
correct.
<P>

Q.   You say the reason you didn't pursue it was because you did not think the
shares were likely to be in escrow and there's no
such announcement?
<P>

A.   And I relied on the annual report."
<P>

(T 110.40 - 111.24)
<P>

79   	The view I have come to concerning this August 1997
conduct of Lebbon is as follows. In the absence of any satisfactory
explanation,
the failure of Lebbon to associate the possible coincidence of
restricted shares coming out of escrow with the fall in the price
of the
Peptech shares brings into question his credibility in relation to his asserted
reliance upon the materially incorrect published
reports of Peptech.  
<P>

80   	However, the view I have reached is that in August the
reference to escrow shares in historical documents relating to Peptech
"didn't
jag in (Lebbon's) mind" for the reason that the documents were received in a
different context, namely for the preparation
of material by Mak for Lebbon's
August presentations.  
<P>

81   	My reasons for preferring that view are that it was not
necessary for Lebbon to make any admission as to sighting that August
material.
He had no difficulty in denying knowledge of the content of the broker reports
provided prior to the allotment agreement.
 In August 1997 he had the
opportunity, in the face of the fall of the Peptech share prices, to opt out of
any further commitment
to Peptech on the basis of the misleading nature of its
96 report and the half yearly report, instead of accepting a compromise in
the
form of the substitution agreement.  I am reasonably satisfied that his
attention was directed in August to the tasks ahead of
Leadenhall in enlivening
interest in Peptech's shares in the face of a challenging resistance in the
market place. 
<P>

82   	If Lebbon is to be taken as unscrupulous in raising in
these proceedings a reliance upon the materially false, or misleading
contents
of Peptech's reports, it was open to him to adopt that course both prior to and
following the substitution agreement. In
fact, when relations between him and
Peptech became strained it led to Lebbon asserting, in his facsimile of 5
November 1997, that
he had been "conned" by Peptech in relation to the private
placement of Peptech shares.  
<P>

83   	However, there is no reference in Leadenhall's lengthy
facsimile to Aston to the false nature of Peptech's reports.  It is
a wide
ranging facsimile and if it had been present to the mind of Lebbon in November
1997 that there existed restricted shares,
I would have expected him to have
relied upon Peptech's incorrect reports to the public in his facsimile of 5
November 1997.  The
facsimile opens with the following paragraphs:
<P>

"I write to you with great concern and a formal request for some answers
<P>

<b>Background</b>
<P>

Leadenhall and its associates have invested $A1 million in Peptech and have
spent close of $A0.25 million in costs - many of which
were incurred for the
benefit of the company, Peptech, for which no reimbursement has been
received.
<P>

Since we made our investment, we have seen the share price drop to less than
30% of that which was paid and, to date, we are facing
a loss of approximately
$A1 million - all this in the space of three months and with no communication
from the company explaining
matters.  This state of affairs is unhealthy and
can not be allowed to continue.
<P>

David Baker and ourselves are receiving a number of comments from shareholders
and criticisms which I, at least, am not in a position
to defend.  I and a
number of shareholders would like answers to a range of questions, including,
but not limited to, the following
issues. 
<P>

A copy of this fax to you to (sic) is being sent to David Baker as he was
present during my visit to Cirencester in July 1997."
<P>

There then followed four pages of questions concerning Peptech's products;
Peptech's appointment of a London broker; its engagement
of consultants and a
finance director; suggested conflicts of interest of Peptech's secretary;
conduct of Peptech in the context
of shareholder relations; strategies in place
for capital restructuring or in regard to takeovers and matters concerning
management
and presentations to stockbrokers.  Under the heading "shareholders"
there appeared the following:
<P>

<b>"Shareholders</b>
<P>

Has the company received satisfactory responses to all its Section 719 notices
sent out by the ASC?
<P>

What was the shareholding of the top 20 shareholders as at the end of 31 July
1997, 31 August 1997, 30 September 1997 and 31 October
1997?
<P>

How have they changed and why?
<P>

What is the company doing to keep in touch with its top 20 shareholders?
<P>

What is the company doing to keep the share market informed of progress?"
<P>

84   	If the falsity of the Peptech's reports was present to the
mind of Lebbon at that point, I think the probabilities are high,
that he would
have resorted to that criticism. His facsimile concluded with the following
paragraphs:
<P>

"In summary, there is an enormous amount to be done and little sign of anything
happening.  Shareholders could be excused if they
vote with their feet and/or
dump the existing Board and management.
<P>

On a personal level, I feel that I was "conned" and that urgent answers are
required to convince me otherwise.
<P>

Whilst I acknowledge your desire to be friendly and to have lunch next time you
are in Australia,  a lunch alone will not solve
the million dollar problem -
there needs to be other things done and value restored.
<P>

We find ourselves in a far, far different position today than the position that
was painted to me in Cirencester.  I look to you
personally to restore value to
our investment."
<P>

85   	The facsimile has the earmarks of an extremely
disenchanted investor and is in terms that, I think, reflect a keen willingness
to explore avenues of escape from the transaction.  I find it very hard to
believe that if Lebbon had been aware of the existence
of the restricted shares
and of the fact that they had come out of escrow in August/September 1997, he
would not have made full use,
at that stage, of the false statements in the
published reports of Peptech.  
<P>

86   	Nothing had gone right in relation to Peptech's shares.
They had fallen into the twenties, that is cents: Peptech had got
no closer to
a listing on the London market and an important step in the raising of new
capital failed to eventuate when Allergen
Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Allergan)
declined to exercise its option rights in relation to Peptech's shares .  
<P>

87   	Lebbon's facsimile of 5 November 1997, I think, marked the
beginning of his investigation into shareholdings in Peptech, and
one aimed at
seeing what that would turn up, without knowing precisely what an investigation
into shareholding would reveal.  I doubt
if litigation was far from his
thoughts.  
<P>

88   	Initially, I think, Lebbon was aiming in the direction of
shareholdings that Aston and those  associated with him may have
had and
disposed of following the allotment agreement.  I do not know whether Lebbon
was completely open in his evidence about his
conduct in November 1997, as
reflected in the following transcript:
<P>

"Q.   You had asked Dr Aston in the letter that you wrote to him on 5 November
to provide information as to who the substantial
share holders were as at 31
July, 31 August, 30 September and 30 October?
<P>

A.   Yes because one of the issues that we had discussed earlier was the
nominee holdings and that Peptech should try and get behind
some of those
nominee holdings.
<P>

Q.   You wishing to know who the top forty shareholders were as at late
November 1997, what do you say your reason was in seeking
that out?
<P>

A.   I had no other specific reason other than just looking at it for general
information.
<P>

Q.   It was not for the purpose of seeking to explore ways that you might
assert that somehow you had been conned?
<P>

A.   No, it wasn't.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.  What was it? You must have had a reason?
<P>

A.   Well, we were faced with the situation where there had been substantial
trades in August.  I had asked the company to make
inquiries about who the
nominee companies were, Mark Potter had sent me an updated register I think on
31 August.  There had been
speculation and comment made by Baker as to who had
been buying and selling and in the context of trying to understand where the
company was  at I naturally asked for the top twenty."
<P>

(T 150.34 - 151/2.2)
<P>

89   	Other steps taken by Lebbon included a recourse to the
broker reports which had been in Leadenhall's possession for several
months.
Lebbon fixed the time for that examination as the end of November 1997.  At the
same time, he obtained from Peptech's share
registrar, a list of the top forty
shareholders in Peptech.  This was provided by facsimile of 26 November 1997.
He compared that
printout with a similar record provided to him by Mellish on
18 July 1997 which provided details of shareholders as at June 1997.
 
<P>

90   	This comparison revealed a group of shareholders that had
not appeared in the June list.  These, as it happened, included
holders of the
restricted shares.  Since there had been no share trading or private placement
to account for that change and given
Lebbon's reference back to the broker
reports it is not too difficult a step to conclude that Lebbon had a shrewd
idea at that stage
of how those new shareholders had come onto the list.  
<P>

91   	Lebbon also revisited the 96 report and in doing so he
"discovered by accident" that the percentage of shareholding attributed
to
Peptech's principal shareholders reflected an issued share capital of
119,000,000 shares, not 134,000,000 as stated in the 96
report.  I have some
doubt about that exercise being performed other than in the context of Lebbon
chasing up the trail of the restricted
shares, although he claimed that as at
28 November 1997 he had "no view (and) was fishing for information."
<P>

92   	According to Lebbon he did not make the connection between
the restricted shares and the change in shareholding until 1 December
1997.
Perhaps nothing much turns on the space of a few days.  However I entertain
little doubt that Lebbon had a pretty fair idea
of what had happened to explain
the change in shareholding in the two lists provided to him by that date.  The
1 December date coincided
with the receipt by Lebbon from the ASX  of the
Peptech notice of meeting of 21 June 1996 to approve the allotment of the
restricted
shares. That notice of meeting was forwarded by the Manager in
Adelaide of the ASX and was forwarded in the following circumstances:
<P>

"Q.   Had you prior to receiving the document at page 1238, dated 1 December
1997, spoken to someone at the Australian Stock Exchange
asking for a
document?
<P>

A.   No I do not think I did, no.
<P>

Q.   Do you see the document at page 1238, the notice of meeting as
discussed?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Apparently, a fax sent to you by David of the Australian Stock
Exchange?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Had you spoken to David before this?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Had you asked for a copy of the notice of meeting concerned?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Had you asked specifically for a copy of the notice of meeting proposed to
be held in July 1996?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   This was proposed to be held then?
<P>

A.   Yes.
<P>

Q.   Where did you get that information about the meeting from?
<P>

A.  The circumstances surrounding that is David, while the manager of the
Australian Stock Exchange, he is the manager of the Australian
Adelaide stock
Exchange.  I had known him for some time and I telephoned him and discussed the
difficulty I had in terms of this
anomaly and I think he then looked at his
internal data base and said there was the notice of meeting, and that is how it
came to
be sent to me.
<P>

Q.   It was not because, because you had read in a document that you received
in August that there was a meeting to be held in July
1996, at which
consideration was to be given to shares being issued?
<P>

A.   No I do not think it was.
<P>

Q.   You say do you that your recollection now is that David White was the one
who made reference to that meeting as being a potential
explanation?
<P>

A.   Yes
<P>

Q.   Did you recall what you had read of it in the document that you had been
given in August?
<P>

A.   No."
<P>

(T 159.38 - 160.30)
<P>

93   	It is clear from the facsimile of Lebbon to Baker of 2
December 1997 that he was well aware of the existence of the restricted
shares
by that time and that he was investigating ways of extricating Leadenhall from
an unsatisfactory investment.  He forwarded
a facsimile to Peptech on 2
December 1997 which was in the following terms:
<P>

"We acknowledge receipt of your facsimile dated 26 November 1997 under cover of
which you sent a copy of the top 40 shareholders
as at November 1997.
<P>

We have obtained from the ASX a copy of a Notice of Meeting of 16 July 1996 and
enclose a copy for your reference.
<P>

There appear to have been some shareholding changes from those shares which
were allotted pursuant to the meeting of 16 July 1996
compared with the
shareholding list as at 26 November 1997.
<P>

Accordingly, we would be pleased if you would kindly provide us with the
following information
<P>

1. What are the current shareholdings of:
<P>

- Malcolm Douglas McMillan
<P>

- Agnes Therese McMillan
<P>

- Theresa Bomford
<P>

- EBC Nominees (Jersey) Ltd
<P>

- Swiss Bank (London Office Nominees) Ltd
<P>

- Wharton Shober
<P>

2. On what dates and in what quantities were disposals of shares made by
Integro Fiduciaire SARL - you will note that their shareholding
has apparently
dropped from 2,263,500 to 391,000 as at 26 November 1997.
<P>

3. On what date and in what quantities were disposals of shares made by
Fiduciaire Ryco SARL - you will note that their shareholding
has apparently
dropped from 3,143,750 to 1,571,875 as at 26 November 1997.
<P>

4. What were the dates on which each of the shareholdings listed in the Notice
of Meeting of 16 July 1996 were available for sale
through the ASX, i.e. were
any or all of these securities restricted securities and, if so, for what
period?"
<P>

94   	In the absence of a response, Leadenhall's solicitor
forwarded the following facsimile to Peptech on 22 December 1997:
<P>

"I act for Leadenhall.
<P>

My client discovered earlier this month that the 14,976,825 shares issued by
Peptech Technology Limited (the "Company") pursuant
to a resolution passed on
16 July 1996 were "restricted securities" within the meaning of the ASX Listing
Rules, with an escrow period
of twelve months.
<P>

My client was not informed of this material fact in its negotiations with the
Company for the issue to it of shares and options
pursuant to its application
made on 31 July 1997.  Had my client known the facts as to the restricted
securities it would not have
subscribed for the shares.
<P>

Furthermore:
<P>

1.  There is no reference in the Company's annual report dated 13 December 1996
to the number of restricted securities on issue
and the date from which they
cease to be restricted securities.  This, inter alia, is a breach of ASX
Listing Rule 4.10.14.
<P>

2.  The Company's notice of meeting dated 21 June 1996 convening a general
meeting of shareholders to pass the resolution for the
issue of the shares does
not disclose that the shares proposed to be issued will be restricted
securities.  I note that your letter
to ASX of 16 July 1996 states:
<P>

"The new shares are likely to be subject to escrow conditions as restricted
securities..."
<P>

3.   It appears from your letter of 19 July 1996 to ASX, that the notice of
meeting referred to above was not given in draft form
to ASX prior to its
dispatch to shareholders, as required by ASX Listing Rule 15.1.4.
<P>

The failure of the Company to inform my client of the facts as to the
restricted securities constitutes deceptive and misleading
conduct in breach of
Section 995 of the Corporations Law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.
My client is entitled to recover damages from the Company, and from Messrs R
Aston, A R Bates, G A Hilton and  D J M Mellish as
persons involved in the
contraventions, pursuant to Section 1005 of the Corporations Law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.
<P>

I have also advised my client that it is entitled to make application to the
Court under Section 1114 of the Corporations Law in
respect of the Company's
breaches of the ASX Listing Rules.  
<P>

My client's loss, as far as it can presently be quantified, is $885,276, made
up as follows:
<P>

Subscription cost							$1,000,000
<P>

Costs and expenses of investigation of the Company			$   205,260
<P>

Other costs &amp; expenses in respect of the "investment"			$       8,104
<P>

Opportunity cost							<u>$      61,489</u>
<P>

							SUB-TOTAL 	$1,274,853
<P>

Less:
<P>

Net proceeds of sale of 350,000 shares in the Company			$   116,835
<P>

Present value of remaining holdings					<u>$   272,742</u>
<P>

						SUB-TOTAL		$   389,577
<P>

					                	<b><u>	$   885,276</u></b>
<P>

My client requires, without delay, an acknowledgment of liability and an
undertaking to compensate it for its loss and damage."
<P>

95   	Peptech responded by its solicitor's facsimile of 24
December rejecting the claim and asserting that Lebbon had been  "made
aware of
the existence and terms of the restricted securities, both in Cirencester, UK
and in Sydney, during the course of the extensive
due diligence investigations
which he undertook on behalf of Leadenhall."
<P>

96   	Consideration of Leadenhall's case, I think, may start
with a series of findings against which its entitlements may be gauged:
<P>

A.   The 96 report and the half yearly report were important tools in Lebbon's
"view of the financials" of Peptech.  Each report
was misleading in a material
respect, either by omission of reference to the existence of the restricted
shares or by incorrect description
of Peptech's issued shares as quoted shares.

<P>

B.     Lebbon clearly placed reliance upon that material causing Leadenhall to
enter the allotment agreement.
<P>

	C.     Prior to the allotment agreement it did not register with Lebbon that
the
<P>

restricted shares existed.  His mid July discussions 1997 with representatives
of Peptech did involve discussions relating to the
holders of shares who
happened to be holders of restricted shares.  Lebbon would have known that the
Peptech UK shareholders had
been bought out in an exchange of shares and it was
almost inevitable that discussion would have arisen, as Aston has said, over
their loyalty to Peptech.  I accept that in such discussions mention, in
passing, was made of the fact that their shares were in
escrow for the time
being.  I accept that in those discussions it did not register with Lebbon that
there were some 14,000,000 shares
in escrow and due to be listed.  Whether it
should have is another matter.
<P>

D.     Peptech officers were clearly aware of the potential impact on its
planning for
<P>

possible capital restructuring and capital raising of the listing of the
restricted shares and of the fact that some restricted
shareholders proposed to
dispose of their holdings and that others were under pressure to sell.  In
comparison with the concentration
by Peptech's board on these matters about the
time of the allotment agreement, statements made to Lebbon by Peptech, in
relation
to Peptech shares were, in my view, less than fulsome on the subject
of restricted shares.
<P>

	E.     Leadenhall was in possession of the broker reports which would have
put
<P>

Lebbon on notice of the existence of the restricted shares and of their pending
release from escrow.  I accept that he did not notice
any such references in
material provided to Leadenhall until early August 1997.  Whether he should
have been aware of their contents
is another matter.
<P>

	F.      By 12 August 1997 Lebbon was aware of reference in the Peptech

<P>

announcements to the existence of the restricted shares.  Given his
preoccupation with promoting Peptech shares, he took no action
to clarify that
matter in the light of the fallen price of Peptech shares.  Whether he should
have taken some action is another matter.
<P>

G.     Notwithstanding that the reference to restricted shares in the Peptech
        
<P>

announcements came to his notice in early August 1997, Lebbon did nothing to
clarify the position before causing Leadenhall to enter
into the substitution
agreement.  Whether he should have done so is another matter.
<P>

	H.     Had Lebbon been aware of the existence of the restricted shares and of
their
<P>

terms of restrictions I do not accept that he would have abandoned
negotiations, given the favourable evaluation of Peptech's potential
by Story.
I do accept that he would have deferred concluding negotiations.  Lebbon's
interest was short term in so far as Leadenhall
aimed to on-sell shares
received under the allotment agreement: and medium to long term in relation to
any shares retained and the
options exercisable until 2002.  The release of the
restricted shares onto the market was pertinent to the on-sale of the allotted
shares.  I suppose, if the whole of the substituted shares had been dumped on
the market in an unorderly exiting of the former Peptech
UK shareholders, there
could have been a medium term effect if the exodus led to a complete lack of
shareholder confidence.  In that
case recovery of Peptech's share price may
have taken more than what could have been achieved by the Story analysis,
Lebbon's capital
city presentations, listing on the London market and Allergan
exercising its option rights.
<P>

I.     Had Lebbon acted prudently he should have:
<P>

(i) treated the broker reports received some time about May 1997 with more
regard and made himself aware generally of their contents
and, in particular,
he should have been alerted to the possible existence and likely period of
escrow of the restricted shares:
<P>

(ii) being put on notice, clarified with Peptech whether there were in fact any
restricted shares amongst its issued shares and
required Peptech to reconcile
that information with Peptech's reports:
<P>

(iii) taken similar action in August 1997 in relation to the reference in the
Peptech announcements to the possibility that Peptech
had issued shares which
were the subject of restriction agreements; and 
<P>

(iv) taken action to protect Leadenhall's position other than by entering into
the substitution agreement.
<P>

J.      While those failures represented a lack of care on the part of Lebbon
contributing to Leadenhall's acceptance of the terms
of the allotment
agreement, I am satisfied, on the probabilities, that Leadenhall entered the
allotment agreement under the influence
of the omissions and incorrect
statements in the 96 report and the half yearly report.
<P>

97   	Whether the plaintiffs suffered recoverable damages "by"
that conduct, in my view, presents a question that is not readily
answered.  I
expressed the view on a question of principle, during the course of submissions
that this case was not a `<i>Potts v Miller' </i> situation.  That was in
response to submissions on behalf of Peptech that the measure of damages to
which the plaintiffs may be entitled
was the difference between what was paid
for the allotment of shares and the granting of options and the true value of
those securities
unaffected by the misleading conduct of Peptech as measured at
the date of the transaction.  On that basis it was submitted that
the damages
would be nil.
<P>

98   	If the principle espoused in <i>Potts v Miller </i>
((1940) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1940/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=64%20CLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">64 CLR 282)</a> applied to the facts of this case I think the conclusion
drawn by counsel for Peptech would be correct.  The presence of the restricted
shares and their impending release from escrow were not facts affecting the
intrinsic value of the Peptech shares.  They were factors
that, in the short
term at least, were capable of affecting the market price of Peptech shares.
<P>

99   	It was not inevitable or, in my view, even a matter of
probability that those facts would adversely affect Peptech's share
price.  The
real significance of those factors was the risk that the body of restricted
shareholders would exit the company in an
unceremonious dumping of shares soon
after the restricted shares came out of escrow.  If that did not eventuate,
then the structure
of Peptech's share capital would have been unremarkable.
<P>

100   	Further, the possibility of an inordinate disposal of the
hitherto unrestricted shares in the weeks following their release
from escrow
resulting in a depressed market price may have said little about the underlying
value of the shares to a prospective
long term investor: particularly one
taking a position with long term options over shares in Peptech.
<P>

101   	The favourable Story analysis; the anticipated exercise
of option rights by Allergan; the anticipated secondary listing of
Peptech's
shares on the London market; the announcement of Leadenhall's above market
placement and the strategy of sparking a share
price increase by a series of
presentations emphasising those things, were a combination of events that could
have made a depressed
share price in August/September 1997 a favourable
platform for investment in Peptech: provided that the premium to be paid on
allotment
of shares to Leadenhall reflected the depressed share price.  
<P>

102   	Part of Lebbon's evidence concerning the significance of
the restricted shares was as follows:
<P>

"Q. Can I suggest to you that if you had known of shares being held in escrow
before you made the investment on 31 July, you also
would have thought nothing
of it ?
<P>

A. Absolutely not, I would not have done the investment; it would have been so
fundamental to the transaction".
<P>

(T 113.26 - 113.30)
<P>

103   	I have difficulty in accepting that evidence at face
value in the light of my findings as to the market significance of the
existence of the restricted shares and of their release from escrow.  However,
the evidence lies uncomfortably beside other evidence
of Lebbon in cross
examination. 
<P>

104   	As to the effect of gaining knowledge of the restricted
shares prior to the allotment agreement, Lebbon gave the following
evidence:
<P>

"Q.   You tell his Honour, don't you, that in May of 1997 you were still in the
process of trying to work out whether you would
spend money getting a
scientific report done?
<P>

A.   Correct.
<P>

Q.   And you hadn't really formulated any particular proposition whereby you
might require either shares or options?
<P>

A.   Correct.
<P>

Q.   And without you having formulated what your proposal might be, may I take
it if you had read in any of the reports Mr Baker
provided to you that there
were shares in escrow, it wouldn't have mattered?
<P>

A.   It would have mattered.
<P>

Q.   In what sense?
<P>

A.   As to the timing and pricing and also as to whether I had proceeded at
all.  At that stage we hadn't fixed timing or price."
<P>

(T 37.44 - 38.4)
<P>

105   	Later in his cross examination Lebbon gave evidence to
similar effect as follows:
<P>

"Q.   You say, do you, that if you had known that there were restricted
securities which might be released on to the market in late
1997 in Peptech
that you would have bargained for some different option price, do you?
<P>

A.   If I had proceeded with the deal I would have looked at a different price,
yes.
<P>

Q.   What price do you say you would have looked at?
<P>

A.   I don't know.  I haven't contemplated that.
<P>

Q.   What work would you have done to try and work out what price would be
appropriate?
<P>

A.   Good question.  I'm not sure offhand.  There would be a number of things I
would have done, I think.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Q.   One would have been to get Mr Story on the job?
<P>

A.   Yes, your Honour, but this issue then is not just about fundamental
values, which is what Dr Story's report is about, it is
about pricing
mechanisms and how the market might react.  My inclination --
<P>

Q.   You are talking about the fact that Mr Story's exercise wouldn't know the
results of it?
<P>

A.   Certainly if I had proceeded with the transaction or contemplation of the
transaction I would still had a report done, but
my initial reaction would be
that I would not have done the transaction at that point of time.  I would have
waited to see the effects
of this for the price to have weakened and then
negotiated something."
<P>

...
<P>

A.   It is a fairly complex set of issues you deal with.  There's no precise
answer, which is why you would wait until the effects
were known.  This was a
transaction where there was risk involved and significant risk, and I was
putting in a significant amount
of money of my own, that had I been aware of
the risks I would have waited.  You know the saying you can go broke making a
profit,
but nobody went broke not doing a deal.   I would have waited. 
<P>

...
<P>

Q.   But if you had not known, I want to come to some communications which
suggest you did know, but if you had not known that there
were restricted
securities but were informed immediately before the allotment agreement that
there were, you say, do you, that you
would have forgone the opportunity to
enter into this arrangement and deferred reflecting upon it for some number of
months to wait
and see what the market did?
<P>

A.   In hindsight, if you asked me that question what would I have done, I
believe I would have waited."
<P>

(T 95.23 - 95.52...T 98.50 - 98.57...T 99.24 - 99.33)
<P>

106   	I think that evidence accords with the opinion evidence
of Keene as to the significance to the market of restricted shares
in a listed
corporation.
<P>

107   	I think the correct conclusion to be drawn from Lebbon's
evidence is that he would not have abandoned negotiations with Peptech
had he
been aware, prior to the allotment agreement, of the existence of the
restricted shares and their impending listing.
<P>

108   	I also take the view that Leadenhall would have proceeded
with the allotment in one form or another having regard to the
height of
Lebbon's expectations in relation to Peptech's future share price. Based upon
the Story analysis and Lebbon's own workings
he had formed the opinion that the
net worth of Peptech was in the order of $260,000,000 which reflected a
potential value per share
of between $1.90 to $2.00.  It is of particular
significance, in my view, that, in the second half of August 1997, he was still
of
the opinion that there was a "huge upside" in prospect with Peptech's share
price.  
<P>

109   	Leadenhall's presentation to prospective investors "based
on information believed to be reliable as at 14th August 1997"
is an insight
into Lebbon's thinking in the second half of August 1997.  It is a twenty seven
page "bullet" type document published
under Lebbon's name as executive director
of Leadenhall.  It outlined the history of Leadenhall's investment in Peptech,
ascribing
to the allotment price of 62 cents per share a premium value over
market price of approximately 16 cents.  It dealt with the Story
analysis and
the `product portfolio' of Peptech in some detail, including the quality,
`stage of advancement' and valuation of it
"as per.... Story Base Case $256
million."  It outlined "Project Milestones" including Allergan's anticipated
exercise of option
rights and provided "Anticipated Corporate Milestones".
Included in the latter were the appointment of a Finance director; the
appointment
of a London Stockbroker to "manage secondary listing" and, in 1998,
the listing of shares on the London market.  In a "summary" which
posed the
rhetorical question `why did Leadenhall invest' ; the answers provided included
the following:
<P>

	"- share price at historical low
<P>

	 - huge upside...for (factors) not priced into current share price
<P>

	 - London listing within 12 months"
<P>

110   	If Lebbon is to be taken as honestly presenting the
Peptech case in the second half of August 1997, which I accept his presentation
represented, it leaves little room for speculation when it comes to deciding
whether Lebbon would have proceeded with the allotment
 had he been aware of
the existence of the restricted shares.  When it is recalled that by mid-August
1997 the Peptech share price
had fallen significantly, the implication is
strong that Lebbon had not been deterred by that market setback and had been
prompted
to describe the share price, being at an historical low, as an
incentive to investment in Peptech.
<P>

111   	In trying to assess the consequence of finding that
Lebbon would have deferred concluding an allotment agreement with Peptech
and
would have caused Leadenhall to enter into such an agreement at a subsequent
time, although not necessarily on the same terms
as the allotment agreement, I
think one is entitled to look at the events relating to the release of the
restricted shares.
<P>

112   	The restricted shares and their respective shareholders
were as follows: 
<P>

"Shemyakin Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry	-	4,527,000 ordinary shares
<P>

Vadin Tichonovich Ivanov			-	   880,250 ordinary shares
<P>

Tatyana Michaylovna Andronova		-	   880,250 ordinary shares
<P>

Malcolm Douglas McMillan			-	   565,875 ordinary shares
<P>

Agnes Therese McMillan			-	   377,250 ordinary shares
<P>

Robert Harold Raymond Bomford		-	   402,400 ordinary shares
<P>

Theresa Bomford				-	   402,400 ordinary shares
<P>

EBC Nominees (Jersey) Limited		-	   150,900 ordinary shares
<P>

Swiss Bank (London Office Nominees) Limited	-	   188,625 ordinary shares
<P>

Wharton Shober				-	   251,500 ordinary shares
<P>

Integro Fiduciaire SARL			-	2,263,500 ordinary shares
<P>

Roger Aston				-	   490,425 ordinary shares
<P>

Paula Aston					-	   452,700 ordinary shares
<P>

Fiduciaire Ryco SARL			-	3,143,750 ordinary shares
<P>

..."
<P>

113   	There is some discrepancy between those figures, taken
from the notice of general meeting of Peptech to approve the issue
of the
shares to the Peptech UK shareholders, and other records in evidence: a
discrepancy which I regard as of no significance.
 As earlier noted, on receipt
by Lebbon of the top 40 shareholders in Peptech as at 26 November 1997 he
compared that schedule with
the comparable schedule of shareholders as at 30
June 1997.  That comparison, in substance, pointed up the listing of the
restricted
shares by their appearance on the 26 November 1997 schedule in
contrast with their omission from the 30 June 1997 schedule.  
<P>

114   	Lebbon carried out a further analysis of Peptech
shareholding by a comparison of the 26 November 1997 schedule with
shareholdings
as at 4 December 1997.  What comes out of that comparison is that
the Shemyakin Institute and associated shareholders of the Institute
had
retained their shareholding: the McMillans and Shober had disposed of their
shares; the  Bomfords half of their holding.  Fiduciaire
Ryco had transferred
one half of its holding and Integro Fiduciaire had transferred nearly three
million of its shares.
<P>

115   	Further evidence of sale of the restricted shares is to
be found in a Mellish note of 18 December 1997 which disclosed that
the
McMillans had disposed of their holdings on 1 October 1997: Theresa Bomford
sold her holdings, except for 9,000 shares, on 7
November 1997: EBC Nominees
had disposed of 150,900 shares on 20 October: Swiss Bank had sold 188,625
shares on 24 October: Wharton
Shober sold a total of 251,500 shares between mid
September and 24 October: Integro Fiduciaire "had a balance of 391,000 but
(had)
steadily sold them from 27/10/97": Fiduciaire Ryco
<P>

"had 2 holdings
<P>

(1) 1/9/97  1,571,875
<P>

(2) 1/9/97  1,571,875 sold 25/9/97"
<P>

116   	Mellish's note to Aston in relation to this information
was that it had not been given to Lebbon.  It will be remembered
that Lebbon
had requested of Peptech details of current shareholdings of the McMillans,
Bomford, EBC, Swiss Bank and Shober, in addition
to details of the disposal of
shares by Integro Fiduciaire and Fiduciaire Ryco, together with a statement as
to the dates on which
the shareholdings listed in the 16 July 1996 notice of
meeting were available for sale through the ASX.  
<P>

117   	The details of movement of the restricted shares is not
readily discernible in that certain of the beneficial owners resorted
to Jersey
Island trusts and Jersey Island companies as repositories for their shares and
used broker nominee entities for trading
on the stock exchange.  Merrill Lynch
(Australia) Pty Ltd (Merrill Lynch) appeared to be the broker used by Peptech
and several of
 its principal shareholders.  
<P>

118   	Edward Darryl Codd (Codd) was a stockbroker within
Merrill Lynch.  He was called to give evidence in the plaintiffs' case
by
leave, no statement of evidence having been filed.  He had declined to provide
a statement on grounds of confidentiality.  His
evidence was not particularly
illuminating, largely as a result of the recourse of Merrill Lynch's clients to
Jersey Island trusts
and Jersey Island companies with some greyness in the
identity of the persons holding beneficial interests under those trusts or
in
those companies, and from whom Merrill Lynch received instructions.  For
example, in relation to the holding in the name of Fiduciaire
Ryco, it appeared
that, although those shares were treated as Aston's holding in the 1996 report,
he only had a beneficial interest
in half the shareholding held by that trust,
the remainder being "held by a completely independent trust", in respect of
which Aston
did not know "who the beneficiaries (were) but (he did) know the
family associated with it" were the McMillan interests representing
"precisely
half of what is documented".  
<P>

119   	Aston freely accepted that what was stated in the 1996
report was incorrect in relation to the declaration of his shareholding.
 It
was his evidence that, in the face of his inability to provide precise details
of other interests in the Fiduciaire Ryco shareholding,
Peptech's secretary,
Geoffrey Allan Hilton (Hilton), a partner in the law firm, Henry Davis York,
advised him to treat the whole
of the Fiduciaire Ryco shareholding as his own.
The credibility of Aston has been challenged partly on the basis of this
evidence.
 However, I have had no difficulty in accepting the substance of
Aston's explanation, although I think some unstated motives may
have made the
course taken in relation to the disclosure of his shareholding in the 96 report
more preferable than disclosing details
of the Jersey trust holdings.  The
method of recording those holdings in Jersey trusts or Jersey companies did not
readily lend itself
to the identification of the beneficial interests involved,
where those interests were held in entities identified by various numbers
and
not by names.  
<P>

120   	The evidence established that there was an off market
movement of shares in Fiduciaire Ryco with the McMillan interests being
transferred to a Merrill Lynch nominee entity.  Putting that transfer aside,
there appears to have been a movement on the market
of restricted shares,
beginning in October 1997, of something in excess of 3,800,000.  
<P>

121   	When one compares those transactions with the trading in
Peptech shares between July and the beginning of December 1997,
I think it is
drawing a fairly long bow to relate the deterioration in the price of Peptech
shares to the restricted shares coming
out of escrow or to their disposition.

<P>

122   	In July there were some 4,424,000 shares traded at prices
varying between 44.1 and 50 cents, averaging 46.6 cents.  In August
there were
some 9,598,000 shares traded at an average of 42.9 cents, the price ranging
between 39.5 and 51.4 cents.  In September
 the total was 3,825,000 averaging
37.5 cents, with the price varying between 35.2 and 39.2.  In October the
quantity traded was
6,722,000 at an average of 26.1 cents, the price varying
between a low of 17.5 and the highest price of 34 cents.  In November 4,390,000
shares traded at an average of 18.4 cents, the range being 17.2 up to 19.4.
Finally, in the first few days of December, the trade
totalled 570,000, with an
average of 17.1 cents.  
<P>

123   	In summary there was a total trade of approximately
29,000,000 shares in Peptech between July and November 1997, of which,
a little
over 3,800,000 shares would have been the previously restricted shares.
<P>

124   	I think there is some interest in Merrill Lynch's trading
during that time and that of Baker Young. Throughout that time
Baker Young was
a net buyer of some 4,355,000 shares.  It was a net buyer of shares for all
months except December. Merrill Lynch
was a net buyer of shares in July,
selling 880,000 and buying 1,666,000.  In August, it was a net seller of
2,440,000.  In September
it was a net seller of nearly 300,000.  In October,
again it was a net seller of 524,000, selling at an average of 26.2 cents.  It
was a net buyer of 156,000 shares in November.  It is not possible to link up
those sales with any particular body of shares in Peptech
and no attempt has
been made to identify those particular trades.  However, those sales do not
reflect a mass exodus of restricted
shareholders from their investment in
Peptech.
<P>

125   	On those facts I doubt if any movement in the Peptech
share price during those months should be attributed to either the
existence of
the restricted shares coming out of escrow, or to the disposal of any of those
shares on the market.  
<P>

126   	Leadenhall has developed part of its case on the basis
that Aston had withheld material information from Lebbon in negotiations
relating to the attitude of shareholders of these restricted shares.  Aston had
taken steps, about the time of the allotment agreement,
aimed at batching into
one the various groups of restricted shares which were due to come out of
escrow at different times during
August and September 1997.  The objective was
to effect one entry of the restricted shares onto the market to facilitate the
sale
of restricted shares by those wishing to dispose of their holdings.  He
gave instructions to put in place a mechanism by which the
shares could be
promptly listed upon coming out of escrow.  To the knowledge of Aston, the
McMillans, Shober and, I think, the Bomfords
were shareholders intending to
sell restricted shares once they were released from escrow.  
<P>

127   	In addition, Aston was aware that the shareholders
associated with the Russian institute were under pressure to liquidate
their
interests, due to the harsh economic conditions in which they were operating in
Russia.  That was reflected in their ability
to operate at only half capacity.
However, it was Aston's evidence, which I accept, that he had been in close
contact with the Russian
institute shareholders and was confident of their
loyalty and of their willingness to stay with Peptech.  The evidence I think
disclosed
that Aston's confidence in their expression of loyalty was well
founded. 
<P>

128   	I do not regard any failure to disclose to Lebbon
information of the intention of restricted shareholders to dispose of their
holdings or the steps taken by Peptech to facilitate sale of restricted shares
as significantly adding to Leadenhall's case which
is founded upon Lebbon's
assertion that he was not informed of the existence of the restricted shares
and was provided with misleading
information in the form of the 96 report and
the half yearly report.  The fact that Aston knew there were some holders of
restricted
shares who were intending to sell was not, in my view, of particular
moment nor were his actions in facilitating the listing of those
shares: other
than to underscore the obvious, namely that there was a likelihood that some
holders of restricted shares would be
interested in selling their holdings when
those shares were released from escrow in September 1997.
<P>

129   	It is convenient at this stage to deal with another
aspect of Leadenhall's case that depends upon breach of the Corporations
Law,
and the misuse of insider information by Peptech.  In my view nothing turns on
that cause of action that is not disposed of
by my findings in relation to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> count.  
<P>

130   	Implicit in that proposition is my view that the
existence of the restricted shares and the fact that they were coming out
of
escrow in the third quarter of 1997 were not matters which could be described
as insider information.  They could have been matters
of which Lebbon was
unaware.  
<P>

131   	Clearly, they were not matters unknown in the public
domain.  That much is clear from the broker reports which disclosed
either the
existence or the possibility of the existence of the restricted shares.  The
same may be said of the Peptech announcements
as provided to Lebbon in August
1997.  
<P>

132   	It was argued on behalf of Leadenhall that publication of
a private share broker analysis of Peptech for the purpose of dissemination
of
material to selected clients, no doubt to encourage trades, does not put that
material into the public domain so as to divest
it of the quality of insider
information.  I do not agree.  Lebbon no doubt, had reservations about the
utility of a broker report
of that kind, but it is, I think, beyond argument
that a diligent examination of matters of record would have revealed the
existence
of the restricted shares in much the same way as the broker reports
gleaned that information.  I do not understand it to be suggested
that the
content of the broker reports contained anything in the way of confidential
information relating to Peptech.
<P>

133   	In summary,  I am of the view that the release of the
restricted shares on to the market in the last quarter of 1997 had
no
measurable effect on the Peptech share price.  I think that is so whether one
examines the pattern or volume of trading.   The
volume of trading I have
examined.  The pattern of trading may be seen from the graph of price movement
and volume of trading in
Peptech shares as evidenced by Keene.  
<P>

134   	If an explanation is to be found for the fall in
Peptech's share price from the high of 1993 to the low of 1997 it is to
be
located, in my view, outside of the influence of the existence and release of
the restricted shares from escrow.  The price had
undergone a sustained erosion
from mid-1993 to the end of 1995.  In 1996 there was a correction in mid year
which coincided with
a sharp increase in the volume of trading.  From that
point there was a steady decline, accentuated in October/November 1997.  I
am
not persuaded to associate that decline to the release of the restricted shares
from escrow, particularly having regard to the
long history of decline and the
comparatively insignificant number of restricted shares traded.  Rather, I
think that decline was
due to market forces unrelated to the subject mater of
Peptech's misleading conduct.
<P>

135   	I think that the findings so far made in these reasons
require consideration of three facets of the evidence: 
<P>

(1) Was Lebbon's failure, prior to the allotment agreement, to pick up the
references to the restricted shares in the broker reports
and in passing
references during discussions with Peptech representatives in July 1997 such as
to break the nexus between  Peptech's
misleading reports and the losses
Leadenhall faced on its investment with the collapse of the Peptech share price
?
<P>

(2) If that position is answered "no", what is the effect of my findings
that:
<P>

(a) its release of the restricted shares from escrow had no measurable effect
on the Peptech share price:
<P>

(b) the fall in the share price was due to other unspecified market factors
and
<P>

(c) had he known of the existence of the restricted shares, Lebbon would have
deferred concluding negotiations until a later assessment
could have been made
of the likely effect of the existence of release from escrow of the restricted
shares on the Peptech share price.
<P>

(3) In any event, what is the effect of the substitution agreement?
<P>

136   	I have preferred to address question (3) as subsidiary to
the issues raised in relation to the allotment agreement, subject
to the effect
of the mutual releases given under the substitution agreement.
<P>

137   	As to (1): The essential impediment in Leadenhall's case
is Lebbon's ignorance of the existence of the restricted shares,
notwithstanding references to them in the broker reports and in discussions
with Peptech representatives.  Without that ignorance
the inaccuracies in
Peptech's 96 report and the half yearly report cease to have a misleading
nature.
<P>

138   	While I accept that Lebbon's assessment of Peptech
apportioned secondary importance to the broker reports, I take the view
that a
diligent approach to that assessment would have involved recourse to the broker
reports as a starting point or as background
for the more informative studies
which he commissioned or carried out.
<P>

139   	I do not accept the validity of Lebbon's assertion that,
even had the reference to the restricted shares in the broker reports
come to
his attention prior to the allotment agreement, he would have relied upon the
contents of Peptech's most recent published
reports as discounting the
historical references in the broker reports.
<P>

140   	If the evidence of Lebbon, Keene, Kennedy and Bates is to
be accepted as to the significance to the share market of the release
of the
restricted shares from escrow, then any references in the broker reports to the
possibility of there being some 14,000,000
 shares held in escrow should have
been sufficient to initiate an investigation by Lebbon into that aspect of
Peptech's share structure.
<P>

141   	The same observation applies to the disclosures during
the July 1997 meetings.  In that respect I think one has to proceed
on the
basis that discussions concerning the former Peptech UK shareholders placed
little emphasis on the fact that their shareholdings
were subject to
restrictions under the listing rules.  Even so I fail to see how any such
references could have gone unheeded without
a significant failure on the part
of Lebbon in carrying out a careful assessment of Peptech.
<P>

142   	The conclusion I have come to is that Lebbon, hence,
Leadenhall, should have been alerted to the possible existence of the
restricted shares prior to the allotment agreement.  Once on notice as to the
possibility that the buy out of the Peptech UK shareholders
may have resulted
in the imposition of restrictions on the trading of Peptech shares issued in
connection with that buy out, it would
have taken the simplest enquiries,
either of Peptech, or the ASX, to establish the existence of the restricted
shares.  I think the
correct approach in principle to that situation is to be
found in <i>Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd </i>

<P>

143   	Although I am far from satisfied that the application of
that approach leads to a just conclusion in this case, it is my
view, that the
chain of causation was not broken by the shortcomings of Lebbon in performing a
diligent examination into the affairs
of Peptech prior to the allotment
agreements.
<P>

144   	I accept that Lebbon acted upon the correctness of the
information contained in the 96 report and the half yearly report
and that the
information contained in those reports was materially incorrect.  Lebbon should
have been aware of the existence of
that falsity by due enquiries into the
affairs of Peptech.  On the probabilities, he was not.
<P>

145   	As to (2): I think the correct approach to the assessment
of damages is that followed by me in <i>Trade Practices Commission v
Collings</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20142%20ALR%2043" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 142 ALR 43</a><i> </i>as approved by the Court of Appeal
(<i>Collings Construction v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission

<P>

146   	The application of that approach to damages would not
present a particular difficulty had I accepted the way in which Leadenhall
presented its case, namely, as one based upon the proposition that it would not
have entered into the allotment agreement but for
the misleading conduct of
Peptech.  The conclusion I have reached is that, had Leadenhall been aware of
the existence of the restricted
shares, it would have deferred concluding
negotiations for the allotment of Peptech shares and the taking of options.
<P>

147   	The problem that such a conclusion presents, I think is
compounded by my finding that the release of the restricted shares
from escrow
had no measurable effect on the Peptech share price. 
<P>

148   	One way of approaching that problem is to conclude that
Leadenhall, in the absence of any dumping of the restricted shares
on the
market, would have negotiated an agreement not materially different from the
allotment agreement.  There is considerable justification
for that approach on
the basis of the terms of Lebbon's investor presentations in August 1997 in the
face of known slippage in Peptech's
share price.  Before resolving that
question I think it is preferable to address the issues raised under question
(3).
<P>

149   	As to (3):  One does not get any assistance from the fact
that the parties released each other from the allotment agreement
and replaced
it with the substitution agreement.  I accept Lebbon's evidence that he caused
Leadenhall to enter into the substitution
agreement in circumstances where he
regarded Leadenhall as committed to Peptech under the allotment agreement and
was confronted
with a `take-it-or-leave it' stand by Peptech.
<P>

150   	Peptech has relied upon the mutual releases as a release
of Peptech from the subject claims.  While the words of the release
are wide
enough to embrace the claims brought in these proceedings, in my view, the
terms of the releases should be read down to
express the intention of the
parties to limit the release to possible claims within the contemplation of the
parties.  Clearly, upon
the findings reached in these reasons, that
contemplation did not extend to claims of the nature made in these
proceedings.
<P>

151   	There is a further threshold question raised in relation
to the association of any losses suffered by the plaintiffs with
Peptech's
conduct.  As earlier stated in these reasons, Lebbon acknowledged that in early
August 1997 he received the Peptech announcements
and noted the reference to
the possibility that the shares issued to the Peptech UK shareholders may be
subject to escrow. 
<P>

152   	In addition to that, I think Lebbon has to live with his
rosy description of Peptech as an investment opportunity as at 14
August 1997
in his presentation to prospective investors, notwithstanding Peptech's August
share price drop.  That was an unequivocal
expression  of Lebbon's continued
confidence in the value of an investment in Peptech.
<P>

153   	One has to take Lebbon's word that any connection between
the fall in Peptech's share price and the reference in the Peptech
announcements to the possibility of shares being held in escrow didn't `jag'
with him.  However, I have accepted that evidence and
sought a rational
explanation for Lebbon's failure to relate the two things to his pre-occupation
with preparation for and delivery
of capital city presentations to prospective
investors in Peptech.
<P>

154   	As it happened, in my view, there was no material
connection between the price drop and Peptech's shares coming out of escrow.
The only rational basis for such a connection in August trading would lie in a
market awareness of the impending release of the restricted
shares from escrow.
As to that, I think the following observations should be made:
<P>

(1) It is difficult to reconcile that proposition with Lebbon's case of a
complete unawareness of the existence of the restricted
shares on his part: he
being a highly experienced dealer in shares engaged in a due diligence exercise
into the affairs of Peptech.
 On that view, the market, as with Lebbon, would
be taken as being unaware of the restricted shares.  However, the reality is
that
the existence of the restricted shares was, I think, in the public domain
well prior to the allotment agreement. 
<P>

(2) The August 1997 slide, when seen in the context of Keene's graph, is part
of a general slide that had been afflicting Peptech
shares from mid-1996 and,
before that, more dramatically from early 1993.  The continued slide in Peptech
share prices after August
1997, in my view, should not be associated with the
disposal of the restricted shares on the market, but should be attributed to
other market forces.
<P>

(3) In my view, any awareness by the market of the effect of the impending
release of the restricted shares would have been built
into the Peptech share
price by August 1997.
<P>

155   	The conclusions I have come to are that the awareness by
Lebbon of the reference in the Peptech announcements to restricted
shares
coupled with his failure to pursue that topic before causing Leadenhall to
enter into the substitution agreement, while representing
significant
carelessness on Lebbon's part, should not be treated as breaking the chain of
causation between Peptech's misleading
conduct and any losses suffered by the
plaintiffs: that the picture of Peptech as an investment opportunity in
Lebbon's presentation
to prospective investors should be treated as Lebbon's
confirmed view of the worth of Peptech, notwithstanding the August 1997 fall
in
Peptech's share price: that although the substitution agreement was entered
into on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, it probably reflected
Lebbon's continued
view of the value of investment in Peptech: that the losses suffered by the
plaintiffs were losses which would
have been sustained whether or not there
existed restricted shares in Peptech's share structure.
<P>

156   	The way in which the plaintiffs' losses have been
calculated, I think, lends emphasis to that last mentioned finding: Leadenhall
retained, at a cost of $352,129.08,  712,903 shares of the 1,612,903 shares
allotted to it under the substitution agreement and sold
those securities
between 29 December 1997 and 16 January 1998 for $146,723.12, yielding a loss
of $205,405.96.  Advent took up the
balance of the allotment, 900,000 shares at
a cost of  $414,000 which were sold over a period, from 30 September 1997 to 5
February
1998 for a return of  $236,288.75, resulting in a loss of $177,711.25.
Noble acquired 1,612,903 options from Leadenhall at an exercise
price of 62
cents for the cost of $233,870.92, which it sold off the market to a related
corporation, Chi Investments Proprietary
Limited (Chi) on 27 May 1998 for
$16,129.03, namely at 1 cent per option.  Noble had also acquired from
Leadenhall 403,225 options
exercisable at $1 which it also sold on 27 May 1998
to Chi for a consideration of $403.23, resulting in a loss to Noble of
$217,338.66.
 One has to ask why those transactions are the measure of the loss
of Leadenhall and its related corporations.  To take a glaring
example, after
the options were in the hands of Chi, the evidence disclosed that the Peptech
share price rose to 98 cents, without
Chi exercising its option rights.  That
also raises the question why the date of sale between related corporations
should be the
point of measurement of loss.  
<P>

157   	While it may be said that the losses claimed by
Leadenhall would not have been suffered "but for the wrongful act or omission"
of Peptech, that cannot be said to be the test of causation.  The `but for'
test ignores the complexity of some of the factors making
up a relevant cause.
The `but for' test is more in the nature of a pre-condition test: or  a
"negative criterion of causation" (<i>March v Stramare (E. &amp; M.H.) Pty Ltd

<P>

158   	As earlier stated, I am not satisfied that Leadenhall
would not have entered into an allotment agreement had it known of
the
existence of the restricted shares.  I am satisfied that an allotment
agreement, possibly of a modified form, would have been
negotiated and,
further, that losses sustained by the plaintiffs were of a kind that would have
ensued regardless of the existence
of the restricted shares and of their
release from escrow.  There may have been a reduced consideration negotiated
for the shares
and options under such an agreement.  However no attempt has
been made to quantify any such reduced consideration.  In my view, Lebbon's
August 1997 presentation to prospective investors would indicate that any
reduction would not have been significant.
<P>

159   	I think a distinction is to be drawn between the losses
associated with the effect of market forces on Peptech's share prices
following
the substitution agreement and the losses associated with the "inherent
weakness" of a business, the purchase of which
has been induced by misleading
conduct.  The latter class of losses was the subject of consideration by Wilcox
J at first instance
in <i>Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd v Henjo Investments Pty
Ltd </i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20ATPR%2040%2d822" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) ATPR  40-822.</a>  The distinction lies, I think, in the area
of remoteness of the losses sought to be recovered.  In the <u>Collins
Marrickville</u> type case, damages resulting from the susceptibility of the
subject business to the vicissitudes of the economic climate in which
the
business has to operate are perceived to be not too remote,  even though not
directly related to the subject matter of the misleading
conduct.
<P>

160   	Once it is concluded in these proceedings that Leadenhall
would have deferred concluding negotiations and negotiated an allotment
agreement at a later time, the losses claimed by the plaintiffs fall into a
category of losses that would have been incurred regardless
of the existence of
the restricted shares: save only the extent to which there may have been a
reduced consideration agreed upon.
 In my view, there is no basis upon which a
finding could be made as to the amount of any such reduced consideration other
than by
having regard to the glowing post 14 August 1997 presentation by Lebbon
of Peptech as an investment opportunity.  On that basis I
think one is entitled
to conclude that any reduction in consideration would not have been
significant.
<P>

161   	It is for these reasons that, in my view, Leadenhall's
case fails and, with it, the respective cases of Advent and Noble.
 It was not
submitted otherwise.
<P>

162   	For these reasons the plaintiffs' claims are dismissed
and judgment given for the defendant.  The plaintiffs are to pay the
defendant's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

163   	In the event that I am in error and that the plaintiffs
are entitled to damages, I am of the view that the following is the
correct
approach to the assessment of losses: assuming that the plaintiffs are entitled
to losses attributed to the fall in Peptech
shares, regardless of the market
factors affecting that drop in price.
<P>

164   	As earlier stated I do not regard the measure of damages
to be applied is that as applied in <i>Potts v Miller. </i>  I think the
correct approach, on the assumption that Leadenhall would have abandoned the
pursuit of Peptech shares and options,
once it knew of the existence of the
restricted shares, is to assess the losses sustained in the reasonable disposal
of those shares
following ascertainment of that fact. 
<P>

165   	On that basis the shares were disposed of, in the case of
Leadenhall, between 29 December 1997 and 16 January 1998 at market
price and by
Advent between 20 September 1997 to 5 February 1998.  Although those sales of
Advent were commenced prior to Lebbon
becoming aware of the existence of the
restricted shares, it is not suggested that this premature sale increased the
losses that
would have been suffered through a post November 1997 sale.
Clearly, the period of disposal of those shares is otherwise reasonable
and
made at market price.  
<P>

166   	However, I think the losses on the disposal of shares
should be measured against the stated consideration for those shares
under the
substitution agreement, namely, at 62 cents per share.  In theory, I do not
think it is open to Leadenhall to advance a
case based upon the arrangements it
entered into with Noble and Advent, in quite the way presented.  Under those
arrangements Leadenhall
sold 900,000 shares to Advent at 46 cents per share and
disposed of the options to Noble at a price per option of 14 cents, in the
case
of the options with an exercise price of 62 cents per option, and at a price of
2 cents per option in the case of those options
exercisable at $1.00 per
option.  The total price of those transactions was $233,870.92.  Leadenhall
appropriated the difference
between the $1,000,000 acquisition price of the
1,612,903 shares allotted under the substitution agreement and the total of
$647,870.92
paid to it by Advent and Noble, namely $352,129.08, to the cost to
it of the balance of the shares allotted to it under the substitution
agreement, namely 712,903 shares.  That happens to work out at a little over 49
cents per share.  
<P>

167   	I am satisfied that the allotted shares and options
granted to Leadenhall under the substitution agreement were dealt with
in those
ways as between the three related corporations.  However, the way in which the
substitution agreement was structured, namely
a striking of the acquisition
price at 62 cents per share, I think, requires first that the proceeds of sale
of the shares by Leadenhall
after the substitution agreement be measured
against the $1,000,000 acquisition price paid under that agreement.  On that
basis there
was a loss on the sale of the shares of $616,988.13.  Against that,
Leadenhall would be required to allow the proceeds of on-sale
to Advent and
Noble amounting to $647,870.92 and the proceeds of further sale of the balance
of 712,903 shares, namely, $146,732.12,
resulting in a loss of $205,405.96.

<P>

168   	Mathematically there is nothing to criticise in the
Leadenhall calculation, which may be described as a shorthand method
of
computation of damages.  I have presented it in a different way not, I trust,
for any pedantic reasons, but to keep at the forefront
of the analysis the true
nature of the terms of the substitution agreement as one proceeding at an
acquisition price of 62 cents
per share: a deliberate structure to imbed in the
substitution agreement, as in the allotment agreement, an allotment at a
premium
of between 12 cents and 16 cents per share.
<P>

169   	Otherwise, the method of calculation of losses by each of
Leadenhall, Advent and Noble in the sale of shares and options
is
mathematically correct in the end result.
<P>

170   	The way in which the options have been treated by the
plaintiffs presents something of an anomaly, in my view.  In the first
place,
the on-sale of the options to Noble, in one sense is a windfall to Leadenhall
in the context of the terms of the allotment
and the substitution agreements
which ascribed the consideration to the allotment of Peptech shares.  
<P>

171   	Further, the sale by Noble to Chi has an air of unrealism
about it: being a transfer between related corporations without
any apparent
commercial necessity on the part of Noble to enter into the transaction.  The
anomaly lies in the potential of one of
Lebbon's corporations to benefit from
the granting of the options without any recognition of that benefit being
ascribed to Peptech
under the substitution agreement: unless the $16,532.26
sale price of the options to Chi is said to reflect that benefit.  
<P>

172   	While I consider the evidentiary basis of Leadenhall's
valuation of those options to be sketchy, Kennedy's attempt to challenge
that
valuation was not notably successful.  Given the depressed market in which the
sale of the options was negotiated and the comparatively
high exercise price of
the options, I doubt if any sophisticated analysis of the value of those
options would be a particularly rewarding
exercise.  Accordingly, I would
accept that sale price of the options as a reasonable one.
<P>

173   	A further head of damage, consisting of lost opportunity
costs, is based upon the financials of the plaintiffs, the investment
policy of
Leadenhall and the trading activities of Noble and Advent.  The opportunity
cost is calculated on a weighted average return
on investment of 56.3% after
adjustment by way of exclusion of the losses represented by the Peptech
transaction and after allowance
made for receipt of proceeds on sale of the
securities.  The rate of return is a weighted average of the respective rates
of return
of the plaintiffs as disclosed in the plaintiffs' financials for year
ended 30 June 1998.
<P>

174   	As a mathematical exercise I do not understand the
defendant to challenge the accuracy of that calculation.  However, I have
some
difficulty with the plaintiffs' approach.  In the case of Advent, the evidence
was that its business was to "invest and trade
in listed shares".  The
financials for year ended 30 June 1998 show that it purchased securities to the
value of $1,362,440.83 and
sold securities to the value of $1,416,829.03.
There  does not appear to be much sign of investment  in those activities.  The
realised
surplus of $152,796.49 was used to derive a rate of return of 34.3%
(before adjustment for the Peptech transaction) on the value
of the opening
portfolio of  $445,417.43.  I notice that the pattern of trading was similar to
that of 1997, although of a much reduced
order in 1997, with purchases of
$966,118 and sales of $898,840.  The "Opening Listed Investments" was $151,393.
I also note that
interest paid in 1998 was $174,689.61 as against $9,633 in
1997.  The 1998 interest expense did not appear to reflect related corporation
transactions and left open the indication that it may have been related to the
trading activities of Advent.
<P>

175   	The notion involved in the opportunity cost calculation,
that the funds applied to the Peptech transaction, would have been
applied to
further increased trading activities, I think fits uncomfortably into the
increased trading pattern reflected in the comparison
of the 1997 and 1998
figures.  
<P>

176   	Further, I think the speculative nature of the Peptech
transaction is not reflected in the method of calculation of opportunity
costs.
When added to my view that the slide in Peptech share prices was the product of
market forces unrelated to the misleading
conduct of Peptech, I would not be
persuaded to allow opportunity costs to Advent.
<P>

177   	In the case of Noble: Its business was described as
investing, predominantly, in listed shares.  The opportunity cost has
been
calculated by reference to a surplus of $363,599.81, before adjustment for the
Peptech transaction, as disclosed in its share
portfolio.  I have been unable
to reconcile that figure with the financials of Noble for the year ended 30
June 1998.  In particular,
the "Investment - Securities" in listed
Corporations is shown as standing at $1,384,213 as at 30 June 1998 and
$1,203,484 as at 30
June 1997.  That value is stated in the accounts as being
the "net market value" and that "movements in the net market value of assets
are recognised in the Operating Statement in the periods in which they occur."

<P>

178   	In note 2 to the accounts, movement in net market values
of investments is shown as including "Investments Realised During
 the
financial year - Securities in Listed Corporations", for the 1998 year,
$363,600 and for the 1997 year $606,907 giving a net
amount of $258,000 in 1998
and $13,146 in 1997.  
<P>

179   	Had I taken a different view of the reasonableness of
including the opportunity cost in the assessment of damages I would
have
required clarification of the financials and the associated share portfolio of
Noble before being satisfied as to the reasonableness
of the plaintiffs'
computations of a reasonable rate of return.  For the reasons earlier advanced,
I am not persuaded that opportunity
costs should be allowed.
<P>

180   	Leadenhall's policy in relation to the surplus funds was
described as one of investing in listed shares or of prepayment
of management
fees to Noble.  Its principal business activities "were the provision of
corporate advisory and management consulting
services and trading investments".
Its operating revenue for the year ended 30 June 1998 was $1,264,732.  That was
made up principally
of "Professional services revenue" of $616,300 and of
"Gross proceeds from sale of investments", in the sum of $608,889.  The
principal
difference from the 1997 year lay in the gross proceeds from sale of
investments amounting only to $176,434.  The rate of return
used in the
calculation of opportunity cost was based upon a "realised surplus" of
$58,345.82 on an opening portfolio value of $221,437.94.
 As in the case of
Noble, I would have preferred clarification of Leadenhall's financials had I
taken a different view of the plaintiffs'
entitlement to opportunity costs.
<P>

181   	Leadenhall also claimed $327,901 by way of costs
associated with its investigation of Peptech and in relation to the subject
transaction with Peptech.  As in the case of the opportunity costs, I do not
understand the defendant to challenge the mathematical
correctness of the
calculations of the "Associated Costs".  In my view, Leadenhall would have been
entitled to those costs, save
for the pre-allotment agreement costs which in my
view would have been incurred, for the most part, in any event.  There is no
satisfactory
evidentiary basis for isolating any pre-allotment agreement costs
as falling outside that classification of excluded costs. 
<P>

182   	A final area of dispute relates to Leadenhall's release
of the on-sale investor from the on-sale.  I have been provided with
competing
calculations as to the effect of that release: Peptech contending that it
involved self-inflicted losses upon Leadenhall
that should not be visited on
Peptech.  Clearly, in the events prevailing at the time of the release,  there
was no obligation on
the part of Leadenhall to release the on-sale investor.
Leadenhall advanced calculations in support of a submission that the release
involved no detriment to Peptech in Leadenhall's assessment of its losses.  It
is not necessary, in my view, to resolve that different
methodology of
calculation of the effect of the release.  Had Leadenhall been entitled to
damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 82</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> it would have been entitled to
damages assessed on the basis of the reasonableness of its release of the
on-sale investor.  A contrary
approach would result in Leadenhall being
entitled to damages for Peptech's misleading conduct and the on-sale investor
held to a
bargain, on Leadenhall's case, structured on that misleading conduct.
In my view, the release by Leadenhall of the on-sale investor
was a reasonable
commercial act and called for no adjustment to the assessment of damages that
Leadenhall may have incurred by the
conduct of Peptech.
