<u>10147/1999</u>	<u>GLENN MICHEAL JAMES PHILLIPS v DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND
TRAINING formerly known as DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL EDUCATION SCHOOL FURNITURE
COMPLEX for and on behalf of THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 22 January
1999.  The plaintiff seeks relief pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 151A</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">151D</a> (2) of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).
<P>

2  	The plaintiff has sworn an affidavit.  His solicitor (Mr Parsons)
has sworn a number of affidavits.  The affidavits annex copy
expert reports
(including reports from Drs Sundaraj and Benanzio) and other documentation.
The plaintiff has been cross-examined.
 The defendant has not read any
affidavit.  It has not tendered any documents.
<P>

3  	I do not propose to embark on an exhaustive recitation of the
relevant facts.  It suffices to merely mention some of them.
<P>

4  	On 25 August 1990, the plaintiff suffered personal injury.  He
was then employed by the defendant as a maintenance officer.
 The injury
occurred whilst he was working at Pendle Hill High School and installing a tool
cabinet in a metal workroom.  It slipped
off a support bar and landed on his
left knee.
<P>

5  	The accident was reported and a compensation claim was made.
Pain persisted in his left knee.  On or about 14 February 1991,
his condition
was diagnosed as a type of Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.  Thereafter, he
underwent lumber sympathetic block treatment
and a surgical lumbar
sympathectomy.  Whilst this treatment gave him relief his symptoms did not
completely resolve.  In about July
1992, he experienced an exacerbation of pain
when receiving physiotherapy.  He then underwent a series of guanethidine
blocks.  The
symptoms then appeared to improve and he returned to part-time
work from home.
<P>

6  	In 1992, his claim for compensation was settled and he accepted
payment of compensation under the Act.  There is no dispute
that there has been
an election to claim permanent loss compensation in respect of the injury in
the sense required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151A</a> (3) (b) of the Act.
<P>

7  	He was made redundant by his employer and thereafter he obtained
a new job as a driving instructor in 1995.  He continued with
this work for
about a year.
<P>

8  	In 1997, there was a deterioration in his condition.  The
problems in his left leg flared up.  The pain spread from his leg
to other
parts of his body.  He experienced symptoms in his right knee.  In 1998, his
condition worsened and there is expert evidence
to support the view that the
Reflex Sympathetic Distrophy has spread to other parts of his body (including
his right knee).
<P>

9  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 151A</a> stipulates that a person to whom compensation is
payable under the Act in respect of an injury is not entitled to both permanent
loss compensation in respect of that injury and damages in respect of the
injury from the employer  liable to pay that compensation.
 The section
requires an election to be made.  When an election is made, it is irrevocable
except that an election to claim permanent
loss compensation may be revoked
with the leave of the Court.
<P>

10  	The power to grant leave is conferred by subsection (5).  The
power may be exercised when the threshold requirements of (a),
(b) and (c) are
satisfied.
<P>

11  	In this case, (a) is not in dispute.  There is evidence which
satisfies (b).  Also, there is evidence which satisfies (c).
 In respect of
(c), whilst the defendant does not concede that this requirement has been
satisfied, it takes the stance that in the
light of the evidence and recent
authority (<u>Brennan Taylor v State of New south Wales</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/159.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA 159)</a>
it is placed in a position where there is nothing that can be said in
opposition on the point.  In my view, this approach fairly
presents the
position in which the defendant is placed.
<P>

12  	In <u>Taylor</u>, it was said that:-
<P>

"Assuming without deciding the field of knowledge described above, the effect
of para (c) is that it must be asked whether a reasonable
person knowing what
was known or ought to have been known to the worker would expect the further
deterioration in fact suffered by
the worker as something more probable than
not.  If the answer is no, para (c) is satisfied."
<P>

13  	I am satisfied that the threshold requirements have been met.
Nothing was put by way of opposition on discretionary grounds.
 Accordingly, I
grant leave to the plaintiff to revoke the election.
<P>

14  	Whilst the granting of this relief, removes the bar to the
making of a claim for damages brought about by the making of the
election,
there remains the problem that arises by reason of the time limit prescribed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151D</a> (2).  The time limit for commencement of proceedings against the
employer for damages has expired.  The plaintiff now also needs
leave to
commence proceedings under that provision.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 151D</a> (2) confers a
discretionary power to grant leave.  The power is exercised having regard to
the relevant circumstances of the case
before the Court and so that justice can
be best served between the parties.  The onus rests with the applicant.
<P>

15  	Whilst there may be many relevant discretionary considerations,
in this case the defendant has advanced one matter  only (that
of prejudice) in
opposition to the granting of leave.
<P>

16  	There was an early reporting of the accident.  The plaintiff has
been on compensation.  The defendant has had the opportunity
to have him
medically examined.  It is not suggested that it is prejudiced in any way in
relation to questions of quantum.  The only
suggested matter of prejudice is
said to relate to questions of liability.
<P>

17  	The defendant has not placed any evidence before the Court.
There is no evidence of any actual prejudice.  The defendant merely
asserts
what it describes as a general prejudice which may arise from delay itself.
The defendant relies on what was said in <u>Brisbane South Regional Health
Authority v Taylor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR 866</a> (in which McHugh J referred to
"presumptive prejudice" that arises from delay itself p. 873).  The defendant
has made specific mention
of the fact that memories can be expected to have
faded over the years.
<P>

18  	There may well be presumptive prejudice. If there is, I do not
consider that it is a matter which should be accorded great
weight.  I do not
consider that the defendant is placed in a position where it cannot fairly
defend itself.  It seems to me that
a fair trial can still be had. The
defendant has had the opportunity to take statements from relevant witnesses.
It is not said that
relevant documentation has been destroyed or lost.
<P>

19  	In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that justice
is best served by the granting of leave.  In my view, the relevant
onus has
been satisfied.
<P>

20  	I grant leave to the plaintiff to revoke the election made to
claim permanent loss compensation in respect of his injury. 
I grant leave to
the plaintiff to commence court proceedings for damages in respect of that
injury.  The proceedings are to be commenced
by the filing of a Statement of
Claim within 28 days.  The costs of the Summons are to be costs in those
proceedings.
