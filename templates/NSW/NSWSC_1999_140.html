<b><u>JUDGMENT</u> - </b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is the trial of the issue of liability only in a
claim for damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiff
on
25 April 1986.  At about 9.30 pm on that day the plaintiff was driving his
Holden Rodeo utility truck north on the Mount Lindsay
Highway north of
Tenterfield, and shortly after crossing the bridge over Branch Creek his
vehicle left the roadway, collided with
an embankment at the side of the road,
overturned end over end and came to rest on its hood with the plaintiff outside
the vehicle
some four to five feet away.  He was taken to Tenterfield Hospital
where he was found to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.229 grams
of alcohol
per 100 millilitres of blood, but the following day it was discovered that a
linkage to the left hand front wheel steering
had fractured, and the major
issue in the case has been whether it fractured before the vehicle left the
road, thus causing the accident,
or whether it fractured in the vehicle's
collision with the embankment, thus being a result and not the cause of the
collision. 
As a result of the accident the plaintiff was rendered unconscious
and has since been a paraplegic.
<P>

2	The defendants are respectively the company from whom the plaintiff purchased
the vehicle on 26 May 1985 (eleven months before
the accident) and who serviced
it in the meantime, and the company which was the importer and general
distributor of the vehicle.
 The defendants contend that if the steering link
failed before the vehicle left the road, the plaintiff was nevertheless guilty
of contributory negligence in driving whilst intoxicated.  A further allegation
of contributory negligence (not wearing a seat belt)
was withdrawn during the
hearing.
<P>

3	A number of experts have been called by each party, but a lot of their
opinions depend on the nature of the marks on the road,
the location on the
vehicle of the tyre exhibit R and the terrain where the vehicle left the
eastern edge of the bitumen, which matters
generally depend on the
unsatisfactory and inconsistent recollection of a number of witnesses, about
ten to eleven years after the
event, most of whom made no contemporaneous
record, or on inferences drawn from reported sightings of debris, most of which
cannot
be positively identified as coming from the suspect vehicle.
<P>

4	The plaintiff purchased the vehicle in May 1985 from the first defendant and
prior to the evening in question never had any trouble
with the steering.  He
has no memory of the accident or the day thereof, except that he intended to go
to greyhound races at Casino.
<P>

5	Mrs King said that on 25 April 1986, her husband left home about 10.30 am to
go to the races with a friend of his.  She later
met him at a hotel in
Tenterfield at about twenty to eight in the evening where they remained about
an hour, during which time she
had two half scotches and her husband had two
middies of beer.  When they left the hotel in their respective vehicles he
seemed sober.
 She followed and last saw his vehicle going down towards the
bridge, where she temporarily lost sight of it.
<P>

6	After the bridge, she looked across and saw his vehicle on the right hand
side of the road completely upside down, with its headlights
still on pointing
back to town, she raced across to the vehicle, and then went straight home,
rang the hotel and went back to the
scene.  She did not know if the police,
ambulance etc were there when she got back.  Her husband was taken to
Tenterfield Hospital
and the next day was transferred to Brisbane.
<P>

7	She said that Ron Bartrim rang her two days later and told her he had been
and inspected the vehicle and it had a steering failure,
but the NRMA Insurance
claim form May 1986, which she signed although it was not filled in by her,
made no reference to steering
failure, and she purchased a new Rodeo on 13 June
1986 from the first defendant, although by then she believed her husband had
crashed
because of defective steering.  I found her answers on these matters
unconvincing.  Moreover, when the insurance claim was rejected
by NRMA
Insurance early in 1987 (in the letter, apparently erroneously, dated 3
September 1987), the Kings' then solicitors, Stuart
Cook &amp; Braham wrote to
the insurance company pointing out there had been no charge or admission re
alcohol and asking that the
refusal be reviewed, but once again there was no
reference to steering failure (exhibit 29).  Mrs King then changed solicitors
and
instructed Cope, Norton &amp; Sedgwick who wrote on 13 March 1987 (exhibit
30) that the vehicle left the road "as a result of a blackout
caused due to
severe nervous strain and exhaustion during the height of the fruit picking
season," although Mrs King denied giving
such instructions.  Again there was no
reference to steering failure.
<P>

8	All this suggests that the Kings had not been told by Mr Bartrim or anyone
else of the separation of the steering link until after
the vehicle was
returned to them in about April 1987.
<P>

9	Mount Lindsay Road runs generally in a north/south direction.  As the
plaintiff was travelling on the evening in question it descends
in a straight
run of about two hundred metres to a concrete bridge over Branch Creek after
which it commences a sweeping right hand
uphill curve.
<P>

10	On each side of the bridge there is (and was) a white post and cyclone wire
fence which continues for about thirty metres from
the end of the concrete
bridge.  These fences are splayed in the sense that where they join the rails
of the bridge they come virtually
up to the edge of the bitumen, then gradually
recede from the bitumen giving way to a shoulder on each side of it.  It was
said that
the road is straight for fifty to sixty metres north of the end of
the bridge (per Newell), but the appearance of this may be deceptive,
and some
of the photographs (particularly exhibit N) give the impression that the curve
and rise commence very shortly after the
northern end of the bridge.
<P>

11	On the right hand side for traffic travelling north (or eastern side) there
is a driveway entering just north of the bridge with
a splayed intersection,
the northern side of which constitutes an embankment about four feet high, and
some distance further to the
north there develops a low ditch or gutter at the
edge of the shoulder, beyond which ditch or gutter there is an embankment, and
beyond that to the east the terrain is rough and uneven.  As one travels
further north away from the bridge it would seem that the
land on the eastern
side becomes more uneven (or did so, because there was evidence of some changes
since the accident, although
not very clear).  Beyond this area there are (as
can be seen in the photographs) some rocky outcrops.
<P>

12	The scene was visited on the evening of the accident by the then Senior
Constable Newell (since retired).  He found the plaintiff's
vehicle lying
upturned on its hood facing in a generally south-westerly direction in the
rough area of ground on the right hand (eastern)
side of the road.  The
plaintiff, who was unconscious, was outside and about two to three metres away
from the vehicle.  He also
saw tyre and gouge marks, and after the vehicle had
been towed away he stepped out measurements of these various features, and the
following day confirmed them with a tape measure.
<P>

13	He recorded his findings in his police notebook, subsequently in an
Occurrence Pad entry made at 12.30 am the following morning
and later in at
least two (and probably more) Traffic Collision Reports (exhibits M and 6).
<P>

14	In particular he found a tyre mark on the left or western shoulder
commencing about twenty five metres north of Branch Creek
and running north for
about twenty six metres at an angle, taking it further away from the edge of
the bitumen.  He also saw two
heavy black tyre marks running across the bitumen
at an angle of about forty to fifty degrees to the mark in the shoulder, and he
thought the more northern of these marks was a continuation of the wheel mark
on the shoulder.  These marks ran about fifteen metres
from the left hand edge
of the bitumen, across the road and the eastern shoulder (although not
continuous on the shoulder) and left
a gouge mark in the embankment beyond the
eastern shoulder which in turn was about three to four metres from where the
vehicle was
resting.
<P>

15	He recorded in the Occurrence Pad that "when about 25 metres north of Branch
Creek (the vehicle) veered onto the Gravel shoulder
on the western edge of the
road, travelled on the shoulder for 26 metres.  The vehicle then veered to the
incorrect side, of the
roadway, collided with an earth bank and overturned."
In his P4 reports, he recorded the place of the accident as ninety metres north
of Branch Creek (meaning where the vehicle came to rest).
<P>

16	His measurements were challenged and he agreed that on visits to the site on
20 August and 7 November 1997 with respective defendants'
experts and lawyers
he had indicated a site further north, and he agreed that debris consistent
with parts of the motor vehicle was
found at the place he indicated on those
occasions.  He also agreed he had changed his mind on this issue at least
twice.  He was
retired from the Police Force with hypertension, anxiety and
depression, and agreed his memory is not good and he was relying on
the records
he made shortly after the events in question.
<P>

17	His recollection was that the vehicle had left the bitumen on to the left
hand side shoulder some distance past the end of the
fence, but conceded that
his measurements could not be correct if the fence extended thirty metres north
of the bridge.  He agreed
that the spot he had shown to solicitors was one
hundred and twenty five metres from the northern end of the bridge.  He did not
record, and did not see, any gouge marks on the bitumen.
<P>

18	Graham Foan is and was an automotive engineer, and at the time of the
accident was the general service manager of David Booth
Ford at Tenterfield
which was the NRMA agent.  On the morning of 26 April 1986 he saw the
plaintiff's vehicle in the NRMA compound
and he noticed it had bodywork damage
to the cabin, bonnet and front panel areas.  His attention was drawn to the
fact that the two
front tyres were off the rims and deflated and the left front
rim had a dent in it.  He identified in Court the wheels which he said
were on
the various hubs at the time (exhibits Q, R, S, T and U) but the identification
of these wheels was disputed.  He also identified
what he described as scuff
marks on the outside shoulder of the tyres he said were on the left (exhibit Q)
and right (exhibit R)
front wheels.
<P>

19	He next saw the vehicle on 10 July 1987 when he went to the plaintiff's
property to help Dr McLeod remove the steering components
and the front wheels,
and on that occasion, he said, some of wheels were on different hubs.
<P>

20	He again saw the vehicle in September 1997 at the plaintiff's premises in
company with two of the plaintiff's expert witnesses,
Mr Cusack and Dr Gilmore.
The two tyres which had been on the front of the vehicle in August 1987
(exhibits Q and T) were against
a wall being photographed, but Mr Foan spoke to
the others and the spare in the tray (exhibit R), which he believed had been on
the
front offside hub the day after the accident, was also photographed.
<P>

21	On 26 April 1986 (the morning after the accident) Mr Foan also noticed that
the left hand steering tie rod ends had come apart.
 He pointed out the inside
of the ball housing and the ring of indentations and expressed the view that it
had not been crimped properly.
 After examining the vehicle he went to the area
where the accident had occurred.  His observations were somewhat different to
those
of Mr Newell and are recorded on a plan (exhibit V) drawn only recently.
In particular, although he observed a tyre mark on the western
shoulder about
twenty five metres north of the bridge, he did not consider it was related to
the plaintiff's accident.
<P>

22	He did say however that he observed light black marks on the northbound side
of the  road about fifty metres north of the bridge
which stretched north for
about ten and eight metres respectively and were the width of a vehicle track
apart, ie the distance between
the two front wheels.  Then immediately to the
north of these light black marks was a gap of about a foot and then gouge marks
in
the bitumen at about a fifty five to sixty degree angle to the light black
marks, the gouge marks giving way to heavy black marks
across the bitumen to
the east where a guidepost was flattened across the drain or ditch at the
eastern edge of the shoulder, and
on to where the plaintiff's vehicle had
apparently ended up.  He estimated the final resting place of the plaintiff's
vehicle at
seventy to eighty metres north of the bridge and twenty metres from
the eastern edge of the bitumen.
<P>

23	He described a subsequent occasion (October-November 1986) when he attended
the location in relation to another two incidents
of vehicles leaving the
roadway.  These vehicles finished up approximately fifty metres further north
than the plaintiff's vehicle
and is a possible explanation for the location of
debris in that area some years later.
<P>

24	He said that east of the bitumen there were gouge marks in the shoulder
(described here as the gravel bank) between the bitumen
and the ditch or
gutter.  These were a track width apart.  There were no gouge marks in the
ditch but on the eastern side of the
ditch there were further gouge marks in
the granite loam running roughly north-south, one about six feet long and
probably a foot
wide and it was only about a foot deep as if it had just taken
the top of the bank off; and the other one east of that about five
feet long,
about a foot wide and about three inches deep.  These marks were about two feet
north of the water drain.  He indicated
where the vehicle came to rest in
photographs eleven and twelve of exhibit N and also stood in the place in
photographs thirteen
and fourteen to Dr Gilmore's report (exhibit K) of 21
October 1997.  His opinion, based on the presence of two as opposed to four
tyre marks, was that there had been no braking by the vehicle.
<P>

25	Mr Jupe was the tow truck operator who went to retrieve the vehicle which he
said was about forty to fifty feet (twelve to fifteen
metres) east of the
roadway and about fifty to sixty metres north of the bridge although he could
not be sure, and he had previously
told the first defendant's solicitors he
could not remember where the vehicle was.
<P>

26	Messrs Bartrim and Conroy visited the site the following day and also made
observations of the site.  Mr Bartrim said that thirty
metres north of the
bridge he observed wheel marks on the roadway which ran approximately a further
thirty metres veering to the
left, the left one on the gravel a short distance,
and then veered right across the road at about sixty to seventy degrees and
which
finished up in the ditch.  He said it could be seen where the tyres had
left the bank and, by reference to grass knocked down and
glass fragments,
where the vehicle had come to rest, which he placed at about eighty to eighty
five metres north of the bridge. 
On the other hand Mr Conroy said that he saw
tyre marks on the bitumen going straight up the hill about fifty to sixty
metres long
which then veered to the right at an angle of about seventy degrees
and which continued across the road into a culvert leading to
flattened grass
on the eastern side about seven to eight metres from the edge of the road.
<P>

27	In the second defendant's case Mrs Parker, Mrs Sullivan and Miss Hickey gave
evidence.  The latter two had been travelling past
shortly after the accident
and had seen the plaintiff's vehicle overturned.  Eleven years later they
indicated to the defendant's
solicitor the place where they saw it at a place
further north (and therefore further away from the bridge) than indicated by
the
plaintiff's witnesses.  Miss Hickey is the only person who claims the
headlights were facing away from Tenterfield.  Mrs Parker is
and was an owner
of an adjoining property and on the evening of the accident, apparently after
the vehicle had been towed away, walked
to her boundary to check the fence and
by moonlight (without any other light) saw on the other side of the fence an
area of flattened
grass.  This was about fifty yards north of the boundary of
the adjoining property and approximately one hundred to one hundred and
fifty
metres north of the bridge.
<P>

28	Finally Mr Dunn (North Coast Appraisers) went to the area with Mrs King on
July 1987 whom he says indicated where the vehicle
was turned over (although
Mrs King denied this) and he also noted in the area that a guide post on the
western side had been gouged,
which post was one hundred and forty five metres
north of the bridge.
<P>

29	There are a number of differences in the evidence of the plaintiff's
witnesses.  They generally describe tyre marks running northerly
on or just off
the western side of the bitumen for about twenty to thirty metres followed by a
sharp angled curve fifty to sixty
degrees (or at least seventy degrees in the
case of Mr Conroy) to the right, running off the eastern edge of the bitumen,
across
the gravel shoulder and into the ditch or gutter on the eastern side.
Some of them saw gouge marks in the embankment on the eastern
side of the ditch
and they placed the vehicle (either because they saw it or saw flattened grass
and debris) east of the ditch seven
to eight metres east of the eastern edge of
the bitumen, although Mr Jupe placed it forty to fifty feet (ten to twelve
metres) east
of the bitumen.
<P>

30	They all placed it about seventy to ninety metres north of the bridge.
Messrs Jupe and Conroy saw no marks on the western gravel
and, although Mr Foan
saw the mark on the gravel, he did not believe it belonged to the plaintiff's
vehicle.  Mr Foan was the only
one to describe gouge marks on the bitumen and
there are other variations, mainly in respect of estimates of distance; and in
respect
of distance I accept the evidence of Mr Newell who is the only one who
stepped out and later measured and recorded distances.  I
have not overlooked
the evidence of the defendants' witnesses, but none of them visited the site in
the days following the accident,
but were seeking to recall the precise
location eleven years later.
<P>

31	Accordingly I find that approximately twenty five metres north of the
northern end of the bridge the plaintiff's vehicle went
towards the left or
western edge of the bitumen and its left hand wheels onto the gravel shoulder,
and about thirty metres further
north the vehicle veered sharply to the right,
across the roadway and eastern shoulder hitting the embankment at the eastern
side
of the ditch which caused it to turn end over end and it came to rest
bottom up in grass on the eastern side of the roadway in an
area about ninety
metres north of the bridge, but the evidence as to the final resting place of
the vehicle or of the marks on the
road is not really that satisfactory.
<P>

32	Following the collision the plaintiff was taken to Tenterfield Hospital
before being transferred to Brisbane for treatment. 
Whilst there a blood
sample was taken at about 10.30 pm which on analysis showed a blood alcohol
concentration of 0.229 grams of
alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood (0.229g%).
I accept the unchallenged evidence of Dr Helen Dauncey that his blood alcohol
concentration
at the time of the accident is unlikely to have been less than
that and possibly as high as 0.249g% (supplementary report of 19 March
1998)
and that such a reading indicates a consumption during the afternoon and
evening of that day of the equivalent of ten to thirteen
schooners of full
strength beer or 80% to 100% of a bottle of spirits.  Such a blood alcohol
reading would be expected to produce
in most people heavy intoxication, and
thus his capacity to drive a motor vehicle would have been significantly
impaired.  Common
experience suggests that at that hour, after an afternoon at
the greyhound races, he may have been tired, particularly if also affected
by
alcohol.
<P>

33	Dr Dauncey noted that even alcohol tolerant drivers, whilst mostly able to
drive without mishap, once an emergency or mistake
is made are more likely to
make further errors when attempting to correct the situation, that they
typically have trouble staying
on the road at corners, and that the plaintiff's
driving would probably have been severely impaired and his ability to respond
efficiently
and effectively to an emergency greatly diminished.  In this regard
it may not be without significance that although Mrs King was
following the
plaintiff home from Tenterfield and had been in view most of the time, she lost
sight of his vehicle as they approached
the bridge over Branch Creek; this may
indicate that the plaintiff accelerated down the hill towards the bridge
although she did
say there were pine trees in the area which could have
obscured her view.
<P>

34	It is also relevant that notwithstanding extensive enquiries and notices to
produce, at the end of the case there was no evidence
that either front
steering link on this model of vehicle had ever failed on any other occasion;
and when in 1994 Mrs King wrote to
the Federal Office of Road Safety in 1994
(eight years after the accident) drawing attention to what the plaintiff's
experts had
found, the reply (exhibit X13) was to the effect that that Office
had received no other reports of steering failure in that model
vehicle.
<P>

35	It was conceded on behalf of the plaintiff that an impact such as occurred
when the front end of the vehicle impacted with the
embankment or whatever
could, given the right circumstances, have caused the separation; but it was
submitted that other evidence
in the case pointed to the separation having
occurred on road, ie before the vehicle "moved" (to use a neutral term) to its
incorrect
side.
<P>

36	Another issue at the hearing was how many impacts the vehicle had with the
embankment or the ground, and how many times it turned
over, but once again
there were no eyewitnesses and the various experts sought to draw inferences
from what they observed of the
vehicle and the steering link some years later.
In some instances their inferences on such things as the number of impacts were
related
to their inferences as to whether the separation occurred before or
after the vehicle left the road, and it was not clear which inferences
were
drawn first.  It ultimately seems to have been agreed that the vehicle only
rolled over once (there being no evidence of damage
to the rear of the
vehicle), but there remained a dispute as to the number of impacts; the
defendants' experts suggesting a number
of impacts which seemed to be more
consistent with their theories, and the plaintiff's experts suggesting only one
impact which more
readily accommodated their theories.
<P>

37	A single roll would involve not only a major impact at the front of the
vehicle causing the roll-over, but also a somewhat lesser
impact when the rear
of the vehicle completed the roll and hit the ground.  Whilst I accept that the
vehicle only rolled over once,
I am unable to reach a conclusion on whether
there was one or more impacts.  I note that the photos show not only damage to
the front
left wheel assembly area but also damage to the right side front of
the vehicle (where the bull bar is deformed).  This I believe
would be
consistent with at least two impacts but the damage to both sides at the front
may be consistent with both sides making
contact with the bank and sustaining
the damage at the same time, and though I am unable to reach a firm conclusion
as to how many
impacts there were, I believe it was probably more than one.
<P>

38	A major matter relied on by the plaintiff relates to the scuff marks on the
outside shoulders of the tyres (exhibits Q and R)
they being the wheels said by
Mr Foan to have been on the front left and right hubs respectively at the time
of the accident.  The
plaintiff's experts, particularly Mr Cusack and Dr
Gilmore, expressed the view that these marks were consistent with the steering
linkage separating after the vehicle left the bridge causing the left front
wheel to swing freely to the left on to the gravel and
after travelling some
distance on the gravel to suddenly swing to the right (as a result of striking
a small obstruction on the gravel
shoulder).  This, so the theory goes, caused
the vehicle to swing or veer suddenly to the right, the driver attempted to
correct
it by turning the steering wheel to the left which effectively turned
the right front wheel hard left, so that with the left front
wheel still turned
hard right, the vehicle proceeded across the road "pigeon-toed" thus causing
the scuff marks on the outer shoulder
of both front tyres as they rotated.
<P>

39	The defendants' case on the other hand was that exhibits Q and R (the tyres
with the scuff marks) were not both on the front
axle or stubs, but were both
on the left side of the vehicle, and that the scuff marks were indicative of a
yaw caused by the plaintiff
allowing the vehicle (with its steering still
intact) to veer off the left of the bitumen and then overcorrecting with the
result
that it veered across the road and into the bank.  It is therefore
necessary to review the evidence as to which tyres and wheels
were on which
hubs.
<P>

40	Mr Foan said that when he saw the vehicle in the NRMA compound at
Tenterfield the following morning he paid attention to the
tyres, and that both
front tyres were at that stage deflated and the beading was separated from the
rim of the wheel.  He identified
these two tyres which he said were on the
front as those which became exhibit Q (which he said was on the left front) and
exhibit
R (which he said was on the right front).  He further said that exhibit
T was then inflated with the beading against the rim on the
left rear, exhibit
U also inflated and with the beading against the rim on the right rear, and
exhibit S was in the tray of the vehicle.
 All the relevant witnesses agreed
that exhibit S had hardly been used and this could be deduced from only minimal
wear and the fact
that the lugs were in parts still attached to the rubber.
Messrs Bartrim and Conroy also saw the vehicle at that time and their evidence
was that the front tyres appeared to be deflated but they did not appear to pay
much attention beyond that.  
<P>

41	Following the accident the vehicle was removed to Queensland and later
returned to the plaintiff's orchard near Tenterfield where
it was inspected by
Dr McLeod on 10 July 1987.  Mr Foan was present on that occasion and removed
the steering assembly in Dr McLeod's
presence.  On that occasion Mr Foan said
he observed that the tyres were differently placed, namely exhibits Q and U
were where they
had formally been, but exhibit T was on the right front,
exhibit S on the left rear and exhibit R in the tray of the vehicle.  He
said
he pointed out to Dr McLeod that they were differently placed, but Dr McLeod
did not recall such conversation, and he also said
that at the time his belief
was that he was told that the wheels were then "with their position at the time
of the accident."
<P>

42	At some stage prior to the preparation of exhibit F on 27 March 1997
exhibits Q and T were labelled "left" and "right" respectively.
 It is not
clear who did the labelling.  Similarly exhibit U was labelled "R/rear",
exhibit S "left/rear" and exhibit R "tray". 
On 7 November 1997 Mr Foan removed
exhibit S from the left rear, exhibit U from the right rear and exhibit R from
the tray, and made
a note to that effect on the rims of the tyres themselves.
I am therefore satisfied that by the time the vehicle got back to the
plaintiff's property after the accident, exhibits Q and T were on the front,
exhibits S and U were on the rear and exhibit R was
in the tray.  The vehicle
had not been driven and could not be driven in the mean time, and is difficult
to see why any of the tyres
would have been changed between the morning of 26
April 1984 and 10 July 1987 when Mr Foan saw the vehicle again.  
<P>

43	Mr Jupe, the tow truck driver, gave evidence that if the front of the
vehicle was damaged he would have towed it with the front
end lifted up, that
is travelling on its rear wheels; and if either of the rear wheels were
deflated he would have substituted an
inflated tyre on that wheel, but he would
not have replaced deflated tyres on the front as there would be no point.  
<P>

44	As already noted, it is agreed that exhibit S was previously the spare tyre,
and so if exhibit R was on the rear prior to the
impact and was deflated as a
result of it, there would be every reason for Mr Jupe to replace exhibit R with
the spare (exhibit S)
and throw exhibit R into the tray of the vehicle prior to
towing it into town.  However, if exhibit R was on the front offside and
deflated in the accident, there would be no point in him moving it, and if
exhibit T was on the left hand rear at the time of the
accident and not
deflated, as Mr Foan claims it was (I note it is deflated now although the
beading is not removed from the rim),
there would be no reason to replace it
with the spare (exhibit S).  All these considerations lead me to the conclusion
that Mr Foan
is simply mistaken as to where exhibit R was on the morning
following the accident, and it appears to me that the tyres were on the
same
wheels on the morning after the accident as they were fifteen months later when
the vehicle was seen at the plaintiff's property.
<P>

45	It follows that at the time of the accident, exhibit R was on the left hand
rear hub and, being deflated in the accident, Mr
Jupe replaced it with the
spare (exhibit S), placed exhibit R in the tray prior to towing the vehicle
into town, and left it there.
 Mr Foan did concede that exhibits Q and T have a
similar consistency to each other in the wearing of their treads, as do
exhibits
U and R have a similar consistency to each other, and that this
indicates that exhibits Q and T on the one hand and exhibits U and
R on the
other hand most likely travelled on the same axles or stubs at some time.  It
was suggested on behalf of the plaintiff that
whilst this might be so they
could easily have been rotated between the purchase of the vehicle and the
accident.  This is possible,
but there is no evidence that it happened, and to
suggest it did is pure speculation.  The fact that they have travelled on the
same
axles or stubs as I have indicated is consistent with the location of
exhibit R as contended for by the defendants.
<P>

46	Accepting as I do that at the time of the accident exhibits Q and T were on
the front and exhibit R on the left hand rear, the
scuff marks on the tyres,
according to Mr Keramidis the motor traffic engineer, indicate what he termed a
"right hand yaw", that
is, a loss of control of the vehicle causing it to
swerve to the right.  Moreover, the markings on the outside of the two tyres on
the same left hand side (exhibits Q and R) are inconsistent with the
"pigeon-toed" passage of the vehicle across the road from west
to east after
the separation of the steering link as claimed by the plaintiff.  If the
plaintiff's experts are correct and the separation
had occurred on road before
the vehicle veered to the right, causing the left front wheel (exhibit Q) to
swing sharply to the left,
the inside rim of that tyre would have become the
leading edge and one would have expected some scuff marks on that inside edge,
although perhaps not so much if it was on the gravel, but there are no such
scuff marks of any kind on the inside shoulder of exhibit
Q. 
<P>

47	Other problems I see with the "pigeon-toed" theory are that no explanation
has been given which satisfies me as to why, if the
left wheel swung freely to
the left something,  and if so what, caused it to swing violently to the right
onto and across the bitumen,
and if the vehicle was after separation travelling
across the road "pigeon-toed" as they claim, one might expect that the driver,
if alert, would be applying the brakes, but there were apparently no skid marks
indicating the rear wheels in a locked position.
 
<P>

48	For these reasons I reject the plaintiff's experts' opinions as to the
significance of the marks on the road and the tyres, and
prefer the opinion of
Mr Keramidis that the vehicle was in a right hand yaw at the time, which
opinion that witness said was also
consistent with the diagram shown on the
later P4 (exhibit 6) which, as far as I can tell, in this regard is not
inconsistent with
the diagram on the earlier P4 (exhibit M) (bearing in mind
that the diagrams on the P4s are merely rough sketches and do not purport
to be
to scale or to show accurately measured angles).  
<P>

49	Mr Keramidis described what he meant by a yaw as follows:
<P>

	"In a circumstance where a vehicle . . . . . is travelling along a curved
path, steering is applied beyond which the road is capable
of holding that
vehicle in that circular path, the vehicle commences to slide partially and
rotate in this particular case in a clockwise
condition.  At the same time,
though, it maintains or attempts to maintain its circular path.  So if you like
there is a combination
of circular motion that the vehicle is following as well
as a rotation of the vehicle during that circular motion." (p 1482)
<P>

50	In considering the evidence relating to the significance of the marks on the
roadway, I have not overlooked the evidence of Dr
Gilmore but, like other
witnesses for the plaintiff, he understood that exhibit R (the second tyre with
the scuff marks) had been
on the right front hub, whereas for reasons already
indicated I am satisfied it was on the left side rear.
<P>

51	I turn now to consider the metallurgical, and other expert evidence provided
by a number of experts, namely Dr McLeod, Mr Cusack
and Dr Gilmore for the
plaintiff, Mr Nicolson for the first defendant and Messrs Gartner and Freedman
for the second defendants.
 The two metallurgists, Dr McLeod and Mr Gartner,
and also the engineers, Dr Gilmore and Mr Nicolson, appeared quite objective,
whilst
Mr Cusack seemed to be rather looking for indications which might
support an on-road separation of the steering link, and Mr Freedman
appeared to
start with the proposition that the separation was off-road, and everything he
observed had to be explained consistently
with that initial proposition.  In
fairness, I hasten to add that I am not suggesting either of them was dishonest
in any way.  Each
of these experts furnished one or more reports, and in those
reports not only expressed their own opinions, but commented on the
opinions
expressed by each of the other experts who had provided opinions up to that
time.  They each also gave oral evidence and
were cross-examined.  Not
surprisingly, the experts called by the plaintiff expressed the view that the
steering link separated before
the vehicle veered across the roadway, thus
causing it to do so, and pointed to a number of indicators to this effect;
whilst the
defendants' experts expressed a contrary view and either drew
different inferences from the indicators identified by the plaintiff's
experts,
or found other indicators pointing to a different conclusion.  All the
plaintiff's experts proceeded on the basis that exhibit
R had been on the right
front hub and the vehicle had veered across the road pigeon-toed, a position I
have rejected.  
<P>

52	The assembly that was found the next morning to have come apart formed part
of the linkage from the steering wheel mechanism
to the hub of the left front
wheel and was the connection between the centre track rod and the outer track
rod.  It was also referred
to at times as the "Inner End Assembly" and as the
"Ball Joint".
<P>

53	The joint had been assembled by crimping the tubular steel casing over a
knurled cylindrical nut in conical fashion, thus forcing
the nut against a grey
polymeric bush which formed part of the socket of the ball joint.  The
separation resulted when the crimping
over the knurled nut had opened, thus
releasing such nut.
<P>

54	It is convenient to deal with the expert evidence under a number of headings
formulated by counsel in their written submissions.
<P>

55	(a)	The Marks on the left ball housing.
<P>

Dr McLeod and Mr Cusack were able to identify a number of what they described
as critical features which were not present on the
right ball housing eg, small
serrated markings; and these features were likewise not present on other
samples on which tests were
carried out by Mr Gartner.  They expressed the
opinion that these features were indicative of a progressive failure.
<P>

56	On the other hand Mr Gartner considered there was little difference in the
marks shown on the left and right ball housings and
that they were similar to
those created in tests by him; and he did not consider the marks on the left
ball housing disclosed any
evidence of progressive movement.  Mr Nicholson
expressed the view that the marks could have been caused between the separation
of
the link on initial impact and the final resting of the vehicle on its roof.
Dr McLeod conceded in cross-examination that the marks
on the left and right
ball housings were similar, although he maintained there were differences which
he considered significant.
<P>

57	(b)	The marks on the knurled nut.
<P>

Unfortunately the knurled nut along with other components were misplaced after
their initial inspection by Dr McLeod.  The other
components were later found
but not the knurled nut, and accordingly Dr McLeod is the only expert who has
had the opportunity of
examining the real thing.  Mr Gartner had to rely on
photographs taken by Dr McLeod and a description given to him by Dr McLeod.
 Dr
McLeod in his report of 23 November 1987 (exhibit C) expressed the view that
the marks of metal-to-metal abrasion on the right
side cylindrical nut were
continuous, whereas those on the left hand nut were interrupted, not as deeply
scored and, towards final
separation, the lands were worn down to a greater
width; and all this suggested to him that separation of the left joint did not
occur in one movement but in an interrupted manner.  Mr Gartner, on the other
hand noted a variety of marks around the knurled nuts
even in his controlled
testing, and considered that the marks as shown in the photographs which he saw
could be produced by rapid
actual or near actual separations, and did not
indicate progressive failure.  
<P>

58	(c)	The "hourglass" mark on the inside chamfer of the ball housing.
<P>

The various witnesses agreed that these marks could have only been made with
the neck of the track rod inserted 5 to 7.5 millimetres
inside the ball
housing.  It is to be noted that the neck of the track rod narrows towards the
rod itself and the joint ball.  The
plaintiff's witnesses, Dr McLeod and Mr
Cusack, expressed the view that at least two contacts were necessary between
the track rod
and the inside of the chamfer to cause the hourglass shape of the
mark.  This opinion is found in Mr Cusack's report of 27 March
1997 (exhibit F)
and was not in Dr McLeod's original report, although he agreed with and adopted
it.  On the other hand, the defendants'
experts, including Mr Gartner, were of
the view that the hourglass mark could have resulted from separation on impact
and is not
consistent only with a progressive failure.  
<P>

59	(d)	The marks in the front left wheel well.
<P>

The left front wheel well, that is the metal part of the chassis which forms
the inside of the wheel well and the outside of the
engine compartment, had two
abrasions made by the wheel, one at the front and one at the back.  These marks
are beyond the limits
of the turn of the left wheel whilst the steering was
connected, and it seems to be agreed that they could only have been made on
or
following disconnection.  It is also agreed that they could only have been made
whilst the wheel was rotating.  From these factors
the plaintiff's experts draw
the inference that the steering must have been disconnected before the
vehicle's impact with the embankment,
because the plaintiff's case is that
there was only one impact and they use these two marks to support their theory
of the left wheel
breaking free to beyond a full left turn when the
disconnection first occurred, and then for some reason flicking to the extreme
right causing the vehicle to travel "pigeon-toed" across the road when the
driver attempted to steer and did steer the right wheel
only to the left.
Given that I have rejected the "pigeon-toed" theory, the plaintiff's experts
cannot explain why there are two marks
on the wheel well.  
<P>

60	The defendants' experts have generally proceeded on the basis that the
vehicle hit the embankment and ultimately came to rest
further north of the
bridge than postulated by the plaintiff's witnesses where the ground is more
uneven and there was therefore
scope for more than one impact, although it is
agreed the vehicle only turned over once.  Mr Gartner in particular considered
that
if there was only one impact he could not explain how there were the two
abrasion marks on the inside of the wheel well, but he thought
that a major
impact followed by a minor impact may have been sufficient.  The difficulty
with this theory is that if the wheel stopped
on impact, it needed some cause
to make it resume rotation so as to make the second mark.  
<P>

61	It should also be added that, although I have accepted Mr Newel's evidence
as to location of the accident, when on 5 September
1999 Mr Foan went there,
and stood on the relevant spot as indicated in Dr Gilmore's report (exhibit K),
the ground where he stood,
although not as rough as that further to the north,
could hardly be described as smooth, and there is some room for two or possibly
more impacts, although only one major one.  One can envisage the vehicle
hitting the embankment (a major impact) then rolling over
and not immediately
settling but bouncing once or twice before coming to rest on its top side.  
<P>

62	(e)	Lack of any mark on the idler arm stop. 
<P>

The plaintiff's experts postulated that for sufficient tensile force to be
generated to break the joint, the limiting bolt on the
centre track rod would
need to be forced against the left idler arm tab spot deforming it, or at least
marking it; whereas the defendants'
experts say that the force could have
effectively broken the joint like a handle pulled with great force off a door
without the door
slamming into its frame, and that there was sufficient inertia
created by the right side steering mechanism and steering wheel to
make this
possible.  Mr Nicolson in his report of 25 August 1997 (exhibit 4) said at para
1.5:
<P>

	"The LH steering lever attached to the LH stub axle was found to be deformed
from its original position in both an upward and inward
direction and was
twisted at the tyre rod end attachment eye. . . . .  For this deformation and
twisting to occur the steering side
rod must have been attached at the time of
the accident . . . . . The position of the lever and the shielding that the
wheel and
suspension stub axle provide would prevent the deformation by any
other means." 
<P>

63	(f)	Manufacturing and fault issues.
<P>

There was criticism from the plaintiff's expert witnesses, which was conceded
by the defendants' witnesses, that the crimping process
was not fool proof,
that the "Outline of Manufacturing Processes" (annexed to Mr Freedman's report
of 12 March 1991) (exhibit X1)
was insufficient in itself as a manufacturing
specification, and that it could not be assumed that every unit from the
production
process would be properly formed or that quality control inspections
were necessarily adequate.  There were changes in mechanism
when a new model
was later introduced but these were said to be related to other variations in
the design of the vehicle and not
because there was any evidence that the
crimping process was unsatisfactory.  However, whilst all of these things may
be conceded,
they do not amount to evidence that the crimping failed on this
vehicle prior to its impact with the embankment.
<P>

64	There are parts of the expert evidence called on behalf of the plaintiffs
which, when read in isolation, tend to suggest that
the steering linkage
fractured before the vehicle left the road, but at the same time there is other
evidence from the defendants'
experts to the contrary; and the plaintiff's
experts' theories and opinions become less persuasive when one accepts, as I
do, that
exhibit R was at the relevant time on the left rear hub and the
vehicle did not proceed across the road in a "pigeon-toed" manner.
 It follows
that I am not persuaded by the metallurgical, mechanical and engineering
evidence called on behalf on the plaintiff.
 
<P>

65	At the same time, it cannot be ignored that the plaintiff was driving his
vehicle with a blood alcohol reading of at least 0.229g%.
 I have already
referred to Dr Dauncey's opinion as to the probable effects of such a reading
on the capacity of the plaintiff to
drive the vehicle on the evening in
question.
<P>

66	Moreover, at the end of the case there was no evidence that this or a
similar steering linkage had ever failed on any other vehicle
of this make and
model.  It would be a remarkable coincidence if the only time such a steering
linkage failed was when the vehicle
was being driven by an intoxicated driver
at night at the beginning of a right hand curve in the roadway.
<P>

67	For these reasons I have come to the conclusion that what most probably
happened is that the plaintiff, whilst affected by liquor,
either dosed off or
had a lapse in concentration with the result that when the vehicle left the
bridge he failed to commence the
right hand curve and travelled onto the gravel
shoulder on the western or left hand side of the road.  When he realised what
had
happened he over corrected the steering to the right at too sharp an angle,
lost control, went into a yaw, left the road on the right
hand side, hit an
embankment or other obstruction and overturned; and that the impact involved in
hitting the embankment and overturning
caused the fracture of the steering
linkage.  There must accordingly be a verdict for the defendants.
<P>

68	Although, in the light of my finding on primary liability it is now
irrelevant, it is probably desirable that I express a view
on the issue of
contributory negligence.  It was submitted on behalf of both defendants that if
I were to find that the steering
linkage failed before the plaintiff's vehicle
left the road and was the cause of the accident, I should nevertheless also
find that
because of the plaintiff's intoxicated condition he was guilty of
contributory negligence.  In my view this would not follow.  If
the steering
linkage broke whilst the plaintiff was still on the roadway, he may, because of
his condition, have been less capable
of reacting promptly and efficiently, but
I am not satisfied that even if he was completely sober he would have been able
to avoid
the collision with the embankment if he had no steering control over
the left front wheel.  Therefore, if the plaintiff were entitled
to a verdict
it would not be a case where there would be any apportionment for contributory
negligence.  
<P>

69	Finally, Mr Gregg on behalf of the first defendant, although generally
relying on the arguments of the second defendant, made
a submission that there
was evidence that the plaintiff was travelling at an excessive speed.  The fact
that the impact caused the
damage it did, does tend to suggest that he was not
travelling slowly, as does the fact that, although his wife had been following
him, she had lost sight of him approaching the bridge; but these factors in
themselves would not justify me making a finding that
his speed was excessive
in the circumstances.  
<P>

70	For these reasons I direct the entry of judgment for the defendants and
order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the
proceedings.
