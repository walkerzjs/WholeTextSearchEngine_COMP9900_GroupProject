<b>1806/99 - HEATH GROUP AUSTRALASIA PTY LTD &amp; ANOR  v  LEONARD HENRY
HANNING &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  By a summons filed on 24 March 1999 the plaintiffs
seek orders which would bring into this Court some proceedings
in the
Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales and the Chief Industrial
Magistrate's Court of New South Wales.  If I make
the orders which the
plaintiffs seek, they will apply the Federal Court of Australia for orders
transferring proceedings there into
this Court, so that all of the proceedings
can be heard together by the Supreme Court.
<P>

2  	At the present time there are five proceedings, all of which
relate to the dismissal of the defendants, Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson,
from
their respective positions as managing director and executive director of the
first plaintiff.  The two proceedings in the Industrial
Relations Commission
have been brought respectively by Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson, seeking relief
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 106</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act 1996</a> (NSW) (matters 5856 and 5857
of 1998).  The respondents before the Commission are the two plaintiffs before
me.  In those proceedings
Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson contend that they are
entitled to three years' remuneration on termination of employment, and that
they
are entitled to benefit from the first plaintiff's executive share plan.
The second plaintiff, which is incorporated in the United
Kingdom, is joined in
those proceedings because it is the trustee of the executive share plan.  Mr
Hanning seeks a total of $3.9m
plus costs while Mr Anderson seeks $2,786,395
plus costs.  In their defence to those proceedings, the present plaintiffs
contend
that Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson were dismissed for serious misconduct,
and claim breaches of provisions of the Corporations Law,
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act 1974</a> (Cth), the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW) and fiduciary and contractual
duties.  
<P>

3  	The present plaintiffs have filed and served four lengthy
affidavits in the Commission proceedings.  Two of the deponents are
directors
of the British parent company of the first plaintiff, the third is the managing
director of the first plaintiff and the
fourth is a chartered accountant from
Sydney who has made a forensic investigation into the accounts of the first
plaintiff in relation
to the present defendants.
<P>

4  	The two Federal Court proceedings have been brought by the
plaintiffs against Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson respectively and are
based on the
same material as the defence in the Commission proceedings.  The plaintiffs say
that the evidence to be filed in the
Federal Court proceedings will be
identical, or virtually identical, with that filed in the Commission.
<P>

5  	Mr Hanning has also instituted proceedings in the Chief
Industrial Magistrate's Court of New South Wales against the first plaintiff
(matter 98/2500) claiming payment for annual leave.  The first plaintiff denies
that claim, and asserts in the Federal Court proceedings
that Mr Hanning took
excessive annual leave and seeks the return of money on that basis. The first
plaintiff says that the Chief
Industrial Magistrate's Court has no jurisdiction
to entertain its claim.  
<P>

6  	In this Court the plaintiffs seek orders under s 8 of the
Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1997 (NSW) removing the
proceedings
before the Industrial Relations Commission and the Chief Industrial Magistrate
to this Court, where they would be treated
as a continuation of the present
proceedings and be heard together.  This is on the basis that the Federal Court
proceedings would
later be transferred to this Court by order of the Federal
Court under s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1997
(Cth), upon the application of the plaintiffs as applicants in the Federal
Court proceedings.  
<P>

7  	The plaintiffs say that there are strong reasons of convenience
for achieving this outcome.  First, folding five proceedings
into one will save
substantial time and expense.  All five proceedings arise out of the same
facts, and the evidence will overlap
very substantially, particularly as
between the Industrial Relations Commission and Federal Court proceedings.  The
plaintiffs estimate,
after discussion with senior counsel, that the length of
separate Commission proceedings would be five to seven days, with seven
days
estimated for the Federal Court proceedings and two days estimated for the
proceeding in the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court.
 Further, two of the
witnesses for the plaintiff are directors of the parent company in London, and
the plaintiff says that if the
proceedings are not joined then those witnesses
will have to leave their jobs in London on at least two occasions at great
inconvenience
and expense, or alternatively they will have to give their
evidence by video link, a procedure which is also expensive.  Additionally,
if
the proceedings are not joined there is the prospect of two appeals in separate
jurisdictions.  
<P>

8  	The defendants oppose the orders which the plaintiffs seek.  They
submit that this Court has no jurisdiction to make the orders
or to hear the
Commission proceedings if they are removed to it.  They also raise some matters
going the Court's discretion, submitting
that the Commission is a specialist
tribunal which exercises non-judicial, arbitral powers and is therefore the
most appropriate
body to determine the proceedings which are presently before
it, and also that the plaintiffs are engaging in forum shopping.
<P>

9  	I propose, first, to deal with questions relating to the
jurisdiction of this Court, then to indicate the Court's general approach
to
the exercise of discretions under the cross-vesting legislation, and then to
turn to the particular discretionary considerations
in this case.  I shall deal
with them under five headings, namely:  expense and convenience;  overlapping
and issue estoppel;  relevant
limits of the jurisdiction of the Commission, the
Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court and the Federal Court of Australia;  the
Commission
as a specialist tribunal;  and forum shopping.
<P>

<b>Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court</b>
<P>

10  	The plaintiffs seek orders under the cross-vesting legislation
as enacted in New South Wales.  The preamble to the Commonwealth
and State
legislation recites that inconvenience and expense have occasionally been
caused to litigants by jurisdictional limitations
in federal, State and
Territory courts, and that it is therefore desirable to establish a system of
cross-vesting of jurisdictions
between those courts, without detracting from
the existing jurisdiction of any court.  Since the word `court' in the preamble
is
capable of referring to any court in a State, it could be contended that one
of the purposes of the cross-vesting legislation is
to permit the transfer of
proceedings from one court in a State to another court in the same State, where
inconvenience and expense
can be avoided by doing so.  However, an examination
of the history of the legislation suggests that the principal legislative
concern
was with limitations upon the jurisdiction of each State system of
courts and the Commonwealth system of courts, rather than limitations
of
jurisdiction within the system of courts of a single State:  see K Mason and J
Crawford, `The Cross-vesting Scheme',  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2062%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 62 ALJ 328.</a>  Purely intra-State
jurisdictional problems can be cured by legislation of the State without the
necessity for a national co-operative
scheme.  
<P>

11  	The federal-State focus is confirmed in the Explanatory Note to
the New South Wales Bill.  The Note explains that clause 8
would enable the
Supreme Court to remove a proceeding from another court of the State into the
Supreme Court `so that it can then
be transferred to the Federal Court or other
relevant court, or so that it may be determined in the Supreme Court itself
together
with proceedings transferred to it from the Federal Court or other
relevant court.'  This implies a legislative intention to authorise
the Supreme
Court to determine the combined proceedings.
<P>

12  	However, ss 8 and 9 of the cross-vesting legislation of New
South Wales are cast in language which is wide enough to confer
on the Supreme
Court the jurisdiction to hear and determine a proceeding removed to it from
another court of the same State.  They
state:
<P>

<b>`Orders by Supreme Court</b>
<P>

8.(1) Where:
<P>

(a)	a proceeding (in this subsection referred to as the `relevant proceeding')
is pending in:
<P>

	(i)	a court, other than the Supreme Court, of the State;  or
<P>

	(ii)	a tribunal established by or under an Act;  and
<P>

(b)	it appears to the Supreme Court that:
<P>

	(i)	the relevant proceeding arises out of, or is related to, another
proceeding pending in the Federal Court, the Family Court
or the Supreme Court
of another State or of a Territory and, if an order is made under this
subsection in relation to the relevant
proceeding, there would be grounds on
which that other proceeding could be transferred to the Supreme Court;  or
<P>

	(ii)	an order should be made under this subsection in relation to the relevant
proceeding so that consideration can be given to
whether the relevant
proceeding should be transferred to another court, 
<P>

the Supreme Court may, on the application of a party to the relevant proceeding
or of its own motion, make an order removing the
relevant proceeding to the
Supreme Court.
<P>

(2)	Where an order is made under subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding,
this Act applies in relation to the proceeding as if
it were a proceeding
pending in the Supreme Court.
<P>

(3) 	Where a proceeding is removed to the Supreme Court in accordance with an
order made under subsection (1), the Supreme Court
may, if the Supreme Court
considers it appropriate to do so, remit the proceeding to the court or
tribunal from which the proceeding
was removed.
<P>

<b>Exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to cross-vesting laws</b>
<P>

9.	The Supreme Court:
<P>

(a)	may exercise jurisdiction (whether original or appellate) conferred on that
court by a provision of this Act or of a law of
the Commonwealth or a State
relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction;  and
<P>

(b)	may hear and determine a proceeding transferred to that court under such a
provision.'
<P>

13  	Section 5(1) authorises the Supreme Court to transfer a
proceeding which is pending in the Supreme Court to the Federal Court.
 Thus,
by acting under ss 8(1) and 5(1) the Supreme Court may remove a proceeding from
another court of the State so that it becomes
a proceeding of the Supreme
Court, in order to transfer the proceeding to the Federal Court.  A matter
removed to the Supreme Court
under s 8 falls within the definition of `State
matter' in s 3(1), and s 4(1) invests the Federal Court with jurisdiction with
respect
to State matters.  Subject to constitutional issues such as those which
the High Court examined in <i>Re Wakim; ex parte McNally </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 27</a>, the
effect of the Supreme Court's order under s 8 is to render the matter a State
matter and therefore generate Federal Court jurisdiction,
and the effect of the
Supreme Court's order s 5(1) is to enable the Federal Court to exercise that
jurisdiction.  The same analysis
applies where the transfer is to the Family
Court or the Supreme Court of another State or Territory.
<P>

14  	It appears that the accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court
may not extend to the making of orders under s 106 of the IR
Act in proceedings
commenced in the Federal Court (<i>The Rochester Communications Group Pty Ltd v
Adler </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2065%20FCR%20572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 65 FCR 572</a>, a case on s 275 of the Industrial Relations Act
1991 (NSW)), but there is jurisdiction (subject to <i>Wakim's </i>case and
other possible constitutional arguments as to the non-judicial or arbitral
nature of the power) when the s 106 matter comes
to the Federal Court by orders
of the Supreme Court under s 8 of the cross-vesting legislation:  <i>Adamson v
NSW Rugby League Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2027%20FCR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 27 FCR 535</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=31%20FCR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">31 FCR 242</a>;  <i>Gallagher v
Pioneer Concrete (NSW) Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20113%20ALR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 113 ALR 159.</a>
<P>

15  	The question which arises in the present case is whether, when
the Supreme Court makes an order under s 8, it thereby confers
upon itself
jurisdiction to deal with the removed proceeding, if it does not otherwise have
jurisdiction to do so.
<P>

16  	Chapter 2 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/index.html#p9" class="autolink_findacts">Part 9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act 1996</a> (NSW) (`IR
Act'), which includes s 106, creates a special statutory regime under which the
Commission may declare void or vary a
contract whereby a person performs work
in an industry, if the Commission finds that the contract is an unfair
contract.  Chapter
4 of the IR Act distinguishes between the Commission and the
Commission in Court Session.  A person appointed as a member of the
Commission
in Court Session is referred to as a judicial member of the Commission:  s
149(3).  The Commission in Court Session is
constituted by a judicial member or
members (s 151(1)), and the Commission in Court Session is established as a
superior court of
record:  (s152(1)).  Certain functions of the Commission are
to be exercised only by the Commission in Court Session.  These include
the
hearing and determination of proceedings with respect to unfair contracts under
Chapter 2 Part 9:  s 153(1)(c).  
<P>

17  	While these provisions contemplate that only the Commission in
Court Session will exercise the statutory jurisdiction which
they create, in my
opinion they do not exhibit a legislative intention to vest the statutory
jurisdiction exclusively in the Commission.
 To put my conclusion another way,
an enactment of the New South Wales Parliament authorising the Supreme Court to
exercise the statutory
jurisdiction vested by the IR Act in the Commission
would add to but not be inconsistent with the IR Act.  There is a difference
between vesting a new statutory jurisdiction in a single body, and vesting the
statutory jurisdiction in that body exclusively, and
in my opinion the IR Act
does the former but not the latter.  This distinguishes the present case from
<i>Gaza Grazing Pty Ltd v Ampol Exploration Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20Qd%20R%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 Qld R 202</a>, where
the relevant mining legislation conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the
Warden's Court.  
<P>

18  	The defendant submitted that a conferral of exclusive
jurisdiction on the Commission in Court Session arises from s 153(1),
which
states that `the following functions of the Commission are to be exercised only
by the Commission in Court Session' and then
sets out a list which includes
proceedings under Part 9.  I reject this submission.  On its proper
construction, s 153(1) deals with
the allocation of functions between the
Commission generally and the Commission in Court Session, excluding the
Commission generally
from any function in respect of Part 9 proceedings, but it
does not deal with the allocation of functions as between the Commission
(or
the Commission in Court Session) and other tribunals such as the Supreme
Court.
<P>

19  	Thus, if s 106 proceedings are removed from the Commission to
the Supreme Court under s 8, there is nothing in the IR Act to
prevent the
Supreme Court from exercising the functions and powers of the Commission in the
removed proceedings.  But since the functions
and powers of the Commission
under Part 9 of the IR Act are special statutory functions and powers, the
Supreme Court cannot exercise
them unless the New South Wales legislature has
conferred jurisdiction upon it to do so.  Section 4 of the cross-vesting
legislation
of New South Wales does not assist, because it vests additional
jurisdiction only in federal courts and courts of States other than
New South
Wales.  However, in my opinion both ss 8(1) and 9(b), on their proper
construction, confer jurisdiction on the Supreme
Court with respect to the
removed matter, provided that s 8(1)(b) is satisfied.  
<P>

20  	Section 8(1) applies where a proceeding is pending in a court
other than the Supreme Court of this State.  The Industrial Relations
Commission in Court Session is a court for the purposes of this provision:  IR
Act, ss 151, 152;<i>  Bruning v Kingsmill (Australia) Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44
NSWLR 180.</a>  The subsection authorises the Supreme Court to make an order
removing that proceeding to the Supreme Court, where it appears to
the Supreme
Court that either of two conditions is satisfied.  Those conditions supply the
federal-State focus which underlies the
cross-vesting legislation, because they
have the effect that the Supreme Court cannot remove Commission proceedings to
itself except
in anticipation of either receiving other proceedings from a
federal court or a court of another State or Territory, or of transferring
the
Commission proceedings to another such court.
<P>

21  	One of the two conditions (in s 8(1)(b)(i)) is that the
proceeding is related to another proceeding pending in (relevantly)
the Federal
Court and, if the Supreme Court makes an order for the removal of the
proceeding under s 8, there would be grounds on
which the Federal Court
proceeding could be transferred to the Supreme Court.  While this provision
does not expressly confer on
the Supreme Court the jurisdiction to deal with
the removed proceeding, such jurisdiction is conferred by clear implication.
In particular,
paragraph 8(1)(b)(i) would be nonsensical if the Supreme Court
lacked the jurisdiction to deal together with the proceeding removed
from
another New South Wales court and the proceeding transferred to it by the
Federal Court.  In my opinion s 8 has the effect that
if the Supreme Court
makes an order removing a s 106 proceeding from the Commission to the Supreme
Court, the Supreme Court has all
of the statutory jurisdiction of the
Commission in Court Session to deal with the removed matter.
<P>

22  	Section 9(a) authorises the Supreme Court to exercise original
or appellate jurisdiction conferred on it by a provision of
the cross-vesting
legislation of New South Wales or of the Commonwealth or any other State.  In
my view this provision confirms that
the Supreme Court may exercise the
jurisdiction impliedly conferred upon it by s 8 of the cross-vesting
legislation of New South
Wales.  Section 9(b) authorises the Supreme Court to
hear and determine a proceeding transferred to it under a provision of the
cross-vesting
legislation of New South Wales, the Commonwealth or another
State.  The word `transferred' is used in s 9(b), whereas s 8(1) speaks
of an
order `removing' a proceeding to the Supreme Court.  In my opinion, however, an
order removing a proceeding from another State
court to the Supreme Court is an
order for the transfer of the proceeding for the purposes of s 9(b).  Section
9(b) refers to a transfer
under the provisions of the NSW legislation as well
as the legislation of the Commonwealth and other States, and the only order
under
the NSW legislation which could be described as the transfer of a
proceeding is an order under s 8.  
<P>

23  	<i>Bruning v Kingsmill (Australia) Pty Ltd </i>is authority for
the view that s 9(b) confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of New South
Wales in respect of matters removed to
that Court under s 8, and that the
Supreme Court consequently has all of the Commission's powers to hear and
determine a proceeding
under s 106 of the IR Act.  In <i>Minproc Ltd v
Killinger </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/564.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 564</a> Young J followed <i>Bruning's </i>case,
observing (in effect) that the profession should assume that the Equity
Division will follow <i>Bruning</i> unless the Court of Appeal determines
otherwise.  Some earlier observations by McLelland CJ in Eq in <i>Wood v Boral
Resources (NSW) Pty Ltd </i>(No.4980/92, 28 October 1993, unreported) and by
Young J in <i>Winron Pty Ltd v Shell Company of Australia Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2066%20IR%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 66 IR
64</a>, which suggest some doubt as to whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction
to deal with a proceeding under s 275 of the former Industrial
Relations Act
1991 after an order for removal under s 8, do not fully explore the question
and in my opinion, to the extent that
those doubts are inconsistent with the
reasoning in <i>Bruning's </i>case, <i>Bruning's </i>case is to be preferred.

<P>

<b>General approach to the exercise of discretions under the cross-vesting
legislation</b>
<P>

24  	The approach which I should take is indicated by the judgment of
Rogers AJA in <i>Bankinvest AG v Seabrook </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 711.</a>  In
<i>Johnston v Becker </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/310.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 310</a> Bryson J described that judgment as
`definitive of the law and practice on this topic in New South Wales'.  As
Bryson J said, the
central questions are to determine which court is the most
appropriate forum for the case and where the interests of justice lie.
 First
instance decisions in cross-vesting applications are dominated by their facts
and by the authoritative expedition in the <i>Bankinvest </i>case, and tend not
to carry the issue any further.  In the <i>Bankinvest</i> case, Rogers AJA
observed that it was inappropriate to talk of an `onus' in relation to
applications of this kind, but it is nevertheless
true that the court will not
make an order for transfer or removal of a proceeding unless it is persuaded
that the interests of justice
require it:  <i>Dawson v Baker </i>(1994) 120
ACTR 11, 18.
<P>

25  	After carefully reviewing the authorities, Higgins J in
<i>Dawson v Baker </i>(at 22) concluded that it was not possible to limit the
range of matters which are relevant, or defined the weight which any such
matter will be afforded in the circumstances of a particular case.  Clearly the
five factors which I was invited to consider in this
case are all relevant
matters for assessment.
<P>

26  	In some of the reported cases the application was made by
consent.  The consent of the parties was regarded as a relevant and
influential
factor in <i>Winrod Pty Ltd v Shell Oil Company of Australia Ltd </i>and
<i>Bruning v Kingsmill (Australia) Pty Ltd</i>, and the absence of consent
influenced the outcome in <i>Wood v Boral Resources (NSW) Pty Ltd.  </i>It may
be easier to transfer or remove proceedings where the applicant is the
plaintiff in all relevant proceedings, than where the
plaintiff in one is the
defendant in the other and the application is contested. Nonetheless, as Miles
CJ remarked in <i>Dawson v Baker </i>(at 13), the interests of justice are not
governed by the attitude or wishes of a party or even all the parties.
<P>

<b>Expense and convenience</b>
<P>

27  	The evidence is that instead of three hearings taking up 14 to
16 sitting days, a single hearing would be achieved if orders
were made by this
Court and the Federal Court.  Since the evidence in the Federal Court
proceedings would be virtually identical
with the defendant's evidence before
the Commission, one infers that if the Commission and Federal Court proceedings
were heard together,
especially if they were consolidated so that one came to
be regarded as a cross-claim in the other, there would be a saving of up
to
half of the estimated total hearing time.  Avoidance of the prospect of two
appeals in separate jurisdictions would also be an
advantage.  
<P>

28  	At this stage it is not clear whether Mr Hanning or Mr Anderson
will require the two United Kingdom witnesses to attend for
cross-examination.
However, having reviewed the affidavits in the Commission proceedings, which
are in evidence before me, I have
formed the view that it is sufficiently
likely that the UK deponents will be required for cross-examination that I
should assess
the present application on the assumption that they will be.  On
that basis it is obvious that it will be considerably more convenient
and less
expensive for the plaintiffs to have their witnesses give oral evidence once in
this Court than to give it at least twice
at different times in different
courts if the orders are not made.
<P>

29  	The defendants are not able to point to much in the way of
inconvenience or expense to them if the orders are made, their case
resting
rather on the other considerations which I set out below.  They say, however,
that making the orders will lead to delay,
which is clearly a relevant
consideration:  see <i>Dawson v Baker</i> at 25 per Higgins J.  While the
process of making application to this Court and the Federal Court for orders
for removal and transfer
of proceedings necessarily involves an element of
delay, I am not in a position to conclude that making the orders will produce
such
a substantial delay as to outweigh the considerations of expense and
convenience which favour the making of the orders.  No evidence
was led to
compare delays in the Commission, the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court, the
Federal Court and this Court.  In considering
the question of delay, the proper
comparison is between final resolution of a consolidated proceeding in this
Court and the resolution
of all of the existing proceedings in other courts,
rather than between the delay in hearing in this Court and the delay in the
first
hearing in the various proceedings if they remain unconsolidated.  For
reasons which I shall explain, I cannot assume that a hearing
in the Commission
would create estoppels which would extinguish the Federal Court proceedings if
they had not been heard, nor that
determination in the Federal Court would
extinguish the Commission proceedings.  Overall my conclusion is that
considerations of
convenience and expense distinctly favour the plaintiffs.

<P>

<b>Overlapping and issue estoppel</b>
<P>

30  	To understand the significance of this factor one must look in
more detail at the factual allegations which underlie the various
proceedings.
It appears from Mr Hanning's affidavit in the Commission proceedings that the
problems which led to his dismissal on
3 July 1998 had a substantial history.
He was a founder of Fielding &amp; Partners (Australia) Pty Ltd, 45% of the
shares of which
were held by Fielding &amp; Partners (UK), with Mr Hanning's
interests holding 27.5%.  In 1986 Fielding &amp; Partners (UK) was purchased
by
C E Heath plc.  Subsequently Fielding &amp; Partners (Australia) Pty Ltd was
merged with the Heath subsidiary in Australia, Mr
Hanning becoming the Managing
Director and a substantial shareholder of the merged entity.  Later his
shareholding interest was bought
out by Heath but 21% of the shares of the
Australian company were issued to executives including Mr Hanning under an
executive share
plan.  Mr Anderson was hired by the merged entity and
eventually became a director.  
<P>

31  	In 1997 there was a management buy-out of the parent company C E
Heath plc led by Mr MacKenzie-Green, one of the present plaintiffs'
deponents.
In his affidavit he alleges that financiers to the management buy-out
discovered that some key employees of the Australian
company had long-term
service contracts under which they were entitled to their full salary for the
remainder of the contract term
in the event of a change of control of the
employer.  This discovery led to intense negotiations and an agreement whereby
the affected
employees agreed not to enforce these rights and entered into new
service contracts in return for shares and a cash bonus of $A600,000.
 Half of
the bonus was paid immediately and according to Mr MacKenzie-Green, payment of
the other half was subject to the attainment
of stated profit targets which
were never attained.
<P>

32  	Mr MacKenzie-Green says that in April 1998 he and Hamish Mackay,
another deponent who is deputy chairman of the UK parent,
visited Australia and
discovered considerable differences within the Australian board in relation to
the allocation of resources,
working practices and management.  He subsequently
received a note from two Australian directors making serious allegations
against
Messrs Hanning and Anderson.  He returned to Australia in June and had
many confidential discussions, concluding that there were
divisions amongst the
Australian directors which ran so deep that fundamental changes needed to be
made.  He suggested to Mr Hanning
that he be replaced as managing director and
that he become chairman.  Mr Hanning refused.  They discussed sale of the UK
interest
in the company and a possible split of the company, and Mr
MacKenzie-Green says that although Mr Hanning initially expressed an interest
in acquiring the UK shareholding pursuant to rights of first refusal which he
had, he later urged the UK shareholder not to sell
and endeavoured to persuade
the UK directors that differences in the Australian board could be resolved.
Meanwhile investigations
were undertaken with respect to the allegations which
had been made against Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson.  In his affidavit Mr Mackay
deposes to investigations carried out by Arthur Andersen during a financial
audit of the Australian company.  He says that Arthur
Andersen discovered
certain irregularities relating to Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson.  He convened a
board meeting of the directors
of the Australian company for 3 July 1998.
<P>

33  	The minutes of that meeting indicate that though Mr Anderson was
present, Mr Hanning was absent due to illness.  In fact he
had suffered a
severe heart attack and had undergone major by-pass surgery on the previous
day.  Mr Mackay informed the meeting of
Arthur Andersen's financial review and
of legal advice received by the company.  The minutes then set out a catalogue
of allegations
against Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson, namely that:  
<P>

(a)	Mr Hanning purported to determine that Mr Anderson was not liable to repay
a substantial loan which he had received from the
company, and misled the
company by allowing the loan to remain as such in financial statements; 
<P>

(b)	Mr Hanning made various decisions with respect to a loan to a company known
as Chip Application Technologies Ltd, without legal
advice, which had the
effect of altering the terms of the loan to the disadvantage of the company;

<P>

(c)	Mr Hanning authorised payment of part of the second tranche of $300,000
even though the company had not achieved the profit
targets upon which payment
of that amount was conditional;   
<P>

(d)	Mr Hanning directed the company not to pay fringe benefits tax on part of
his `notional salary' under an arrangement which was
not disclosed to the
board.  
<P>

34  	The minutes record that `in light of all the foregoing
circumstances' the UK shareholder had decided to remove Mr Hanning and
Mr
Anderson as directors.  The board then resolved to dismiss them summarily as
employees of the company. 
<P>

35  	In the Federal Court proceeding against Mr Hanning, the
plaintiffs rely on the allegations in paragraphs (a) to (d) above,
asserting an
entitlement to relief for breach of the Corporations Law, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>, and on the grounds of breach of fiduciary duty,
breach of contract, fraud and deceit.  In their Federal Court proceeding
against
Mr Anderson, the plaintiffs rely on the allegations in paragraphs (a)
and (d) and seek relief on equivalent grounds.  The Federal
Court proceeding
against Mr Hanning raises two additional matters.  One is an assertion that Mr
Hanning took at least 89 days in
excess of his annual leave entitlements, and
failed to complete and lodge annual leave forms so as to create the appearance
that
he was entitled to additional leave which he had not taken.  These
allegations are related to the proceedings in the Chief Industrial
Magistrate's
Court, in which Mr Hanning seeks to recover in respect of his alleged
entitlement to annual leave.  In effect, the Federal
Court proceeding seeks to
make out that because he failed to account properly for annual leave in fact
taken, Mr Hanning is not entitled
to the payment for annual leave which he
claims, but has in fact taken excess annual leave for which he should reimburse
the company.
 The other matter is an allegation that Mr Hanning arranged with
the company to take leases of motor vehicles used by his three sons,
without
the proper authority of the company.  The Federal Court proceeding against Mr
Anderson makes an additional allegation against
him, namely that he failed to
report information relevant to the acquisition of the Johnson &amp; Higgins
Queensland Aviation Business
by the company.
<P>

36  	The Commission proceedings seek the avoidance or substantial
variation of the employment and executive share plan contracts,
as well as the
contracts which were entered into at the time of the management buy-out to
replace the `change of control' rights
with entitlements to shares and bonuses.
The applicants in the Commission proceedings allege that these contractual
arrangements
were unfair, harsh and unconscionable and contrary to the public
interest in many ways, which are specified.  While the Commission's
determination on some of the aspects of alleged unfairness will depend
principally on the documentation rather than extrinsic evidence,
and some of
the extrinsic evidence of unfairness may go beyond the basic allegations made
in the minutes of the meeting of 3 July
1998, it is clear that the events of 3
July 1998 and the circumstances leading up to them, including negotiations at
the time of
the management buy-out, will be of central relevance in the
Commission proceedings. 
<P>

37  	The grounds set out in the summons in the Commission proceedings
refer not only to the terms of the contracts which are challenged,
but also to
the employer's conduct in and about termination of the employment, implying an
allegation under s 106(2) that even if
the contracts were fair at the time they
were entered into, they subsequently became unfair because of the employer's
conduct.  To
the extent that such an allegation is made the Commission will be
required to review the history of the employment relationships
and the
circumstances leading up to the terminations, as well as the conduct involved
in the terminations themselves, and make a
determination of fairness in all the
circumstances.
<P>

38  	It is equally clear that those matters are of central relevance
to the Federal Court proceedings, although the Federal Court
proceedings raise
some additional issues.  One of the additional issues raised in the Federal
Court proceedings against Mr Hanning
is the question of entitlement to payment
for annual leave, which is the very issue raised in the proceedings in the
Chief Industrial
Magistrate's Court.  It is plain, therefore, that there will
be very substantial overlap between the proceedings in the Commission,
the
Federal Court and the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court.
<P>

39  	Apart from the inconvenience and expense which this overlapping
produces, it is likely in my opinion to raise some awkward
questions of issue
estoppel, unless the proceedings are heard together.  
<P>

40  	If the Commission proceedings are dealt with first, the
Commission will make determinations with respect to the fairness of
the conduct
of the plaintiffs, which are likely to deal with the grounds for dismissal set
out in the minutes of the meeting of 3
July 1998. The Federal Court proceedings
make allegations which were intended to ground causes of action under statute
and under
the general law, some of the factual ingredients of which are likely
to go beyond the facts which the Commission would determine
in the exercise of
its jurisdiction under s 106.  To take an obvious example, the causes of action
in the Federal Court proceedings
involve proof that a benefit was gained or a
loss or detriment suffered.  The result is that if the proceedings in the
Commission
are determined first, there are likely to be some complex arguments
about estoppel in the Federal Court proceedings:  generally,
see <i>Blair v
Curran </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2062%20CLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 62 CLR 464</a>, 531-2 per Dixon J;  <i>Queensland v Commonwealth
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 585</a>;  and note <i>Wiest v DPP </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/450.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 450</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2023%20FCR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 23 FCR 472</a>, 522 per
Gummow J.
<P>

41  	Much the same problems will arise if the Federal Court
proceedings are heard and determined first.  The Federal Court will
make
findings which will be relevant to but not necessarily determinative of the
issues which are raised in the Commission proceedings.
 This is because the
investigation of unfairness under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p9" class="autolink_findacts">Part 9</a> requires the Commission to consider
whether the contract is against the public interest, and also because the
factual matters relevant
to deciding whether the contract or conduct under it
is unfair, harsh or unconscionable are broader than the factual matters
relevant
to deciding whether conduct is misleading or deceptive, fraudulent or
deceitful, or in breach of the Corporations Law or contract
or fiduciary
duty.
<P>

42  	While a prior determination of the Federal Court proceedings
against Mr Hanning could estop him from asserting the facts necessary
to
establish entitlement in the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court, the benefit
of that estoppel is not sufficiently strong to outweigh
the disadvantage which
would arise through the uncertain application of estoppel documents in other
respects.  
<P>

<b>Relevant limitations of the jurisdiction of the Commission, Chief Industrial
Magistrate and Federal Court of Australia</b>
<P>

43  	A significant factor in favour of making the orders which the
plaintiff seeks is that the Supreme Court is the only tribunal
which has the
jurisdiction to deal comprehensively with all aspects of the dispute between
the parties.  Clearly the jurisdiction
of the Chief Industrial Magistrate is
limited having regard to s 382 of the IR Act.  While I have not been taken to
all of the legislation
which confers jurisdiction on the Chief Industrial
Magistrate, the evidence before me asserts that the Chief Industrial
Magistrate's
Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the first plaintiff's claim
that excessive annual leave was taken and that money should be
repaid on that
basis.  
<P>

44  	The Commission has a wide jurisdiction under Part 9, but there
are nevertheless limits.  The Commission's power under s 106(1)
is to make an
order declaring the contract wholly or partly void, or varying it, if the
Commission finds that the contract is an
unfair contract.  Section 106(5)
authorises the Commission to make such order as to the payment of money as it
considers just in
the circumstances, but the power to make an order of this
kind is limited by the wording of the subsection.  An order for the payment
of
money can be made `in making an order under this section... in connection with
any contract declared wholly or partly void, or
varied'.  In other words, it is
only when the Commission finds that the contract is unfair and decides to make
an order affecting
the contract that its power to make a money order arises.
The additional power to make certain prohibitory orders, conferred by s
107, is
not relevant in the present circumstances.  The Commission can also make orders
under other parts of the IR Act including
Ch 2 Pt 6 with respect to unfair
dismissals, in properly constituted proceedings.  
<P>

However, none of this goes so far as to authorise the Commission, where it
decides that a contract is not unfair, to order that
the applicant in
proceedings before it must pay money to the respondent employer.  At least to
that extent, the Commission may not
have the power to deal comprehensively with
all the claims of the parties.  While the Commission in Court Session has the
power to
make declaratory orders (s 154), the present plaintiffs seek
substantially more than merely declaratory relief in the Federal Court
proceedings. Here the relief sought in the Federal Court is by the employer on
basically the same grounds as it seeks to defend the
s 106 proceedings.  This
may be contrasted with <i>Wood v Boral Resources (NSW) Pty Ltd </i>(cited
above), where the lorry-owner drivers were the applicants for relief in each
proceeding, and McLelland CJ in Eq took the view
that the Commission's power to
give them relief was at least as wide as the Federal Court's.
<P>

45  	Additionally, while the Commission may be guided by analogy with
the law of contract, fiduciary duty and deceit, and by the
statutory duties
under the Corporations Law and trade practices legislation, in making its
determination whether a contract is unfair,
the Commission is not a `Court' as
defined for the purposes of the Corporations Law and cannot therefore exercise
the statutory powers
of a Court with respect to such matters as orders for
compensation under Pt 9.4B of the Corporations Law.
<P>

46  	On the other hand the Federal Court's jurisdiction is also
limited.  While that court's accrued jurisdiction may permit it
to deal with
the claims under the Corporations Law and the general law which are combined
with claims under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> in the proceedings currently before
it (see <i>Re Wakim;  ex parte McNally</i>, cited above), it cannot in the
proceedings presently before it make orders avoiding or varying contracts on
the broad ground of
unfairness defined in ss 105 and 106 of the IR Act.  I need
not give further consideration to the question whether the Federal Court
could
exercise the jurisdiction of the Commission if I were both to remove the
Commission proceedings to this Court and then transfer
them to the Federal
Court, since there is no application for me to do so.  
<P>

47  	I conclude, therefore, that the most convenient and expeditious
way of resolving all aspects of the dispute between the parties
is to take such
steps as I am able to take in order to have the proceedings determined by the
only court with plenary jurisdiction,
namely this Court.
<P>

<b>The Industrial Relations Commission as a specialist tribunal</b>
<P>

48  	Counsel for the defendants submitted that the Commission is the
most appropriate tribunal to determine the s 106 proceedings,
because those
proceedings raise non-judicial issues and require the exercise of arbitral
power, and the Commission has acquired a
form of specialisation and
characteristic jurisprudence which give rise to forensic advantages which
should not be taken away.  He
referred to <i>Walker v Industrial Court of New
South Wales </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2053%20IR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 53 IR 121</a> and <i>Rothmans v Industrial Court of New
South Wales </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2053%20IR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 53 IR 157</a> as illustrations of the special
characteristics of this jurisdiction. I should note that the specific issue
considered in <i>Walker's</i> case, namely whether it was appropriate for the
Industrial Court of the time to consider the employer's conduct in respect of
the
termination of employment in determining whether the contract was fair, has
been addressed by s 106(2), a provision which was not
present in s 275 of the
1991 Act.  Counsel for the defendant submits that this Court ought not make an
order where it can be seen
that there is another tribunal with the requisite
power which is particularly suited to deal with the matter in issue (<i>Harry M
Miller Attractions Pty Ltd v Actors' &amp; Announcers' Equity Association of
Australia </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20NSWLR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 NSWLR 614)</a>;  and that the Court should leave the
applicants in the Commission to pursue their remedy before that tribunal
because the Commission
has been set up by the legislature to entertain disputes
of this kind (<i>Murray v Transport Workers' Federation of Australia </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20NSWR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969]
1 NSWR 351).</a> 
<P>

<i>Judicial or non-judicial power?</i>
<P>

49  	The Commission in Court Session is a superior court of record
(IR Act, s 152), and has been described as a superior court of
limited
jurisdiction:  <i>Nisbet v Kilfoyle</i> (Industrial Relations Commission of New
South Wales, Commission in Court Session, Full Bench, No.CT1120/96, 18 December
1996, unreported).
 The source of the jurisdiction of such a court is
statutory;  it does not have any inherent jurisdiction to deal with common law
claims, and it appears unlikely that it has any pendent or accrued jurisdiction
(<i>National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service v Stables Perisher Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
20 NSWLR 573)</a>, though this point was not fully argued before me.
<P>

50  	The Commission in Court Session is empowered by Ch 2 Pt 9 to
make orders avoiding or varying certain contracts where the Commission
finds
that the contract is `unfair contract'.  The words an `unfair contract' are
defined in s 105 to mean (relevantly) a contract
that is unfair, harsh or
unconscionable, or that is against the public interest.  The Commission may
find that the contract was unfair
at the time it was entered into, that it
subsequently became an unfair contract because of conduct of the parties, a
variation or
other reason, s 106(2).  In considering whether a contract is
unfair because it is against the public interest, the Commission must
have
regard to a number of matters specified in s 106(4), including the effect of
the contract on any system of apprenticeship or
other methods of providing a
sufficient and trained labour force.  The considerations to which s 106 refers
are not limited to matters
of an essentially industrial character:
<i>Stevenson v Barham </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20136%20CLR%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 136 CLR 190</a>, 199.
<P>

51  	While these provisions are very broad, especially as they permit
the Commission to vary a contract, they are not so widely
expressed as to be
necessarily powers of a non-judicial nature.  It is not uncommon for the
legislature to confer a very broad statutory
jurisdiction on this Court - for
example, the jurisdiction to determine that a contract is unjust, and hence to
make an order varying
it, under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a> (NSW);  and the
jurisdiction to make orders which have the effect of superseding the testator's
intention under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a> (NSW).  The fact that the
Commission's jurisdiction extends to conduct after the making of the contract
does not render its discretion
any less a judicial discretion.  The evaluation
of a course of conduct by reference to broad standards occurs, for example, in
cases
which seek to invoke equitable doctrines with respect to unconscionable
conduct, or statutory jurisdiction for misleading or deceptive
conduct.  Nor,
in my opinion, does the statutory reference to the public interest render the
Commission's power non-judicial.  By
analogy, this Court must apply the
criterion of public benefit in order to assess whether a trust is a valid
charitable trust.  In
summary, in my view there is nothing in the statutory
provisions which confer jurisdiction on the Commission in Court Session under
Pt 9 of the IR Act which identifies the Commission's power as a non-judicial
power which ought not to be exercised by a court such
as the Supreme Court
pursuant to an order for removal under s 8 of the cross-vesting legislation.
<P>

52  	I was referred to cases dealing with the question whether
similar powers conferred on tribunals were part of the judicial power
of the
Commonwealth, to be exercised only by a court constituted pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s71.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 71</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">72</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  That question is rather different from the question
before me, which is whether I ought to decline to remove the proceedings from
the Commission on the ground that those proceedings raise non-judicial
questions inappropriate for determination by the Supreme Court.
 Nevertheless I
note that in <i>Re Dingjan;  ex parte Wagner</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 323</a>, 360,
Gaudron J observed that it was relevant to the question before her that the
power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission
with respect to unfair
contracts had been vested in a tribunal which is not a court, and that policy
considerations had a part to
play in the tribunal's determination.  In the case
of IR Act, the relevant power is vested in a court, namely the Commission in
Court
Session.  That reinforces my view that there is nothing in Pt 9 which
makes the exercise of power under those provisions inappropriate
for this
Court, either generally or in the specific circumstances of this case.
<P>

<i>Arbitral power?</i>
<P>

53  	In <i>Minister for Youth &amp; Community Services v Health &amp;
Research Employees' Association of Australia </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 543</a>, 559-560,
McHugh JA observed that the power conferred by the Industrial Arbitration Act
1940 (NSW), s 88F (an ancestor of s 106)
was an arbitral rather than a judicial
power (see also <i>Minproc Ltd v Killinger </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/564.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 564).</a>  In addition
to the breadth of the grounds for making orders, his Honour was influenced by
the fact that under the industrial relations
legislation of the time, the power
was vested in the Commission rather than a judicial body, and the Commission
could at that time
apply s 88F of its own motion.  Now the power conferred by s
106 is vested in the Commission in Court Session, and s 108 states that
an
order may be made on the application of listed persons (the list not including
the Commission itself) and not otherwise.  McHugh
JA was also influenced by the
facts that an application for an order could be made by a stranger to the
contract (such as an industrial
organisation) and that the Commission could
exercise its power although the contract was not unfair when made but became
unfair by
virtue of subsequent events.  The former is no longer an unusual
occurrence - for example, in an application to a court under s 1324
of the
Corporations Law.  I have already commented on the latter point.
<P>

54  	The question before the Court of Appeal in that case was
different from the issue which I must determine, in the exercise of
my
discretion under s 8 of the cross-vesting legislation.  Even if the
Commission's power under s 106 is, like its power under s
88F, an arbitral
rather than a judicial power, it may nevertheless be appropriate to make an
order which has the effect that the
arbitral power is exercised by this Court.
However, the combination of changes to the industrial relations legislation and
expansion
of the functions required to be performed by a court may well mean
that what was an arbitral rather than a judicial power in 1987
is now better
classified, at least for present purposes, as a judicial power.
<P>

<i>Specialist jurisprudence</i>
<P>

55  	It is true that the Commission in Court Session and its
predecessors have built up a formidable jurisprudence with respect
to the
`unfair contracts' jurisdiction:  apart from the cases just cited, see <i>David
Jones Ltd v Cukeric </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2078%20IR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 78 IR 430</a>;  <i>Nordby v Barclays Australia
Investment Services Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2053%20IR%20319" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 53 IR 319</a> and 1996 CCH Australia Limited
Australian Industrial Law Review, para 5-072;  and generally JJ Macken, P
O'Grady and C Sappideen,
<i>The Law of Employment </i>(1997) p.532ff.  But the
Commission's jurisprudence is not secret, and can be brought to the attention
of the Court by competent counsel.
<P>

56  	It may be that in certain kinds of case the Commission's
expertise is such that a removal order should not be made - for example,
where
the issue for determination is closely bound up with the interpretation and
effect of an industrial award or enterprise agreement.
 As Young J remarked in
<i>Minproc Ltd v Killinger</i>, the Commission's expedience in such matters
gives it a yardstick against which to measure the instant application.  This
consideration
appears to have carried some weight with the McLelland CJ in Eq
in <i>Wood v Boral Resources (NSW) Pty Ltd </i>(cited above).  The dispute in
that case was clearly an industrial dispute on any view, involving a grievance
by lorry-owner drivers
which arose when Boral implemented a policy of giving
preference to trucks owned by it and driven by its employees. 
<P>

57  	In the present case, the protagonists are not merely employer
and employees.  Mr Hanning was a founder of one of the businesses
which merged
to form the employer company.  He has at all times had a significant
shareholding, and in recent times has been interested
in buying out the
majority shareholder of the employer or splitting the company because of
boardroom divisions.  The disagreements
between the parties which led to his
dismissal are to a large degree not matters to do with employment or terms of
service.  Mr Anderson
was an ally of Mr Hanning on the board and his dismissal
is referrable to the same considerations.  The dispute also extends to aspects
of the negotiated settlement of the `change of control' provisions at the time
of the management buy-out, and to the fairness of
the operation of the
executive share plan.  Overall, the dispute is better characterised as a
commercial or corporate dispute than
as in any sense an industrial dispute.
<P>

58  	This characterisation of the proceedings receives some support
from the amendments to the IR Act which commenced on 1 December
1998, although
clearly those amendments do not apply to the present facts.  The 1998
amendments introduced s 109A, which excludes
from Division 2 of Part 9 a
contract of employment that is alleged to be an unfair contract for any reason
for which an application
could have been made by the employee under Part 6
(unfair dismissals), or could have been so made but for the provisions of s 83
which exclude the employee from making an application under that Part.  Section
83 says, inter alia, that Part 6 does not apply to
an employee whose conditions
of employment are not set by an industrial instrument and whose annual
remuneration is greater than
$62,200 (or a greater amount prescribed by the
Regulations). The purpose of the amendments, according to the Second Reading
Speech
(Legislative Council, 8 April 1998, p.3796) was to exclude matters
arising from the dismissal of employees from the jurisdiction
of the Commission
relating to unfair contracts.  This was because the explicit restrictions on
access to the unfair dismissal jurisdiction
(award coverage or earnings less
than the prescribed amount) were being circumvented by those who could afford
to litigate an unfair
contract claim. 
<P>

59  	The conditions of employment of Mr Hanning and Mr Anderson were
not set by an industrial instrument and their annual remuneration
far exceeded
the maximum amount.  Therefore had the 1998 amendments been applicable to their
circumstances, proceedings under the
IR Act could not have been taken against
them either under Part 9 (unfair contracts) or Part 6 (unfair dismissals).  The
significance
of the amendments for present purposes is that they reflect a
legislative view that the Commission's specialisation does not extend
to
disputes regarding the employment of highly paid employees whose conditions of
employment are not set by an industrial instrument.
<P>

60  	In all the circumstances I reject the submission that there is
something special about the expertise or jurisprudence of the
Commission in
Court Session which makes it a more appropriate tribunal than this Court to
deal with a matter such as the present
case, which involves highly paid
executive employees whose conditions of employment are not governed by an
industrial instrument
and who are in a dispute with a predominantly commercial
and corporate flavour.
<P>

<b>Forum shopping</b>
<P>

61  	The defendants draw attention to the following chronology:
their employment was terminated on 3 July 1998;  they commenced
their s 106
proceedings in the Commission on 4 November 1998, and the first defendant
commenced proceedings in the Chief Industrial
Magistrate's Court on 27 November
1998;  the present plaintiffs filed their substantial affidavits in the
Commission on 19 March
1998 and commenced proceedings in the Federal Court, as
well as the proceedings in this Court, on 24 March 1999.  The defendants
say
that the institution of Federal Court proceedings contemporaneously with the
present application, and so long after the institution
of industrial
proceedings by them, must be seen as a ploy by the plaintiffs to transfer the
dispute to a more amenable tribunal.
 
<P>

62  	I reject this submission.  The Federal Court proceedings follow
on from and reflect the matters set out in the minutes of the
board meeting of
3 July 1998.  The expiration of time between the dismissal and in the
institution of the Federal Court proceedings,
less than nine months in all, is
explicable at least in part by the preparation during the intervening time of a
forensic report
which was made available to the plaintiff's lawyers on 19 March
1999, and is exhibited to an affidavit in the s 106 proceedings.
 The facts of
this case are obviously distinguishable from cases such as <i>Wood v Boral
Resources (NSW) Pty Ltd</i> (cited above), where the Federal Court proceeding
was instituted after the failure of applications for interlocutory relief in
the
Supreme Court and the Industrial Court, strongly suggesting forum shopping
in a manner contrary to the public interest.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

63  	In my opinion the plaintiffs have made out their case for the
orders which they seek in paragraphs 1-6 of the summons, although
the orders
should refer to removal rather than transfer of the proceedings.  If the
Federal Court decides not to transfer the proceedings
before it to this Court,
it may be necessary for me to make further orders, and therefore I should grant
liberty to apply on, say,
48 hours' notice.  
<P>

64  	The only remaining issue is whether, following the lead given by
Young J in <i>Minproc Ltd v Killinger </i>(cited above), I should, while making
the orders sought, also order that they not be entered until a later date, so
as to permit a
conciliation process to take place in the Commission.  That
would ensure that the policy underlying s 109 of the IR Act would be
properly
implemented.  I shall hear the submissions of the parties on that question, and
also on the question of costs.
