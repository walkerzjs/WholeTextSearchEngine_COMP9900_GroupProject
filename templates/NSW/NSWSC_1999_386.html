<b>JUDGMENT	(Extension of time to file statement of claim)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed in court on 27 April 1999 the
plaintiffs seek orders that the limitation period for commencing an action
against the estate of R J Hunt be extended up to and including 8 September 1998
and that the time for service of the further amended
statement of claim be
extended to on or before 25 September 1998.  The first to fourth defendants
oppose these orders being made
and the fifth defendant neither consents nor
opposes the application.
<P>

2	On 17 August 1998 the following orders were made.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff has leave to join the estate of the late Roderick John Hunt
as fifth defendant.
<P>

(2)	That the limitation period for commencing an action against the estate of
the late Roderick John Hunt be extended up to and
including 31 August 1998.
<P>

(3)	Leave is granted to the plaintiff to serve a further amended statement of
claim on or before 31 August 1998.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff is to pay the third and fourth defendants' costs.
<P>

3	An appeal was lodged from my decision referred to above.  On 2 December 1998
Hidden J dismissed the appeal.
<P>

4	No further amended statement of claim was filed by 31 August 1998.  However
the further amended statement of claim was filed 9
days outside the time
stipulated namely on 9 September 1998.
<P>

5	Once again, the blame for non-compliance with my orders lies with the
plaintiff's solicitor.  In my previous judgment I made some
unflattering
comments about the plaintiff's solicitor.  I commented that when the solicitor,
Mr Garrett had advised the plaintiff
that there were ways to get around the
limitation period, he demonstrated a cavalier attitude to the law.  The
solicitor has acknowledged
that he received a copy two days after it was
delivered.  On 20 August 1998 he attended an informal conference at the first
to fourth
defendants' solicitor's office in Sydney which explored settlement
but was unsuccessful.
<P>

6	The solicitor's explanation for the delay in filing the further amended
statement of claim is that both prior to and during the
whole of the month of
August 1998 and September 1998 he was absent from work on regular occasions
because of his personal health.
 He had total kidney failure due to a condition
known as Polycystic Kidney Disease.  This has necessitated regular
haemodialysis
since February 1998.  In addition to the requirement for dialysis
on three afternoons every week, at the relevant time the dialysis
machine
installed in his home was frequently malfunctioning due to an electrical supply
irregularity.  Consequently he was compelled
to frequently attend either
Wollongong or Shellharbour public hospitals renal units for dialysis on an
emergency basis which was
disruptive to his legal practice.  On 8 September
1998 he commenced a course of training at Wollongong hospital, renal
department,
on a new and different dialysis machine.  This necessitated absence
from his office for three days per week for a further three weeks.
 As a result
of these circumstances he inadvertently overlooked the time for filing and
serving of the amended statement of claim.
<P>

7	On 28 October 1998 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to the first to fourth
defendants' solicitor and informed him that at the hearing
of the appeal, he
proposed to request appropriate orders to regularise the late filing and
service of the further amended statement
of claim.  The plaintiffs' solicitor
failed to raise this issue with Hidden J.
<P>

8	The plaintiff submitted that a further extension of time should be granted
because the delay of a day in filing the further amended
statement of claim of
9 days did not alter the position of the defendants to their detriment, a
reasonable explanation for the delay
has been provided and it is fair and
reasonable to make such an order.  The plaintiff also submitted that to sue a
solicitor for
negligence leaves the plaintiff with a more onerous case to
prove.
<P>

9	The defendant submitted that an order to extend the time for filing a further
amended statement of claim should not be granted
because the plaintiff's
solicitor had previously demonstrated a cavalier attitude to time constraints
in this matter, there has been
largely unexplained delay of 5 months before the
plaintiff's solicitor sought to regularise the error and it has suffered
prejudice

<P>

10	The first to fourth defendants counsel referred to the authorities of
<b><u>Gladesville RSL Club v Bartsch &amp; Anor</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 674</a> and
<b><u>Morgan v 45 Flers Avenue Pty Limited &amp; Anor</u></b> (1987) NSWLR at
573.  In <b><u>Morgan</u></b>, the second opponent had filed three notices of
motion seeking dismissal of the claimant's proceedings for want of prosecution.
After
the last motion was filed, the parties, by consent entered into a self
executing order to the effect that if the claimant did not
pay for the printing
of the appeal books within 7 days the appeal would be dismissed for want of
prosecution.  Kirby P (as he then
was) considered the factors both for and
against setting aside the self executing orders (pp 580,581).  His Honour
considered the
prior serious delays meant that the solicitor for the claimant
should have been on notice of the need to exercise punctilious care
in
complying with the terms of the order.  His Honour considered the client may
have remedies against his solicitor and why should
they be allowed to further
trouble the opponents who had endeavoured to comply with time constraints.
When exercising his 
<P>

discretion, the President acknowledged that it was a borderline case but
considered that just sufficient reason had been shown to
warrant relief in this
case.  This would allow the appeal to be disposed on its merits and reflects
the preference of the modern
approach to disputes of this kind.
<P>

11	In <b><u>Gladesville RSL</u></b> the judge in the original application to
extend the limitation period found that the plaintiff satisfied the threshold
first contained
in s 60I(1)(a)(ii) and exercised his discretion in favour of
the plaintiff.  His Honour extended the limitation period.  The plaintiff's
legal advisers failed to commence proceedings on the plaintiff's behalf within
one month as stipulated in the orders.  A further
notice of motion was filed
seeking a further extension application and relied on additional facts to pass
through the s 60I(1)(a)(ii).
 Handley JA (with whom Mason P and Stein JA
agreed) at p 681 stated:
<P>

	<b>"The question whether it is just and reasonable to make a second order
extending the limitation period is also affected by the failure
of the
plaintiff's legal advisers to commence proceedings within the time permitted by
the earlier order.  In <i>Walkley v Precision Forgings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 WLR
606</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20All%20ER%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 All ER 548</a>, a plaintiff had commenced proceedings within the
limitation period, which became liable to dismissal for want of prosecution.
An
extension of the limitation period to enable fresh proceedings to be
commenced was refused, because as Lord Diplock said (at 619;
559) "these are
self-inflicted wounds".  The answer to a question from the court would indicate
that the plaintiff may well have
a remedy against her legal advisers, but this
is strictly irrelevant in the resolution of the present appeals.</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>An order for an extension is interlocutory, and as such may be susceptible
of variation where, as a result of some accident, illness,
mistake or the like,
proceedings are not commenced within the extended period and an application is
made promptly for the necessary
variation.  No such question arises in this
case and there is no need to express any view on it."</b>
<P>

12	In the case before me the plaintiffs' extension of time applications fell
under ss 60C, D and E of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b>.  Nevertheless, my previous
order granting a further extension of time may be varied if it comes about due
to some accident, illness
or mistake and an application is made promptly for
the necessary variation.
<P>

13	I turn to the exercise of discretion to grant the relief sought in the
motion.  The factors which persuaded me to grant the original
extension of time
and join the fifth defendant as a party to the proceedings are the same.  The
defendants were aware as at 28 October
1998 that the plaintiffs' solicitor was
taking steps to rectify his non-compliance with the court's order.  The fifth
defendant neither
consents nor opposes the orders for an extension of time in
which to file the further amended statement of claim being made.  The
defendant
has not demonstrated that it suffers actual prejudice, but rather the
presumptive prejudice which has been caused by delay.
 Even though the motion
was not filed until it was handed up in court at the hearing, the actual
further amended statement of claim
was filed only 9 days outside the time
stipulated.
<P>

14	While I am sympathetic to the plaintiffs' solicitor's serious illness, in
the light of my previous comment that he had adopted
a cavalier attitude to the
law and in particular time limits, if he was well enough to attend Sydney for a
conference with the defendants'
solicitors shortly after my judgment was handed
down, it is difficult to see how he failed to make the compliance with the time
limit
imposed by the court a priority.  He also failed to seek an extension of
time when the appeal was heard by Hidden J even though he
had previously
advised the first to fourth defendants he would do so.  Once again, the blame
cannot be attributed to the plaintiffs
but rather their solicitor and if leave
is refused they will have the more onerous task of establishing a professional
negligence
case against him.
<P>

15	This is a borderline case.  The plaintiffs have only just satisfied the
court that an extension should be granted.  By adopting
this course the cases
will be determined on their merits.
<P>

16	As the plaintiffs were in default of the orders of the court the first to
fourth defendants should be awarded their costs.  The
question to be determined
is whether the plaintiffs or their solicitor should pay the first to fourth
defendants' costs.  Before
I make an order that the plaintiffs' solicitor
should pay the costs, I should allow him the opportunity to be heard.
<P>

17	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The limitation period for commencing an action against the estate of R J
Hunt be extended up to and including 25 September 1998.
<P>

(2)	The time for service of the further amended statement of claim be extended
up to 25 September 1998.
<P>

(3)	Costs are reserved.
