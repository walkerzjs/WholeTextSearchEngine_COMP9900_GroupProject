<b>11633/99   -   SPANOS ENTERPRISES PTY LTD &amp; 2 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>			v   SOUTH SYDNEY CITY COUNCIL</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Appeal against decision of costs assessor;</b>
<P>

<b>				 Extension of time)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By summons filed 8 July 1999 the plaintiffs seek
orders that firstly, that the certificate of determination of costs of John
McGruther
(the costs assessor) dated 4 May 1999 be set aside;  secondly, that
the matter be remitted to the costs assessor for re-determination;
and thirdly,
that the time for filing an appeal be extended.  The first plaintiff is Spanos
Enterprises Pty Limited, the second plaintiff
is Spanos Export Meats Pty
Limited and the third plaintiff is Anthony William Spanos.  The plaintiffs
relied on the affidavits Anthony
William Spanos sworn 9 July 1999 and 29 July
1999 and Victor Tjakamarra Forrest of 27 August 1999 and 22 October 1999.   The
defendant
relied on the affidavit of Rachel Suzanne Kelleher sworn 1 September
1999.
<P>

2  	The grounds of appeal are firstly, that the costs assessor in
reaching his determination was in breach of procedural fairness
or natural
justice and secondly, that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on
behalf of the costs assessor.
<P>

<b><u>Extension of time to appeal</u></b>
<P>

3  	The court has a wide discretion when considering whether or not
to extend time to appeal.  The ultimate test is to do justice
between the
parties.  As a general rule, time will be extended if there is no prejudice to
the other party and appropriate orders
for costs or the imposition of other
terms of the extension adequately protect their position.
<P>

4  	The certificate of assessment is dated 4 May 1999.  The appeal
should have been lodged by 2 June 1999.  The summons was filed
on 8 July 1999,
just over one month out of time.  The plaintiffs' reason for their delay was
that they had difficulties obtaining
documentation from his former solicitor
and did not obtain the certificate of assessment until 23 June 1999.  However,
on 2 June
1999 Mr Spanos was aware that a judgment had been entered in the Land
and Environment Court against the plaintiffs in the sum of
$44,041.65 for costs
on 17 May 1999.  The alarm bells should have rung.  The defendant did not
demonstrate that it suffered any prejudice.
 While the exercise of discretion
is finely balanced, and after taking the above matters into account it is my
view that the time
to appeal should be extended to 8 July 1999.
<P>

5  	A short history of this matter is as follows.
<P>

(1)	Mr Spanos is the chief executive officer, director and secretary of the
first and second plaintiffs.  He has held these roles
since at least 1992.  The
plaintiffs own property worth about $8 million with a mortgage in the sum of
$1.4 million.  The approximate
equity of the plaintiffs is $6.6 million.  Mr
Spanos is a voluntary youth worker.
<P>

(2)	On 8 July 1998, Pearlman CJ of the Land and Environment Court gave judgment
in a matter between South Sydney City Council as
applicant, Spanos Enterprises
Pty Ltd as first respondent, Spanos Export Meats Pty Ltd as second respondent
and Anthony William Spanos
as third respondent.  Her Honour declared that the
respondents, their servants and agents have used, permitted or suffered to be
used premises known as "The Graffiti Hall of Fame" at 286-288 Botany Road,
Alexandria (the premises) for the purpose of dance parties
without having first
obtained development consent from the applicant and are in breach of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a>.  Her Honour ordered that the
respondents, their servants and agents be restrained from using, permitting or
suffering to be used
premises known as 286-288 Botany Road, Alexandria for the
purpose of dance parties without having first obtained development consent
from
the applicant in accordance with the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning
and Assessment Act 1979</a>.  Her Honour also ordered that the respondents pay the
costs of the applicant as agreed or as assessed.
<P>

(3)	On 15 January 1999 the defendant's solicitor served a bill of costs on the
plaintiffs' solicitor and lodged an application for
assessment of party/party
costs with this court.  The bill of costs claimed the sum of $65,588.35 for
costs and disbursements.
<P>

(4)	On 19 February 1999 the court referred the matter to Mr McGruther for costs
assessment.  The parties were notified accordingly.
 
<P>

(5)	On 25 February 1999 the costs assessor wrote to the solicitors for the
plaintiffs.  He noted that no objections had been lodged
as at the date of the
letter.  He allowed the plaintiffs 14 days to lodge objections and submissions.
No notice of objections or
submissions were ever lodged.  
<P>

(6)	The solicitor Mr Tees did not file a notice of ceasing to act.  He may have
been reinstructed by the plaintiffs in April 1999.
 In the meantime copies of
all correspondence was mailed to the third plaintiff.
<P>

(7)	On 4 May 1999 the costs assessor issued a certificate of determination of
costs in the sum of $44,041.65.  The costs assessor
deducted $21,546.70 from
the amount claimed in the bill of costs.
<P>

(8)	On 18 March 1999 the plaintiffs' solicitor, Mr Tees wrote to Mr Spanos and
stated:
<P>

<b>"YOU ALSO NEED ANOTHER SOLICITOR INSTRUCTED TO FIGHT THE ASSESSMENT OF ABOUT
$65,000-00 COSTS AGAINST YOU IN THE LAND ENVIRONMENT
COURT BELOW.D.G. THOMSON
ARE RECOMMENDED AND MUST BE PAID UP FRONT ASAP AND URGENTLY.</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

At the foot of the letter in handwriting appeared the words:
<P>

<b><i>"Handed to Mr Spanos</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>personally at 1.46pm 18/3/1999</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>He said John Tyndall</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Barrister to act.  I said</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>"He cannot he is a Barrister"</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>TS then said "We'll see anyway"."</i></b>
<P>

(9)	On 6 October 1999 in the matter Spanos Enterprises Pty Limited (plaintiff)
v South Sydney City Council (defendant) (Equity No
3090/99), Mr Spanos made an
application to set aside the application for statutory demand.  Acting Master
Berecry made findings in
relation to the letter dated 18 March 1999 referred to
above.  The Acting Master stated at pp 4 and 5 of his judgment:
<P>

<b>"The letter is endorsed at the foot with a note that it was handed to Mr
Spanos.  Therefore, as at 18 March Mr Spanos was aware that
his then solicitor
was not going to act for him in relation to the costs assessment and further
that that solicitor had informed
him that he would need to instruct another
firm.  He also emphasised that there was a degree of urgency required.</b>
<P>

<b>The costs assessor handed down his certificate on 4 May, some six weeks
after that letter.  It would appear that Mr Spanos took no
steps to protect the
plaintiff in relation to the assessment of those costs until well and truly
after the event.  In his affidavit,
which of course is contradicted by that
particular letter, he deposes to the fact that it was not until mid June that
he became aware
of the assessment.</b>
<P>

<b>The plaintiff in these proceedings has failed to take steps to protect
itself, before the assessor, by not acting on the advice given
by the former
solicitor.  True it is he may not have had the complete file as at 18 March,
but it was open to him to request the
solicitor to make that file available.
Had the solicitor refused to do so, there is adequate protection by way of
application to
the Supreme Court for the file to be released for the purpose of
the note in the assessment to proceed.  The plaintiff, through Mr
Spanos, did
not avail itself of those procedures."</b>
<P>

6  	For reason of comity, I accept these findings.  I also agree with
these findings.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

7  	The plaintiff submitted that the costs assessor in reaching his
decision was in breach of procedural fairness or natural justice
in that there
was no prior notice given to the plaintiffs of the assessment;  or no
disclosure of material adverse to them was made;
 and there were deprived of
the opportunity to provide information and be heard by the assessor, by reason
of the incompetence or
inadvertence of the plaintiffs' former solicitor in
failing to bring these matters to the plaintiffs' attention in time or failing
to make objections.
<P>

8  	Section 208L of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (as
amended) provides.
<P>

<b>"Appeal against decision of costs assessor as to matter of law</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A party to an application who is dissatisfied with a decision of a costs
assessor as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine the
application may, in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, appeal to
the Court against the decision.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	After deciding the question the subject of the appeal, the Supreme Court
may, unless it affirms the costs assessor's decision:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs assessor, or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the
costs assessor to re-determine the application.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	On a re-determination of an application, fresh evidence, or evidence in
addition to or in substitution for the evidence received
at the original
proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

9  	The plaintiff referred to portions of the second reading speech
of the <b>Legal Profession Reform Bill</b> which occurred on 16 September 1993,
the explanatory statement in relation to the <b>Legal Profession Reform
Bill</b> 1993 and the <b>New South Wales Law Reform Commission Report</b> 
<P>

(No 70) entitled "Scrutiny of the Legal Profession - complaints against lawyers
February 1993".  It was submitted that these documents
assist in the
interpretation of s 208L of the Act.  The language of s 208L is clear and there
and there is no need to refer to these
extrinsic matters.
<P>

10  	In <b>Judicial Review of Administrative Act</b>, 2nd ed., pp
180-181 which are reproduced below, Professor S A de Smith said:
<P>

<b>"Natural justice generally required that persons liable to be directly
affected by proposed administrative acts, decisions or proceedings
be given
adequate notice of what is proposed, so that they may be in a position:  (a) to
make representations on their own behalf;
 or (b) to appear at a hearing or
inquiry (if one is to be held);  and (c) effectively to prepare their own case
and to answer the
case (if any) they have to meet."</b>
<P>

11  	In <b><u>Kioa &amp; Ors v West &amp; Anor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR
550</a> the High Court held that the duty to accord natural justice is a duty to
act fairly.  In the normal course, a party to judicial proceedings
(as are
those subject to costs assessment) could expect to be apprised of the nature of
the case sought to be made against it, and
of the date and time fixed for
hearing such as to give it a reasonable opportunity to meet that case and to
advance its own.  These
statements are similar to those expressed by Professor
de Smith and referred to earlier.  Brennan J (as he then was) at p 628
stated:
<P>

<b>"A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power
must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters
adverse to his
interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in
deciding upon its exercise."</b>
<P>

12  	In relation to procedural fairness, Mason J stated in
<b><u>Kioa</u></b> that the law had now developed to a point where it may be
accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of
according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which
affect the rights, interests and legitimate expectations,
subject only to the
clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention.  Procedural fairness is
a notion of a flexible obligation
to adopt fair procedures which are
appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case (pp 583 and
584).
<P>

13  	On the subject of alleged solicitor incompetence, the plaintiff
referred to <b><u>R v Birks</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 677</a> and <b><u>Chouman v
Margules</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=17%20MVR%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">17 MVR 144.</a>  These authorities refer to the manner in which
cases were conducted before the court and are not relevant to the case before
me.
 In any event, the plaintiff, Mr Spanos an experienced businessman, was
told on 18 March 1999 to instruct a solicitor urgently in
relation to the costs
assessment but did not do so until April 1999 at the earliest.  
<P>

14  	The costs assessor complied with his obligations under the Act
and more specifically those duties referred to under ss208,
208A and 208B.  It
was never drawn to his attention that the plaintiffs' solicitor was no longer
acting for the plaintiffs.  The
costs assessor wrote to the plaintiffs'
solicitor requesting objections and submissions to be lodged in accordance with
s 208.  The
costs assessor did not have the knowledge that the plaintiff
intended to lodge a notice of objection (if that was 
<P>

actually the plaintiffs' intention).  The costs assessor carried out his duties
under the Act in a proper manner.  The costs assessor
afforded the plaintiffs
natural justice and was not in breach of procedural fairness.  This ground of
appeal fails.
<P>

15  	The plaintiffs' second submission was that there was a
reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the costs assessor because
documents forwarded by the defendant's solicitor refer to the plaintiffs as
being involved in criminal activities, a shooting incident
and the involvement
of police.
<P>

16  	In <b><u>Dubow v Miller Goddard Solicitors</u></b> (NSWSC,
unreported 30 September 1998) I held that the principle of apprehended bias
applied to costs assessors.  I have since become
aware of the decision by Young
J in <b><u>Smits v Buckworth</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 22 September 1997)
where he considered whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the
part of a costs
assessor and applied the principle of apprehended bias.  In
<b><u>Wentworth v Wentworth</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 6 February 1998) Santow
J applied the principle to a taxing officer.  
<P>

17  	I have reproduced some of the principles in relation to
apprehension of bias referred to Santow J in <b><u>Wentworth</u></b>.  They are
as follows:
<P>

<b>"The proper test for judicial or quasi judicial bias in Australia is as
stated by the High Court in <i>Webb v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 41</a> at 47
(per Mason CJ and </b>
<P>

<b>McHugh J, affirming the statements of principle in <i>Livesey v New South
Wales Bar Association</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 288</a> and <i>Re JRL;  Ex parte</i> CLJ

<P>

<b>`When it is alleged that a judge has been or might be actuated by bias, this
Court has held that the proper test is whether fair-minded
people might
reasonably apprehend or suspect that the judge has prejudged or might prejudge
the case.  The Court has specifically
rejected the real likelihood of bias
test.  The principle behind the reasonable apprehension or suspicion test is
that it is of `fundamental
importance that justice should not only be done, but
should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done...'</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>The fairminded person has been described in different ways:  for example,
the reasonable person (<i>Vakauta v Kelly</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20167%20CLR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 167 CLR 568)</a>;  the
reasonably minded observer (<i>Goktas v GIO</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 684)</a>;  and
objective and reasonable person (<i>Raybos Australia Pty Limited v Tectran
Corporation Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20272" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 272</a> at 275).  Thus Deane J in
<i>Webb</i> (supra) at 67 quoting <i>Livesey</i> (supra) at 293: whether, in
all circumstances, a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the material
objective facts `might entertain
a reasonable apprehension that [the judge]
might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the
question'
in issue."</b>
<P>

18  	In <b><u>Webb v The Queen</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 41</a> at 53 Mason
CJ and McHugh J stated that test reflects the rationale that it is of
fundamental 
<P>

importance that the parties to litigation and the general public have the full
confidence in the integrity including the impartiality
of those entrusted with
the administration of justice (see Deane J in <b><u>Webb</u></b> at p 68).  
<P>

19  	More recently Einstein J in <b><u>Gibson v O'Keefe</u></b>
(NSWSC, unreported 2 June 1998) considered whether conduct and comments of the
ICAC Commissioner constituted apprehended bias.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff referred to the letter dated 8 March 1999 where
the defendant's solicitor wrote to the costs assessor and stated
that the
matter was a contested three day hearing before the Chief Judge in the Land and
Environment Court alleging criminal activities
on the part of the respondent
and seeking injunctive relief.  
<P>

21  	At paragraphs 2 and 3 of the chronology also forwarded to the
costs assessor, it was stated that in May 1995 there were various
attendances
upon a number of nearby residents and businessmen and a meeting was held with
the Mayor and the Director of Planning
and Building and others to monitor the
present state of the evidence and what further steps could be taken and that
correspondence
was initiated with the New South Wales Police Service.  It also
stated that in 1996 there were a number of attendances upon Council
officers
and police relevant to various dance party events and the incidents were
recorded and statements taken ultimately to be
used in evidence.
<P>

22  	At p 5 of the chronology it was stated that there was an
incident widely reported which took place at the subject premises
on 7 May 1995
(shooting) when as a result of a fight between participants at a dance party a
person was shot and the perpetrator
was subsequently shot by police.  
<P>

23  	At p 6 of the judgment at the foot of the page of Pearlman CJ
said:
<P>

<b>"Each of these four deponents witnessed an incident on the premises during
which a man was shot.  They each made a statement to the
police on 7 May 1995
in connection with that incident.  The incident has no relevance to these
proceedings, but it supports the reliability
of the evidence given by each of
these persons, as each of them was more likely to recall the event by reason of
the incident."</b>
<P>

24  	Pearlman J in her judgment refers to at least four police
officers who gave evidence before her.  Some attended the premises
when dance
parties were either scheduled to take place (j pp 9, 11,12) or taking place.
The judgment also referred to Council officers
attending these premises.  The
statements about police officers making attendances at the premises and a
shooting incident at the
premises are true.  The letter of 8 March 1999 uses
the words "<b>alleging</b> criminal activities" (my emphasis).
<P>

25  	It is my view that a fair minded person would not reasonably
apprehend or suspect that the costs assessor would have prejudged
the costs
assessment.  because two of the statements complained about are true and the
third statement refers to alleged criminal
activities.  It would be expected by
a fair minded person that a costs assessor would not accept all that was stated
in submissions
as being true and that the costs assessor would read the
judgment and form his own view on it.  This ground of appeal fails.  The
appeal
is dismissed.  The decision of the costs assessor of 4 May 1999 is affirmed.
The summons is dismissed.  Costs are discretionary.
 Costs should follow the
event.  The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs as agreed or assessed.
<P>

26  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Time to file an appeal is extended to 8 July 1999.
<P>

(2)	The appeal is dismissed.  The decision of the costs assessor of 4 May 1999
is affirmed.  The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiffs are to pay the defendant's costs as agreed or assessed.
