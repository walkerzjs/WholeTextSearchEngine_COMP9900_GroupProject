<center><b>NRMA LTD &amp; ORS v JOHN KERIN MORGAN</b>
<P>

<b>(t/as ALLEN ALLEN &amp; HEMSLEY) &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	<b>GILES JA:</b>  I published reasons in these proceedings
on 13 May 1999.  For present purposes little knowledge of the proceedings is
necessary,
but in what follows I assume familiarity with those reasons.  I also
use the acronyms and abbreviations used in the reasons. 
<P>

2   	The proceedings included cross-claims by each of AAH, AT
and Mr Heydon against the others of them for indemnity or contribution.
 The
cross-claims were pursuant to s 5 of the LR Act or, as they said, "in equity".
By notice of motion filed on 20 May 1999 AT sought
leave to file a further
cross-claim against Mr Heydon.  In the proposed further cross-claim it alleged,
first, that Mr Heydon owed
to it a duty of care similar to that owed to the
NRMA, that he was in breach of that duty of care, and that its damages for the
breach
of duty of care were the amount for which it was liable to the NRMA;
and secondly, that Mr Heydon had been involved in contravention
of s 42 of the
FT Act and had breached s 996 of he Law and that AT had thereby suffered loss,
being its costs and the amount for
which it was liable to the NRMA.  The
hearing of the notice of motion, together with other notices of motion and
questions outstanding
in the proceedings, is to take place on 23 July 1999.

<P>

3   	Accompanying the notice of motion was an affidavit of Mr
Peter Kennedy sworn 20 May 1999.  The affidavit adverted to the decision
of the
High Court in <i>Astley v Austrust Ltd</i> (1999) 8 HCA 6 given on 4 March
1999, after I had reserved my decision in these proceedings, and to the
opportunity given to the
parties to lodge supplementary written submissions on
the decision of the High Court.  In para 6 of the affidavit Mr Kennedy then
said -
<P>

"Until such submissions were called for, it was not considered necessary to
examine directly the liability of the Third Defendant,
to the Second Defendants
independently of the claim for indemnity or contribution made in the Third
Cross-Claim.  Once the immediate
consequences of the decision in <i>Astley v
Austrust Ltd</i> became apparent, I instructed Counsel to advise on this
liability. Counsel have advised that the Third Cross-Claim may not, in certain
circumstances, permit the Second Defendants to claim contribution from the
Third Defendant and for more abundant caution the Second
Defendants should seek
the leave of the Court to file a further Cross-Claim."
<P>

4   	Mr Heydon served on AT a notice to produce, and on AT's
solicitors a subpoena, requiring the production of documents. The response
to
the subpoena and the notice to produce was such that only the documents in pars
1 and 2 of each, the corresponding paragraphs
being in the same terms, need to
be addressed.  AT claimed that the documents sought by Mr Heydon were subject
to client legal privilege.
 Mr Heydon responded that the privilege had been
lost by the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> and possibly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 126</a>
of that Act, because their substance had been disclosed through para 6 of Mr
Kennedy's affidavit.  
<P>

5   	I was told of this contretemps when giving directions with
a view to the hearing of the notices of motion and other questions.
 It was
agreed that the documents called for were initially subject to client legal
privilege, and that the loss of the privilege
turned on para 6 of the Mr
Kennedy's affidavit.  In those circumstances, and again by agreement, argument
was heard today on the
status of the documents in pars 1 and 2 without the
necessity for a formal motion and on a notional production of the documents and
application by Mr Heydon for access to the documents.  
<P>

6   	The two paragraphs read -
<P>

"1 	All file notes, briefs, correspondence or other documents recording or
referring to the instructions to counsel to advise, referred
to in para 6 of
the affidavit of Peter Ewen Kennedy sworn 20 May 1999.
<P>

2 	All file notes, memoranda, correspondence [sic] recording or referring to
the advice referred to in para 6 of the affidavit of
Peter Ewen Kennedy sworn
20 May 1999."
<P>

7   	Although the question of the status of the documents does
not arise on the adduction of evidence, it was common ground that
whether the
privilege has been lost is to be determined on the derivative application of
the principles of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> considered in<i> Akins v Abigroup Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/254.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 254</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 539.</a>  A different view was taken by a bench of five Judges of
the Federal Court in <i>Esso Australia Resources Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of
Taxation</i><b> </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1655.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1655</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20159%20ALR%20664" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 159 ALR 664</a> but, quite apart from the common
ground, I am bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal.  
<P>

8   	In the circumstances of this case, the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> is that the privilege has been lost if AT knowingly
and voluntarily disclosed the substance of the documents described in the two
paragraphs.  Mr Kennedy's affidavit was relevantly knowing and voluntary
disclosure.  Was the disclosure of the substance of the
documents?  
<P>

9   	Mr Heydon submitted that there was disclosure of the
substance of the documents in para 1 because of Mr Kennedy's words, "I
instructed counsel to advise on this liability", meaning the liability of Mr
Heydon to AT.  I do not think that is so.  Mr Kennedy's
words said no more than
what it would have been necessary to say in order to claim client legal
privilege and that cannot work a
loss of the privilege.  In any event, his
words did no more than indicate that there existed a confidential communication
between
himself and counsel on the subject of advising on the liability and did
not, in my opinion, disclose the substance of the communication.
<P>

10   	It is appropriate at this point to refer to some
authorities.  
<P>

11   	In <i>Ampolex v Perpetual Trustee Company (Canberra)
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 12</a> a sentence in a Part B statement that
"<i>Ampolex</i> maintains that the correct ratio is 1:1 and has legal advice
supporting this  position" was held by Rolfe J to be a disclosure of
the
substance of the legal advice.  His Honour rejected a suggested distinction
between the substance of the advice and the effect
of the advice, and said (at
19) that the substance could be disclosed even if the ultimate conclusion
without the reasoning process
was revealed.  It was sufficient that there was
disclosure of what the advice was.  Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was
refused
on 20 May 1996, although without relevant comment on the merit.  In
refusing a stay order  pending an application for special leave
to appeal to
the High Court, Kirby J said that it was strongly arguable that the reference
to the supporting legal advice "waived
the privilege as to the precise content
of the legal advice on that point":  his Honour observed that mere reference to
the existence
of legal advice would not amount to a waiver of its contents
(see <i>Ampolex v Perpetual Trustee Company (Canberra) Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20137%20ALR%2028" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 137 ALR
28</a> at 34.)
<P>

12   	In <i>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v
Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20153%20ALR%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 153 ALR 393</a> Goldberg J held that a
reference to a brief without its contents, or any summary of or extrapolation
of those contents, was insufficient
for disclosure of the substance.  
<P>

13   	In <i>BT Australasia Pty Ltd v. State of New South Wales
(No 7)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/294.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 294</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20153%20ALR%20722" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 153 ALR 722</a> Sackville J referred to distinctions between a
mere reference to legal advice and disclosure of its substance, and between an
expression
of view as to the likely outcome of litigation and the statement of
the substance or effect of legal advice.  His Honour observed,
with reference
to the earlier Federal Court decision of<i> Adelaide Steamship Company Ltd v
Spalvins</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/144.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 144</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20152%20ALR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 152 ALR 418</a>, that the test of loss of privilege by
disclosure of special circumstances was a quantitative test which asked whether
there had
been sufficient disclosure to warrant loss of privilege.
<P>

14   	Finally in <i>Southern Cross Airlines Holdings Ltd (in
liquidation) v Arthur Andersen &amp; Co </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/963.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 963</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 ACSR 455</a> Drummond J held
that a brief general summary of certain advice was insufficient to amount to a
disclosure of the substance of the
advice, also referring to <i>Adelaide
Steamship Company Ltd v Spalvins.  </i>His Honour did not agree with the
equation of substance and effect, saying that disclosure of the effect of a
document may occur where
only the conclusion reached has been disclosed and
that disclosure of the substance could not occur without disclosure of "both
the
conclusion and the critical (but not all the) steps by which that
conclusion was reached" (at 462).  However his Honour said that
the decision of
Rolfe J in <i>Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company (Canberra) Ltd </i>was
undoubtedly correct, and so his Honour cannot have intended that much be
disclosed by way of critical steps.
<P>

15   	This brief review of authorities, in my opinion, provides
a sound basis for the view I have already expressed, that the reference
to
instructing counsel to advise on liability was insufficient to amount to
disclosure of the substance of the otherwise privileged
communication between
Mr Kennedy and counsel.  
<P>

16   	It also means, in my opinion, that when Mr Kennedy went on
to say, albeit in summary form, what counsel had advised, there
was a
disclosure of the substance of that otherwise privileged communication between
counsel and Mr Kennedy or whoever was the recipient
of the advice.  The present
case is considerably stronger on the facts in favour of disclosure of the
substance of the advice than
was <i>Ampolex v Perpetual Trustee Company
(Canberra) Ltd</i>.  It must not be forgotten that what is subject to privilege
is the communication.  In this case, I was informed that the communication
was
both by a written advice, and by advice in conference as to which a file note
or some other record or reference was brought into
existence.  Paragraph 2 set
out above, strangely, would seem not to call for the written advice, but I do
not think any point is
taken as to that.  So far as there is a written advice
as referred to in the last sentence of para 6 of Mr Kennedy's affidavit, or
a
file note or other record of or reference to the oral advice so referred to, in
my opinion, the privilege otherwise attracted has
been lost. 
<P>

17   	AT distinguished between advice as referred to in the last
sentence of para 6 of Mr Kennedy's affidavit, on the one hand,
and what was
described as material on the content, prospects and implications of the
proposed further cross-claim, on the other hand.
 I think, the distinction is
well drawn.  All that was the subject of disclosure was the advice on the state
of the existing cross-claim
and the desirability of filing a further
cross-claim.  Nothing was disclosed as to advice on content, the material
prospects and
implications of the further cross-claim, save to the extent that
the reasons for filing a further cross-claim may have involved advice
on what
it would say and would provide to AT over and above the existing cross-claim.

<P>

18   	There is potential for uncertainty as to the dividing
line, it being a little like the proverbial elephant.  AT has masked
what it
says falls on the wrong side of the line. It would be inappropriate for me to
look at the documents in order to rule, if
that be necessary, given that I am
yet to hear the notice of motion.  I consider that the appropriate course is
for AT to reconsider
its masking in the light of what I have said in these
reasons, and make any changes which it may think are called for.  Mr Heydon
may
either accept the result of that exercise or he may not.  If he does not, he
will have to make application to another Judge for
the Judge to look at the
documents and rule, and he will need to do so quickly.
<P>

19   	I referred earlier to the possible operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 126</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  Mr Heydon submitted that he would be entitled to a wider
inspection of the documents produced because it was reasonably necessary,
in
order to have a proper understanding of the advice as described in para 6 of Mr
Kennedy's affidavit, to have regard to what counsel
said about the content,
prospects and implications of the further cross-claim.  I do not see that there
would be any room for that
on the assumption that a masking exercise in
accordance with what I have said has been appropriately carried out.  
<P>

20   	It follows that I do not think that access to the
documents referred to in para 1 should be given, but that access should
be
given to the documents referred to in para 2 to the extent I have indicated and
in principle excluding the masked portions.  
<P>
