<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>PROTECTIVE DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>TUESDAY 15 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>57/99 - DREW V H</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b> This is an application for the appointment of an interim
manager of the estate of the defendant.
<P>

2	This morning the plaintiff filed a summons seeking an order that the
defendant be declared incapable of managing his affairs and
for the usual order
to be made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a>.  The evidence is not
complete and the defendant has not been served.  Accordingly, I cannot deal
with the application on a final
basis.
<P>

3	Ms Ornelas, solicitor for the plaintiff, asks for an interim order because
she says a lot of the defendant's current problems
with aggression and
delusions comes about because he is starved of funds.  She put that funds can
only flow through to him from the
insurers of the person whom he is suing for
personal injuries, if a receiver and manager is appointed.
<P>

4	There is no provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a> for this Court to make an
interim order.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> gives a stipendiary magistrate or the Mental Health
Review Tribunal a power to make an interim order, but nothing is said about the
court.
<P>

5	The court has inherent powers under its parens patriae jurisdiction to make
orders for the benefit of persons needing protection.
 The question is,
however, how far can the court go in reckoning that a person needs protection?
Certainly the jurisdiction extends
over persons who are or who are alleged to
be mentally ill, but under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a> orders can be made
notwithstanding there is no evidence of mental illness.
<P>

6	The defendant in the instant case is forty-one years of age so there is no
question of him coming under the power to deal with
infants, as in so many of
these cases.  Further, a magistrate has decided, at least some time ago, that H
is not mentally ill within
the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983.
<P>

7	Clause xviii of the Third Charter of Justice (1823) empowers the court to
"appoint Guardians and Keepers of the persons and Estate
of natural fools and
of such as are or shall be deprived of their understanding or reason by the Act
of God so as to be unable to
govern themselves and their Estate".
<P>

8	As Powell J pointed out in<b> MN v AN</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 525</a>, 533 the
corresponding inherent jurisdiction in England extended beyond lunatics and
idiots, strictly so called, to all persons who
were "unable to act with any
proper and provident management" who were "liable to be robbed by anyone"
whether they were, strictly
speaking, insane or not because the mischief called
for as much protection as actual insanity (<b>Ridgeway v Darwin</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1802/423.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1802] EngR 423</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281802%29%208%20Ves%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1802) 8
Ves 65</a>, 66; <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1802/423.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1802] EngR 423</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20ER%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">32 ER 275</a>, 276).
<P>

9	There is thus inherent power to make an interim order to protect the estate
of a person who falls within the category referred
to by Lord Eldon in
<b>Ridgeway</b>.
<P>

10	The evidence shows that the present defendant is within that category.  The
evidence of his behaviour shows that unless he is
supplied with money he could
well be a danger to the community, but that unless his funds are controlled he
does not have sufficient
capacity to manage those moneys.
<P>

11	He is described by the psychiatrists as a person who is out of control and a
danger to the community, and they say that it is
a blot on the system that the
community is not protected from him by an order under the Mental Health Act.  I
merely record this,
I am not dealing with public protection, but rather the
protection of the estate of the defendant.
<P>

12	I am thus satisfied that there is inherent power to deal with this
application.  The next question is what needs to be established
by the
plaintiff in order to succeed.
<P>

13	Ordinarily one would expect that the application would be served on the
defendant because it is a basic rule in the Protective
Division that orders are
not made against the person or property of any defendant without that defendant
being given an opportunity
to resist the order:  <b> Re Craven </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%2018%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) 18 WN
(NSW) 243.</a>
<P>

14	Usually the only exception is where the defendant's condition may be
detrimentally affected if he or she is served<b> </b>(<b>Re Craven</b>) or
where he or she may be dangerously excited by the service: <b> Re Webb</b>
(1906) 12 OLR 194;<b>  Re Bulger </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%201%20WWR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 1 WWR 248.</a>  The mere possibility of
the process server being assaulted is insufficient reason to exempt service
(<b>Re Craven</b>).  In the instant case it would seem that the defendant's
condition may well be detrimentally affected by service before money starts
flowing through to him, so that I will proceed on this motion without service
having been effected.
<P>

15	The plaintiff must then show that there is a strongly arguable case that the
defendant is a person who falls within the class
specified by Lord Eldon in
<b>Ridgeway v Darwin </b>(supra), at least in the short term.  The evidence
need not go so far as to show that two medical practitioners or a medical
practitioner
and a psychologist consider that the defendant is incapable of
managing his or her affairs, but the evidence must at least show a
strongly
arguable case that immediate protection is needed to preserve the defendant's
property.  The evidence in the instant case
satisfies me of this.
<P>

16	Accordingly, this morning I made orders 2 and 3 in the notice of motion to
appoint an interim receiver and manager. I reserved
the question of costs and I
will continue to reserve them until the hearing.
<P>

17	I do this because whilst there is no doubt that the plaintiff's solicitor is
entitled to the costs of filing the application
and preparing the affidavit
evidence, I was not much assisted by the presentation of the material in court
and I do not want the
impression to be gained that in protective matters costs
will be awarded on the indemnity basis in every case.  The nominal plaintiff
must not be out of pocket, but I would be reluctant to order costs without
seeing an itemised account of what is proposed to be charged
against the
defendant's estate.
<P>

  
<P>

 
<P>

                                          oOo
