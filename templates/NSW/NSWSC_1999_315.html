<b>JUDGMENT  (Transfer to District Court)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Section 143 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act, 1973</a></i> provides for
the transfer of proceedings from this Court to the District Court.  Section
143(4) provides that if the plaintiff in
the proceedings applies for a transfer
of the proceedings under the section, the defendant is not permitted to oppose
the application.
 The Supreme Court however, for any reason appearing to it as
sufficient but having due regard to the provisions of s 145, (which
section
relates to the transfer of proceedings to the Supreme Court), may decline to
make the order sought.
<P>

2	It is the plaintiff who makes the application before this Court today for the
transfer of her action to the District Court.  That
being so, the position is
reached where simply the matter is either transferred or if there are reasons
appearing to be sufficient,
the Court may decline to make the order sought.
<P>

3	Whether it be necessary or not, the plaintiff has filed an affidavit by her
solicitor in support of the application deposing to
inquiries made of the
District Court registry and the Associate to Christie DCJ of that Court in
relation to the likelihood of her
action being heard in that Court as an action
"<i>ready to be heard"</i>.  The evidence indicates that on that basis the
probabilities are that it could be listed for hearing in that Court in
August.
<P>

4	The action cannot be said, as at today, 19 March 1999, to be "<i>ready for
hearing"</i> in the sense that there are some outstanding interlocutory
matters.  But, even taking that into account, in the light of the evidence,
it
seems to me that the action should be transferred and what purports to be
opposition to it, notwithstanding the terms of the section,
is rather
extraordinary.  One would think that there is anxiety in all parties that the
litigation be heard and determined if it
cannot otherwise be resolved.  One
would think that both sides would have an interest in the diligent prosecution
of any outstanding
interlocutory matters to achieve that end.  The Court would
be loathe to conclude that one side or the other would deliberately take
steps
to thwart the attainment of justice for one side or the other by a case being
listed for hearing and heard.
<P>

5	An application for expedition was made by the plaintiff before me on 2
February and declined on 17 February this year.  I do not
see anything turning
on that and I certainly  would not embark upon speculation that one of the
reasons for Ms Ieremia seeking to
have her action heard in the District Court
is to avoid an order for security for costs.  
<P>

6	As indicated during the course of submissions and discussions, the plaintiff
is the Consul-General for Greece.  Her action arises
from publications in the
press of what, as a matter of general knowledge, must be regarded as one of the
major foreign language community
publications in this State, if not in this
country.  The imputations against the plaintiff relate principally to her
conduct as a
diplomatic officer, though there are others that do not.  The
status of the plaintiff as a diplomatic officer in an action against
an
instrument of mass communication concerning imputations against her in her
professional capacity as a representative of a foreign
nation, might be
thought, in the normal course, to satisfy criteria for the retention of such a
case in this Court.  But recognition
is to be given to a right that the
plaintiff has to move the Court for an order under s 143 of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District
Court Act</a></i>.
<P>

7	It has been suggested that one reason why I would decline to order the
transfer is the status of the defendant as a cross-claimant.
 There would have
to be something extraordinary and exceptional in the circumstances of a
cross-claim for the existence of such a
process by itself to preclude the
transfer of an action brought by a plaintiff, <i>a fortiori</i> when the
subsection specifically refers to the plaintiff as the party entitled to the
relief sought.
<P>

8	Another factor that is taken into account in determining whether or not to
transfer an action and one that certainly was of importance
prior to the 1997
amendment, was the existence in this Court of the Defamation List and the
perception that it functioned smoothly
and efficiently to aid the preparation
of litigation with a view to the attainment of justice as quickly and as
efficiently as possible
(<b><i>Brown v Mirror Newspapers Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20NSWLR%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983)
2 NSWLR 80</a>;  <b><i>Haines v AFFC &amp; Anor</i></b> (Levine J, 12 December
1997);  <b><i>Murrihy v Radio 2UE Pty Limited </i></b>(Levine J, 11 November
1998)).  The District Court, whilst on the evidence before me, and I have no
other information about the matter,
does not have an equivalent list.  The
evidence indicates that there has been allocated to deal with defamation
matters, a judge
of that Court who is well-known to be experienced in this area
of the law.  
<P>

9	Shortly stated, we have a plaintiff here who wishes to have her action
transferred to the District Court.  She does so on the
basis of information
that the chances of it being heard in that Court earlier than it would be heard
in this Court, are fairly high.
 I do propose to make an order under s 143 of
the Act. 
<P>

10	It must be clear, and it is stated that at the time of the making of the
order, the action is not "<i>ready to be heard</i>" but that does not preclude
the making of the order and it certainly does not provide any basis for the
parties doing otherwise than
diligently pursuing any outstanding interlocutory
steps in the District Court.
<P>

11	I, accordingly, pursuant to s 143 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act</a></i>, order
that these proceedings be transferred to that Court.
<P>

12	An application by the plaintiff is now made for costs of  the proceedings
which I have just determined.  The section of the Act
under which the plaintiff
has succeeded, specifically excludes the defendant from opposing the
application.  The defendant was asked
by me, at Mr Littlemore's suggestion, to
offer assistance as to why I might decline to make the order.  I think it is
appropriate
that the costs order be the plaintiff's costs be costs in the
cause.
