<P>

<b>Reasons for Verdict</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The accused, John Charles Maxwell, stands charged with the
murder of Mervyn James Alchin at Wagga on 25 March 1998.
 He has been tried by
me sitting without a jury.  There is no issue that he killed the deceased.  The
only matter to be determined
is whether he was mentally ill, as the law
understands that expression, at the time of the killing.
<P>

2	The accused is now twenty-five years old and was twenty-three at the relevant
time.  He is a single man.  He had been living with
his mother at Darlington
Point.  In early 1998 he moved to Wagga  and took up residence with a lifelong
friend, Brendan Carter. 
He was an accomplished footballer and he began playing
with a local football club at Wagga.  It was in that context that he met the
deceased, Mr Alchin, who was a man of about fifty years of age who was
described as a strapper at that club.
<P>

3	On 20 March 1998 the accused had an argument with Mr Carter about his, that
is the accused's, standard of tidiness in the house.
 The accused left and
moved in with the deceased.  It was there in the early afternoon of 25 March
that he killed the deceased. 
He attacked him with a knife, inflicting a large
number of wounds.  To recount the details of the incident and of the deceased's
injuries would be needlessly distressing.  It is sufficient to say that it was
a sustained and ferocious attack.  From the injuries
and from the accused's own
account of the event I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to
kill the deceased.  His
counsel, Mr John Nicholson SC has not suggested
otherwise.  Accordingly, the elements of the crime of murder are made out.
<P>

4	To understand the circumstances it is necessary to examine the accused's
psychiatric state.  On this aspect I have the benefit
of expert evidence from
two experienced and respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr C
L Wong.
<P>

5	Dr Nielssen, in his capacity as a visiting psychiatrist with the Corrections
Health Service, treated the accused for a considerable
period of time from 1
April 1998, only a matter of days after the killing.  The history he obtained
from the accused was to the effect
that about eighteen months prior to the
killing he began to experience auditory hallucinations.  These were benign at
first but increased
in intensity.  He began to attend church and to read the
Bible and he formed the idea that passages in the Bible related to him.
Indeed, he came to believe that he was the Son of God.  
<P>

6	More significantly, the voices became demonic.  He believed that he heard the
voices of demons who wanted to kill him because
he was the Son of God.  He
believed that they had great powers and came to believe that he was in acute
and immediate danger of being
killed.
<P>

7	He had been popular and had many friends but as the illness developed he
began to withdraw from social contact, and became distrustful
even of good
friends.  Dr Nielssen also obtained from the accused a history of his use of
alcohol and drugs but I do not consider
that to be material for the purpose of
my decision today.  
<P>

8	There is some confirmation of this history in the other evidence in the case.
In a statement to police the accused's mother, Mrs
Brenda Maxwell, spoke of a
deterioration of his mental condition over the period of months leading to the
killing.  She recalled
his hallucination of a demonic figure in the fire of the
home.  He spoke of seeing demons in his bedroom. She confirmed his interest
in
religion and the Bible, which she said he had never had before, and her account
of that interest suggests it to have been obsessional.
 On one occasion he
claimed to her to be Jesus.  His mother spoke of other bizarre behaviour which
it is unnecessary to recount.
<P>

9	She became sufficiently concerned to ask him to seek treatment.  Indeed, it
seems that on her behalf an arrangement was made for
the accused to see a local
medical practitioner, Dr Robert Byrne, but he did not attend for that
appointment and he refused to seek
any treatment.  One can only wonder if the
deceased might well be alive if he had not refused.
<P>

10	Similar observations of the accused to those of his mother were made by his
friend, Brendan Carter and another lifelong friend,
Rohan King.  Both of them
spoke particularly of his religious obsession and his withdrawal from normal
social contact.  
<P>

11	I also received in evidence in the defence case the statement of Mr Geoffrey
Foster, a former police officer, who knew the accused
through his interest in
rugby league.  Mr Foster is himself a religious man.   He said that the accused
had never been religious
and spoke of his new involvement in the Bible as
"unguided and misinterpreted".  It is clear that Mr Foster had held the accused
in very high regard as a person and sportsman, but he described his behaviour
in the period leading to the killing as spiralling
downwards.
<P>

12	On the night before the killing, 24 March, Brendan Carter visited the
accused at the deceased's home, having heard that he was
unwell.  The accused
told Mr Carter that he had been having really bad headaches.  Mr Carter visited
him again, twice on the day
of the killing.  On the second occasion, in the
early afternoon, the accused came to the door holding a knife.  He was pale.
He told
Mr Carter not to come in and said that he was "freaking out".  Mr
Carter asked if he was all right but the accused slammed the door.
 Mr Carter
could hear him mumbling in the house but could not decipher what he was
saying.
<P>

13	Tragically, the deceased came home from work early that day because he was
feeling sick.  It was when he arrived at the home
in the early afternoon that
he met his death.  What happened is encapsulated in the history which the
accused gave Dr Nielssen and
I quote from pp 2 and 3 of Dr Nielssen's report,
exhibit 2:
<P>

	He said that Mr Alchin came home soon after Mr Carter left, and went to the
toilet in the laundry before coming into the house.
 Mr Maxwell said he
believed Mr Alchin's delay in coming into the house arose from preparations to
kill him, and caused him to arm
himself with a knife and stab Mr Alchin to
death when he came into the house.
<P>

14	I pass over the next sentence and the beginning of the one after it and,
starting in mid-sentence, the doctor continued:
<P>

	...the immediate reason for attacking Mr Alchin was that the voices told him
that Mr Alchin planned to kill him.  He said that
after stabbing Mr Alchin he
took his car and attempted suicide by crashing it into a tree.  However, he
said the car spun into a
paddock and he escaped uninjured and was treated at
the roadside before his arrest, where he again heard voices urging him to kill
the people attending him.
<P>

15	His mother said in her statement that in the late morning of that day the
accused phoned her and said that he was "stressing
out".  It appeared to her
from the telephone conversation that he was then hearing voices.  
<P>

16	The accused made full admissions to police of what he had done.  In an
electronically recorded interview in answer to question
62 he said that when he
drove at the tree he wanted to kill himself, rather than someone else, but that
he missed the tree.
<P>

17	Mrs Mavis Menz saw this course of driving, which by her description was
quite erratic, and she saw the car veer on to the paddock
where it came to
rest.  She went to the accused's assistance.  She said that the accused looked
vacant and did not appear to understand
her when she spoke to him.   He spoke
of wanting to go to "Joyland". The accused told an ambulance officer who
attended the scene,
Mr Colin Apps, that he meant to hit the tree and he
admitted to Mr Apps that he had killed a man.  
<P>

18	At the hospital to Det Senior Const Burns the accused said, "I have killed
him.  I am in hell now."  To Det Inspector Bernasconi
at the hospital he said:
"I'm fucked man. The devil made me do it. I killed the cunt and I will kill
someone else. No reason, just
the devil."
<P>

19	In the course of the recorded interview with police the accused's
description of events revealed the same delusional pattern
which he had
described to Dr Nielssen.  Indeed, in answer to a series of questions
commencing at question 203, he said that from
the previous day he had been
scared to leave the house because the voices told him he was to be killed.  In
answer to question 80,
he said that he did not know why he killed the deceased,
he was just "a pawn".
<P>

20	For the most part during that interview his answers were responsive to
questions but some answers were unresponsive and bizarre,
consistent with his
religious fantasy, and his answer to one of the questions, question 138,
suggests that he was hearing voices
in the course of the interview itself.
<P>

21	He later took part in what is known as a walk through of the scene which was
video taped and that video was shown in court yesterday.
<P>

22	When Dr Nielssen first saw him in custody, only days after the offence, he
described him as floridly psychotic.  He said his
condition improved only after
what he described as enforced medication.  
<P>

23	In the video of the walk through interview the doctor saw, as he described
in evidence, clear signs of mental illness, although
he noted that the
accused's demeanour was much more subdued than it had been when he saw him in
prison.  He saw this as explained
by the fact that during that walk through the
accused was accompanied by a number of police officers and was responding to
questions
asked of him.
<P>

24	Let me turn then to the law relating to the defence of mental illness.   The
Crown having proved the elements of murder beyond
reasonable doubt, the burden
of proof shifts to the accused to satisfy me on the balance of probability that
he was mentally ill
at the relevant time.
<P>

25	The leading legal authority on mental illness is still the reported summing
up of the former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir
Owen Dixon, in <i>R v
Porter</i>, a trial which took place in 1933 but the summing-up of which was
reported some years later in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=55%20CLR%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">55 CLR 182.</a>  In some ways, Sir Owen Dixon's
language is the language of the thirties but what his Honour said remains as
true today as it was
then.  Speaking of the rationale of the defence of mental
illness, his Honour said this at p186:
<P>

	The purpose of the law in punishing people is to prevent others from
committing a like crime or crimes.  Its prime purpose is to
deter people from
committing offences.  It may be that there is an element of retribution in the
criminal law so that when people
have committed offences the law considers that
they merit punishment, but its prime purpose is to preserve society from the
depredations
of dangerous and vicious people.  Now, it is perfectly useless for
the law to attempt, by threatening punishment, to deter people
from committing
crimes if their mental condition is such that they cannot be in the least
influenced by the possibility or probability
of subsequent punishment; if they
cannot understand what they are doing or cannot understand the ground upon
which the law proceeds.
 The law is not directed, as medical science is, to
curing mental infirmities.
<P>

26	At p188 his Honour gave the time honoured definition of the defence of
mental illness in law:  there must be a state of disease
or disorder or mental
disturbance arising from some infirmity, temporary or of long standing.  It
must be of such a character as
to prevent the accused from knowing the physical
nature of the act he was doing or from knowing that what he was doing was
wrong.
 It is the second leg of that twofold definition that is relied on here.
It is not suggested that the accused was unaware that he
was stabbing a man,
and doing so fatally, but it is urged that his mental illness was such that he
was prevented from knowing that
what he was doing was wrong.
<P>

27	Sir Owen Dixon expanded upon that concept a little later in the summing up
at pp189-190.  His Honour said this:
<P>

	If through the disordered condition of the mind he (that is, the accused)
could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree
of sense and composure
it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong.  What
is meant by "wrong"?  What is
meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the
everyday standards of reasonable people.
<P>

28	I have the evidence of two eminent forensic psychiatrists whose opinions are
that the defence is made out.  Properly and responsibly,
the Crown Prosecutor
has not submitted to the contrary, although she has taken that stance only
after a careful consideration of
the evidence and a brief but searching
cross-examination of Dr Nielssen yesterday.  Nevertheless, the decision remains
one for me,
assisted as I am by the stance taken by counsel, and I must examine
the psychiatric opinions in the light of the whole of the evidence.
 
<P>

29	Before I turn to the psychiatric evidence what I can say is this, the other
evidence establishes that the accused was only recently
acquainted with the
deceased.  There is no suggestion of any animosity between them.  Nothing in
the evidence points to any rational
motive for the accused having attacked the
deceased particularly with such savagery.
<P>

30	I gather from the evidence that the accused has no prior convictions and
that he was normally not an aggressive person.  I have
referred already to the
statement of Mr Geoffrey Foster, the former police officer, that he was a young
man of impeccable character.
 The observations of his mother and of the other
witnesses to whom I have referred makes it clear that his mental condition was
deteriorating
seriously in the period leading to the killing.  All these
matters lend force to the conclusions of the psychiatrists. 
<P>

31	Both psychiatrists diagnose schizophrenia, a very serious mental illness. In
evidence yesterday Dr Nielssen recited, from the
history of the accused's
behaviour in the months leading up to the killing, the classic symptoms of that
terrible disease.  Dr Nielssen's
conclusion was this, and I read from pp5-6 of
the report:
<P>

	Mr Maxwell is a twenty-four year old man who killed a man he had only recently
met as a result of symptoms arising from an acute
episode of psychotic illness.
The psychosis was characterised by eighteen months escalation of full syndrome
of schizophreniform
symptoms, including delusions of reference, thought
broadcasting and vivid, frightening auditory hallucinations.  Mr Maxwell had
never previously been treated for mental illness or had any alternative
explanation for his symptoms presented to him and believed
at the time of the
offence that the victim planned to kill him.  There was no provocation or any
kind of rational basis for wanting
to harm Mr Alchin.
<P>

	The corroborative statements confirm that Mr Maxwell underwent a morbid change
in the months before the offence, characterised
by withdrawal from company and
a preoccupation with religious themes.
<P>

32	I pass over the next sentence and continue:
<P>

	He had no history of any kind of criminal conviction and although he was a
semi-professional footballer, according to the statements
provided he was not
known as an aggressive or violent person.  
<P>

	I believe Mr Maxwell has the mental illness defence open to him as he had a
defect of reason, that is a belief that the victim
was planning to kill him
owing to a disease of the mind, that is acute schizophrenia.  Mr Maxwell
probably knew the nature and quality
of his act as the voices told him to kill
the victim and other people.  However, he was not aware that the act was
morally wrong
as he believed that the world was populated by demons with
superhuman powers who planned to kill him because he was the son of God.
Moreover, the effects of an acute psychotic episode of the type observed in Mr
Maxwell made it impossible for him to reason with
a moderate degree of
calmness.
<P>

33	Dr Nielssen in oral evidence encapsulated his opinion by saying that the
accused was acting in a kind of self-defence because
of his delusional
beliefs.
<P>

34	Dr Wong in his report, part of exhibit A, expressed his opinion in this way
and I read from pp4-5 of his report:
<P>

	There is no doubt that the accused was suffering from acute symptoms of
Schizophrenia at the time of the alleged killing and for
about one and a half
years prior to that.  These consisted predominantly of delusions, largely of a
persecutory nature, and auditory
hallucinations.
<P>

35	I pass over a number of sentences and continue:
<P>

	The symptoms he manifested are highly characteristic of the illness.  The
account he gave me is in keeping with the observations
by his mother and his
friend Brendan.  It is also consistent with the account he gave to the police
at the record of interview. 
I have no reason to believe that the accounts he
gave were anything but genuine.
<P>

	The accused was aware of what he was doing and that what he was doing was
wrong at the time of the alleged killing.  However, being
consumed with his
delusional beliefs and hallucinations and in the grip of intense fear
engendered by his abnormal experiences, it
could not be said that he was able
to reason about the rightness and wrongness of his alleged act with any degree
of sense and composure.
 I am therefore of the opinion that he can avail
himself of the defence of mental illness.
<P>

36	After examining all the evidence, and giving appropriate weight to the
opinions of the two experts, I am satisfied that the defence
of mental illness
has been made out to the requisite standard.  Indeed, in my view, no other view
could possibly be taken of the
evidence.  In arriving at that conclusion I have
regard to the consequences of the special verdict of not guilty by reason of
mental
illness, as I am required to do by s37 of the <i>Mental Health (Criminal
Procedure) Act </i>1990.  Dr Nielssen gave evidence of those consequences
yesterday.
<P>

37	My verdict is that the accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness.
<P>

38	I turn now to the order which I must make.  In the light of my verdict, I
order that the accused be detained at the Long Bay
Prison Hospital or at such
other place as may from time to time be determined by the Minister for Health
until released by due process
of law.  
<P>

39	The Court extends its deepest sympathy to all those affected by the loss of
the deceased.
