<P>

<b>J<u>UDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

 1___	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> In this matter the Plaintiff, Neil MacDonald seeks the
following orders against the Defendants.
<P>

 2___	1) A declaration that the Plaintiff is not liable to pay the fees of the
Defendants incurred in the course of acting for the
Plaintiff in District Court
proceedings at Sydney No. 2787 of 1989.
<P>

2) An order that the Determinations as to Costs made by Mr. Leonard Hattersley,
Costs Assessor, on 30 October 1998 in Applications
for Assessment of Costs Nos.
14392 of 1995 and 14393 of 1995, be set aside.
<P>

 3___	The Plaintiff relies on two affidavits in support of the relief sought,
namely an affidavit by Mr. Alan Robert Connolly, sworn
on 1<sup>st</sup>
February 1999, and an affidavit of Christopher Gordon Price, an employed
solicitor of Mr. Connolly, dated 1<sup>st</sup> February 1999. The Defendants
have not filed any affidavits in reply. 
<P>

 4___	This matter has a long history.  The Plaintiff was a litigant in the
District Court when he and his mother, Doreen MacDonald
were sued by Elizabeth
Aleksanian. The Defendants then practising as Benjafields Coral and Shanahan
were his solicitors and Mr. Alan
Connolly was acting for Mrs. MacDonald.
<P>

 5___	Mrs.Aleksanian was a client of M. A. MacDonald &amp; Co, an accountancy
firm, she sued the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff's Mother,
Doreen MacDonald, who,
I understand, was the proprietor of the firm, and the Plaintiff was the
consultant to the firm. The cause
of action was alleged negligent professional
advice given to Mrs. Aleksanian by the Plaintiff.  
<P>

 6___	The Plaintiff in these proceedings issued a Third Party Notice to C.E.
Heath, Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Ltd (C.E.
Heath) seeking
indemnity against his liability to Elizabeth Aleksanian under a policy of
accountants professional indemnity insurance
which indemnity at that point of
time had been refused by C.E. Heath. From the correspondence annexed to the
Plaintiff's affidavit
it appears the policy was in the name of Mrs. MacDonald.
The proceedings by Mrs. Aleksanian were settled on   20<sup>th</sup> April
1994, the second day of the Hearing in the District Court by both the Plaintiff
and Mrs. MacDonald.  The Third Party proceedings
were then stood over until
28<sup>th</sup> September 1994.  It was some time later that Mr. Connolly at
the request of the Plaintiff rang Mr. Peter Benjafield and  arranged
a meeting
to discuss the Defendant's cost bills which had  already been rendered for work
performed up to that time.
<P>

 7___	It appears on 13<sup>th</sup> September 1994 together with Mr. Price, an
employed solicitor of Mr. Connolly, Mr. Connolly attended the offices of the
Defendants
at Chatswood and there conferred with Mr. Peter Benjafield, the
first named Defendant. Mr. Connolly then informed Mr. Benjafield
that the
Plaintiff was in serious financial difficulties and was finding it extremely
difficult to pay the Defendants fees and then
said:
<P>

<i>"And is not sure he can afford to keep instructing you"</i>
<P>

 8___	Mr. Connolly  then went on to state that if the Plaintiff lost his claim
against Heaths he wanted the Defendants to forgo
their fees already
incurred,(see paragraph 8).<i> </i>On the face of it, this was a startling
request.
<P>

 9___	On examining that paragraph and other correspondence annexed to the
affidavit of Mr. Connolly, it appeared to me that the
suggested agreement about
fees related to the payment of fees in respect to the Third Party action, not
the whole of the fees that
had been incurred. That is I say, is further
highlighted by correspondence annexed to Mr. Connolly's affidavit, for example
the Defendants
letter to Mr. Connolly, annexure F to the affidavit in which
that very matter was alleged. The writer concluded his remarks by the
following
terms:
<P>

<i>"To suggest anything else as you have done is ludicrous and insulting,
remembering it was only at your request that we acted for Mr.
MacDonald."</i>
<P>

(See also annexure F to Mr. Connolly's affidavit.)
<P>

 10___	It appears initially Mr. Connolly was acting for both parties and when
it became apparent it may have been a conflict of
interest he asked the
Defendants to act on behalf of the Plaintiff. I am satisfied on the material
before me, annexed to the affidavit
of Mr. Connolly, that he kept a very close
interest in the proceedings, this in particular appears from the statutory
declaration
sworn in the cost assessment of Mr. Antoneas, page 100 of the
annexures.
<P>

 11___	 In the light of that matter I then sought from Mr. Gray of Counsel
representing the Defendants in the presence of Counsel
for the Plaintiff in my
chambers for a clarification of that question.  Mr. Gray said it was always
understood that the agreement
in question related not only to the fees likely
to be incurred in the future in respect to the Third Party proceedings but to
all
fees incurred in the action. Whilst that concession was made it does not
appear to be supported by the attitude of the Defendants
up to and including
the assessment of costs in this matter.  In these circumstances, however, I
proceed to consider the matter on
that basis. 
<P>

 12___	Mr. Benjafield indicated to Mr. Connolly he was not handling the matter
as Mr. David Milne his partner was looking after
the matter and he was
overseas.  He said in Mr. Milne's absence the matter was being handled by  Mr.
Antoneas and he  had left the
left the Defendants employ.
<P>

 13___	 Mr. Connolly then alleged he put the facts of the case against Heath to
Mr. Benjafield and stated in his opinion that C.E.
Heath would be unable to
deny liability, see paragraph 9, Mr. Benjafield, apparently was not so
enthusiastic as in paragraph 11 said:
<P>

<i>"I don't think I would agree with your view that Neil MacDonald's prospects
are so good."</i>
<P>

 14___	Mr. Connolly then went on the attack and stated that he was unhappy with
the quality of legal service provided to Neil MacDonald
by the Defendants since
a Mr. Colin Mitty had left the firm. Since that time  he alleged he had been
dealt with unsatisfactorily
and the costs charged were said to be considerably
excessive, Mr. Benjafield said that he did not know about that, but Mr.
Connolly
went on to state that the Plaintiff believed there was a lot of wasted
time, that they were not happy with Mr. Antoneas command of
issues and the
Plaintiff was concerned that he Mr. Antoneas was not clear as to the
Plaintiff's case against Heaths, Mr. Connolly
then said:
<P>

<i>"These issues may in due course have to be fended, if there is not some
agreement put in place between you and me."</i>
<P>

<i>If there was an agreement, it might include Neil abandoning any complaint
putting in issue the professional competence of  your firm
or the quantum of
the costs you have charged him.  In exchange for Neil abandoning possible
claims of professional incompetence and
overcharging there should be an
agreement that Benjafields would demand the costs only in the event Neil
MacDonald is successful
in his claim against the insurer and in that events he
is not successful there should be no fee, Neil cannot afford your fees if
he
loses he can only keep instructing you if you agree he won't have to pay your
fees if he loses.  Neil will also have an appeal
from the judgment if he
loses."</i>
<P>

 ( See paragraph 10.)
<P>

 15___	Mr. Benjafield in reply said he was concerned about the payment of
Counsels fees whereupon Mr. Connolly gave an undertaking
that Counsels fees
would be paid regardless of the outcome of the case, he then went on to say:
<P>

<i>" When we're talking about your fees we're talking about the bills you have
already sent Neil that he has yet to pay as well as the
fees you'll incur from
now on until the Hearing. If you continue acting for Neil we will act as your
Agents to prepare the matter
for the Hearing and instruct Counsel."</i>
<P>

 16___	Mr. Benjafield replied that although David Milne was overseas he could
make a decision on this, (see paragraph 11), he then
said: 
<P>

<i>"I'll go along with what you propose, we will be prepared to abandon our
costs if Neil MacDonald is unsuccessful in his claim against
your insurance
company."</i>
<P>

 17___	As part of the agreement Mr. Benjafield sought an undertaking that if
there was  an appeal in the event of the Plaintiff
being unsuccessful in the
Third Party claim.
<P>

 18___	Mr. Connolly confirmed the agreement by letter to the Defendants,
December 1994, annexure A to his affidavit. Mr. Benjafield
replied  in which he
confirmed <i>"most of the details set out in annexure B".</i>
<P>

 19___	 On the 21<sup>st</sup> September Mr. Benjafield said that he would
stick to the agreement in the letter but only be happy if Doreen and Neil
MacDonald were
on the brink of financial collapse and he sought from Mr.
Connolly a  statement as to the assets and liabilities of the Plaintiff
and his
Mother, ( see paragraph 16 of Mr. Connolly's affidavit). Mr. Connolly informed
Mr. Benjafield that he was instructed by the
Plaintiff and his Mother that
their liabilities exceeded their assets. 
<P>

 20___	Mr. Connolly then informed Mr. Benjafield: "<i>that Neil also confirmed
today that he would accept your fees only if you risked them against the
results of the case,"</i> Mr. Benjafield said <i>"well, Alan will take the risk
if you lose you will appeal",</i> I do not understand quite what is meant by
the phrase <i>"he would except your fees."(</i> See paragraph 18.)
<P>

 21___	Unfortunately for the Plaintiff on 20<sup>th</sup> December 1994 Judge
Garling of the District Court gave judgment  in favour of C.E. Heath,(see
paragraph 19 of Mr. Connolly's affidavit).
Mr. Connolly then acted on  behalf
of the Plaintiff on an appeal to the Court of Appeal which was lost  and he
then sought special
leave to the High Court which was refused.
<P>

 22___	A dispute then arose between the parties about the matter, the
Defendants alleging they were not bound by the agreement negotiated
with Mr.
Connolly and Mr. Connolly asserting to the contrary. It not necessary to go
through this large volume of correspondence
as I was not referred to much of it
by way of submissions by Counsel. There are some matters, however, that should
be highlighted
that show to me the unusual situation that has developed in this
case. I have already referred to the assertions in annexure F to
Mr. Connolly's
affidavit.
<P>

 23___	In the ultimate as agreement could not be reached between the parties on
the question of costs, the Defendants then instituted
proceedings in the Local
Court to recover the costs incurred before the Third Party Hearing took place,
the matter was stood over
generally to enable a bill of costs to be served and
the costs to be assessed.
<P>

 24___	There were arguments on the quantum, the outstanding fees  to
8<sup>th</sup> August which was initially said to be in the sum of $13,793.36,
annexure C. It then appeared the claim by the Defendants at October
1995 was
$17,828.01. Mr. Connolly then put the Defendant on notice that he was objecting
to the difference between the bills, he
again set out at some length the
alleged agreement between himself and Mr. Benjafield. Criticism was also made
of Mr. Antoneas and
his approach to the case. In a reply the Defendants
(30<sup>th</sup> October 1995), annexure L, Mr. Connolly's affidavit  again
denied Mr. Connolly's interpretation of the agreement. It was further
pointed
out by the writer, the Plaintiff had been made aware by Mr. Milne in August
1994 as to  Mr. Milne's view as to costs, it
was alleged the Plaintiff then
sought to discontinue action against the insurer but at Mr. Connolly's behest
he changed his mind
and continued with the action. This is again further
material to suggest that Mr. Connolly was keeping a very close eye on the
litigation.

<P>

 25___	Eventually an application for assessment of costs was filed in the
Registry on 9<sup>th</sup> November 1995, the Cost Assessor, Mr. Hattersley
then became involved and wrote on 19<sup>th</sup> July 1996 to Connolly and Co.
in which he sought information as to the state of the appeal as he regarded it
as important because
of the disputed terms between the parties that had been
referred to, annexure S.
<P>

 26___	He also sought information on certain matters in particular:
<P>

 1) <i>"were those separate accounts or any of them disputed by your
client".</i> Mr. Connolly replied, annexure T, that his client did not dispute
any of the separate accounts, it was then submitted that the cost
question
should await the outcome of the appeal which had not then been decided. In a
letter  of 4<sup>th</sup> June 1997 Mr. Connolly informed the Defendants that
the Court of Appeal on 9<sup>th</sup> May 1997 dismissed the appeal, annexure
C.C., were informed that Connollys' were making an application for leave to
appeal to the
Hight Court. That application was refused, see letter
12<sup>th</sup> December 1997 from Connolly and Co. to Mr. Hattersley, annexure
E.E. 
<P>

 27___	The assessment of costs then came before Mr. Hattersley, Mr. Benjafield
swore a statutory declaration dated 17<sup>th</sup> August 1998, in which he
agreed a conference took place about the Plaintiff's action under the insurance
policy, he said that his
understanding was that a decision was required from
the firm, if it continued to act and it advised the Plaintiff that they would
cease to act unless the fees were paid, see annexure to Mr. Connolly's
affidavit at p.121. In the declaration in paragraph 6, he
said to the best of
his recollection he agreed with Mr. Connolly that the firm would continue
nominally to represent Mr. MacDonald
but all labour and costs being provided
and met by A.R. Connolly and Co.  He said it was the wish of Mr. MacDonald to
determinate
the proceedings at that time and not incur any further costs, but
it was Mr. Connolly's opinion, apparently, that there was more
than an arguable
case on this question. He stated his view to Mr. Connolly that Mr. MacDonald
would lose.
<P>

 28___	He said it was not his intention to give away any fees already incurred
but to delay recovery to allow the proceedings to
continue and that  such
intention was conveyed to A.R.Connolly, it was further intended to put at risk
any further fees which the
firm might incur from that day forward, ie. from
September 1994.(See annexure iii page 21).
<P>

 29___	 Mr. Connolly alleges the statutory declaration was not served on his
firm until 15<sup>th</sup> October 1998 after he had provided his statutory
declaration on 19<sup>th</sup> August 1998, and thus the assessor did not have
his responses,( see paragraph 22.C).
<P>

 30___	The assessor in his reasons of  30<sup>th</sup> October 1998, annexure
K.K.K., stated: 
<P>

<i>"The Defendant sought to recover costs at the rate of $195.00 per hour based
on a retainer agreement"</i>
<P>

 31___	He upheld that agreement and assessed the costs on that basis. It
appears the Plaintiff had paid part of the costs, Mr. Hattersley
reduced the
claim as to time spent  by the Defendants by 14.5 hours or a reduction of
$195.00 per hour of $2827.50, the disbursements
claim was $6362.36, the total
assessment was $18,520.61, the Plaintiff having paid $9031.00 leaving a balance
of $9501.61 payable.
<P>

 32___	He then referred to the question of the alleged agreement made between
Mr. Connolly and Mr. Benjafield on behalf of the Plaintiff,
in doing so he
referred to the statutory declarations made, and accepted the evidence  and the
explanations of the Defendants as
being more probable in all the circumstances.
He then made a finding that the Plaintiff owed the Defendants the sum of
<b>$</b>9507.61 plus a filing fee of $153.48, a total of <b>$</b>9661.09
<P>

 33___	An appeal was lodged by the Plaintiff against the decision pursuant to
Section <b>208 L</b> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a></b>. The affidavits in
this matter were also filed in that appeal, the matter came before Sperling J.
on 3<sup>rd</sup> February 1999 and His Honour took the view that fresh
evidence in the appeal was not allowable, (<b>s</b>.<b>208L of the Act)</b>.
Consequently His Honour refused to allow the affidavits to be read. His Honour
then came to the conclusion there was sufficient
evidence before Mr. Hattersley
to support the facts as alleged by the Defendants and went on to assess
costs.
<P>

 34___	Sperling J. then considered the question of consideration in the alleged
agreement. His Honour said, p. 3:
<P>

<i>"The consideration was that the Defendants stood to gain the benefit of the
fees to be earned in the event that Mr. MacDonald was
successful in the
litigation, by "to be earned" </i>
<P>

I mean to be earned after the asserted conversation between the
solicitors<b>:</b>
<P>

<i>"Had the Defendants not made the agreement on the Plaintiff's case it would
have been open to the Plaintiff to go elsewhere for legal
representation,
subsequent to the dialogue between the solicitors."</i>
<P>

 35___	His Honour then dismissed the appeal. This amended summons was then
filed under <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> of the Act </b>which permits fresh evidence to be
adduced in the appeal.
<P>

 36___	This is quite an extraordinary case, as I have pointed out earlier.
There were assertions in the correspondence by the Defendants
that any
agreement as to costs related to future costs that one could well understand in
those circumstances the cost assessor finding
on the balance of probabilities
that that was more likely to be the agreement than the one referred to by Mr.
Connolly. Mr. Benjafield
has not sought to contest the material filed on behalf
of the Plaintiff, thus the material in Mr. Connolly's affidavit is accepted.
<P>

 37___	No point is taken as to my power to set aside the costs order and no
argument is put in favour of the costs assessor finding
or otherwise. The only
point taken by the Defendant is that the contract between Connolly on behalf of
the Plaintiff and Mr. Benjafield
on behalf of the Defendants is that it is
unenforceable because there has been a total failure of consideration
<P>

 38___	It is important to note that the statement of the ground under <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
51A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 5</a></b> is annexed to the further amended summons, once again it causes
difficulties in interpreting just what did happen in this case, in
paragraph
three of the statement it was said:
<P>

<i>"In consideration of the Defendants agreeing to forgo their fees for acting
on behalf of the Plaintiff in District Court proceedings
at Sydney NO. 2787/89
in the event that the Plaintiff's claim against the Third Party professional
insurer failed the Plaintiff agreed
to continue using the services of the
Defendants and to pursue with other solicitors an appeal from the Judgment in
the District
Court if the Judgment was against the Plaintiff and in favour of
the Third Party professional indemnity insurer."</i>
<P>

<b>51A <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 5</a> is in the following terms:</b>
<P>

<i>`The Plaintiff shall file and serve with or subscribe to the summons
instituting the appeal a brief but specific statement of the
grounds relied
upon in support of the appeal and as to whether the appeal is from the whole or
part only and what part of the decision
to the Tribunal below."</i>
<P>

 39___	It is alleged by the Plaintiff that the costs assessor erred a) in
concluding that no agreement  alleged  by the Plaintiff
was reached on
13<sup>th</sup> September 1994 between Messrs A.R. Connolly and Company on
behalf of the Plaintiff and Messrs Benjafield Milne, and b) by failing
to find
that there was an agreement between Messrs A.R. Connolly and Company on behalf
of the Plaintiff and Messrs Benjafield Milne
that the Plaintiff would not be
required to pay the fees to Messrs Benjafield Milne for their work for the
Plaintiff in the District
Court proceedings No. 2787/89. 
<P>

 40___	The point taken by Mr. Gray, is that there is no consideration passing
to the Defendants on the terms of the contracts alleged.
In other words, his
submission is to the effect that there was no enforceable contract at the date
of the conversation between Mr.
Connolly and Mr. Benjafield on 13<sup>th</sup>
September 1994. The basis of his submission is that the District Court
proceedings had two components: firstly the claim by Mrs.
Aleksanian against
the Plaintiff and his Mother: and secondly the claim for indemnity against C.E.
Heath. The proceedings in respect
to Mrs. Aleksanian were settled by both the
Plaintiff and his Mother in April 1994, the proceedings against C.E. Heath were
stood
over from April to September. After the settlement, the Defendants
submitted their accounts for professional costs and disbursements.
Exhibit
W.W., Mr. Connolly's affidavit, these three accounts were rendered in respect
to professional work and disbursements occurred
up to that date, it is
submitted the amounts therefore had been earned for work done.
<P>

 41___	Mr. Connolly in paragraph 8 of his affidavit asserts he is acting for
the Plaintiff, the important point, it is submitted,
is that the proposal that
Mr. Connolly put to Mr. Benjafield is that:
<P>

<i>"You will continue acting for Mr. MacDonald when the Hearing resumes on
28<sup>th</sup> September."</i>
<P>

 42___	Mr. Gray points out that in Mr. Connolly's affidavit, annexure A, in
paragraph 3 he states:
<P>

<i>"We also note your agreement that we act as your Agents in preparing the
matter for Hearing and briefing and instructing Counsel for
the remainder of
the proceedings."</i>
<P>

 43___	Mr. Gray submits what Mr. Connolly was saying, or indeed what happened
is that his firm effectively took over the whole of
the work in the case, the
Defendants did nothing.  On that basis the agreement Mr. Connolly propounds is
that the Defendants give
up their unqualified entitlement to the fees they have
already earned and in exchange for fees owing on a contingency basis, in other
words it is submitted, the benefit to Mr. MacDonald is that instead of having
an unqualified liability to pay the fees, he now has
a qualified liability to
only pay them if he wins the case.  Mr. Gray posed the rhetorical question<i>:
"What do  the Defendants get out of the agreement?"</i> And he answers it by
saying: <i>"Nothing."  </i>The position he submits was  that they were not
going to continue to act unless they were paid the fees already owing by the
Plaintiff.
The Plaintiff claims they were not paid because they entered into
this agreement instead. The agreement, however, provided Mr. Connolly
would do
all the future work, I infer in those circumstances that Mr. Connolly would
have been paid for the work he did if the Plaintiff
 had  won the case, seeing
the Defendants did nothing further in the case. 
<P>

 44___	Mr. Gray submitted that the costs assessor sought certain answers as to
what was in issue, on this question of costs I referred
to this matter earlier,
the answer from Mr. Connolly was  that none of the accounts were disputed. Mr.
MacDonald, Mr. Gray then submits
gave up nothing, and that the agreement was
all one way, all the benefits went to Mr. MacDonald who ceased to have the
unconditional
obligation to pay.  Mr. Morahan, on behalf of the Plaintiff
submits there is consideration, but that alleged consideration goes outside
the
terms of the contract pleaded. He submitted, referring to paragraph 3 of a
forbearance to sue it is also submitted the consideration
is further in them
remaining instructed and retaining the rights that that entails, namely that
they would continue working on the
matter and take it to its ultimate. What
rights in effect were reflected in working on the case is not easily
perceived.
<P>

 45___	It is also submitted that the Plaintiff had paid approximately $9,000.00
odd towards their costs.
<P>

 46___	Even if I were to consider the question of forbearance to sue for
alleged incompetency, Mr. Gray submitted there is no substance
in that
allegation. Mr. Gray in his submission referred to the statutory declaration by
Mr. Connolly on 1<sup>st</sup> August 1998, page 98 of the annexures to his
affidavit. At this point the case had been settled and that of Mrs. MacDonald,
each
paying $20,000.00 to the Plaintiff, the terms applied to both and Mr.
Connolly was acting for her.
<P>

 47___	It is readily apparent that Mr. Connolly was really the one advising the
Plaintiff at this point of the case, this becomes
readily apparent when one
reads the statutory declaration of Mr. Antoneas.
<P>

 48___	In his declaration Mr. Connolly (19<sup>th</sup> August 1998 annexure
AAA(a) page 98 of the annexures to his affidavit), he raises specifically  the
competence of the solicitor handling
the matter on behalf of the Defendant and
made a serious wide-ranging attack on this person's competence, (see paragraph
10), not
only did he make that allegation, but also made the allegation that
the costs charged were considerably excessive,(see paragraph
18 of that
declaration).
<P>

 49___	In answer, to the above, Mr. Antoneas in a statutory declaration sworn
on 4<sup>th</sup> September 1998, annexure GGG (a) page 112 of the annexures to
Mr. Connolly's affidavit, he set out his considerable experience in
the law. It
is to be noted he formed a belief which I believe is well-founded that the
Plaintiff was keeping Mr. Connolly advised
as to the preparation of the case,
(see para 13.b). He advised the Plaintiff that his chances of success were slim
(see para 6).
Furthermore the Plaintiff expressed satisfaction for the work Mr.
Antoneas had performed ( para 13, in particular para 13.c). There
was no reply
to this statutory declaration as far as I can ascertain.
<P>

 50___	On the face of the material that I have before me there is no basis for
the wild allegations made by Mr. Connolly as to the
competence of Mr. Antoneas.
It also appears both Mr. Benjafield and Mr. Antoneas had a much better
appreciation of the legal problems
involved in the claim for indemnity against
C.E.Heath than did Mr. Connolly. In those circumstances I find it hard to
accept that
there is any basis in any alleged promise to forgo to sue the
Defendants. I point out this was not alleged in the pleadings in this
matter
.
<P>

 51___	On the question of the total failure of consideration  I was not
referred to authority.
<P>

 52___	Consideration is something that must have some value in the law, but it
need not be of equivalent value. In <i>Curry -v-Misa</i> <b>1875 10 LR 10 ex at
153 at 162:</b>
<P>

<i>"A valuable consideration in the eyes of the law may consist either in some
right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party
or some forbearance
detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the
other."</i>
<P>

 53___	It must be conceded that the authorities show that the consideration may
be tenuous in the extreme, see for example <i>Carlill -v-Carbolic</i>
<i>Smokeball Company</i> <b>1892 2 Q.B.D. at 424.</b>
<P>

 54___	The Courts, however, have found in certain circumstances that there is
no consideration and the worth of the apparent undertaking
is illusory.
<P>

 55___	In this matter I have come to the conclusion that there was a total
failure of consideration on the terms of the contract
as alleged in the
pleading. I fail to see the advantage accruing to the <b>Plaintiff</b> in
agreeing to the terms of this contract in consideration being that they remain
as solicitors on the record. In my view that was
a total illusory
consideration, it would be different if they were to do the work as solicitor
because then it may be argued the
consideration was the additional fees that
would accrue as a result of them being retained. Realistically the agreement,
however,
was that Mr. Connolly was to do all the work, including the briefing
of Counsel and I infer from that he would be paid for that work.
In those
circumstances there would be no benefit to the Defendants remaining on the
record.
<P>

 56___	Even if I am wrong in concluding that the agreement I should consider is
the one pleaded I would not have found the allegations
of Mr. Connolly of
negligence in the handling of the matter because to be such as to provide
consideration on the material before
me there was no basis for these
allegations. As I pointed out earlier Mr. Connolly's client also settled on the
basis of Mr. MacDonald's
settlement. Any alleged negligent professional work
only related to the action against Mr. Heath of Heath &amp; Co. which was taken
over by Mr. MacDonald.  
<P>

 57___	The orders sought in the further Amended Summons filed pursuant to leave
granted by Sperling J are dismissed with costs.
