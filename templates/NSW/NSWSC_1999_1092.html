<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Transfer to District Court)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In matter 20245 of 1999 there is an opposed
application for a transfer of the action to the District Court.  It
is an
action brought by two plaintiffs, which I understand to have been instituted
two days before the expiry of the limitation period,
the publication being in
May 1993. The imputations in a general way may be described as asserting of the
plaintiffs that they are
defamers.
<P>

2   	No doubt at any hearing of the action on the issue of
damages, the question of the delay in the institution of proceedings
- the
objective of which is speedily to seek vindication of an asserted damaged
reputation - will be the subject of consideration.
 There is nothing in this
action that persuades me that its prosecution, if it is to be prosecuted, will
benefit procedurally or
otherwise by being maintained in this court.
<P>

3   	In relation to the second plaintiff, in my judgment of 27
October in <b><i>Hoser v Hartcher</i></b> the fact that there was some adverse
material available that upon its admission might diminish any damages to which
Mr Hoser would
be entitled, was a factor that was raised in submissions.  In
this case the plaintiffs have chosen to sue in the one action.  There
may well
be reasons for that.  The effect of any flaw in Mr Hoser's case by reason of
the matter I have mentioned upon Mr Pierson's
case will have to be handled in
the District Court, to which I remit it for hearing in Sydney.
<P>

4   	In action 1954 of 1993 the causes of action upon which the
sole plaintiff Mr Pierson sues, are injurious falsehood and intentional
inducement of breach of the contract.  Those two causes of action discretely,
whilst not common, do not have any remarkable characteristics
that warrant the
retention of this very old case in this court.
<P>

5   	One matter that might induce a belief that it should stay
here is the articulated claim for a loss said to flow from one or
both of those
torts in the sum of $1.2 million. In the light of remarks made in court today
as to what is frankly conceded to be
the inflated nature of that claim, in
terms of its quantum, and in the light of the questionable issue of any causal
connection between
whatever tort is found to have been committed and the
incurring of any loss, the  action again cannot be characterised as warranting
retention in this court.
<P>

6   	It has not enjoyed a vigorous history through this court,
either with the benefit of differential case management, or without
it.  It may
well be that this action will be amenable to prompt disposition in the District
Court, to which I order it to be remitted
for hearing in Sydney.
<P>

7   	I will recommend, subject to the resources of the District
Court, that those matters be listed together.
<P>

8   	In matter 19547 of 1993, the plaintiff is to pay the
defendant's costs of 22 October 1999, otherwise the costs will be the
defendant's costs in the cause.
