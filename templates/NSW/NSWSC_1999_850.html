COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 26 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<u>10921/1999</u>	<u>IAN CHARLES TURNER v NEALE DENNIS PRIDE</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT </u></b>
<P>

1  	The Court has been told that there were earlier proceedings in
this Court between the plaintiff and the defendant.  Largely,
what is known
comes from material provided by the plaintiff.  There had been an advance of
$75,000.00 by the plaintiff to the defendant.
 There had been documentation
entered into between the parties (a Deed of Trust which gave the plaintiff a
beneficial interest in
a property owned by the defendant).  The plaintiff
lodged a caveat against the title to the property.  Proceedings were brought by
the plaintiff for an extension of that caveat.
<P>

2  	There was interlocutory activity.  The proceedings were set down
for hearing.  The plaintiff had briefed junior counsel.  The
proceedings were
settled on the first day of the hearing.  The plaintiff obtained payment in the
sum of $105,000.00.  By consent,
an order was made that the defendant pay the
plaintiff's costs.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff prepared a "Party/Party Bill of Costs".  It was in
the order of $79,000.00.  There was dispute as to the quantum
of the costs.
The plaintiff made application to this Court for an assessment of the costs.
The application stated that "The amount
of costs in dispute is the whole bill".
The application was referred to a Costs Assessor (Mr Goodman).
<P>

4  	An "Objection to Bill of Costs of Plaintiff" (the objection) came
before the Costs Assessor.  The total of the items identified
in the objection
was in the order of $27,000.00.  There were communications between the parties
and with the Costs Assessor.
<P>

5  	The Costs Assessor issued a Certificate of Determination.  He
determined the costs payable in an amount in the order of $30,000.00.
Subsequently, the Costs Assessor was asked to provide reasons for his
determination.  The Costs Assessor responded by letter dated
9 April 1999 (the
letter).
<P>

6  	On 19 April 1999, the plaintiff filed a Summons.  Relief is
sought pursuant to either s 208L or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u>
1987</a> (the Act).
<P>

7  	The hearing took place on 22 July 1999.  The evidence comprised
an affidavit from Mr Smallwood (the solicitor for the plaintiff)
and
documentation tendered on behalf of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff was
represented by counsel.  By leave, counsel appeared on
behalf of the Attorney
General (there was no opposition to an appearance as Amicus Curiae).  The
defendant appeared in person.
<P>

8  	Counsel for the plaintiff has prepared written submissions.  On
behalf of the plaintiff, two principal submissions are made.
 One has been
referred to as a jurisdictional matter.  This was founded on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208A</a> (5) and the
fact that the Costs Assessor had reduced the bill by more than the sum total of
the objections.  In support of this submission,
the plaintiff sought comfort in
what had been said in <u>Law Society of New South Wales v Gallagher</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWADT/1999/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
NSWADT 8 (G</a> B Molloy - Judicial Member).  The other was a matter of bias.  The
plaintiff says that there was either actual or perceived bias.
 There were a
few other matters agitated.  I will expressly refer to some of them in due
course.
<P>

9  	At this stage it is convenient to look at some of the provisions
of the Act which deal with the matter of assessment of costs
(Division 6).  The
starting point is the distinction drawn in the Act between applications for
assessment of costs in relation to
"a bill of costs" (which is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s173.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
173)</a> and applications for assessment of costs that result from an order (made
by a court or a tribunal).  Whilst the expression "bill
of costs" might be
thought to be of general application, it does not appear in the provisions
dealing with costs that result from
an order.
<P>

10  	The entitlement to make an application is conferred by
Subdivision 1.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s199.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 199</a> - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s201.html" class="autolink_findacts">201</a> enable applications to be made in relation
to "a bill of costs".  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s202.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 202</a> enables an application to be made where the
costs are payable as a result of an order (any "order for the payment of an
unspecified
amount of costs").  It has the erroneous heading "Application for
assessment of party/party costs".
<P>

11  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s206.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 206</a> - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">208</a> are of general application to all assessments.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s206.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 206</a> requires the Proper Officer of the Court to refer each application
to a Costs Assessor to be dealt with under the Division.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s207.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 207</a> empowers
the Costs Assessor inter alia to make requirements in respect of the production
of documents and the furnishing of particulars.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208</a> is headed
"Consideration of applications by costs assessors".  Subsection (1) prohibits
the determination of an application unless
the Costs Assessor has complied with
the requirements thereof.
<P>

12  	Subdivision 2 (which comprises <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208a.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 208A</a> - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208e.html" class="autolink_findacts">208E</a>) prescribes
the assessment process applicable when the Costs Assessor is dealing with an
application relating to "a bill of costs".
 Subdivision 3 (which comprises
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208f.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 208F</a> - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208i.html" class="autolink_findacts">208I</a>) prescribes the assessment process applicable where the
Costs Assessor is dealing with an application relating to costs payable as
a
result of an order.
<P>

13  	When the assessment takes place pursuant to Subdivision 3, the
Costs Assessor must comply with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208F</a> (inter alia he must
consider the matters specified in subsection (1) and he must make a
determination in accordance with subsection
(2)).  In assessing what is a fair
and reasonable amount of costs, he may have regard to any or all of the matters
enumerated in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208G.</a>
<P>

14  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L</a> provides an avenue of appeal where there has been a
decision of a Costs Assessor as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine the application.  Whilst "decision" is undefined, it would seem to
be intended that it contemplated a "determination".

<P>

15  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> prescribes the avenues for leave to appeal.  Where
there has been an application relating to "a bill of costs", the section
enables
the seeking of leave to appeal in this Court.  Where there has been an
application relating to costs payable as a result of an order,
the section
enables the making of the application for leave to the court or tribunal that
made the order.
<P>

16  	In addition to the provisions of the Act, there is the <u>Legal
Profession Regulation</u> 1994 (the Regulation).  Division 3 (clauses 25-26A)
of the Regulation has application where there is an assessment of a bill of
costs.
 Division 4 (clauses 26B - 26D) therein has application where there is
an assessment of "party/party costs" under s 202 of the Act.
 Division 5
(clauses 26E - 26I) is of general application.
<P>

17  	There are prescribed forms for the making of an application for
assessment.  In the case of "party/party costs" Form 3 has
application.
Paragraph 5 of that form makes provision for the providing of information
relating to the matter (one of the contemplated
ways of providing that
information is by attachment of a copy of a bill of costs).
<P>

18  	Clause 26C prescribes a procedure to be complied with before the
application is made and referred to the Assessor.  It affords
the opportunity
to make both objection to the application and response to any objection.  There
is no prescribed form for either
the objection or the response.
<P>

19  	Clause 26G is in the following terms:-
<P>

"A costs assessor may determine that the amount of fair and reasonable costs is
the amount agreed to by the parties if during the
course of the assessment the
parties notify the costs assessor that they have agreed on the amount of those
costs."
<P>

20  	I shall first turn to the jurisdictional submission.  In
substance, it is said that the Costs Assessor was invested with power
to
determine only those costs items which were identified in the objection.  It
was said that this flowed from the proper construction
of s 208A (5).  It is in
the following terms:
<P>

"A costs assessor may not determine that any part of a bill of costs that is
not the subject of an application is unfair or unreasonable."&#180;
<P>

The plaintiff looks to <u>Gallagher</u> as authority for this contention (see
inter alia paragraphs 22-25).
<P>

21  	Paragraph 22 contains the following:-
<P>

"There is an argument oft raised in the profession, in or to the effect that an
assessor must have regard to the whole of the bill
and to all of the items
therein set out."
<P>

Paragraph 23 is as follows:-
<P>

"It seems to me, therefore, that the role of the assessor is not at large but
is confined by the items in the bill that are disputed,
all other items being
allowed simply because they are not disputed."
<P>

22  	There may be some debate as to what was intended by those
observations.  It is not entirely clear as to whether they are intended
to
speak in terms of jurisdiction or power or merely in terms of general practice
or procedure.
<P>

23  	At the outset, it has to be borne in mind that the regime
established by the Act and the Regulation brings into operation an
assessment
process (as opposed to the taxation process which it replaced).  It was the
taxation process that involved an item by
item consideration.  There will be
cases where the assessment task can be properly performed by a global
approach.
<P>

24  	The assessment process does not put in place any formal pleading
or similar requirement.  Largely, the regime involves an informal
process
intended to effect expedient and less costly resolution of disputes by
experienced practitioners.  There will be cases in
which at least one party (if
not all) will be acting in person.  The amount in issue may be very modest.
The role of the Costs Assessor
is not performed in a court context.
<P>

25  	In the case of assessment where there has been a costs order
Form 3 requires the provision of stipulated information relating
to the matter
(see paragraph 5 of the Form).  The attachment of a copy of a bill of costs is
merely one method of giving that information.
 Whilst the prescribed procedure
enables the lodging of an objection and a response prior to the lodging of the
application, in many
cases no objection is lodged.  Despite the lack of
objection, the procedure still sees the application being referred for
assessment.
<P>

26  	After the application has been referred by the Proper Officer,
the conduct of the assessment is in the hands of the Costs Assessor.
 He has
been given powers to exercise (s 207).  He is required to give the parties a
reasonable opportunity to make written submissions
and he is bound to give due
consideration to any submissions so made (s 208).  He is required to make a
decision or determination
(including a determination as to the costs payable)
in accordance with statutory requirements (inter alia s 206).
<P>

27  	The language of the Act has thrown up its fair share of
problems.  The history of the assessment regime has seen Costs Assessors
presented with a host of contentious situations.  The debate thrown up in the
present case is but one of many.
<P>

28  	A Costs Assessor is placed in the position where each assessment
has to be conducted on a case by case basis.  In some cases,
the areas of
dispute may be well defined by the relevant documentation.  In others, it may
provide little assistance.  However the
task may be presented to him, he is
ultimately left to resolve the application by decision or determination which
complies with the
statutory requirements.
<P>

29  	I should digress to observe that pleading processes do not
confine the jurisdiction or power of a court or tribunal.  Their
function is to
define and narrow issues.  Generally speaking the parties select the issues
which they wish to agitate and the court
or tribunal resolves the dispute by a
determination of those issues.  But, this is not always the position.  There
are cases in which
the selected issues will not be determinative of the real
questions involved in the case.  In those cases the court or tribunal must
address the real issues, so that justice is done between the parties and the
dispute is determined according to law.
<P>

30  	In the case of a Costs Assessor, what is required is a
performance of statutory functions and the discharging of statutory
duties.  It
may be that in most cases the resolution of issues raised in the assessment
will produce a result which discharges the
duty to comply with statutory
requirements.  But, this will not always be the position (even in cases where
issues have been well
defined).
<P>

31  	Without seeking to be exhaustive, I mention these matters as
illustrations of situations where there may be a need for the
decision maker to
depart from any selected issues and address other considerations for the
purpose of making a decision according
to law.
<P>

32  	I should add that in the case of a Costs Assessor a failure to
comply with any of the statutory requirements has of itself
the potential to
provoke a complaint of error from a dissatisfied party.  Of course, there may
be a question of the materiality of
the conduct of the parties in respect of
the force to be given to any such complaint.  A party who does not raise an
issue before
a Costs Assessor can expect difficulty if it is sought to agitate
that issue on appeal.
<P>

33  	In this case, the Costs Assessor was dealing with an application
relating to costs payable as a result of an order (it was
an application made
pursuant to s 202).  Accordingly, s 208A has no application to the assessment.
Further, I do not accept either
the construction which the plaintiff seeks to
put on s 208A (5) or its application otherwise to the facts of this case.  What
is
the subject of the application can be expected to be disclosed by the
application itself (Form 3 requires the applicant to identify
the amount of
costs in dispute).  In this case, the application for assessment related to the
whole of the amount claimed by the
plaintiff.  It was not limited to part only
of the "Party/Party Bill of Costs".
<P>

34  	It may be that s 208A (2) was intended as imposing a limitation
on what may be disallowed in cases where there is an application
relating to a
bill of costs (the Costs Assessor has to be satisfied that "the disputed costs"
are unfair or unreasonable).  The expression
"the disputed costs" is not
defined.  Presumably, the manner in which the dispute may be manifested is not
the subject of restriction.
 However, I need not further pursue that matter as
s 208A has no application in this case (it applies only where the assessment
relates
to "a bill of costs").
<P>

35  	In this case, the relevant provision is s 208F (2).  The
contrast with s 208A (2) is of importance.  Section 208F (2) requires
the Costs
Assessor to determine the costs payable by assessing the amount of the costs
that in his or her opinion is a fair and reasonable
amount.
<P>

36  	Before proceeding further, I should again mention certain other
statutory requirements.  A Costs Assessor must give due consideration
to the
submissions that have been made (s 208 (1)).  He must consider the matters
specified in s 208F (1).
<P>

37  	There is a statutory duty to form an opinion as required by s
208F (2).  In forming that opinion he must give due consideration
to any
submissions that have been made and consider the matters specified in s 208F
(1).  He is required to make a determination
in respect of the subject of the
application.
<P>

38  	The Parliament has seen fit to impose statutory requirements in
respect of which the Costs Assessor is bound to comply.  The
language of inter
alia Subdivision 3 does not justify the view that an absence of dispute (or
objection) discharges or relieves the
Costs Assessor of the obligation to
comply with relevant statutory requirements.  The Regulation recognises that
even where there
is agreement as to an amount, a discretion is retained by the
Costs Assessor (clause 26G).
<P>

39  	Accordingly, I reject the contention that the Costs Assessor has
exceeded jurisdiction or power.  His determination is consistent
with him
having complied with the statutory requirements applicable to this particular
application.  In order to comply with those
requirements, he considered that
there was a need to assess costs which were the subject of the application (but
not identified in
the objection) so as to form the required opinion as to what
was a fair and reasonable amount.  Such an approach was open to him
in the
circumstances of this case.
<P>

40  	For completeness, I should observe that in complying with the
statutory requirements, there is also a need to see that the
requirements of
procedural fairness are met.  In this case, it is not said that there has been
any departure from those requirements.
 Accordingly, I put that matter
aside.
<P>

41  	I now turn to the matter of bias.  It suffices to direct
attention to the allegation of apprehended bias.  The attention of
the Court
has been drawn to the usual cases.  Stress is placed on what appears in
paragraph 3 of the letter.  Paragraph 3 contains
material which is directed
towards expressing the reasoning process behind his determination.  It also
contains material which is
directed to expressing the reasoning process behind
the costs orders that were made by him.  Strong views are expressed as to the
quantum of the costs claimed by the plaintiff.  Strong views are expressed as
to the conduct of the solicitor for the plaintiff.
 The authorities make it
clear that the expression of views with vigour should not necessitate
disqualification (<u>Galea v Galea</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 263).</a>  It has been said
that material contained in the letter demonstrates pre-judgment.  I do not
accept that contention.  It must be
borne in mind that the letter is an
expression of the reasoning process made after the determination had taken
place.
<P>

42  	In my view, the assertion of bias fails.  In presenting his
reasons, the Costs Assessor has expressed a strong view to the
effect that the
costs claimed by the plaintiff were grossly excessive.  It was a view that
could properly be expressed with force.
 He has purported to determine the
costs payable in an amount that was in his opinion fair and reasonable.  In my
view, the determination
made by him was one that was open to him in the
circumstances.
<P>

43  	I have now dealt with the principal submissions.  Accordingly, I
shall proceed to make some express mention of other matters
agitated either in
written submissions or in argument.
<P>

44  	It was said that there was error of law upon the face of the
reasons of the Assessor.  The substance of this contention is
the assertion
that the Costs Assessor failed to follow the approach enunciated in
<u>Gallagher</u>. Before proceeding further with this contention, I should
clarify one matter.  The letter has been taken as the expression of the
reasoning process of the Costs Assessor in reaching his determination.  In the
letter, the Costs Assessor makes some observations
concerning the decision in
<u>Gallagher</u>.  It is common ground, that the decision in <u>Gallagher</u>
had not been brought to his attention until some time after the determination
had been made.  Accordingly, whilst his reasoning process
did not accord with
what was said in the decision his views on the decision itself did not form
part of his reasoning process.  I
have already dealt with matters relevant to
that decision.  For many reasons, this contention fails.
<P>

45  	It was said that the Costs Assessor took into account irrelevant
matters.  In making this submission, reference was made to
paragraphs 2 and 3
of the letter.  I do not accept this contention.  The thrust of the reasoning
process was that the costs were
grossly excessive and that the amount allowed
was that which in his opinion was a fair and reasonable amount.  He relied on
inter
alia his experience in reaching these views.  This was a course open to
him.  It must be borne in mind that a Costs Assessor is not
bound by rules of
evidence and may inform himself on any matter in such manner as he sees fit (s
208 (2)).
<P>

46  	Further, it is said that there was an erroneous finding in that
the Costs Assessor proceeded on the basis that the litigation
related to a loan
of $75,000.00.  In respect of this contention, some initial comments need to be
made.  Firstly, I do not accept
that such a finding was made.  Secondly, it is
largely correct to say that the litigation related to a loan of $75,000.00.
Thirdly,
even if a different view were to be taken as to this matter, it would
not be of such significance as to justify disturbing the determination.
<P>

47  	The Costs Assessor has merely said that "Item 637 indicates that
the litigation related to a loan of $75,000.00".  Item 637
appears in the
plaintiff's "bill of costs".  It was the making of this loan that led to the
litigation.  The proceedings resulted
in a judgment in the sum of $105,000.00.
If the reference to the sum of $75,000.00 has any significance, it is to
demonstrate the
obvious disproportion between what was in dispute and the costs
claimed by the plaintiff.  The comment was part of the expression
of the view
that the costs were grossly excessive.
<P>

48  	The plaintiff bears the onus of demonstrating an entitlement to
relief.  In my view, the plaintiff has failed to discharge
that onus.  No basis
(be it error or otherwise) has been demonstrated to justify disturbing the
determination.
<P>

49  	The Summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of
the Summons.  The exhibits may be returned.
