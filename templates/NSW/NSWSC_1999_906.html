<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>On 4 April 1996 Lorna Adell Bonham died.
Under the terms of her will she made the following provisions: 
<P>

<u>I GIVE AND BEQUEATH</u> unto my Trustee upon trust my cottage premises at 10
Hamley Street, Bathurst aforesaid together with the furniture contained therein
for my son <u>CLIVE LAWRENCE BONHAM</u> absolutely upon his attaining the age
of twenty-one years <u>AND AS TO</u> the residue of my real and personal estate
<u>I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH</u> the same unto my Trustee upon trust for the
said <u>CLIVE LAWRENCE BONHAM</u> the said <u>ADELL MARIE HUGHES</u>, <u>PAMELA
MARGARET LINNANE</u> and <u>JUDITH ANN BONHAM</u> or the survivors of them upon
their attaining the age of twenty one years respectively.
<P>

2   	On 1 September 1998, probate was granted to Adell Marie
Bonfield. The inventory of property disclosed that the realty was valued
at
$100,000 and the balance of the deceased's estate was valued at $112,334.46.

<P>

3   	On 7 November 1997 each of the daughters of the deceased
commenced proceedings under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. The
proceedings were commenced out of time. On 11 December 1997 orders were made by
consent to amend the summons by seeking an order
extending the time for
bringing the applications up to 7 November 1997.
<P>

4   	Subsequently, on 26 November 1998, an order was made in
each matter substituting Clive Lawrence Bonham as the defendant in
each of the
proceedings. 
<P>

5   	At the commencement of the hearing orders were made that
the evidence in one matter be read as the evidence in the other. 
<P>

6   	In <i>Perrin &amp; ors v Morgan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1943%5d%20AC%20399" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1943] AC 399</a> Lord
Atkin warned Judges faced with disputes over wills of the prospect that they
might one day be obliged to meet "the group of
ghosts of dissatisfied
testators" who, "according to a late Chancery Judge, wait on the other bank of
the Styx to receive the judicial
personages who have misconstrued their wills".
"Waiting thereto" the President said "will be those whose wills have been
interfered
with unnecessarily or excessively". I suspect the same fate awaits
beneficiaries who have caused wills to be unnecessarily or excessively
interfered with. 
<P>

7   	Persons are entitled to dispose of their assets as they see
fit. However, the <i>Family Provisions Act</i> permits the Court, to a limited
degree, to interfere with the testamentary intentions of the deceased.
<P>

8   	This is a small estate. The valuation for probate was
$212,334.46. The residue being $112,334.46. Under the will, subject to
administration costs, each of the plaintiffs would have been entitled to
approximately $28,000. I think that is important when considering
each of the
claims. 
<P>

9   	In <i>Jackson v Riley</i> (unreported, 24 February 1989)
Cohen J said that where the estate is a small estate, he suggested that the
parties should try to
come to some compromise and, if that failed, then the
proceedings should have been approached with concerted attempts to keep the
costs to a minimum. His Honour went on to say that both branches of the
profession have an obligation to reduce the costs of litigation
as much as
possible where the amounts in dispute are so small. If the parties cannot reach
a compromise, then by consultation with
their legal advisers, both solicitors
and Counsel, should seek to find all means of defining the real issue and
confining the evidence
in relation to them.
<P>

10   	I can find no fault with either the plaintiffs or their
legal representatives. There is evidence (Exhibit A) that they used
their best
endeavours to settle the proceedings. The evidence of the defendant was that,
in the face of all requests to settle, he
was not prepared to do anything but
litigate. His reason being that he had promised his mother that he would do
everything possible
to ensure that the terms of her will were carried out as
she wished them. I am sceptical of such promise when the maker of the promise
stands to gain more than the others. It is not necessarily a noble position but
one advanced by self interest. It would seem to me
having regard to this
evidence that, in all probability, he ignored the advice of his legal
representatives in embarking on the course
that he did. 
<P>

11   	At the date of the hearing, the costs of all parties
amounted to approximately $67,500. Thus, if all costs were paid out of
the
estate, each plaintiff would receive a legacy of less than $9,000. It was
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that this is an
estate where the Court
should order an equal share amongst the four siblings. However, I am mindful in
what was said in <i>Cooper v Duggan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2050%20ALJR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 50 ALJR 539.</a> It was said that it
may be possible to justify an equal distribution in a small estate. However,
that is not an aim of the jurisdiction
and, should such an order be made, the
discretion may miscarry. While the statute has changed since that decision, the
fundamental
philosophy has not. 
<P>

12   	So far as each of the beneficiaries go, their needs are
different. 
<P>

<b>Adell Marie Bonfield</b>
<P>

13   	Adell Marie Bonfield ("Adell") is currently forty-nine
years of age. She is married with children. However, her children are
not
dependant on her. She was educated to the age of sixteen. Thereafter she became
an office worker and married at nineteen. She
moved out of the Bathurst
district after marrying and did not return to the area until 1980. During the
time she was away from Bathurst
her relationship with her parents was
unremarkable. When she returned to the Bathurst district her relationship was
close with both
her parents. During that period of time up until the death of
firstly her father and then her mother, both she and Judith Ann Davey
cared for
their parents by doing a number of tasks above and beyond what are normally
associated with the type of relationship one
has with parents. Not only did
they and their family visit the parents on a regular basis and have regular
contact with them, but
during their times of illness they were supportive and
cared for their parents. They were available to run errands, take them to
hospitals, sit with them in hospital and, generally, look after their welfare.
In my view the relationship that Adell had with her
mother was a close and
caring relationship. The things that she did by and large, however, are things
that one would normally expect
of a child towards a sick parent. She did,
however, give of herself unstintingly towards her parents. In my view, having
regard to
the matters provided in section 9(3), she has demonstrated that
consideration should have been given to her to a greater extent than
was given
by her mother. The plaintiff's husband from time to time during 1989 and 1990
provided his labour to enable renovations
to be carried out to the deceased
home.
<P>

14   	Adell has been employed as a clerk at Glenray Industries
since 1985. Her husband worked for the railways for many years and
subsequently
drove taxis and a bus in Bathurst. In 1995 he purchased a coach for purposes of
establishing a coach business. Since
that time they have purchased three
coaches. Each time I assume upgrading the coach. Mrs Bonfield continues to be
employed as a clerk
and currently her weekly earnings are $430. Her husband
earns $270 net per week. The total income for the family is $700. From her
evidence, the weekly expenses amount to $678 leaving an excess of $22 a week. A
major component of the weekly expenses is the repayment
on the mortgage. That
repayment amounts to $190 per week. The recent upgrade of coach from a
Mercedes-Benz to a Scania has cost the
Bonfields $165,000. It was necessary to
borrow from the Colonial Bank an amount of $150,000 to finance the purchase of
that coach.
That has resulted in a commitment to the bank of just over $2700
per month by way of repayments. On income and expenditure it can
be seen that
there is very little surplus left over. When one takes into account the
commitment to the debt in respect to the coach
her position is precarious.
There was evidence that at this stage the coach is not operating full-time.
Often work is only available
on three or four days per week. It operates
generally in the Bathurst area and the Sydney metropolitan area. The Bonfields
hope that
within a few years the business will be running at a profit. Until
that time the financial position is, as I have already indicated,
precarious.

<P>

15   	There is a mortgage over the family home and currently
stands at $80,000. There is a debt in respect of credit cards which
stands at
$3,000. In my view, Adell has demonstrated that provision should be made for
her maintenance and advancement in life. That,
of course, is commonly referred
to as need. The matters that I have identified are matters that, in my view, do
go to her needs.
It seems to me that whilst this estate cannot pay out the
mortgage and, indeed, on the authorities, it would not be permissible for
me to
make an order which would enable her to discharge the mortgage from money she
receives out of her mother's estate by adjustment.
Nevertheless, in my view,
there is a need to provide her with a fund of money which may either enable her
to reduce the principal
on the mortgage or to use the money to supplement their
income whilst they get over this difficult period over the next few years.

<P>

16   	When her assets are considered, the assets in themselves
are not going to enable her to do that. As I have already indicated
the Scania
coach which is worth $165,000 is subject to a loan of $150,000. A home at Kelso
is currently valued at $85,000. The mortgage
as I have indicated is
approximately $80,000. 
<P>

17   	Adell is a member of a superannuation fund and, according
to a statement from the fund which is marked Exhibit D, the balance
in that
account is just under $11,000. But of course at this stage she cannot gain
access to the moneys that are held in the superannuation
fund.
<P>

<b>Pamela Linnane</b>
<P>

18   	Pamela Linnane ("Pamela") is forty-seven years of age. She
received her education in the Bathurst area and then went on to
study nursing.
Ultimately she became a Registered Nurse. She is also qualified as a
psychiatric nurse. She was married. That marriage
ended in divorce. She has for
many years been living in a de facto relationship with a Phillip Anderson. They
have two children by
that relationship. They are currently aged ten and
fifteen. Most of Pamela's adult life has been spent away from the Bathurst
area.
There were times in Sydney and then in 1989 she and her partner moved to
Queensland to live on a property that they had purchased
at an earlier time.
Pamela continues to work as a nurse. However, her partner is currently
unemployed. The evidence disclosed that
the partner has not worked since 1987.
The evidence also was that he has no intention of working now or at any time in
the foreseeable
future. 
<P>

19   	The income of Pamela's family consists of her weekly
income as a nurse of $470 and a parenting allowance that her partner
receives.
The total amount that they receive is approximately $500 per week. 
<P>

20   	The assets that they own consist of a property in Gympie
(valued at about $53,000), a motor vehicle and various funds and
shares.
Currently their expenses amount to $480 per week. The excess moneys they have
at the end of each week therefore is approximately
$20. 
<P>

21   	So far as the relationship with the mother is concerned,
in my view, Pamela's relationship was nothing unremarkable. As I
have already
indicated she has spent most of her adult life away from Bathurst, either in
Sydney or in Queensland. There was contact
with her parents and holidays from
time to time were spent together. There were visits to Bathurst. However,
because of the geographical
differences, it was not possible for Pamela to
provide the same level of care that her other sisters provided. In my view
there is
nothing which could be regarded as factors against Pamela. The
relationship that she had with her parents was no different than that
of many
parents and children in the late twentieth century Australia. Perhaps if she
lived closer to her parents she would have been
able to provide the care that
her other two sisters did. However, she did not live close by and that should
not count against her.
She nevertheless always displayed a loving and caring
attitude towards both of her parents. 
<P>

22   	However, so far as Pamela demonstrating a need which was
not provided for in her mother's will I have a great deal of difficulty.
In her
evidence she has stated that a house needs to be built on the property near
Gympie. Her family lives in a shed. The shed appears
to be fairly primitive.
The only electricity is electricity generated by solar panels that are affixed
to the roof. There is insufficient
power to run even a television set. <i>Prima
facie</i> there is a need. What Pamela seeks is to build a house on the
property so that the family, I assume, can enjoy the comforts of modern
living.
This estate is a small estate. To make such provision would mean providing her
with a substantial amount from the assets
of the estate. Once again the
authorities would not permit me to make provision for Pamela out of her
mother's estate to the extent
that the estate pay for the building of a home
<i>Shearer v Public Trustee</i> (unreported, 23 March 1998, Young J). At best
the estate would only provide a sum to give her a start to put a deposit down
for the
purpose of building the house and thereafter she would need to arrange
a finance deal to complete the construction. The need that
is clearly expressed
by Pamela is a common need. However, in this particular instance I doubt
whether that is a need at all. 
<P>

23   	The evidence discloses that Pamela and her partner
purchased the Gympie property in the mid-1980s. Her partner's mother died
in
1987. The partner received from his mother's estate a legacy in excess of
$200,000. At that stage, both Pamela and her partner
were working as
psychiatric nurses at Rozelle. After the death of the partner's mother they
moved to the property at Gympie. They
had erected on the property the shed in
which they now live. Out of his mother's estate none of that money was used to
build a house.
The partner ceased working and has not worked since. The
evidence of Pamela was that the partner is not looking for work and has
no
intention of seeking employment in the future. The money, therefore, was used,
to a large degree, to support the family unit until
it ran out. 
<P>

24   	The two children of the relationship are now aged
approximately fifteen and ten. When Pamela resumed working as a nurse in
the
Gympie area, having regard to the location of the property, it would have been
reasonable to expect one of the parents to stay
home and look after the
children. At that stage in 1989, the elder child would have been approximately
five. The younger child was
born at about that time. It was therefore perfectly
reasonable to expect, as I have said, one or other partner to stay at home
until
both children commenced school. However, the younger child is now ten and
therefore has been at school for approximately five years.
There appears to be
little reason why the partner should still not be seeking employment. There is
no evidence that the land is cultivated
or provides an income for the family
unit. On the material before me the only income being generated is the weekly
wage earned by
Pamela and the parenting allowance that the partner receives.

<P>

25   	Since the death of Pamela's mother the parties have done
nothing to have a home built on the land. In fact, they have sold
shares that
the partner received from his mother's estate and instead of using the proceeds
of those shares towards the erection
of a home, the proceeds of sale were used
in part to reduce their debt level, to purchase a boat and an outboard motor
which cost
approximately $2,500. 
<P>

26   	It would seem to me, having regard to their lifestyle, not
just now but over the last ten years or so, that they could be
regarded as an
unconventional family. The needs of most families are not necessarily the needs
that they have. They have been in
the position in the past to have a home built
on the land. In fact, they were in a far better position to do that when the
partner's
mother died than they are now, and yet they elected not to do that.
The shed, for all its imperfections, seemed to suit their lifestyle
even as
recently as this year when there were fresh funds generated they did not see
fit to use those funds towards the erection
of a house on the property. 
<P>

27   	It seems to me, therefore, in the context of this family
that conventional living and a house as most people know it is not
something
that they really consider is a need. In any event, had they marshalled their
assets they would be in a position to make
a significant contribution towards
the building of a home even if they were not prepared to sell the Gympie
property. With the Westpac
rollover fund and the shares together with probably
the best asset the family has (that would be the partner back in the labour
force)
there would be sufficient funds generated by the family by either a
realisation of the shares, income earned by the partner and Pamela
and the
ability they would have to borrow money to complete the building of a home. Any
provision out of the estate, therefore, would
be minor. It seems to me that,
had there been no challenge to the estate, the funds that would have been
available from the mother's
will of approximately $28,000 would more than have
assisted the building on the property. 
<P>

28   	Even now, based on Pamela's evidence, there should be
sufficient funding from the deceased's estate to assist Pamela to build
a house
should that be what she really wants. She gave evidence that the cost of
building a house on the property would be about
$40,000. That would be to
"lock-up stage" and her partner would be able to complete it. That being the
case if Pamela were to receive
her quarter of the residue of what is left of
the estate she would receive approximately $10,000 towards the costs of
construction.

<P>

29   	Whether Pamela should receive an additional amount must be
placed in context of the size of the estate and the competing claims
of her
siblings. It would seem to me that the deceased, had she been a wise and just
testatrix, would have given serious consideration
to her 1972 will in the light
of the amount of assistance that they rendered to her during the 1980s and the
early 1990s. In saying
that, that should not be construed as holding against
Pamela and the fact that she was unable to provide the same sort of assistance
for her parents but, nevertheless, it is a factor to be considered when
determining whether or not they should receive something
additional from the
estate having regard to what their needs are. 
<P>

30   	In my view, having regard to Pamela's lifestyle over the
last twenty years or so the need for the type of accommodation that
she has
alluded to in her evidence is not as strong or pressing as perhaps the need of
her other two sisters.
<P>

<b>Judith Ann Davey</b>
<P>

31   	Judith Ann Davey ("Judith") is forty-three years of age.
She received her education in the Bathurst district and attained
the School
Certificate. Thereafter she studied nursing and worked as a nurse. In recent
years she undertook a course to obtain qualifications
as a masseuse. Having
obtained those qualifications, she resigned from her employment as a nurse and
branched out in her own business
as a masseuse. As with most people starting
out in a new business, she has struggled during the initial period. She hopes
the business
will pick up and there is evidence that, should she be able to
drive to patients, the potential for the business to grow is far greater
than
remaining in rooms in Bathurst. 
<P>

32   	Judith is married. There is one daughter at school doing
Year 12. Her husband has worked in the Bathurst area for many years.
He is a
manager at a large company. The combined income of Judith and her husband is
approximately $1,000 a week. Their outgoings
are approximately $730 per week.
There is a substantial excess of income over expenditure. They own their home
in Bathurst and it
is valued at $165,000. They have a time share unit in Port
Macquarie, savings of approximately $6,500 and two motor vehicles estimated
at
$31,500. They have recently carried out renovations to the bathroom and have a
debt in respect of that work. The debt is approximately
$15,000. 
<P>

33   	Additional assets of Judith consist of entitlements of
superannuation fund and her husband has approximately $6,500 in a building
society. The business that Judith has started, on her evidence, requires the
purchase of a van and a special purpose table. It would
seem that the van would
cost approximately $20,000 and the chiropractic table would cost $2,700. Judith
has stated that, in addition
to the van and the table, the house needs
repainting. A quote has been obtained for $15,200 for the purposes of internal
and external
painting. 
<P>

34   	Having regard to the size of the estate, it seems to me
that no provision should be made for the painting. In any event, even
where the
estate is of such a size that it could make funds available for that work, in
the absence of any evidence of neither Judith
nor her husband are physically
capable of painting the house themselves, I would not regard that as a need.
There is no evidence
of that in any event. 
<P>

35   	However, Judith has demonstrated a need so far as her new
business is concerned. As with Adell, it is a difficult time. It
is a period
where Judith is trying to establish herself in the market place and it is only
with the passage of time and no doubt
some skill and luck that the business
will grow to its potential. In order to give her every assistance to achieve
that position,
it is essential that she purchase a vehicle and it follows that
she will also need to purchase a chiropractic table. On Judith's
evidence to be
able to work in the manner in which she has indicated holds greater potential
than to operate from premises in Bathurst.
Judith, above all others, had a
greater involvement with her parents. True it is that to large degree that
could be put down to an
accident of geography. She has lived in the Bathurst
area all of her adult life. But, nevertheless, it was Judith who was always
there prior to 1980. It would seem on the evidence since 1980 while she has
received much assistance from Adell the primary role
fell to Judith. 
<P>

36   	In considering in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a></i> when one considers conduct in this context it is a positive aspect of
conduct. In my view the caring that Judith has done initially
for both her
parents and subsequently for her mother was of such value and nature that
additional provision should have been provided
to her by her mother. That was
not the case. Therefore some adjustment should be made for Judith.
<P>

<b>Clive Lawrence Bonham</b>
<P>

37   	Clive Lawrence Bonham ("Clive") is forty-two years of age.
He is the major beneficiary of the deceased's estate. Clive was
educated in
Bathurst to the School Certificate. He then did an apprenticeship as a motor
mechanic and was duly qualified as a motor
mechanic. He has also undertaken a
welder's course. He has obtained some certificates and it is his intention to
continue to obtain
other welding certificates. He and his family live in
Tasmania and have done so for many years. He has two children aged thirteen
and
eleven. One child shows promise and it is anticipated by Clive and his wife
that that child will go on to university. The other
child appears to be of
average ability. Nevertheless they hope that he also will continue with
tertiary studies after completing
his last year of school. Although, for that
child, they expect something equivalent for TAFE.
<P>

38   	Clive's relationship with his parents appears to have been
unremarkable. Once again, like Pamela, he moved away from the Bathurst
area
and, with the exception of a period of six months when he and his family lived
at his parents' home to assist his mother after
an laminectomy, he has spent
most of his adult life away from Bathurst. On a trip around Australia he met
his wife and they settled
in Tasmania. The children have been reared in
Tasmania. 
<P>

39   	Whilst Clive and his family wish to move out of their
present house they wish to remain living in Tasmania, not withstanding
the
vagaries of employment. 
<P>

40   	Clive is currently employed as a permanent staff member
and as a welder with a company in Devonport. His wife does seasonal
work at a
local factory. Their combined income is approximately $840 per week. Their
expenses are around about $730 per week. There
is an excess of income over
expenditure of approximately $110. 
<P>

41   	The house they occupy is approximately 100 years old.
Evidence has been put on by a builder and by Clive that the house requires
substantial work to be done to it to make it reasonably habitable. They live
some distance from the boys' schools and that is of
concern to them. 
<P>

42   	Their liabilities are approximately $20,000. Their assets
are approximately $86,000. The liability is in relation to a loan
which was
taken out to purchase a motor vehicle. 
<P>

43   	It is Clive's intention to move from his present address
into Devonport into a better house in an area which is close to schools
and
other amenities. The value of Clive's house is given at $53,000. Evidence has
been put on that to buy the type of house that
the family would need in
Devonport would cost between $110,000 and $150,000. 
<P>

44   	Under the terms of the deceased's will, Clive receives the
Bathurst property and one quarter of the residue of the estate.
Prior to the
commencement of these proceedings, that one quarter of the residue was
approximately $28,000. Although for purposes
of probate the value of the
property was given as $100,000 evidence suggests that, at maximum, the property
is worth $85,000. It
would seem that, in all probability, that it will sell for
about $75,000. If Clive were to receive his entitlement under his mother's
will, he would receive approximately $98,000 before costs were deducted in
relation to the sale of the Bathurst property. That sum
together with the
amount they would get from the sale of their Latrobe home would enable Clive to
buy a house in the upper range
of properties in Devonport without the need to
borrow any funds. 
<P>

45   	At the present time Clive seems reasonably secure in his
employment. The evidence of his wife is that the nature of the work
that she
does and the length of time in that employment dictates the amount of work that
will be made available to her. Whilst in
recent times overtime has not been as
readily available as in previous years, she has a number of years employment
with the organisation
and has acquired a certain level of seniority which means
that, as I understand it, she will be one of the first taken on and one
of the
last put off. 
<P>

46   	Clive and his wife have no liabilities other than the loan
in respect to the purchase of the motor vehicle. Their income is
such that they
have the ability to borrow money. Their ability to borrow would not diminish
their ability to buy a house in Devonport
within the range that they seek. 
<P>

47   	Balanced against Clive's need are the needs of his
sisters. 
<P>

48   	The costs that each party has incurred to date amount to
$67,500. The value of the estate is currently $177,500 in round figures.
That
figure is arrived at by the amounts set out in paragraph 8 of the affidavit of
Adell Marie Bonfield sworn on 24 August 1999.
It stated that the moneys in the
estate forming the residue of the estate are currently $105,331.51. The balance
of the estate is
the realty, the Bathurst property. Current indications are
that there will probably be a sale at a figure of $75,000. 
<P>

49   	If there had been no challenge to the will the siblings
would have received as follows: Clive, approximately $101,000; each
of his
three sisters would have received just over $26,000. The legal costs have been
estimated at $67,500 for all parties. If the
legal costs are taken into
account, the estate is valued at $110,000. That would mean that Clive would
receive just over $83,000
and each of his sisters would receive $9,000. 
<P>

50   	The estate cannot provide for the needs of all of the
parties to the extent that they may seek provision out of the estate.
In
considering the position of each of the parties, it is necessary to bear in
mind the principles set out in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> at
209. The first question is whether or not the provision made for any of the
parties was inadequate for his or her proper maintenance,
education and
advancement in life. So far as Clive's position is, the provision that his
mother made for him was generous. It was
certainly adequate for the proper
maintenance, education and advancement in life. Had the proceedings not been
commenced he would
have received approximately $101,000. That would have
enabled him to relocate to Devonport and, in all probability, he would not
have
been placed in a position where money was needed to be borrowed to enable him
to effect the move. 
<P>

51   	So far as the provision for Clive's sisters is concerned,
it would seem to me that the first question so far as Adell is concerned
could
be answered yes, inadequate provision had been made for her. The major
commitment that Adell and her husband have at the moment
is to service the loan
on the coach. There is also a mortgage over the house. Their income has not
greatly changed with purchase
of the coach. As I have already said, it seems to
me that there is a need that Adell has at the present and which will continue
certainly
over the next couple of years. Having regard to the closeness to her
mother, one would have expected a wise and just testatrix to
revisit her 1972
will and make additional provision for Adell to help her at least so far as
weekly expenses go. It seems to me that
when one considers the mortgage and the
equity that she and her husband have in her house and the drain that the weekly
payment of
the mortgage has on the household finances that provision should
have been made to give Adell some cushion. Whilst this estate could
not go
anywhere near making provision to discharge the mortgage, it would seem to that
a proper provision for Adell, in all the circumstances,
would be to provide her
with a sum of money which could be used for ordinary household expenses and
unforseen expenses that may arise
which are likely to happen over the next
three to four years, or, alternatively, to use the sum of money to reduce the
mortgage and
then either renegotiate the mortgage or pay it off within the time
that is currently provided. In my view, an appropriate legacy
for Adell is
$30,000 and make such an order. 
<P>

52   	So far as Judith is concerned, she is in a better position
than her siblings. She and her husband are in receipt of a combined
income
which is greater than that of her siblings and there is a surplus each week.
She has recently become self employed. To be
able to do that effectively, she
needs a van and a table. There is also a loan which was taken out to carry out
certain renovations
to the home. In my view, an appropriate amount to enable
Judith to purchase the van and to buy the chiropractic table to enable her
to
maximise her income would be a reasonable amount to be provided out of the
mother's estate. Judith above all others rendered care
and assistance to her
mother and father throughout her life. In my view, the matter to be considered
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9(3)</a> have been met. Although she is in a better position than her
siblings, her position is not so great that she has funds available
to her
which would enable her to use her assets without having to borrow money from
other sources. It must also be borne in mind
that while she goes into her
venture with high expectations, the reality may not meet those expectations.
Nevertheless, in my view,
there should be further provision made from the
mother's estate for Judith. An appropriate legacy therefore, in my view, would
be
$23,000.
<P>

53   	In respect of the application brought by Pamela for the
reasons I have already outlined, I am of the view that no additional
provision
should be made out of the deceased's estate for her. Under the terms of the
deceased's will she is to receive one quarter
of the residue of the estate. Had
there been no application brought under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>, she
would have received approximately $26,000. As things stand at the moment when
costs are taken into account she would receive
far less than that. The
provisions so far as Pamela should stand. That is, she should be entitled to
one quarter of the remaining
residue of the estate which is in an amount of
$8,750. I make no other order for provision for Pamela and the summons
therefore be
dismissed.
<P>

54   	The balance of the estate under the terms of the will
would go to Clive. However, because the estate cannot provide for his
sisters
without the realty being sold, Clive will receive the balance of the estate.

<P>

55   	The only outstanding question is the matter of costs of
all the parties in the proceedings. In my view the estate should pay
Adell's
costs on the indemnity basis. Similarly, the estate should pay Judith's costs
on the indemnity basis. Pamela's costs on the
indemnity basis should also be
met by the estate.
<P>

56   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33</a> of the Act provides that the Court may order
the costs of the proceedings in relation to the estate of the deceased be paid
out of
the estate in such manner as the Court thinks fit. Subsections (2) and
(3) qualify subsection (1). Subsection (3) is concerned with
eligible persons
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a>(b). Pamela falls into that category, she being a child
of the deceased. 
<P>

57   	In <i>Stewart v McDougall</i> (unreported, 19 November
1987, Young J) his Honour considered <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33.</a> It can be seen from that
decision that where there are sufficient circumstances to do anything special
in a particular case then
an appropriate order for costs may be made. No
additional provision has been made out of the estate for Pamela. Had the
defendant
not conducted the defence of these proceedings in the manner in which
he did, Pamela would have been entitled to a far greater sum
than is now
available to her. But for those actions, the amount provided under her mother's
will would have been approximately $26,000.
That amount has been eroded
primarily by the actions of the defendant. It seems to me that the same result
would have happened whether
or not Pamela commenced these proceedings. Given
her present circumstances, given the conduct of the defendant, it is
appropriate,
in my view, that what small legacy will flow from the deceased's
estate to her should be preserved. Therefore, the order I make is
that Pamela's
costs be paid out of the estate. 
<P>

58   	So far as the costs of the defendant are concerned he has
contributed to a great extent in the reduction in the value of this
estate.
True it is the land at Bathurst was overvalued for the purposes of probate but
that accounts for only $25,000. The costs
in running the three sets of
proceedings have amounted to $67,500. Much of the costs and expenses associated
with that have been
brought about by the defendant's action. Therefore the
proper order in the circumstances is the defendant's costs are paid out of
the
estate on the party and party basis. 
<P>

59   	I make the following orders:
<P>

In 4671 of 1997 Pamela Margaret Linnane v Clive Lawrence Bonham
