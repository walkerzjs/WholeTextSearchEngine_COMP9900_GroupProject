THURSDAY 1 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>13113/98</u>	<u>EDMUND PATRICK HUGH McNEILE &amp; ANOR v CLUSTER 3 </u>
<P>

<u>PTY LIMITED</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 21 December
1998.  In substance, it brings an appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal
Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).  The hearing took place on 20 May 1999.  No
affidavits were read.  The material placed before the Court consisted of
exhibits
(A-K).
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs had earlier brought proceedings to restrain the
defendants from removing certain earthworks and a culvert to
the entrance to
their property.  The matter was heard by Master Macready.  At the conclusion of
the addresses in the hearing of that
claim, the defendant sought leave to put
on a Cross-claim.  The application was opposed.  The defendant was given leave
to file a
Cross-claim in respect of one of the two orders sought.  The leave
was given on 14 May 1997.
<P>

3  	The matter then proceeded to final hearing.  A judgment was
delivered on 28 May 1997.  In that judgment, the Master expressed
the view that
the plaintiffs claim for relief should be dismissed.  Further, he expressed the
view that the declaration sought in
the Cross-claim should be granted.
<P>

4  	A further judgment was delivered on 19 June 1997.  By that time,
the plaintiffs had filed a Notice of Motion seeking to set
aside the
declaration and for leave to re-open their case.  The leave to re-open was
sought so as to enable the leading of further
evidence from Mr Dart.  Although
the Master saw the application as an attempt to have a second chance at running
their case, the
Master granted the relief sought.  He took this course "Bearing
in mind the possibility of the conflict of findings, notwithstanding
criticisms
I have made of the plaintiffs".  In the judgment, the Master further said "I
would give leave to re-open and set aside
the order I have made subject to the
plaintiffs paying the costs thrown away and in particular the costs of the last
hearing".
<P>

5  	It is convenient to observe at this stage that what had then been
said by the Master about the matter of costs did not constitute
the costs order
actually made by him.  It seems to me that it was intended as preliminary
observations to indicate the course proposed
 to be taken by the Master in
relation to the application for leave.  Further it seems to me that he had in
mind that the granting
of the leave to re-open was to be conditional on the
plaintiffs paying certain costs.
<P>

6  	The judgment concluded with the following paragraph "I order the
plaintiffs to pay the costs of the prior hearing before me.
 I set aside the
order when I dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for relief and, so there is no
confusion, I also order the plaintiff
to pay the costs involved in the
application to reopen".
<P>

7  	It is convenient to observe also at this stage that such
paragraph sets forth the actual orders (including the actual cost order)
made
by the Master.  There can be no doubt that the plaintiffs had been ordered on
19 June 1997 to pay "the costs of the prior hearing"
and "the costs involved in
the application to re-open".  In construing the order, it needs to be borne in
mind that the matters litigated
up to that stage had been resolved in the
defendant's favour and that no other order had been made in respect to costs
incurred up
to that time.  The order itself does not use the expression "the
costs thrown away".  It may be that some lack of harmony can be
seen between
the preliminary observations and the terms of the order actually made.  Be that
as it may, it is the terms of the actual
order that are material.  It can be
added that, to the extent that it may be material, the Master appears to have
regarded the costs
of the last hearing as "costs thrown away".
<P>

8  	A further judgment was delivered on 20 June 1997.  In that
judgment, the Master expressed the view that "So far as costs are
concerned, my
view in respect of the hearing before me to-day and yesterday is that there has
been some success on both sides in
respect of the hearing on that day".  He
observed that "I have already made cost orders in respect of the earlier
hearing before
me and I do not intend to disturb that costs order in respect of
the present matter".  He then made an order that each party pay
its own
costs.
<P>

9  	The matter came before Master Macready once again on 27 May 1998.
The parties were inter alia seeking clarification concerning
the extent of the
costs order made in the judgment of 19 June 1997.  In a further judgment
delivered on 27 May 1998, the Master observed
as follows:-
<P>

"It has been submitted that in effect the change of the case presented really
meant if it had been presented properly there would
be no costs of the trial
because the only issue would have been authority.  That may be so but I think I
should restrain myself to
what I had in mind at that stage and I clearly first
indicated that the costs thrown away should be paid by the plaintiffs and then
I added some explanation to indicate that the costs thrown away included the
costs of the last hearing.  So there was no doubt at
that stage I then went on
to say I order the plaintiff to pay the (sic) of the hearing before me.  So,
the order I made is that first
the plaintiff pay the costs of the application
to reopen;  second, the plaintiff pay the costs thrown away by the reopening of
such
case to include the costs incurred in the actual hearing before me on 14
May 1997.  By way of explanation for the costs assessor,
any preparation costs
in the hearing of 14 May should be paid by the plaintiff if they are correctly
described as costs thrown away
as a result of his application to reopen."
<P>

10  	These observations can be seen as no more than as a purported
exposition given with the intention of clarifying the actual
orders made on 19
June 1997.  It may be that there is some discrepancy between what was said and
ordered on 19 June 1997 and what
is said in these observations.  Be that as it
may, I again stress that it is the terms of the actual order that are material.
Once
again it is made clear that the plaintiff was to pay the costs of the
prior hearing and the costs involved in the application to
re-open.  Further,
it can again be added that, to the extent that it is material, the purported
exposition reinforces the view that
the Master regarded the costs of the
hearing as also falling within the category of "costs thrown away".  I should
observe also that
for the first time these costs were being referred to as "the
costs thrown away by the reopening of the plaintiffs' case".  The purported
exposition also makes it clear that the Master had in contemplation that costs
thrown away (including the costs of the hearing) had
the potential to pick up
"preparation costs".
<P>

11  	The defendant prepared a Bill of Costs.  It claimed costs for
all preparatory work done prior to 14 May 1997.  The defendant
made application
to this Court for assessment of the costs on a party/party basis.  The Court
appointed a Costs Assessor (Mr Hughes).
 Objections and submissions were made
to him.  On 11 December 1998, he issued a Certificate as to Determination of
Costs.  The effect
of this Determination was to allow most of the costs claimed
for preparation.  The Costs Assessor gave reasons for his determination.
 These
may be found in a letter dated 11 December 1998.  The letter contained the
following:-
<P>

	"On June 20th, 1997 the Master at page 7 stated he would not disturb the
orders as to the earlier hearing and then ordered each
party pay its own costs.
As this referred to the new hearing being that of June 20th as to the argument
upon the applicability of
encroachment of buildings, the order each party pay
their own costs applies only to June 20th and not June 19th.  To suggest (as
the Costs Respondent does by the letter to me of November 7th, 1998) the
reference to each party paying their own costs applies to
other than solely
June 20th would be to negate the very express orders the Master immediately
previously made as to the proceedings
of June 19th and previous to that.  I
reject this suggestion of the Costs Respondent.  Clearly the Defendent (sic) is
not entitled
to costs as to the work carried out on June 20th, 1997 and as to
the encroachment of buildings issue determined that day.  The Costs
Applicant
in fact in its bill claims only for one half day on June 19th and not at all
for June 20th.
<P>

	At issue is determining what are the limits of `the costs thrown away by the
re-opening of the plaintiff's case.'  Referring to
page 2 of his judgement
(sic) of May 27th, 1998 which notes on June 19th, 1997 the Master set aside his
earlier dismissal on May
28th, 1997 of the Plaintiff's claim, the `throwing
away' refers to the Defendent's (sic) costs in arriving at the Master's
decision
of May 28th, 1997 which was set aside on June 19th, 1997 when the
Master gave leave to re-open the plaintiff's case.  I cannot reach
any clearer
conclusion from this than that the costs order in favour of the Defendent (sic)
includes the Defendent's (sic) costs
of inter alia defending the Plaintiff's
application for which judgement (sic) was given on May 28th, 1997 up to an
including on June
19th, 1997.  The new evidence allowed to be given for the
Plaintiff when the case was agreed to be re-opened was as stated by the
Master
on June 20th, 1997 evidence from Mr Dart, valuers and engineers.
<P>

	From reading the Judgements (sic) of May 28th, June 19th and 20th 1997 it
appears the nature of the questions addressed differed:
 the first hearing as
to which judgement (sic) was given on May 28th related to acquiesence (sic),
consent and equitable estoppel
whereas the third hearing as to which judgement
(sic) was given on June 20th, 1997 related to issues under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/eoba235/" class="autolink_findacts">Encroachment of
Buildings Act</a> and further evidence of Mr Dart."
<P>

12  	Section 208L provides a narrow avenue of appeal.  It is
restricted to a matter of law arising in the assessment proceedings.
 The
appellant bears the onus of satisfying the Court that there is an entitlement
to relief.
<P>

13  	The thrust of the plaintiffs' case is that there has been an
error of principle and two matters were identified.  The alleged
error is said
to relate to the preparation costs allowed.  It is said that there are such
preparation costs which could not be described
as "costs thrown away".  The
plaintiffs have informed the Court that there were some 220 preparation items.
It does not point to
any of these items by way of illustration of alleged
error.
<P>

14  	Counsel for the defendant has prepared written submissions.
These were supplemented by oral argument.  The thrust of the submissions
is
that the Costs Assessor correctly directed himself to the assessment task.  He
made a determination which was open to him on the
material placed before him.
The complaints which the plaintiffs make relate to questions of fact, and do
not raise any error of law.
<P>

15  	The task faced by the Costs Assessor was not an easy one.  There
seems to have been confusion as to the orders actually made
and the effect of
those costs provisions.  This confusion was reflected in the manner in which
issues were agitated both before the
Costs Assessor and this Court.
<P>

16  	In my view, the terms of the actual costs order are sufficiently
clear.  However, whether or not there be any ambiguity or
confusion, certain
matters are abundantly clear.  One of these was that the plaintiffs had been
ordered to pay the costs of the prior
hearing.  This order had the potential to
pick up costs incurred prior to the actual hearing itself (including costs
which may be
described as being of a preparatory nature).  In my view, the
determination made by the Costs Assessor was open on the material placed
before
him.
<P>

17  	I should add that there has been no appeal against the costs
order.  No application has been made to the Master to either vary
the order or
rectify any alleged error.
<P>

18  	It seems to me that the submissions made on behalf of the
plaintiffs are misconceived.  I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs
have
demonstrated any error of law which would justify the disturbing of the
determination.  There is substance to the contention
that what was argued was
in reality no more than allegations as to error of fact.  For completeness, it
may be added that the plaintiffs
have failed to identify any error of fact.
<P>

19  	I dismiss the Summons.  The plaintiffs to pay the costs of the
Summons.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
