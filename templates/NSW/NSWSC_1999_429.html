<b>JUDGMENT (Public interest immunity - <i>"Waind v Hill</i>"
discretion)</b>
<P>

1	Following my judgment of 19 March on the plaintiff's Notice of Motion to
preclude inspection by the defendant of documents the
subject of a subpoena and
Notice to Produce (NSWSC 212 - DLJT:  24), leave was granted by the Court of
Appeal on 30 April 1999 (see
judgment of Mason P) and the judgment of that
Court delivered on 15 April (NSWCA 97).
<P>

2	On 16 April I granted leave to the plaintiff further to argue two undecided
matters which had previously been raised before me
(public interest immunity
and the <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b> discretion NSWSC 348 - DLJT: 33).
<P>

3	On 20 April 1999 the defendant made submissions that it was not open to me to
hear further from the plaintiff on these two issues,
founding its submissions
in observations of the Full Court of the Federal Court in <b><i>Bryant v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1299.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1299</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2057%20FCR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 57 FCR 287</a> at 295C-296B, 297E and
298A.  
<P>

4	<b><i>Bryant</i></b> was concerned with final relief.  No case was cited to
me that could provide authority or assistance in the resolution of this curious
area in interlocutory proceedings.  I am not persuaded to change the views I
expressed in my judgment of 16 April.  The two undecided
issues have been
enlivened before me and are enlivened again.  The failure of the
plaintiff/respondent to contend, I do not see as
precluding me from further
considering the matters and it is to be noted that in any event, had the
matters been the subject of contention
in the Court of Appeal the <b><i>Waind v
Hill</i></b> discretion would have been remitted to me.  Accordingly on that,
as-it-were, jurisdictional issue, the defendant fails.
<P>

5	I turn to the public interest immunity component of the plaintiff's
application to persist in precluding the defendant from inspecting
the
documents.  The relevant documents are document 1 in Annexure A and documents
13, 17, 41, 42, 43, 44 in Annexure B to Mr Lee's
affidavit of 1 March 1999.
Each of these documents relate to D15 and/or D16 and, it is said, in particular
two aspects of the plaintiff's
circumstantial case in response to those
allegations.  All but document 37 are statutory declarations;  document 37 is a
record of
a Police interview with D16 in which the police put to D16 parts of
the material in document 1.
<P>

6	The foundation for the claim akin to one of public interest immunity rests in
the assertions as to confidentiality attending the
circumstances in which the
material was provided by Mr Lee to the police (documents 1, 13, 41-44).  (See
paragraphs 4 and 5 of Mr
Lee's affidavit and the statement by Mr Lee that he
would not have provided that material were it not for that confidentiality:
paragraph
6).  It is contended that there is strong public interest in
effective policing requiring the cooperation with the Police of persons
under
suspicion (see my rulings on the Police claim for public interest immunity as
to the record of the interview of 29 January
1999:  19 March  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/213.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">1999 NSWSC 213</a> -
DLJT: 25, 1 April  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/284.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">1999 NSWSC 284</a> - DLJT:  31).  
<P>

7	In an evidentiary context the reference to which is not the subject itself of
contention, it appears from the testimony of Superintendent
Woodhouse that save
for "<i>dotting the i's and crossing the t's"</i> after 29 January his
investigations were effectively finished.  He also had to receive some
information from Mr Lee.  He would then
put the matter together and submit it
to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  He did not consider it an
investigation that he was
actively pursuing though acknowledged that the DPP
could direct further inquiries (T982).  It is not known, of course, known what
the contents of any report to the DPP were or will be.  For the purposes of
this application, namely to enliven again the public
interest immunity
component, it is apparent from the evidence thus far before me that a
reasonable view could be taken that the investigation
is at an end subject to
any further direction that could be made by the DPP.  Thus the context of
continuing police investigations
must be viewed in a different light.
<P>

8	I dealt with the public interest immunity component of the original
application in paragraphs 106 - 163 of my judgment of 19 March
acknowledging
the attractiveness then of both sides position on this issue.  It is to be
borne in mind that no claim for public interest
immunity has been advanced for
the determination by the Court by an instrument of the State and it seems that
essentially what the
plaintiff is seeking to do is to assert such an immunity
vis-a-vis the defendant founded upon the confidential circumstances in which
the materials provided (insufficient though they were for the purposes of
client legal privilege).  I am still of the view that it
is desirable in the
public interest that confidentiality attend dealings between a suspected person
and investigating police, the
more so in a continuing investigation, but that
confidentiality does not preclude the police from using any information so
gained
to make relevant inquiries.  The Court must not be quick to intervene
except in the most exceptional circumstances in a situation
such as this
(<b><i>Sankey v Whitlam</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20142%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 142 CLR 1</a> at 44:  see also <b><i>Tipene
v Apperley</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NZLR%20761" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NZLR 761).</a>  Assuming the documents and information
contained within them do fall within a class akin to a class of public interest
immunity
resting in the confidentiality of communications to the Police, I am
not persuaded that there is anything in s 130(4) that reinforces
the nature of
such a cognate public interest immunity.  With respect to s 130(5) it is clear
that the documents and information contained
in them are of importance to the
issues on the amendment application and the trial generally in the context of
the defence of justification.
 Access and inspection, however, will still be a
matter of discretion.
<P>

9	I am not, in the end, persuaded that there is a public interest in the
maintenance of the confidentiality of these documents in
circumstances where no
formal claim for public interest immunity has been advanced by the relevant
authority, where care in any event
as a matter of principle must be taken
before the Court quickly decides to attach immunity, where the documents save
for the Record
of Interview conducted by the Police with one of the
complainants was volunteered by the plaintiff to the Police, and the importance
of the material to the amendment application and the trial generally, in the
weighing exercise, advances any cognate public interest
to the exclusion of the
conduct of this litigation in terms of the defendant having access to this
material, (but subject to discretionary
considerations).
<P>

10	Thus, the claim founded upon the asserted public interest immunity fails.
<P>

11	I turn now to the <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b> discretion.
<P>

12	The decision of the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1
NSWLR 372</a> was analysed exhaustively by Mr McHugh and Mr Wheelhouse.
Unquestionably the matter of inspection is one in the discretion of the
trial
judge (383A-C).  It is to be borne in mind that save for the Record of
Interview these are not a stranger's document in the
sense that they are
initially sourced in one of the parties to the litigation.  The important, but
not necessarily determinative,
question in relation to the exercise of the
discretion to permit inspection is whether the documents have apparent
relevance to the
issues (385D).  This they clearly do:  the issues both as to
the amendment application and the issues to justification generally
in the
trial.  The Court is not concerned with ultimate questions of admissibility
(385F).  Nor, in my view, is this Court concerned
with the revelation of any
matters private to the plaintiff given that the matters are relevant (386A).
<P>

13	The plaintiff's position boils down to this, in my view:  the plaintiff does
not want the defendant to have any forensic advantage
in obtaining by the
inspection of these documents by what is described as the plaintiff's
circumstantial case in answer to the defendant's
case on justification
particularly in relation to D15 and D16.  I agree with the submission made by
Mr Wheelhouse for the question
of "<i>mere</i> <i>forensic advantage or
disadvantage"</i> is irrelevant. However if any question of advantage or
disadvantage can be elevated to a real question of "<i>injustice</i>", the
matter may well be viewed otherwise.  I am of the opinion that that is the case
here.
<P>

14	The defendant is seeking to establish in this civil trial the guilt of the
plaintiff of criminal conduct.  That, shortly stated,
is what is involved in
its plea of justification.  It is a forensic exercise of the utmost gravity.
The defendant has particularised
a case (subject to amendment) and it can be
inferred that it has done so on the basis of instructions, information and
evidence it
proposes to lead.  In so serious a forensic environment the course
of evidence must not be infected. The elucidation of the truth
will be founded
upon the evidence that is lead and challenged in the usual way and, in such a
case as this involving criminal allegations
as it does, by the powerful
mechanism of cross-examination.  It is of critical importance, in my view, that
the evidence of such
persons as D15 and D16 be given without there having been
made available to the defendant an indication of the plaintiff's case,
"<i>circumstantial</i>" or particularly affecting the credibility of those
witnesses, in advance.  It would defeat rather than serve the ends of justice
and the elucidation of the truth in a case of this special kind where the
plaintiff is on trial for criminal conduct, where the defendant
has made its
allegations by way of its plea of justification (and in respect of D15 or D16
there being no issue as to prejudice),
for such witnesses to be called by the
defendant to know in advance and thus be in a position to tailor their
testimony, the position
of the plaintiff forensically to destroy that case
particularly as to cross-examination as to credit and the proof of
"<i>circumstances</i>" otherwise attending the resolution of the defendant's
claims.
<P>

15	In my judgment in relation to the Corrs subpoena (although argued after the
submissions in this application), I have dealt at
greater length with the
general discretionary considerations which in the end are equally applicable in
this instance.
<P>

16	I refuse leave to the defendant to inspect the documents referred to in
paragraph 5 hereof.
