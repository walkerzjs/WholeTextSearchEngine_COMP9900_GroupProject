<b>1836/99 - GAMILAROI BOOMERANGS SPORTS ABORIGINAL CORPORATION V MEMBERS OF
NEW ENGLAND GROUP 19 RUGBY LEAGUE GENERAL COMMITTEE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an application to restrain the holding of an
enquiry by the members of New England Group 19 of the rugby league.
<P>

2	The plaintiff has received a letter indicating that the general committee of
the New England Group 19 will be meeting at the Glen
Innes RSL Club tonight at
7.45 to enquire into allegations of misconduct by the plaintiff through its
players and/or supporters during
the 1998 season, being matters which are said
to affect the control and welfare of the Group and rugby league football.
<P>

3	The plaintiff says that such an enquiry, if held tonight, would be a
travesty.   The foregone conclusion it says will be reached
is a  denial of
natural justice, and thus the meeting should be restrained.
<P>

4	In particular the plaintiff says that first, the enquiry has not been
properly convened.  Secondly, that it has sought particulars
of the allegations
and it has not been given adequate particulars.  Thirdly, the people who
apparently intend to participate in the
meeting have, by their previous
actions, shown actual bias towards the plaintiff, or would reasonably be
perceived to be biased against
the plaintiff; and fourthly, in the light of two
previous sets of court proceedings, in which the plaintiff succeeded on similar
issues, this would be a case of triple jeopardy.
<P>

5	The allegations that are contained in exhibit PX01, which is at least an
attempt to supply particulars, do raise some matters
which, if established, one
could see would be of genuine concern to those wishing to uphold rugby league
players as role models in
the community.  The previous proceedings, as I
understand them, did not actually deal with the truth or otherwise of those
allegations,
but were victories for the plaintiff because of procedural and
other irregularities.   Accordingly, what has gone before does not
necessarily
make me consider that this is a special case outside the way in which this
Court generally approaches this sort of issue.
<P>

6	There are perhaps six basic principles that have to be borne in mind.
<P>

7	(a) 	Bodies such as Group 19, which exist to promote sport in a locality,
must generally be free to conduct their affairs informally,
and the court will
only become involved as, more or less, a last resort, otherwise the right of
freedom of association held so dear
by Australians would be thwarted.
<P>

8	(b) 	As a general rule people who want to hold meetings should be allowed to
hold them, otherwise the right of  freedom of speech
and association would be
impinged.
<P>

9	However, (c) meetings must be properly convened.  If a meeting has not been
properly convened then, even though it might look
like a meeting, it is not in
law a meeting and is valueless.
<P>

10	(d) 	Meetings, especially when they affect the proprietary rights, or the
right to work, of individuals, must be conducted so
that there is no denial of
natural justice.
<P>

11	(e) 	What constitutes natural justice in any particular set of facts will be
infinitely various, as shown by the decision of
Needham J in<b> McNab v Auburn
Soccer Sports Club Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NSWLR%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 NSWLR 54.</a>
<P>

12	(f)    	It is not necessarily the case that a person is entitled to
particulars or to legal representation at a meeting.  Questions
as to procedure
are a matter for the meeting itself, and it is only when there is an actual
denial of natural justice that the court
will interfere.
<P>

13	In the instant case, it may be that some of the questions that Mr Sutton,
for the plaintiff, raises are matters which the court
would in due course
consider might nullify the making of any decision.  On the other hand, the
defendants have been very clearly
warned that unless they do afford natural
justice at the meeting then their decision will be called into question.
Experience in
the past has shown that under such circumstances, properly
advised by competent lawyers, the chances of natural justice rules being
infringed diminish considerably.
<P>

14	I cannot see how this is a special case where the court should stop people
holding an enquiry or a meeting if they wish to do
so.  I appreciate that this
means that the plaintiff and its members may have to make some awkward tactical
decisions as to what
they do at the meeting.  It may also be that the members
of the general committee may need to adjourn after they have given a fair
and
reasonable outline of the case against the plaintiff, at least if the plaintiff
requires a reasonably short adjournment to deal
with those matters.  However, I
cannot see why the court should at this stage prohibit the meeting from being
held or, alternatively,
declare that it has not properly been convened.
<P>

15	Accordingly, I decline to make any order at this stage.   I give leave to
the plaintiff to amend the summons generally.  The
plaintiff is to pay the
costs of today.  I stand the matter over for mention before me on 7 April 1999
at 9.50am.   The exhibits
can be retained. 
<P>

	                                         oOo
