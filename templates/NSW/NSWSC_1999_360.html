<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity)</b>
<P>

1	Consequent upon my judgment of 10 July 1998 (DLJ: 1) there was an
unsuccessful application by the defendant for leave to appeal
to the Court of
Appeal. 
<P>

2	On 23 December 1998 the plaintiffs filed an Amended Statement of Claim.  
<P>

3	With respect to the first matter complained of being the principal story in
<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 8 January 1997, the plaintiffs pleaded the
following imputations:
<P>

	"<i>5(a)	they were so stupid, in the sense that they were lacking in
intelligence, that they failed the HSC;</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	they had limited their future careers to menial occupations not
requiring ability or training because they had each failed the
HSC;</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	they were so lacking in application and academic self-discipline that
each failed his or her HSC;</i>
<P>

	<i>(d)	they were failures".</i>
<P>

4	In respect of the second matter complained of (the editorial), the plaintiffs
pleaded the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"7(a)	they were so stupid, in the sense that they were lacking in
intelligence, that they failed their HSC;</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	they were abject overwhelming failures in that they were incapable of
successfully completing their HSC;</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	they had limited their future careers to menial occupations not
requiring ability or training because they had each failed the
HSC;</i>
<P>

	<i>(d)	they were so lacking in application and academic self-discipline that
each failed his or her HSC".</i>
<P>

5	In the course of argument on the application by the defendant in relation to
the imputations in this Amended Statement of Claim,
the plaintiffs abandoned
imputations 5(b) and (d) and 7(c), there thus leaving for consideration
imputations 5(c) and 7(d), the others
remaining in place consequent upon the
refusal of leave.
<P>

6	For the defendant it is contended with respect to the first publication and
thus imputation 5(c), that any fair reading of the
whole of that matter could
not, on a reasonable basis, give rise to an imputation which attributes the
outcome of the Higher School
Certificate examinations solely to the conduct of
the individual plaintiffs.  It is argued that it is quite clear that the
emphasis
of the article sued upon is that the system/the department/society is
<i>"to blame</i>".  It is incumbent upon the pleader, it is submitted, to
prevent an imputation arising reflecting solely on the individual as arising
from the whole of the article.
<P>

7	Paragraphs 39 to 45 of the first matter complained of are as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Students from Mt Druitt High School's class of '96 blamed poor resources,
a lack of discipline and their own tomfoolery for their
disastrous HSC
results.</i>
<P>

<i>	Students David Deagan, Eid Haddad and Tim Jawabreh admitted classes had
been `mad' last year.</i>
<P>

<i>	`There was no commitment (among the students),' Eid, 17 said `It was like a
game'.</i>
<P>

<i>	David Deagan said the school dux - who expected a mark above 60 - scored 44
out of 100.</i>
<P>

<i>	`We had to share textbooks,' David said.</i>
<P>

<i>	`There was one book between two or three people and they wouldn't let us
take books home.</i>
<P>

<i>	`We would try to photocopy pages or write it out'".</i>
<P>

8	The presence of this part of the matter complained of is extremely
problematical in the resolution of the capacity of the article
as a whole to
convey imputations attributing blame solely to the students.  But upon further
consideration it is to be noted here
that even the references to tom-foolery
and lack of discipline are encompassed by the students themselves additionally
blaming "<i>poor resources</i>" for which, according to the tenor of the whole
article, "<i>we</i>", that is, society or the department, are to bear the
blame.
<P>

9	The view to which I have now come is that from these last series of
paragraphs there cannot be on any reasonable basis isolated
as a "<i>sole</i>"
cause the conduct of the students referred to.  Accordingly, I am unable to
find on any reasonable basis that the matter complained
of is capable of
conveying an imputation in the form pleaded in paragraph 5(c) and that
imputation will not go to the jury.  
<P>

10	Whether the plaintiffs propose further to seek to amend will be a matter for
them and their advisers.  
<P>

11	It was also argued on behalf of the defendant that the application of the
principle relating to libel of a class as enunciated
especially by Hunt J in
<b><i>McCormick v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited &amp; Anor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16
NSWLR 485</a> precludes, as a matter of capacity, any imputation of the kind (now
disallowed) from being held to be capable of arising and thus,
going to the
jury.
<P>

12	In <b><i>McCormick</i></b> his Honour was concerned with the issue of
whether a plaintiff may sue as a member of a class of three in relation to the
allegation
that only one of that class was responsible for perverting the
course of justice (at 488D):  the publication relevantly was "<i>The Mercury
has been given exclusively a letter indicating one of the men was involved in
fixing court cases ...", </i>the "<i>men</i>" being a reference to the three
members of the relevant private investigation firm.
<P>

13	The general principle as stated by his Honour which is indisputably correct
is as follows: 
<P>

	"<i>A libel upon the whole of a class may be the subject of complaint by a
member of that class who is not otherwise individually pointed
to in what was
published only if the matter complained of can fairly be read as defaming each
member of that class. In determining
whether the matter is capable of such an
interpretation, the size of the class, the generality of the charge and the
extravagance
of the accusation may all be considered, although none is
conclusive" </i>(at 487G-488).
<P>

14	His Honour ultimately held that as the matter with which his Honour was
concerned could not by its express wording be interpreted
as asserting that
each member of a class was guilty of the particular conduct and as there was
nothing in the matter which pointed
to the plaintiff as the one who was alleged
to have been guilty of that conduct, it was incapable of conveying the relevant
imputations
(at 491C).  In my earlier judgment (at pages 3-4) I dealt with the
question of identification, being satisfied with the degree of
particularisation in the relevant pleading and here repeated.  In the instant
case I am not persuaded by any of the considerations
referred to as going to
determining whether the matter is capable of giving rise to an imputation of
the kind on which the plaintiffs
individually will seek to rely, that any of
them conclusively operates to the exclusion of any such appropriately drawn
imputation.
 I do not see those considerations operating to prevent, otherwise,
the availability, as a matter of capacity, of the imputations
remaining on the
record.  The size of the class is large, namely 26 plaintiffs.  The charges
presently represented by the imputations
on the record are general in nature
but are capable of being applied, in my view, to each individual member of that
class as a plaintiff.
<P>

15	As to the second matter complained of (the editorial), in the end, I have
come to the view that the defendant's position on the
capacity question in
relation to the remaining imputation in issue is stronger.  A fair reading of
this piece (taking into account
even the arguable proposition that editorials
may be read with more care than a news item), it does state "<i>The cruel
reality is that these students did not fail the academic system.  The truth is
that the system failed them and that is an
unpardonable disgrace</i>"
(paragraph 10) and "<i>there is little gain to be made in blaming the students,
although some told The Daily Telegraph yesterday they could have applied
themselves more rigorously to their studies".  </i>Clearly, this publication is
fairly and squarely attributing blame, on any fair reading, and in an emphatic
way to the "<i>system</i>" rather than the students.
<P>

16	I find I am unable to accept the proposition advanced for the plaintiffs
that the defendant's submissions proceed on the explicit
assumption that the
imputations in 5(c) and 7(d) required that the lack of application and academic
self-discipline be the sole cause,
the exclusive cause of the plaintiffs
failure.  Nor do I assert the submission for the plaintiffs that that is not
what the imputations
say at all.  I read the imputations saying nothing but
that.
<P>

17	Whilst, as I have said in this judgment, the concluding paragraphs of the
first matter complained of are problematical, the conclusion
I have reached is
that neither imputations 5(c) and 7(d) is capable of arising from the
respective matters complained of and neither
will go to the jury.
<P>

18	I was requested by counsel for the defendant to reserve the question of
costs;  I shall do so noting the abandonment by the plaintiffs
of the
imputations to which reference has been made and the overall success of the
defendants.  An appropriate order for costs will
be made at an appropriate
time.
<P>

19	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 5(c) and 7(d) will not go to the jury.
<P>

2.	Liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3 days notice.
<P>
