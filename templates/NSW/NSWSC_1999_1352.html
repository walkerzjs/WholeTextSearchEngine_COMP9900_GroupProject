<u>REGINA  v  NICHOLAS KATSOOLIS</u><p>
60710/95<p>
WEDNESDAY, 28 AUGUST 1996<p>
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL<p>
HUNT CJ at CL, SMART J, JAMES J<p>
	<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SMART J:</b> Nicholas Katsoolis has applied for leave to appeal against the
severity of a sentence imposed upon him by Mahoney DCJ. The applicant
was
arraigned on six counts. On one he was acquitted by direction of the judge,
there being no evidence to support it. On two counts
he was acquitted by the
jury. <p>
	He was convicted of indecently assaulting his niece when she was nine years of
age, by touching her on the outside of her knickers
over the area of the
vagina. <p>
	He was convicted of indecent assault upon her while he was driving a vehicle.
She was aged between nine and thirteen years. The
applicant asked her to give
him a cuddle. As she moved across the bench seat to sit beside him, he put her
head down between the
steering wheel and his body and put his erect penis in
her mouth. When she tried to lift her head it was pushed back down.<p>
	He was convicted of buggery. This occurred in the refrigeration area of the
cafe owned by her grandmother and in which the applicant
worked. <p>
	The three offences, which were not isolated incidents, took place between 1969
and 1973. The complainant did not report the matter
to the police for over
twenty years. It seems that they were reported in 1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
	The judge sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of six
months for the first indecent assault; a fixed term of
two years for the second
indecent assault, and a minimum term of six years with an additional term of
one year for the offence of
buggery. The terms of imprisonment were
concurrent.<p>
	The judge stated that the offence of buggery no longer existed because of the
amendments to the Crimes Act. His Honour said:<p>
"It seems to me to be appropriate, to sentence the prisoner for the offences
for which he had been convicted, in the context of the
penalty which applies at
this present time in respect of the same or equivalent offences. Consequently I
will regard the maximum
penalty which the third conviction, namely on the
charge of buggery, could warrant, would be a sentence of penal servitude for
twenty
years."<p>
<p>
	At the conclusion of his Honour's lengthy remarks on sentence, the solicitor
appearing for the Crown submitted that his Honour had
fallen into error and
that the only maximum penalty on which reliance could be placed was that
prescribed for buggery at the time
at which the offence was committed. The
judge stated that he had considered this. He explained that he had not been
able to find
any authorities which were of assistance. At pages 31-32 of his
remarks the judge said:<p>
"What I have sought to do was to accommodate the sentencing exercise to the
current mores, and to the current state of law both as
to penalties and
sentencing so as best to reflect the situation. I did not for one moment think
that one-third of twenty years was
appropriate so therefore it ought to be
seven years or six years, or whatever it was. And I want to make that perfectly
clear in
case this is taken on appeal, that I did not apply a one-third factor.
What I did was to apply a judgmental factor, having regard
to a twenty year
maximum."<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
	The judge stated that the maximum penalty at the time of the offences "seemed
... to be an irrelevant consideration ... the sentence
will stand.". The judge
erred in the approach he took. He was bound to proceed on the basis of the
crime with which the accused was
convicted <p>
and the penalty fixed by the statute for that crime.<p>
	In <u>Regina v Shore</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=66%20A%20Crim%20R%2037" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">66 A Crim 37</a> at 42, Badgery-Parker J (with whom
Mahoney JA and Hunt CJ at CL agreed) adopted the approach of Judge Court, the
sentencing judge,
that he had to impose a sentence appropriate not only to the
applicable maximum at the date of the offence but also appropriate to
the
sentencing patterns which applied at that time. The accused was convicted
before Judge Court in 1991 for a crime committed in
1974. In <u>Shore</u> cases
were found which indicated what the sentencing pattern was around 1974.<p>
	The researches of counsel in relation to the availability of material on
sentences of buggery have not yielded much of use, nor
have my researches. I
have had to do the best I can in relation to the 1973 position.  Given the
approach of the judge, it is a case
in which it is appropriate for this Court
to re-sentence the applicant.<p>
	The offences were objectively serious. Buggery upon a child is repulsive.
These were also breaches of trust by an uncle in the home
and the child was
aged between nine and thirteen. The method chosen to secure the complainant's
silence, namely that it would adversely
affect the child's grandmother to whom
she was very attached, was reprehensible.<p>
<p>
<p>
	In view of the applicant being acquitted of three of the six counts with which
he was charged, the plea of not guilty was justified.
It was also mainly a case
of word against word. The applicant did express regret as to the first incident
and attributed it to his
being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<p>
	The sentencing judge found that "no physical force of an injury producing
nature was employed to compel the complainant to submit"
and that "the offences
were probably committed at times when his sense of propriety and rectitude and
his inhibitions were all significantly
undermined by the effects of alcohol."
The judge also found that despite the breaches of trust this was not the same
type of offence
as a father or stepfather sexually abusing a child - it was an
exercise in "opportunism" bearing in mind that he was "a sad man who
must have
been internally very unhappy and unfulfilled throughout his life."<p>
	There are other significant considerations. The sentences will be served under
protection. This makes the imprisonment much harder
and will highlight the
ostracism which the applicant has experience throughout his life. The offences
are more than twenty-two years
old and were not even reported until after
twenty years had elapsed from the commission of them.<p>
	The applicant is now sixty-nine years of age and he is not in good health. He
suffers from hypertension and indigestion, for both
of which he receives
medication, degenerative osteoarthritis; bronchitis and occasional haemoptysis
requiring hospitalisation. He
has had a replacement of his left hip and is in
need of a right hip <p>
<p>
<p>
replacement. The combination of age and ill health will contribute appreciably
to the harshness of his imprisonment.<p>
	The applicant married after these offences and had three children, his eldest
son being killed in an accident. He is now divorced.
The subject offences will
isolate him from his family.<p>
	The applicant was otherwise a man of good character. Obviously he has never
been in prison before. The judge not only held that
there were no special
circumstances, but that there should be a less than usual additional term. <p>
	As we are resentencing, this is a sentence which should be approached afresh.
I am unable to share the judge's views. Given the
isolation of the applicant,
his age, his health and his temperament, I think that the applicant is going to
need considerable support
for at least eighteen months and this will certainly
be the case if, for a portion of this period, he has to undergo a hip
replacement.<p>
	I would take a broad approach to the question of sentence. It seems to me that
having regard to the total criminality in all the
offences an appropriate
minimum term is one of three years and six months; and an appropriate
additional term is one of eighteen
months. I have already identified the
special circumstances.  It will suffice if an order is made which varies the
sentence which
was imposed as to buggery.<p>
	In my opinion the appeal against sentence should be allowed and the sentence
on the count of buggery should be quashed. I would
impose a sentence on the
count of buggery having a minimum term of three years and six months, <p>
<p>
commencing on 10 October 1995 and concluding on <p>
9 April 1999. The additional term of 18 months will commence on 10 April 1999.
The sentence thus imposed should, in my view, be concurrent
with the sentences
on the other counts of indecent assault.<p>
<p>
<b>HUNT CJ at CL:</b> I agree with the orders proposed by Smart J, for the
reasons which he has given.<p>
<p>
<b>JAMES J:</b> I also agree.<p>
<p>
<b>HUNT CJ at CL:</b> The orders of the Court are as proposed by Smart J.<p>
