An Aboriginal boy was made a ward of the State as an infant.  After the
expiration of the limitation period he sought to bring proceedings
against the
respondents alleging common law negligence, and breach of statutory and
fiduciary duties.  The Master refused to extend
the time on the basis that he
had not established the requirements of s.58(2) and ss.60G and I.  Held the
Master was in error in
this regard, but not in finding that he had available
causes of action and it was otherwise just and reasonable to grant the
extension.

<P>

<b>20729/1997 - JOHNSON   v   DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	The appellant, Mr Christopher Johnson, for whom Mr T.K.
Tobin of Queen's Counsel and Mr P.W.J. Gray of Counsel appeared, has
appealed
against a decision of Master Harrison, which was delivered on 29 June 1999,
whereby she declined to extend the limitation
period within which he might
commence proceedings against the respondents, for which and whom Mr J.A.
McCarthy of Queen's Counsel
and Ms R. Druitt of Counsel appeared.  The Master
ordered that the original Notice of Motion, which was filed on 22 May 1998, be
dismissed and that the appellant pay the respondents' costs of the application.
The appellant filed an Amended Notice of Motion on
the first day of the hearing
before the Master, namely 22 March 1999, and it is clear that she also intended
to dismiss it.
<P>

2   	By the Amended Notice of Motion the appellant sought an
order, pursuant to s.60G and/or s.58 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969, ("the
Act"), that the limitation period for the causes of action in negligence and
for breach of statutory duty set out in
his Statement of Claim, being one which
claimed damages for personal injury, be extended to 24 July 1997, being the
date on which
the Statement of Claim was filed, and for consequential relief.
The parties agreed before me that the appellant's application to
the Court was
made on the date of the filing of the Statement of Claim.
<P>

<b>The Allegations Made</b>
<P>

3   	It is convenient to trace the history of the matter, at
least initially, by reference to the allegations in the Statement of
Claim,
which, at least so far as the chronology and certain essential facts are
concerned, were not substantially in issue.
<P>

4   	The appellant, an Aboriginal, was born at Wilcannia in
Western New South Wales, on 2 August 1968.  On or about 5 March 1973,
he was
removed from the care and custody of his parents and family and committed by an
order of a Children's Court at Wilcannia under
the <b>Child Welfare Act</b>
1939 to the care of the Minister for Community Services to be dealt with as a
ward and admitted to State control. From 5 March 1973
to January 1974 he was
placed in three specified institutions and, on 7 January 1974, he was placed as
a foster child with white
foster parents and their children at Panania, a
suburb of Sydney.  He remained in that foster placement until about 26 August
1981,
by which time he was aged 13 years.  
<P>

5   	On or about 26 August 1981, the appellant was removed from
that foster placement and placed in an institution under the control
of the
Minister and/or the Department of Community Services and, from about 20 October
1981 to about 19 December 1985, he was placed
in another institution under the
same control, namely Weroona, at Woodford in the Blue Mountains.  On leaving
Weroona, which was
closed on or about 19 December 1985, he lived for a short
time in the home of an officer of the first defendant and, thereafter,
from
about April 1986 he "was forced to fend for himself".
<P>

6   	The facts pleaded, save perhaps for those in the last
sentence of paragraph 5, were not in issue.  The respondents relied on
them to
show that the appellant was being dealt with pursuant to statutory powers, and
for other purposes to which I shall refer.
 In any event there was evdience
before the Master to establish those matters.
<P>

7   	It is alleged, in paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim,
that the respondents and each of them were and was responsible for
his care and
upbringing from the age of 4 years to 18 years, being the period from 5 March
1973 until 2 August 1986, "and thereafter
for his support and the supervision
of his progress as an ex-ward until the age of 20".
<P>

8   	It is alleged, in paragraph 12, that in these circumstances
the respondents or one or other of them owed duties to the appellant:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	to care for him and protect him from harm;</b>
<P>

<b>  (b)	to act in his best interests in accordance with his long term
needs;</b>
<P>

<b>  (c)	to ensure that he was well cared for and that his individual interests
were preserved and enhanced, while ever he was living
in the various
institutions and places referred to in paragraphs 6 to 10; </b>
<P>

<b>  (d)	to ensure that he was brought up with an appreciation and
understanding of his Aboriginality and that all reasonable efforts
were made to
maintain and/or re-establish contact and meetings between the Plaintiff and his
natural family, namely his father, mother,
siblings and other close
relatives;</b>
<P>

<b>  (e)	to ensure that he has support and supervision and (sic) an ex-ward for
two years after he reached the age of 18.</b>
<P>

<b>                                        PARTICULARS</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	The Defendants each owed to the Plaintiff fiduciary duties of such
character.</b>
<P>

<b>  (ii)	The Defendants each owed the Plaintiff such duties in tort.</b>
<P>

<b>  (iii)	The Defendants each owed to the Plaintiff statutory duties of
similar character by virtue of the provisions of Sections 9,
10, 22, 23, 24,
25, 50, 53, 54, 82, 144 and 148B in particular of the Act."</b>
<P>

9   	In paragraph 13 it is pleaded that the respondents, or one
or more of them, breached these duties, the particulars stating
that each of
the facts and matters set out therein was relied on to establish negligence and
breaches of fiduciary and statutory
duties.
<P>

10   	The particulars furnished are:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	Removing the Plaintiff, at age 4, from all contact with his immediate
and extended family.</b>
<P>

<b>  (b)	Failing to ensure, prior to and during the foster placement, that the
foster parents with whom he was to be, and was placed,
were suitable and had an
appropriate appreciation of, and respect for, the Plaintiff's
Aboriginality.</b>
<P>

<b>  (c)	Placing the Plaintiff with white foster parents rather than with
Aboriginal foster parents.</b>
<P>

<b>  (d)	Failing to supervise the conduct of the foster parents so as to ensure
that the Plaintiff did not suffer ill-treatment, including
physical
mistreatment and acts of racial discrimination.</b>
<P>

<b>  (e)	Failing adequately, or at all, to investigate and respond to
notification received in or about June 1977 to the effect that
the plaintiff
was being ill-treated and discriminated against by his foster parents.</b>
<P>

<b>  (f)	Causing the Plaintiff to remain in the foster placement
notwithstanding their awareness of the ill-treatment and discrimination
being
inflicted upon him.</b>
<P>

<b>  (g)	Causing the Plaintiff to remain in the foster placement and in other
institutions notwithstanding their awareness at various
times and for various
periods between 1973 and 1986 that the Plaintiff's own Aboriginal family and/or
extended family was willing
and able to care for him.</b>
<P>

<b>  (h)	Failing to ensure that the Plaintiff was brought up with an
appreciation and understanding of, and pride in, his Aboriginality.</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	Failing to ensure that all reasonable efforts were made to maintain
and/or re-establish contact and meetings between the Plaintiff
and his natural
family, including father, mother, siblings and relatives.</b>
<P>

<b>  (j)	Failing to protect the Plaintiff from mistreatment in the foster
placement and from sexual abuse at Minali and/or Weroona.</b>
<P>

<b>  (k)	Failing to ensure that the Plaintiff received adequate and appropriate
educational opportunities.</b>
<P>

<b>  (l)	Failing to supervise or care for the Plaintiff, adequately and
appropriate educational opportunities.</b>
<P>

<b>  (m)	Failing to supervise or care for the Plaintiff, adequately or at all,
from 19 December 1985 to 2 August 1986, and thereafter
until 2 August
1998."</b>
<P>

11   	In paragraph 14 it is pleaded that these breaches caused
loss and damage to the appellant in that he suffered, and continues
to suffer
from, the psychiatric illnesses of chronic depression, acute anxiety and
post-traumatic stress disorder.  It is nextly
alleged that the appellant was
exposed to physical ill-treatment, especially in the foster home, and to sexual
abuse at the institutions
referred to in the particulars, and became, as a
result of that, violent, and that that unlawful behaviour predisposed him to
violence,
which contributed to his commission of, and conviction and
imprisonment for, various offences of violence.
<P>

12   	The particulars continued that the appellant was rejected
in whole or in part by his Aboriginal family and also by his foster
family,
thus leaving him ill-equipped to cope with the adult world and feeling that he
belonged neither to white nor to Aboriginal
society; that he experienced trauma
and separation from his own family; that he lost the opportunity to know, love
and be loved by
his own family; that he was deprived of family and cultural
heritage; that he lost the ability to realise his innate scholastic and
academic potential; that he engaged in anti-social behaviour; that he lacked
acceptance and appreciation of and confidence in his
Aboriginality; that he
sustained the trauma of having to come to terms with his Aboriginality in the
context of having been exposed
to, and partially absorbed by, prejudiced views
about the inferiority of Aborigines; and that he lost the chance to acquit
himself
to his potential for employment, as a result of which he has suffered
and continues to suffer a loss of earning capacity.
<P>

13   	The appellant claimed damages; equitable compensation;
interest; costs and ancillary relief.
<P>

14   	On the case as pleaded, the appellant had allegedly
suffered from the mistreatment by 2 August 1988, and the alleged psychiatric
illnesses, and other particulars of damage, had occurred by that date.
<P>

<b>The Issues Before The Master</b>
<P>

15   	It was not in issue that the appellant needed an extension
of the limitation period to bring these proceedings, which he sought
pursuant
to the statutory provisions specified in the Amended Notice of Motion.  The
issues, which confronted the Master, were whether
the appellant had satisfied
the criteria specified by those sections; and whether, if he had, it was just
and reasonable to extend
the time.  The requirements of justice and
reasonableness involved, in the way in which the matter was argued before the
Master,
whether there was such prejudice occasioned to the respondents that it
would not be possible for them to obtain a fair trial, and
whether, in any
event, the matters pleaded disclosed a "viable" cause of action.  The Master
was not satisfied that the appellant
had satisfied the criteria.   However, she
stated that if he had, she would have been satisfied that the second and third
tests,
or perhaps more accurately the "just and reasonable" test had been met.
It was her first finding, which led to the orders she made.
 It was accepted
that the Master's decision involved, in large part, the exercise of
discretion.
<P>

<b>The Relevant Provisions Of The Act</b>
<P>

16   	The Master was asked to consider the matter in the light
of s.58(2) and ss.60G and 60I.
<P>

17   	Section 58(2) provides:-
<P>

<b>"Where, on application to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of
action to which this section applies, it appears to the
court that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	any of the material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause
of action was not within the means of knowledge of the
applicant until a date
after the commencement of the year preceding the expiration of the limitation
period for the cause of action;
and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	there is evidence to establish the cause of action, apart from any
defence founded on the expiration of a limitation period, </b>
<P>

<b>the court may order that the limitation period for the cause of action be
extended so that it expires at the end of one year after
that date and
thereupon, for the purposes of an action on that cause of action brought by the
applicant in that court, and for the
purposes of paragraph (b) of sub-section
(1) of section 26, the limitation period is extended accordingly."</b>
<P>

18   	Section 58(2) applies, relevantly, to a cause of action
founded on negligence or breach of duty for damages for personal injury.
"Breach of duty" is defined by the Act as extending to the breach of any duty
whether arising by statute or otherwise.   "Personal
injury" is defined as
including:-
<P>

<b>"Any disease and any impairment of the physical or mental condition of a
person."</b>
<P>

19   	Section 60G, relevantly,  provides:-
<P>

<b>"(1)	This section applies to a cause of action that accrues on or after 1
September 1990, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach
of duty, for damages
for personal injury ..</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	If an application for an order under this section is made to a court
by a person claiming to have a cause of action to which
this section applies,
the court, after hearing such of the persons likely to be affected by the
application as it sees fit, may,
if it decides that it is just and reasonable
to do so, order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended
for such
period as it determines."</b>
<P>

20   	Section 60I provides that a Court shall not make an order
under that section, unless it is satisfied that:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered; or</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission</b>
<P>

<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted; and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made, within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

<b>The Personal Injury Alleged</b>
<P>

21   	The "personal injury", which the appellant alleges,
includes psychiatric illness and a predisposition to violence.  In his
report
of 8 April 1997 a psychiatrist, Dr Robert Gertler, after setting out the
history, the  complaints and his impressions, concluded:-
<P>

<b>"There is no doubt, in my opinion, that Mr Johnson's experience as a foster
child during his crucial formative years led to subsequent
criminal activity.
The nexus was a direct one in the sense that he was exposed to violence and
became violent in turn.  It was indirect
in the sense that he was rejected by
his family of origin and left totally unprepared to cope with an adult world
with no role models
to rely upon and no secure structure.  His anti-social
behaviour was designed to provide a legal structure as a substitute."</b>
<P>

22   	In a further report of 22 April 1997, Dr Gertler
stated:-
<P>

<b>"Further to my report of 8 April 1997 concerning Mr Johnson, he is, in my
opinion, suffering from chronic depression.  This depression
may be experienced
as such or the anger which is associated with it and has contributed to it, can
at times, be externalised.  At
those times Mr Johnson has in the past acted out
either through becoming violent or consuming alcohol to excess or both.  His
anti-social
behaviour is, in my opinion, reactive to the circumstances of his
childhood and adolescent upbringing and also attempts on his part
to deal with
underlying chronic feelings of depression and loss.</b>
<P>

<b>From a psychiatric point of view, his diagnosis is of a chronic depression,
fluctuating in intensity."</b>
<P>

23   	Thus the case the appellant seeks to bring is that in
consequence of his mistreatment whilst a ward of the State, including
being in
foster care, and by reason of the sexual assaults upon him, he suffers from a
psychiatric illness, which is causally related
to that mistreatment.  His case
is that he did not become aware of the existence of this illness, the extent or
nature of it, or
its connection with the respondents' conduct until he received
and perused the respondents' file in 1997 and read Dr Gertler's reports
of
April 1997.  His case is not that in consequence of the physical mistreatment,
he suffered a bodily injury of which he would have
been aware at the time.
<P>

24   	In any consideration of s.58(2) one critical consideration
is that it appears to the Court that any of the material facts
of a decisive
character, relating to the cause of action, was not within the means of
knowledge of the appellant until a date after
the commencement of the
expiration of the limitation period.
<P>

25   	So far as s.60I is concerned the appellant has to satisfy
the Court that he did not know that the relevant personal injury
had been
suffered; or that he was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury
suffered; or that he was unaware of the connection
between the personal injury
and the defendant's act or omission, at the expiration of the relevant
limitation period.  It is sufficient
that he was unaware of any one of these
matters.
<P>

26   	The point where the appellant failed before the Master was
that she was not satisfied, pursuant to s.58(2), that any of the
material facts
of a decisive character was not within his means of knowledge until a date
after the commencement of the limitation
period, and, in respect of s.60I, that
she was not satisfied that he did not know that personal injury had been
suffered; was unaware
of the nature or extent of it; or was unaware of the
connection between it and the defendant's act or omission.
<P>

27   	The appellant's essential point is that the Master erred
in coming to these conclusions because she did not have regard to
critical and
uncontradicted evidence, which established, not that the appellant was unaware
that he was being mistreated and abused
in the manner alleged, when that was
happening, but that he was unaware until about April 1997 that that conduct
caused the psychiatric
illness; the nature and extent thereof; and its
connection with the respondents' conduct.
<P>

28   	The appellant's evidence was that he sought access to his
departmental file.  In paragraph 25 of his affidavit of 23 July
1998 he refers
to this, and to a threat he made to the Department that he would take legal
action if it continued to delay sending
him the file.  He deposed to an
understanding that it was not until January 1997 that the Department provided
his files to the Western
Aboriginal Legal Service and, in paragraph 26, he
stated that he believed that Service obtained the files in early 1997, and that
they contained a social work report by Maggie Hall dated 29 January 1991, and a
psychiatric report by Dr Lewin dated 30 April 1990.
 He annexed copies of those
reports.  The appellant deposed that he did not see those reports until some
time after January 1997.
 Thereafter he saw Dr Gertler.
<P>

29   	That affidavit was read before the Master.  The only
objection recorded on the transcript was to Annexure "C", which the transcript
states the Master "allowed".  I assume that means that she allowed the evidence
rather than the objection, although it does not really
matter.  Several
affidavits sworn by the appellant's solicitor, Mr Panagoda, on 23 July 1998 and
17 March 1999, were read without
objection and Mr Panagoda was not required for
cross-examination.
<P>

30   	In his later affidavit he deposed:-
<P>

<b>"7.	I am also instructed that it was not until 1997, <u>after the files from
the Department and the reports of Dr Robert Gertler became available</u>, that
the Plaintiff was aware:-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	that injury of the kind described in Dr Gertler's report had been
suffered by him;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	of the nature and extent of those injuries;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	of the connection between those injuries and the Defendant's conduct."
(My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

It is clear from paragraph 6 that those instructions were received from the
appellant.
<P>

31   	That evidence, if accepted, established each of the
matters about which the appellant was required to satisfy the Court pursuant
to
s.60I.  It seems to me that it also established material facts of a decisive
character relating to the causes of action, which
was not within the means of
knowledge of the appellant until after the expiration of the limitation period,
as required by s.58(2)(a).
<P>

32   	In the absence of any objection to paragraph 7 or of any
cross-examination of Mr Panagoda or the appellant to establish that
that
evidence was inaccurate, there was, in my opinion, evidence before the Master
of matters to satisfy both sections.  The appellant's
complaint, as I have
noted, is that the Master did not refer to this evidence, nor give effect to it
and that if she had she would
have, or should have, granted his application.
<P>

33   	The appellant was cross-examined at length by Mr McCarthy,
and I invited him to refer me to any cross-examination challenging
the
appellant's assertion, as communicated by Mr Panagoda, of the state of his
awareness of the matters to which Mr Panagoda deposed
in paragraph 7.
<P>

34   	Mr McCarthy referred me to various portions of the
transcript of the appellant's cross-examination at Tp.12 lines 35-55; Tp.13
lines 40-55; Tp.15 lines 35-55; Tp.16 lines 45-55; Tp.17 lines 1-15; Tp.19 line
55; Tp.22G line 5; Tp.24 lines 40-45; Tp.28 line
50 to Tp.29; Tpp.32-33; and
Tp.34.  He also referred to Tp.35.
<P>

35   	At Tp.12 the appellant agreed he told Dr Gertler that he
had been subjected to repeated physical abuse from his foster mother.
 At Tp.13
he said that he did not tell various people about being physically beaten and
flogged.  At Tp.15 he was cross-examined
about allegedly joking at his foster
mother's funeral.  At Tp.16 he confirmed that he described to Dr Gertler
violence from his foster
mother.  At Tp.17 he seemed to agree that that
violence was in relation to her disciplining him.  At Tp.19 he was again asked
about
laughing at his foster mother's wake and describing to Dr Gertler that
she was repeatedly violent to him.  At Tp.22G he agreed that
he told Ms Hall
that he had been sexually assaulted by a visitor to the boys' home and because
he felt shame and disgust it caused
him to drink heavily.  At Tp.24 he
confirmed this evidence.  At Tpp.28 -29 he was asked about seeing Dr Lewin in
1990 "or thereabouts"
and telling him that he believed that he was rejected by
his biological parents when he was aged one year.  At Tpp.32-33 he described
inflicting violence on others and, at Tp.34, he continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Are you telling us that by the time that you were on the streets after
your wardship before you went to gaol, at that time you
regarded the way that
you were treated in chastisement by the Salmons as being physical abuse and
violence of you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Well, it is, isn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>Q. No, is that what you thought at that time?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>Q. When did you come to regard what you saw as the chastisement you received
from them as being not chastisements but physical violence?
You've obviously
thought about this, haven't you?</b>
<P>

<b>A. From an early stage because when I was at Revesby South, that was after
St Luke's, that that's when I started fighting is that
what you wanted to hear,
I'm saying.  That I first realised it, yeah, well, primary school.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. It wasn't a realisation about the Salmons that you communicated to anyone
while you were with the Salmons, was it?</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER: I'm sorry, I can't follow that.</b>
<P>

<b>McCARTHY: He's talking about what they were doing was physical violence
towards him as he says.  I'm just saying to him he didn't
communicate that to
anyone.</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER: He's saying that he was involved in physical violence and that he
was involved in smashing kid's heads in in fifth class.
 But I don't know that
that necessarily relates to the question that you are asking.</b>
<P>

<b>McCARTHY: I think it's totally unresponsive, that's why I'm trying to get
him back.</b>
<P>

<b>TOBIN: It may be responsive.</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER: It may be, but it's not clear to me.</b>
<P>

<b>A. He's saying to me when did I first realise it.  </b>
<P>

<b>Q. You have to tell us, you have got to express it so that we can understand
it.  You're saying, as I understand, in primary school
you started becoming
violent?</b>
<P>

<b>A. Yeah.</b>
<P>

<b>Q. But the question that Mr McCarthy is asking you, I think, is when did you
realise, or when did you think what the Salmons were
doing to you wasn't just
normal chastisement but violence?</b>
<P>

<b>A. When did I realise it?</b>
<P>

<b>Q. Yes?</b>
<P>

<b>A. After I read Gertler's report that it was coming back to then."</b>
<P>

At that point the cross-examination ceased.
<P>

36   	This evidence established that the appellant was aware
that the foster parents were being violent to him. However, it is not,
in my
opinion, that awareness, which grounds the Statement of Claim.  It may be very
different if the appellant was seeking to sue
for physical injuries sustained
as a result of that violence.  But he is not. <i> </i>I have set out his
allegations, which were made clear in Mr Panagoda's affidavit.  The appellant
was never challenged to establish
that he became aware of the psychiatric
illness at any time prior to 1997, or that prior to then he was aware of its
connection with
the respondents' conduct.  Save for the evidence to which I
have referred, which in my view did not meet this point, Mr McCarthy
referred
to none other.  Rather the failure of the Master to have regard to this
evidence was very much at the forefront of the appellant's
written submissions,
but barely mentioned in those of the respondents.  Therefore, the evidence of
Mr Panagoda, based on the instructions
he had received from the appellant,
remained unchallenged, either by cross-examination of him or any relevant
cross-examination of
the appellant.  It is the existence of this unchallenged
evidence, which founds the appellant's attack on the Master's decision.
<P>

37   	The other evidence before the Master, which was not really
challenged and which is of significance, was that a neighbour of
the foster
parents complained to the respondents that the appellant was being subjected to
physical abuse and racial discrimination
by the foster parents.
<P>

<b>The Master's Reasons</b>
<P>

38   	The Master provided comprehensive reasons.  She traced the
appellant's history with care and, commencing at paragraph 6, noted
that he
relied on the sections of the Act to which I have referred in relation to
negligence and breach of statutory duties, and
that the parties agreed that was
the applicable law.  The Master noted relevant authorities in relation to the
extension of time
and quoted s.58(2).  She referred to some dispute as to
whether the time limitation ran out when the appellant attained 18 or 20
years.
<P>

39   	In considering s.58(2) she observed that the appellant
must identify one or more material facts of a decisive character relating
to
the cause of action and prove, by evidence, that such fact or facts were
unknown to him and not within his means of knowledge
as at 2 August 1992.  She
observed that a material fact relating to a cause of action included the nature
and extent of the personal
injury so caused: s.57B(1)(b)(iv).  Sub-section (v)
states as a material fact "the extent to which the personal injury is caused
by
the negligence, nuisance or breach of duty".
<P>

40   	The Master then turned to whether material facts were
decisive, and referred to s.57B(c), which provides:- 
<P>

<b>"material facts relating to a cause of action are of a decisive character
if, but only if, a reasonable man, knowing those facts and
having taken the
appropriate advice on those facts, would regard those facts as showing:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	that an action on the cause of action would (apart from the effect of
the expiration of a limitation period) have a reasonable
prospect of success
and of resulting in an award of damages sufficient to justify the bringing of
an action on the cause of action;
and</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	that the person whose means of knowledge is in question ought, in his
own interests, and taking his circumstances into account,
to bring an action on
the cause of action."</b>
<P>

41   	In paragraph 15 of her reasons the Master noted the
appellant's submission that it was not until April 1997, when he read
the
contents of Dr Gertler's report, that he became aware that his experiences as a
foster child caused his current psychiatric condition.
 She noted the
respondents' submission that the appellant accessed and perused his files in
mid to late 1996, and that Dr Gertler's
report in 1997 "did not tell him
anything which he had not known or contemplated for at least seven years
previously and did not
cause him to change his attitude or course of
conduct".
<P>

42   	She continued:-
<P>

<b>"According to the defendant, by no later than 1990 and probably some time
before, the plaintiff had formed the view that he had been
physically abused,
sexually assaulted and otherwise mistreated and he attributed his current
problems to this mistreatment and abuse."</b>
<P>

43   	The Master commenced, at paragraph 16, to summarise the
appellant's state of knowledge up to 2 August 1992, when the limitation
period
expired.  She accepted that he did not raise the issue of physical abuse with
his foster mother during her lifetime, nor with
representatives from the
Department; that he perceived the floggings he received as being discipline;
that he now appreciates that
he grew up in an environment of  recurrent
physical abuse and in an atmosphere of insecurity and violence; that by the
late 1980's,
prior to going to gaol, he believed that he was physically abused;
and that at that time he believed that the chastisement by his
foster parents
was physical abuse and violence.
<P>

44   	She referred to his evidence, at Tp.34, and said that she
accepted that in the late 1980's the appellant regarded the chastisement
he
received from his foster parents "as physical abuse and violence".
<P>

45   	In paragraph 18 she noted that from at least 1990 the
appellant had been literate, numerate and able to handle government
forms, and
that on 27 March 1990 he told Dr Lewin that he believed he was rejected by his
biological parents when he was aged one
year; that he did not know why he was
"put away"; and that he believed that his adoptive parents had rejected him.
<P>

46   	In paragraph 19 the Master dealt with the appellant's
being charged with murder and she concluded the paragraph by stating
that she
had reached the conclusion that in 1990 he knew that he had suffered a personal
injury, namely the sexual assault, although
in 1991 he did not know that he may
have had a claim in relation to the treatment he received while he was a ward
of the State.
<P>

47   	In paragraph 20 the Master found that after the limitation
period expired, but prior to 1995, the appellant had been told
by Ms Hall, and
had understood, that something on his Departmental file showed that his foster
father had treated him badly, which
information he relayed to another solicitor
and, thereafter, she referred to his examination by Dr Gertler, and his
assessment of
the appellant.
<P>

48   	In paragraph 23 the Master stated that the appellant had
given evidence, to which I have referred, Tp.35, that it was not
until after he
read Dr Gertler's report that he realised that the treatment inflicted by his
foster parents was not just normal chastisement
but violence.  In the context
of the questions, answers, objections and discussion at Tpp.34 and 35, the
evidence is far from clear
and there was obvious room for misunderstanding.  On
one view the appellant's last answer was corroborative of his case.  On no view
was it contradictory of it.
<P>

49   	There is absolutely no doubt that the appellant
appreciated that he was being physically mistreated and abused.  However,
at
the risk of some repetition, he is not suing in these proceedings for bodily
injuries received in consequence of that conduct,
but for the subsequently
ascertained psychiatric consequences of it.
<P>

50   	In paragraph 24 the Master said:-
<P>

<b>"I have carefully analysed and reflected on the plaintiff's evidence.
Further in cross-examination the plaintiff said that in his
mind it became
physical violence when he inflicted violence on other people (t32.50).  He also
stated that he was not really sure
when he first came to the realisation that
the chastisement by the Salmons was physical abuse and violence (t34.15) but he
did not
think that the realisation came when he was smashing someone's head in
(t34.25).  I have reluctantly come to the view that by the
late 1980's but
prior to 1992 the plaintiff knew that the chastisement by the Salmons
constituted physical abuse and violence.  <u>The plaintiff did not give any
evidence to the effect that he did not know the cause of his depression was the
treatment he received
as a foster child</u>.  <u>Nor does he give any evidence
to the effect that after reading Dr Gertler's report he understood that his
experiences as a foster
child who was exposed to violence caused him to be
violent in turn</u>."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

51   	It seems to me, with the greatest respect to the Master,
that to have come to these conclusions she must have overlooked the
uncontradicted evidence of Mr Panagoda, and the fact that the evidence was not
sought to be put in issue by any cross-examination
of the appellant.  In my
opinion the two findings in the concluding two sentences of paragraph 24 cannot
stand with the evidence
of Mr Panagoda and the absence of any cross-examination
of the appellant, which would enable the Master to conclude that that evidence
should not be accepted because the appellant had given incorrect instructions
to Mr Panagoda.
<P>

52   	Mr McCarthy's principal submission was that the Master did
not accept the evidence of the appellant.  I do not, with respect,
agree.  The
Master seems to have thought that the significant finding was that the
appellant was aware that the chastisement of the
foster parents constituted
physical abuse and violence.  But, as I have pointed out, the basis on which
the appellant sues is that
the consequence of that physical abuse and violence,
at least in part, is alleged to have caused a psychiatric illness of which the
uncontradicted evidence is that the appellant did not know until he saw both
the file and the reports of Dr Gertler in 1997.
<P>

53   	The Master continued, in paragraph 25, that she came to
the conclusion that in 1991 the appellant was aware that he had been
sexually
assaulted; that in 1991 he knew that that sexual assault resulted in feelings
of shame and disgust and caused him to drink
heavily; and that in 1995 or 1996
he sought legal advice.  She said:-
<P>

<b>"The plaintiff has not given evidence as to when he became aware that he had
a cause of action that has a reasonable prospect of success.
 The plaintiff has
not discharged his onus of proof.  The plaintiff has not established on the
balance of probabilities that his
experiences as a foster child caused his
current psychiatric conditions."  (I think the next sentence is in error.) "He
has not established
that he was unaware of a material fact of a decisive
character within the period stipulated in s.58(2).  The plaintiff's application
for an extension of the limitation period pursuant to s.58(2) fails."</b>
<P>

54   	Once again it seems to me that these conclusions could
only have been reached by overlooking paragraph 7 of Mr Panagoda's
affidavit.
Dr Gertler directly relates the appellant's psychiatric condition to his
experiences as a foster child, and the evidence
of Mr Panagoda shows that it
was not until 1997 that the appellant was aware either of the nature and extent
of his injuries or the
connection between them and the respondents' conduct.
Once this evidence is appreciated, I consider that the appellant has satisfied
the tests laid down by s.58(2).
<P>

55   	The Master then turned to consider ss.60G and 60I, in the
course of which she also had regard to Schedule 5.  In paragraph
31 she stated
that to gain access to the beneficial provisions of s.60G the appellant must
show that as at 2 August 1992 he was unaware
of one or more of the matters
identified in s.60I(1)(a); and that he did not become aware of that or those,
or ought to have become
of all three matters, earlier than 24 July 1994.  She
said that the practical effect of those provisions was to require the appellant
to identify specifically what fact or facts "he claims not to have known as at
2 August 1992, which lack of knowledge meets the description
in one or more of"
the sub-sections; and to show, by evidence, the date on which he acquired
knowledge thereof, being a date later
than 24 July 1994.  She also noted that
the respondents did not submit that the appellant ought to have become aware of
the matters
in sub-ss. 60I(1)(a)(i) to (iii) "at an earlier date", i.e. than 24
July 1994: paragraph 32.
<P>

56   	She repeated that the appellant had submitted that it was
not until April 1997, when he learnt of the contents of Dr Gertler's
report,
that he became aware that his experiences as a foster child caused his current
psychiatric condition, and:-
<P>

<b>"As with s.58(2) the defendant made the same submission that by 1990 at the
latest the plaintiff had formed the view that he had been
physically abused,
sexually assaulted and otherwise mistreated and he attributed his current
problems to this mistreatment and abuse."</b>
<P>

57   	The Master repeated that, for the reasons given in
relation to s.58(2), in 1991 the appellant knew that he had been sexually
assaulted with the consequences to which that led, and that by the late 1980's
and prior to going to gaol he knew he had suffered
a personal injury.  She said
that by 1992 the appellant also knew that the chastisement by the foster
parents was physical abuse
and violence and:-
<P>

<b>"He does not give any evidence as to when he knew that he suffered a
psychiatric injury namely depression.  The plaintiff's knowledge
that he
suffered a personal injury was acquired prior to 24 July 1994.  Accordingly the
plaintiff's claim under s.60I(1)(a)(i) fails."</b>
<P>

58   	Once again, in my opinion, this reasoning overlooks the
fact that  evidence was given in his case when he knew he had suffered
a
psychiatric illness, namely in 1997, and it is necessary in this case to link
the physical abuse to the psychiatric illness.  It
also seems to overlook the
respondents' concession, which I have recorded in paragraph 55.
<P>

59   	The Master nextly considered sub-s.(ii).  She concluded
that s.60I(1)(b) imposes an objective test as to when the appellant
became
aware of all three matters, and she held:-
<P>

<b>"The plaintiff may be held to have become aware of the nature or extent of
his injury within the relevant period if during that period
he was aware of the
effect which the injury was then having upon him and of its likely future
course, even though he may have been
unaware of the precise pathology or
medical diagnosis.  On the other hand, knowledge of the medical diagnosis will
not itself amount
to knowledge of the nature and extent of the injury if the
plaintiff is unaware of significant aspects of the prognosis, for example
that
the injury is permanent and will not be amenable to treatment; or that it may
deteriorate with the passage of time.  As long
as the consequences are of a
kind that the plaintiff expects, the plaintiff will be aware of the extent of
the injury."</b>
<P>

There was no evidence that the appellant expected that the physical injuries
would lead to a psychiatric condition.  
<P>

60   	The Master, however, returned to her earlier findings of
the difficulties the appellant had experienced and, in paragraph
39, she
said:-
<P>

<b>"Also as previously stated the plaintiff did not give any evidence to
establish that he did not know that the cause of him suffering
depression was
the treatment he received as a foster child."</b>
<P>

I have stated my reasons for respectfully disagreeing with this on several
occasions.
<P>

61   	She continued:-
<P>

<b>"Nor does he give evidence that after reading Dr Gertler's report he
understood that his experiences as a foster child when being
exposed to
violence caused him to be violent in turn",</b>
<P>

which, if I may say so with respect, once again overlooks paragraph 7(c) of Mr
Panagoda's affidavit.
<P>

62   	The Master said that the appellant did not give evidence
to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that, after reading
Dr Gertler's
reports in 1997, his experiences as a foster child caused his current
psychiatric condition.
<P>

63   	I am a little puzzled by this observation.  Sub-s.(ii),
with which the Master was dealing, is concerned with the appellant's
unawareness of the nature or extent of the personal injury suffered.  He was
not qualified to give any evidence, even after reading
Dr Gertler's report in
1997, that his experiences as a foster child caused his current psychiatric
condition.  He proved, at least
at the level required on this application, that
that was so through the evidence of Dr Gertler.  What the appellant was
required
to prove, relevantly for present purposes, was his lack of awareness
and, for the reasons I have given, I am satisfied he did.  In
my opinion the
Master's finding of not being satisfied that the appellant was unaware of the
nature or extent of his injury, within
the time period stipulated in
sub-s.(ii), is contrary to the undisputed evidence.
<P>

64   	The Master nextly considered sub-s.(iii), which she said
was "concerned with ignorance of the existence of facts and omissions
rather
than legal conclusions".  If I may say so, with great respect, I do not think
this is correct.  The words in sub-s.(iii) are
related to an unawareness "of
the connection" between injury and acts or omissions, i.e. those words raise a
question of causation.
<P>

65   	The Master stated, in paragraph 41:-
<P>

<b>"Once again, for the reasons given earlier the plaintiff did not give
evidence to establish that after reading Dr Gertler's report
in 1997 he became
aware that his experiences as a foster child caused his current psychiatric
condition."</b>
<P>

I have already stated my reasons for respectfully disagreeing with this
assessment.
<P>

66   	In paragraph 42 the Master stated:-
<P>

<b>"Nowhere in his affidavit nor in his evidence does the plaintiff disclose
what he understood were the acts or omissions upon which
he relies to found his
cause of action.  Nor does he disclose when he became aware of those acts and
omissions."</b>
<P>

In my respectful opinion, this analysis cannot be accepted.  The matters about
which the appellant was able to give evidence were
the physical mistreatment
and abuse to which he was subjected.  There was an abundance of evidence from
the appellant about that.
 Indeed, Mr McCarthy obtained the evidence in great
detail in the passages to which I have referred.  The critical question, having
regard to the way in which the claim was formulated, was whether those alleged
acts and omissions gave rise to personal injury in
the nature of a psychiatric
illness and, as to that, the evidence of Dr Gertler is that they did.  Finally,
the uncontradicted evidence
is that whilst he was not aware that the alleged
acts or omissions, of which he was clearly aware, gave rise to a psychiatric
illness
until 1997, he became aware of that fact in 1997 and of the connection
between that personal injury and the respondents' conduct.
 In these
circumstances, however, the Master found that the claim under sub-s.(iii)
failed.
<P>

67   	In considering the Master's reasons I have dealt,
essentially, with the submissions on behalf of the appellant.
<P>

<b>The Submissions On Behalf Of The Respondents</b>
<P>

68   	In their written submissions the respondents submitted
that the findings of the Master were open to her on the evidence. 
There was a
detailed reference to portions of the evidence, which dealt with various
peripheral matters, and, in paragraph 6, the
following submissions were
put:-
<P>

<b>"6.1	By no later than 1990 and probably some time earlier, the Appellant had
formed the view that he had been physically abused, sexually
assaulted and
otherwise mistreated.  He felt that his then current problems were caused by
this mistreatment and abuse.</b>
<P>

<b>  6.2	By 1990 he had discussed these feelings with Ms Hall and Dr Lewin.  Ms
Hall had reviewed Departmental files including records
of the Balford complaint
and had advised the plaintiff about taking some sort of action.  The Appellant
may not have been in a good
position to follow this up in 1990-1991 but from
early 1992 the appellant was out of gaol and hence in a position to follow this
up.  By late 1992 the Appellant was studying successfully and thereafter
completed a number of courses of study.</b>
<P>

<b>  6.3	At any time from late 1992 (at the latest) the Appellant was in a
position to commence proceedings.  He had the wherewithal
to, and did in fact,
raise these matters further with Mr Healey in 1994, Mr Sheldon in 1995 and Ms
Hall at some time reviewing her
notes of the files.  He accessed and perused
his Departmental files in mid to late 1996.  </b>
<P>

<b>  6.4	The report of Dr Gertler in 1997 did not inform the Appellant of
anything which he had not known or contemplated for at least
seven years
previously and did not cause him to change his attitude or course of conduct.
Between 1992 and 1997 neither the Appellant
nor those he consulted commenced
proceedings."</b>
<P>

69   	These submissions continue the same error which, if I may
say so with respect, infect this part of the Master's reasons. 
It is quite
wrong to submit, in the light of Mr Panagoda's unchallenged evidence, that Dr
Gertler's reports of 1997 did not inform
the appellant of anything, which he
had not known or contemplated for at least seven years previously.  It told
him, firstly, that
he had a psychiatric illness; secondly, of the nature and
extent of that injury; and thirdly, of the connection between that injury
and
the respondents' conduct.
<P>

70   	The respondents' submissions make no reference to Mr
Panagoda's affidavit, nor did Mr McCarthy make any submissions as to
how, in
the light of all the evidence, it should be treated.  The reason, I have no
doubt, is that in the absence of any objection
to it and of any
cross-examination of the appellant to subvert the information he was said to
have given to Mr Panagoda, the evidence
stood as a complete answer to the
requirements of the relevant sections of the Act.
<P>

71   	In my opinion, the Master was in error in concluding that
the appellant had not established the grounds required by ss.58,
60G and 60I
and the appeal on this ground must be allowed.
<P>

<b>Just And Reasonable</b>
<P>

72   	The Master dealt with the respondents' submission that the
appellant did not have a cause of action.  She was of the view
that he bore an
evidentiary and persuasive onus which, in the absence of concession, required
material to be adduced, which demonstrated
"that the dilatory plaintiff has a
real case to advance".  She dealt with a number of evidentiary matters relating
to the policies
which applied and, at paragraph 59, stated the question to be
decided at trial as being whether the respondents' conduct "accords
to the
standard of reasonable care demanded by the law", which she considered should
be decided in the light of the observations
of Barwick CJ in <b>Maloney v
Commissioner of Railways </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2018%20ALR%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 18 ALR 147</a> at 148.
<P>

73   	The Master dealt with the various ways in which the case
was propounded by reference to negligence, breach of statutory duty
and
fiduciary duties and, after a consideration of various authorities and the
evidence, she concluded, paragraph 66, by stating:-
<P>

<b>"It is my view that there is evidence to demonstrate that the plaintiff has
a real case to advance."</b>
<P>

For reasons I shall give, I consider this was a correct finding.
<P>

74   	The Master turned to consider whether time should, in
effect, be extended in the context of the ability for there to be a
fair trial.
She referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal, to which I shall have to
return, in <b>Williams v Minister, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a> &amp;
Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 497</a>, ("<b>Williams (No 1)</b>") and <b>Brisbane South
Regional Health Authority v Taylor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541.</a>  She set out
passages from the judgments of various Justices, including that in the judgment
of Toohey and Gummow JJ at p.548, where
their Honours said:-
<P>

<b>"A material consideration (the most important consideration in many cases)
is whether, by reason of the time that has elapsed, a fair
trial is possible.
Whether prejudice to the prospective defendant is likely to thwart a fair trial
is to be answered by reference
to the situation at the time of the
application."</b>
<P>

The Master noted that there was no evidence that witnesses, other than the
foster mother, who has died, were not available, and
she said that whilst the
foster mother could not give her version of events, the foster father and his
children could; that the foster
mother was mainly involved in the chastisement
of the appellant, but the foster father also played a role; and that while the
foster
father may not have been at home all of the time the children were and
their evidence, together with his, "can fill in the gaps".
 She concluded that
she was not satisfied that the respondents suffered significant prejudice or
would be unable to obtain a fair
trial.
<P>

75   	In paragraph 83 she said:-
<P>

<b>"For the reasons given earlier, the plaintiff has not passed through the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.58(2)</a> or s.60I gateways and his action fails.  However, if I am wrong and the
plaintiff has passed through a gateway then I would have
considered that the
plaintiff had discharged his onus and I would have been satisfied that it was
just and reasonable to extend time."</b>
<P>

76   	It was agreed that the Master's decision was an
interlocutory one and depended on the way in which she exercised her
discretion.
 It was submitted by Mr McCarthy that she had failed to exercise
her discretion properly in that she had found that the appellant
had a real
case to advance, and in that she had not properly taken into account the
unavailability of the foster mother. 
<P>

77   	I find it convenient to deal with the second point first.
On the second day of the hearing Mr McCarthy said to the Master:-
<P>

<b>"The position of the defendants is that save for the usual prejudice
associated with delay, the defendants do not propose to contend
that they
suffer any significant prejudice in respect of availability of Departmental
staff or records.  I discussed that matter
with Mr Tobin before we came over to
Court this morning.  I am not sure if he would wish to speak to Mr Wells as a
result of what
is now the position of the defendants in this matter."</b>
<P>

78   	Mr McCarthy did not reserve the right to make a submission
that because of the absence of the foster mother prejudice would
be suffered
and, it seems to me, that such a statement, without any such qualification,
could well lead the Master to believe that
no point was being taken in relation
to her absence.
<P>

79   	However that may be, as I have said, the matter was a
discretionary one for the Master, who took into account the effect of
the
foster mother's death, and, in all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that
there has been shown to be any error by her in
the exercise of her
discretion.
<P>

<b>Does The Appellant Have A Case?</b>
<P>

80   	The respondents' principal submissions were that the
appellant had not established that he was able, at law, to pursue any
of the
causes of action pleaded.  The respondents sought to raise these points by way
of a Notice of Contention.  The submissions
were, as I understood them, that
the facts of this case were so closely aligned to those in <b>Williams v
Minister, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/843.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] NSWSC 843</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2025%20FamLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 25 FamLR 86</a>, (that being
the decision on the facts in <b>Williams (No 1)</b> and to which I shall refer
as <b>Williams (No 2)</b>), in which, on the facts, Abadee J held that there
was no duty at common law, no duty pursuant to any relevant statute and no
fiduciary
duty, that I should, as a matter of comity, follow that decision and
hold that there were no such duties owed by the respondents
to the appellant.
As Mr Tobin submitted, I was being asked to determine this case on the former
demurrer proceeding.  In the light
of the respondents' submission, it is
important to decide what test must be met, in a case such as the present, to
decide whether
it is just and reasonable to allow proceedings to go forward.
<P>

81   	Mr McCarthy submitted that before the Master his clients
suffered from the problem that the decision of Abadee J had not been
given and,
therefore, the law had not been clarified.  It seems to me, if I may say so
with respect, that that problem is still being
experienced because I was
informed that <b>Williams (No 2)</b> is the subject of an appeal to the Court
of Appeal and, whilst I have not seen the Notice of Appeal, Mr McCarthy
conceded that it
was unthinkable that the appeal would not involve a challenge
to his Honour's conclusions that, in the circumstances of that case,
there was
no duty of care at common law or under statute and no fiduciary duty.  It may
not be necessary for the Court of Appeal
to  determine those points in that
case, because the view may be taken that the findings of fact are such that
even if all or any
of those duties existed, Ms Williams cannot establish that
there was a breach of them.  In saying that I am not to be taken in any
way as
presuming to suggest how the appeal will be run nor, more particularly, how it
will be dealt with by the Court of Appeal.
 I am simply observing that the
determination of an appeal does not, of necessity, involve a determination of
all issues, which may
be raised on its hearing, even if the grounds are taken,
and that the appeal in <b>Williams (No 2)</b>, assuming it goes ahead, will not
necessarily determine the legal issues to which I have referred.
<P>

82   	I am also concerned about determining these difficult
legal questions at this stage in the absence of factual findings on
the
evidence adduced on the hearing of this case.  It has been made clear in many
cases that decisions on difficult and developing
questions of law should await
findings of fact. 
<P>

83   	Against this background I shall consider the type of case,
which an applicant must make out to obtain an extension of time.
 This was
considered by the Court of Appeal in <b>Williams (No 1)</b>.  Studdert J, at
first instance, refused the application under the Act to extend the time.  The
Court of Appeal, by majority, Kirby
P and Priestley JA, Powell JA dissenting,
allowed the appeal.
<P>

84   	At p.508 Kirby P considered a submission that Studdert J
had overstated the extent to which Ms Williams had to establish a
cause of
action to secure the extension sought.  His Honour had referred to a
"requirement" for her to establish an available cause
of action, and that "it
must now appear that the evidence to establish her cause of action exists".
Kirby P observed that it was
submitted that this involved a mis-statement of
law, which vitiated the order under appeal.  His Honour continued:-
<P>

<b>"To the extent that it was submitted that the need to establish a viable
cause of action was irrelevant to the discretion invoked
(for example,  by
reason of the terms of s.60G by contrast to the former provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.58(2)(b)</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</i> 1969</a>), I would reject this assertion.  It is
contrary to the authority of this Court: see <i>James Hardie &amp; Co Pty
Limited v Wootton</i>.  By the same token, it is obviously unnecessary for a
claimant to establish a case in the detail that would be required at the trial.
The reason for this was sufficiently explained by Hunt J in analogous
circumstances in <i>Martin v Abbott Australasia Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 NSWLR
430</a> at 437.  <u>The alteration of the legislation has not removed the need to
demonstrate, in an appropriately preliminary way, the apparent viability
of the
action and, thus, the utility of providing the extension of time sought</u>.
To permit an obviously hopeless case to proceed would be to condone the
harassment of a defendant otherwise protected by a time
bar.  That could not be
a proper exercise of the judicial discretion afforded by parliament.  It would
condone the unreasonable and
be far from just: cf <i>Briggs v James Hardie
&amp; Co Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 549</a> at 564.  <u>I see nothing in the
remarks of Studdert J which indicate that his Honour was imposing an
excessively onerous test or approaching
the criterion in other than the correct
preliminary (and necessarily tentative) way</u>.  <u>Only if there is evidence
which, in the preliminary hearing initiated by the motion for extension, shows
that it is just and reasonable
to allow the action to be brought, will the
order of extension be granted</u>.  I do not consider that Studdert J asked
himself the wrong question.  Nor do I believe that it was unreasonable to take
closely
into account the concern which ultimately decided the matter for his
Honour, namely the prejudicial effect upon the respondents of
the lapse of time
which Ms Williams sought to cure by the extension claimed."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

85   	Priestley JA, at pp.515-516, after stating that he broadly
agreed with the reasons of Kirby P, continued:-
<P>

<b>"Some of the issues Mrs Williams seeks to raise in her proceedings are, in
my opinion, important.  The respondents contend these issues
cannot or should
not now be explored in the Courts.  Whether either form of that contention
should be accepted is itself an important
question.  </b>
<P>

<b>To enable a properly satisfactory and fully explored answer to be given to
that question and the preliminary ones Mrs Williams wishes
to raise, it seems
to me desirable that Mrs Williams have the opportunity of putting all relevant
evidence before the Court at a
trial, rather than that the matters of
significance which this case raises should be dealt with on the incomplete
state of the evidence
at present before the Court.</b>
<P>

<b>These considerations have influenced my general agreement with the approach
of Kirby P.  That approach involves conclusions, favourable
to Mrs Williams,
about the arguability of a number of issues.  I have reached some of these
conclusions only with hesitation and
I recognise they may be vulnerable to a
strict approach.  However, this case seems to me pre-eminently to be of the
kind where a
broad approach should be taken to questions of arguability of
legal propositions which may be novel but which require careful consideration
in the light of changing social circumstances."</b>
<P>

86   	There was no suggestion in either judgment that the
"strike out" test should be applied, but rather, as the President said,
that it
should be established that a cause of action existed in the sense of an
apparently viable cause of action, such that there
is utility in providing the
extension of time sought.
<P>

87   	The question of the type of case to be established was
considered by the Court of Appeal in <b>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 389.</a>  At p.395, Handley and Beazley JJA said:-
<P>

<b>"The Judge carefully reviewed all the relevant authorities, and we entirely
agree with his analysis.  In particular we agree that

proposition that those matters must
be proved as facts on an application for an

Court to be satisfied that the applicant was not aware of the matters referred
to, but does not require proof of those
matters as facts</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>If an applicant had to satisfy the Court of the existence of ingredients of
his or her cause of action, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.60I</a> would not only impose requirements which were

<P>

<b>We also endorse the Judge's interlocutory ruling disallowing
cross-examination of the applicant's expert.  <u>An application for extension
is not a trial, or a dress rehearsal for the trial.  The Court is concerned
with whether there are serious
questions to be tried, and once this threshold
is established on the relevant issues, cross-examination or further
cross-examination
on those issues can serve no useful purpose</u>.  We
respectfully adopt the Judge's reasons on these matters.  These grounds of
appeal have not been established."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

88   	In the present case it was not in issue that the appellant
was made a ward of the State and came under the authority of the
respondents;
and that the respondents, pursuant to the authority vested in them, placed him
in foster care with people of their choosing.
 There was evidence that the
appellant suffered severe chastisement and floggings at the hands of his foster
parents, and at least
one sexual assault subsequently. There was also evidence
of a neighbour's complaint to the respondents that the appellant was being
mistreated and subjected to racial discrimination at the hands of the foster
parents. That provided a substantial factual starting
point for the cause of
action.  The evidence of Dr Gertler established, sufficiently for present
purposes, that being subjected to
that conduct led to the appellant's suffering
a psychiatric illness which, if established, would be appropriately
compensable.  Mr
McCarthy did submit that it would be very difficult to prove
damages.  At the level at which I am presently considering the case,
I do not
see why, if tortious conduct causes a person to develop a psychiatric illness,
that person, at least prima facie, is not
entitled to recover damages in
consequence thereof.
<P>

89   	In these circumstances I am satisfied that the appellant
has established the type of case to which Kirby P and Handley and
Beazley JJA
were referring.  The question which then arises, having regard to my earlier
conclusions, is why he should not be allowed
to pursue it. The answer to that
question, so Mr McCarthy submitted, lies in the decision of Abadee J in
<b>Williams (No 2)</b>.  As I have said his submission was that the facts of
that case were so similar to the facts of the present, that I should merely
apply his Honour's legal conclusions, based on the facts he found, to the
presumed and thus far established facts in the present
case.  I am not prepared
to do that.
<P>

<b>The Notice Of Contention</b>
<P>

90   	In his written submissions Mr McCarthy stated that the
respondents contended that the decision of the Master ought to be affirmed
for
grounds other than those relied upon by her, namely that the appellant's
relationship with the respondents does not give rise
to any obligation at
common law, under statute or in equity.  He dealt firstly with the common law
duty of care and submitted that
the first and second respondents are alleged,
in these proceedings, to have obligations to the appellant "which on analogous
facts
have been rejected in <b>Williams</b>".  The submission continued that as
in that case the relationship of the appellant and the respondents "is most
aptly described as
one of substitute care" arising from the guardian/child
relationship provided for in the <b>Child Welfare Act</b> 1939, pursuant to
which the Minister became the substitute guardian of the appellant "in contrast
to others, who from time to time
had custody/care of the appellant, including
the foster carers".
<P>

91   	The submission continued that the common law of Australia
recognises that the relationship between parent and child is "a
moral duty of
imperfect obligation and not a relationship which creates duties, which if
breached, sound in damages".  Reliance was
placed upon the statement of Barwick
CJ in <b>Hahn v Conley</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20126%20CLR%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 126 CLR 276</a> at pp.283-284 that:-
<P>

<b>".. the moral duties of conscientious parenthood do not as such provide the
child with any cause of action when they are not, or badly,
performed or
neglected ...   There is no general duty of care in that respect imposed by the
law upon a parent because of the blood
relationship."</b>
<P>

92   	In his oral submissions, Mr McCarthy conceded that there
were circumstances in which a parent could be sued for a tortious
act causing
injury to the child.  He instanced the negligent driving of a motor vehicle by
a parent in which the child was a passenger,
and, more appositely for the
present case, an assault by a parent on a child.
<P>

93   	Mr McCarthy's written submissions continued that the same
policy reasoning, as informed the judgment of Barwick CJ in relation
to the
moral obligation for the upbringing of children, "should apply equally to
substitute carers such as foster carers (who are
not professionals trained in
child care or management) and to other substitute carers provided by the
respondents, whether the actual
personnel are professionally trained or
otherwise".  The written submissions continued that the appellant's complaints
related to
"ordinary parental discretion, conduct and decision-making with
respect to the upbringing of the appellant, and can be contrasted
with the
ward's complaints in <b>Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176
CLR 408</a>, where the negligence was causative of Mr Bennett's loss of a right of
action".
<P>

94   	However, the present case is not one, as <b>Williams (No
2)</b> was, where there are no specific complaints about the way in which the
appellant was treated.  In <b>Williams (No 2)</b>, at paragraph 25, Abadee J
stated the nature of Ms Williams' case thus:-
<P>

<b>"As will be seen from the above, the case does not involve what might
perhaps be described as a specific single identifiable act or
omission
occurring at a particular time and constituting, inter alia, negligence.  No
specific incident, happening or event in the
history from 1942 to 1960 is
relied upon as giving rise to the plaintiff's claimed psychiatric or
psychological conditions.  Nor
is there any identifiable single casual act of
negligence alleged.  The conduct (essentially `omission' conduct) relied upon
to constitute
negligence is said to have generally been of an ongoing nature
throughout the period referred to."</b>
<P>

95   	Mr McCarthy accepted that this set forth accurately the
issues with which his Honour was concerned.  It is immediately apparent
that
there is a significant difference from the present case.  The appellant relies
upon specific incidents of physical mistreatment,
racial abuse and sexual
assault in circumstances where, at one stage, a concerned neighbour saw fit to
complain about the way in
which he was being treated by his foster parents in
their home.
<P>

96   	It may be, at the end of the day, that the evidence does
not support the allegations made by the appellant, or that the Court
comes to
the view that the facts established by the evidence fall within the category of
conduct, which does not give rise to a breach
of any duty of care.  But it
seems to me that until the facts are established one cannot characterise the
matters as pleaded, and
thus far established to the requisite degree, as
necessarily, or perhaps at all, giving rise to a situation where there has been
no breach of any common law duty of care.
<P>

97   	Mr McCarthy's submissions dealt, at some length, with
matters of policy that might be affected by any finding of a duty of
care and
which were addressed in <b>Williams (No 2)</b>, including financial
consequences for child-caring bodies and the reduction in the provision of
substitute care services.  The submissions
continued that "manifestly" to
impose duties on substitute carers, which are not imposed on natural carers,
would have a detrimental
effect on the supply of foster carers and the
charities that currently supply them; on the availability of substitute care
and like
services; on the practicability of supervision of foster parents by
the Minister; on the nature of foster care by demanding unrealistic
standards
of care of volunteers, who are fulfilling a community need; and on the foster
carer/child relationship whereby the law
would mandate favouritism for the
foster child, rather than encouraging treatment in a like manner to the other
children of the foster
carer.
<P>

98   	The submission continued that the imposition of such
"legal" duties on substitute carers would be unreasonable, given that
the
natural parents do not have any such "legal duties", and would be
counter-productive "as it would compromise the core value of
fostering, which
is to afford the ward the opportunity to benefit from being part of a
family".
<P>

99   	These policy considerations may well be ones to which
regard will have to be given, but it will be noted that they stem from
the
concept of a "moral" rather than a "legal" relationship.  It was conceded by Mr
McCarthy that a child cannot, in appropriate
circumstances, be precluded from
suing his or her parents.  Accordingly, it seems to me that the foster parent
cannot be placed in
any better position, in that regard, to the natural
parent.
<P>

100   	It may also be argued, and in my respectful opinion there
would be much force in this argument, that as a matter of policy
children, who
are basically unable to protect themselves and, therefore, find themselves
subject to the control of the respondents,
are entitled to expect that they
will not be placed into foster care in circumstances where they are likely to
be mistreated and,
if they are, once again as a matter of policy, that the
person with the ultimate control over the foster caring situation should
be
held to be negligent in failing to act in the child's interests, if it comes to
that person's knowledge that the child is being
mistreated and that person
fails to act.
<P>

101   	It also seems to me that these policy considerations,
which no doubt flow to a large extent from the relevant legislation,
have to be
considered in the light of whether they are, in law, policy matters or
operational matters: <b>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20192%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 192 CLR 330</a> and
<b>Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory</b> (1998) 192 CLR
431.  This area of the law does not, in my respectful opinion, seem to be
finally settled, and certainly it is not
resolved in circumstances where the
facts are not established: <b>Air Services Australia v Zarb</b> (Court of
Appeal - 26 August 1998 - unreported).  In refusing special leave to appeal to
the High Court both Gleeson CJ and Hayne
J referred, in argument, to the need
to establish the facts before considering issues of law.
<P>

102   	Mr McCarthy nextly submitted that in the light of the
facts and circumstances of this case "it is not just and reasonable
to
recognise a `legal' duty of care owed by the respondents to the appellant".
The basis for this submission was that as in <b>Williams (No 2)</b>, the
appellant's complaints about breaches of legal obligation by the first and
second respondents have no appropriate analogy in
existing law.
<P>

103   	Abadee J commenced to consider remedies under the law at
paragraph 95.  He accepted that the Courts cannot provide a solution
for every
social problem, including problems arising from all human relationships
including those of nurture and nature; that there
is a distinction between the
role of the Courts and the legislature; and that in determining the meaning of
"reasonable" in the statement
of the common law duty of care, the Court cannot
require perfection or the use of hindsight.  So much, if I may say so with
respect,
is not in issue.  His Honour continued:-
<P>

<b>"The common law cannot provide a remedy for all life's accidents, <u>which
are the fault of no person</u>."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

He also observed, paragraph 101, that even if there is error, not every error
is to be equated with a negligent error giving rise
to an entitlement to
recover damages.  These propositions are not in doubt, but each day the Courts
determine whether an accident
is the fault of a person and, if it is, whether
that fault constitutes a right in the person injured to recover damages. 
<P>

104   	The circumstances with which his Honour was dealing in
<b>Williams (No 2)</b> are graphically illustrated in the concluding sentence
of paragraph 101:-
<P>

<b>"Even if there was error and I do not find any in the circumstances of this
case, it would not in any event amount to negligent error,
for reasons that
will appear." </b>
<P>

Once again, his Honour was pointing up the need to find the facts.
<P>

105   	His Honour also drew heavily on an analogy between "bad
parenting" or "bad upbringing" by natural parents, and the position
of a
substitute or a non-biological carer to provide maternal care "of the type that
a natural mother could or might be expected
to ordinarily provide ...".
<P>

106   	It seems to me, with respect to the careful submissions
made by Mr McCarthy in this regard, that one cannot generalise to
the extent
which his submissions require me to do and, further, that <b>Williams (No
2)</b> does not provide any support for such generalisation.  Each case will
have to be decided after its particular facts are determined.
 It may well be
that once the facts are determined the legal principles, which Abadee J
applied, will apply to those found facts
and deny a plaintiff, and perhaps the
appellant in this case, the right to recover.  However, one cannot simply
assert that because
there appears to be some commonality of facts in
<b>Williams (No 2)</b> to the present case, that will lead inevitably to the
same conclusion to which his Honour came.
<P>

107   	Mr McCarthy's written submissions continued that the
relationship between the appellant and the respondents should not "in
these
circumstances give rise to a duty of care as alleged".  The reason advanced is
that the reasonable foreseeability test must
be subject to an "intelligible
limit to keep the law of negligence within the bounds of commonsense and
practicality".  Reference
is made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ in <b>Perre v
Apand Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%201190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 1190</a>, to which Abadee J referred in
paragraph 805.  Whilst the full range of <b>Perre</b> will have to be worked
out on a case by case basis, it does not immediately appear to me why, if the
appellant is able to establish
negligent conduct leading to his psychiatric
condition, in the particular circumstances of the case he wishes to bring, the
foreseeability
test would preclude his recovery.  It may or it may not.
Whether it does or not will, once again, depend on the findings of fact.
<P>

108   	Mr McCarthy's submissions then turned to the statutory
relationship under the <b>Child Welfare Act</b>.  He referred to various
sections of the Act and submitted that pursuant to them the Minister is the
statutory guardian throughout
the relevant period.  The submission continued
that the issue was what legal obligations the statute imposed on the guardian
and
what, if any, obligations did the common law then impose upon the Minister,
and that s.23(1)(g) "appears" to provide a discretion
exclusive to the Minister
and unconfined.  The submission was that the appellant would require a
modification of the statutory discretion
to establish the duties alleged.  He
continued that the acts and conduct of the respondents relied on by the
appellants were within
the ambit of the respondents' statutory discretion, and
if exercised erroneously were only errors of judgment within the ambit of
that
discretion and were not negligent.  This, so it seems to me, raises once again
the issue of policy and operational provisions.
 These cannot be resolved
without final factual findings.
<P>

109   	The difficulties inherent in this area of the law were
considered in <b>Zarb</b>. It must be remembered that that was a case involving
an application to strike out originating process as failing to disclose a cause
of action.  Thus the principles in cases such as <b>General Steels</b> were
applicable.  None-the-less, the Court considered the various cases
distinguishing between policy and operational considerations.
 I find it
unnecessary to further encumber these reasons with references to the
authorities on that point.  Suffice to say that in
this area of the law, it
could not be said that there was not an available cause of action based on a
perception of the meaning of
the statute without an examination of the facts.

<P>

110   	I am supported in this view by the decision in <b>Cubillo
v Commonwealth of Australia</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1999/518.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] FCA 518</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20163%20ALR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 163 ALR 395.</a>  The facts in that case
were that the applicants were part Aboriginal persons who claimed that, as
children, they were removed from
their families and thereafter detained in
institutions against their will until the ages of 18 and 16 years respectively.
The Statement
of Claim pleaded four causes of action against the Commonwealth
for wrongful imprisonment, breaches of statutory duty, breaches of
a general
duty of care, and breaches of fiduciary duty.  The Commonwealth sought orders
that the Statement of Claim be struck out
and the action dismissed.
<P>

111   	Under the relevant legislation of the Northern Territory,
the Director of Native Affairs was the legal guardian of every
Aboriginal and
one applicant alleged that her removal and detention was in breach of the duty
owed to her by the Director as her
guardian, including his conduct in
delegating the roles and duties of guardian over her to institutions in which
she was detained
and failing to supervise the institutions properly or at
all.
<P>

112   	O'Loughlin J dismissed the interlocutory application not
being satisfied that there was not a real question to be tried consistently
with the <b>General Steels </b>test.  Once again this was a case involving a
strike out application. The headnote disclosed that his Honour was of the view
that
the various claims made by the Commonwealth as to the inadequacy of the
originating process, which substantially match the claims
made by the
respondents in the present case, could not be determined until the facts had
been found.  He held that it would be premature
to hold that the applicant had
failed to make out a case in various regards, including the obligation to take
care at common law
and under the statute and in relation to fiduciary duty,
until the facts were decided.  
<P>

113   	Mr McCarthy relied upon the first portion of a passage of
his Honour's judgment at p.426, where he said:-
<P>

<b>"This Court has no jurisdiction to review the desirability of policies
underlying acts of the parliament.  It is therefore not open
to the applicants
to ask this Court to review the policies that were enacted in the Ordinances
and embodied in the powers conferred
by the Ordinances.  Those provisions,
being valid laws, bind this Court and bind the applicants.  But, as I have
said, I understand
the applicants to be pursuing a different course; they seek
to establish that there was an indiscriminate policy of removal and detention
which was not authorised by statute.  That particular argument, if successful,
may, of course, take the case out of the realm of
`breach of statutory duty'
altogether, leaving the applicants to rely on their remaining causes of action.
But as to this, counsel
for the Commonwealth acknowledged, during the course of
argument, that the exercise of power under the Aboriginal Ordinance could
miscarry if, for example, it was exercised for a malicious purpose or for an
objective that was foreign to the mandates of the legislation."</b>
<P>

However, in the whole passage his Honour made clear the necessity to look at
the particular facts and, in these circumstances, he
was of the view that it
was premature to decide that point and, at p.427 paragraph 95, noted, with
approval, that Studdert J in <b>TC v New South Wales</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 31:-</a>
<P>

<b>"... accepted the decision of the High Court in <i>Pyrenees Shire Council v
Day</i> as general authority for the way in which a private right of action may
arise from the terms of a statute and the claimant's membership
of a class
which the statute is intended to protect."</b>
<P>

114   	Mr McCarthy relied upon the findings of Abadee J in
relation to statutory duty.  At paragraph 676, his Honour noted the argument
on
behalf of Ms Williams that the primary relevance of the provisions of the
<b>Child Welfare Act</b> 1939 was that they imposed duties on the Board and
concomitant powers to perform the duties, and that the statutory duties were
exercised
by the Board to create a relationship with the plaintiff, which
attracted common law duties of care and fiduciary duties.  His Honour
said that
no authority was quoted in support of the submission, although he referred to
that portion of the judgment of Kirby J in
<b>Romeo</b> at p.472.  He continued
that he was left with the impression that Ms Williams' argument advanced in
support of the reliance upon
the statutory duty was not regarded by Senior
Counsel appearing for her as being strong, it not having been pleaded in the
original
Statement of Claim, nor the subject of any ruling by Studdert J.
Further it does not appear to have been raised in the Court of Appeal.
<P>

115   	His Honour was of the view, paragraph 681, that there was
no "actionable statutory duty at all".  He did not consider that
the provisions
upon which reliance were placed were intended to give a right of action in
tort, and that they did not impose upon
the defendants any special statutory
duty or liability to the plaintiff enforceable by an action for damages
independently of the
ordinary principles of the common law of negligence, for
which he placed reliance upon the decision of Deane J in <b>Sutherland Shire
Council v Heyman</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 424</a> at p.500.
<P>

116   	In paragraph 683 his Honour observed that some of the
recent authorities dealing with actions for breach of statutory duty
were
considered in <b>Cubillo</b>, noting that O'Loughlin J considered that prima
facie the plaintiffs had private rights of action for breach of statutory
duties
available to them.  However, his Honour was not persuaded that he should
follow that line of reasoning and he referred to various
other authorities,
which, he considered, confirmed him in that view.
<P>

117   	It will be immediately apparent that, although Abadee J
and O'Loughlin J were considering the matter from somewhat different
perspectives, i.e. Abadee J was looking at it from a trial point of view,
whilst O'Loughlin J was concerned with a strike out application,
there is a
difference of view as to the scope and applicability of statutory duty, at
least until the facts are found.  I think,
if I may say so with respect, that
it is also important to have regard to the facts to determine whether the
activities were based
on policy or operational matters.
<P>

118   	I also consider that it is appropriate to have regard to
the statements of Studdert J in <b>TC v State of New South Wales</b>.  In that
case his Honour considered whether a separate right of action could arise under
the statute, notwithstanding, as appears
in paragraph 157, that it was not
contended that the <b>Child Welfare Act</b> gave rise to a statutory cause of
action.  His Honour did so in the context of considering whether the defendant
owed to the plaintiff
a duty of care at common law by adopting the three stage
approach employed by Kirby J in <b>Pyrenees</b>.  In the course of his Honour's
comments on this aspect he noted that s.148B(5) of the <b>Child Welfare Act</b>
had no real counterpart in the legislation considered by the House of Lords in
<b>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 633.</a>
<P>

119   	I have referred to the various authorities, although
probably not in sufficient detail to do full justice to them.  However,
I
believe that what I have said is sufficient to indicate that it could not be
said, on the test applicable to determine whether
there is a cause of action
for present purposes, rather than what might be the higher test for determining
whether a pleading should
be struck out as failing to disclose a cause of
action, that there is not an arguable case as to whether a statutory duty was
owed
and breached.
<P>

120   	Nextly, Mr McCarthy submitted that the relationship of
child and guardian did not give rise to a fiduciary obligation.  He
relied on
the decision of the House of Lords in <b>Henderson v Mevrett Syndicates</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20AC%20145" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] AC 145</a> and <b>Williams (No 2) </b>at paragraph 740.  He submitted that
one first had to find the fiduciary obligations and then prove that such
obligations were breached.
 His submission continued that if the basal
relationship of parent/child does not give rise to fiduciary obligations then
the derivative
or substitute relationship between the respondents and the
appellant should not entail any greater fiduciary obligation extending
beyond
that for which it is substituted by statute.
<P>

121   	I am not satisfied that there cannot be a fiduciary
relationship.  In <b>Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services v
JWB and SMB (Marion's case)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 218</a> McHugh J said, at p.317:-
<P>

<b>"The powers which the parent exercises on behalf of the child are exercised
in the course of a fiduciary relationship.  At all events,
the role of the
parent, when acting for the benefit of his or her child, and the role of a
fiduciary are sufficiently similar to
make at least some of the principles
concerning fiduciaries applicable to the parent-child relationship."</b>
<P>

122   	In <b>Williams (No 1)</b>, Kirby P considered the
existence of a fiduciary relationship at length.  His Honour was of the view
that certain Canadian authorities
should be followed and considered that part
of the error at first instance in refusing to extend the time was the fact that
the claim
for equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty could not be
disposed of by the limitation point, but would, peremptory relief
apart, be
required to proceed to trial.  He continued, pp.510-511:-
<P>

<b>"The evidence relevant to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty would be
substantially the same as the evidence relevant to the claim
for damages for
the torts of negligence and wrongful detention.  If a court concluded that a
claim for breach of fiduciary duty was
bound to be tried, it would seem
strongly arguable that the alternative causes of action upon which the same
plaintiff relied at
common law should be heard at the same time."</b>
<P>

123   	He posed the question whether the action for breach of
fiduciary duty was so hopeless that the failure to have regard to
it
constituted legal error.  He considered it did amount to such error and
continued:-
<P>

<b>"The Board was in the nature of a statutory guardian of Ms Williams.  The
relationship of guardian and ward is one of the established
fiduciary
categories: see <i>Hospital Products</i> ...; <i>Bennett</i> ... .  The Board
was, in my view, arguably obliged to Ms Williams to act in her interest and in
a way that truly provided, in a manner
apt for a fiduciary, for her `custody,
maintenance and education'.  I consider that it is distinctly arguable that a
person who suffers
as a result of want of proper care on the part of a
fiduciary, may recover equitable compensation from the fiduciary for the losses
occasioned by the want of proper care ..."</b>
<P>

124   	The basis of Mr McCarthy's submission, which was put in
absolute terms, that the relationship of child and guardian does
not give rise
to a fiduciary obligation was <b>Paramasivan v Flynn</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1711.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1711</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20160%20ALR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 160 ALR 203.</a>
In that case the appellant commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of the
Australian Capital Territory against the respondent
claiming damages for
assault and breach of fiduciary duty at a time when the respondent was the
appellant's guardian.  An application
was unsuccessfully made at first instance
to extend the limitation period and the Full Court dismissed the appeal.  Their
Honours
commenced to consider fiduciary claims and their application to
limitation law provisions at p.214.  They referred to the pleadings
and to the
significant problem that the appellant had not attempted to define, with any
precision, exactly what the circumstances
were, or where they occurred, which
gave rise to the alleged fiduciary relationship.  Nor had the appellant
elaborated the precise
scope or content of the fiduciary duties.
<P>

125   	Commencing at p.218, their Honours considered the general
principles relating to fiduciary duties and the decision of the
Supreme Court
of Canada in <b>M(K) v M(H)</b>  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992scr3-6/1992scr3-6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 96 DLR(4th) 289</a>, in which it was held
that the relationship of parent and child was fiduciary, giving rise to a
fiduciary duty to protect the child's
well-being and health, and that incest
was a breach of that duty.  Their Honours also referred to the decision in
<b>Williams (No 1)</b>, which they noted preceded that of the High Court in
<b>Breen v Williams</b> (1996) 186 CLR 71, in which their Honours discerned
disagreement with several aspects of recent Canadian approaches to the
development
of the law to which they referred and, at p.221, concluded:-
<P>

<b>"All of those considerations lead us firmly to the conclusion that a
fiduciary claim, such as that made by the plaintiff in this case,
is most
unlikely to be upheld by Australian Courts.  Equity, through the principles it
has developed about fiduciary duty, protects
particular interests which differ
from those protected by the law of contract and tort, and protects those
interests from a standpoint
which is peculiar to those principles.  The truth
of that is not at all undermined by the undoubted fact that fiduciary duties
may
arise within a relationship governed by contract or that liability in
equity may co-exist with liability in tort.  To say, truly,
that categories are
not closed does not justify so radical a departure from underlying principles.
Both propositions, in our view,
lie at the heart of the High Court authorities
to which we have referred, particularly, perhaps, <i>Breen</i>."</b>
<P>

126   	In <b>Cubillo</b> O'Loughlin J considered the claim for
breach of fiduciary duty.  His Honour traced through the various cases, noting
that the fiduciary
relationship was said to arise because of the role and
functions of the Commonwealth's servants and agents in the removal and
detention
of the applicants and because of the Commonwealth's powers over, and
its assumption of responsibility for, Aboriginal people in the
Northern
Territory.  It was also said to arise because of the powers, obligations and
directions of the directors and the vulnerability
of each applicant to the
exercise of them: paragraph 115.
<P>

127   	At paragraph 124 O'Loughlin J noted that the High Court
in <b>Northern Land Council v The Commonwealth (No 2)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2075%20ALR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 75 ALR 210</a>,
was of the view that the question whether there was a fiduciary relationship
was to be resolved at trial.
<P>

128   	In paragraph 126 his Honour referred to reliance upon the
decision in <b>Bennett</b> and to the statement in the joint judgment of Mason
CJ, Deane and Toohey JJ at p.411:-
<P>

<b>"It is not now in question that there was a duty of care owed by the
Director of Community Welfare (the Director) to the appellant
and that there
was a breach of that duty (for which, it is agreed, the minister was
vicariously liable).  In the Courts below, the
duty of care appears to have
been equated to, even derived from, a fiduciary duty owed by the Director to
the appellant arising out
of his statutory office as guardian.  That fiduciary
duty was a positive duty to obtain independent legal advice with respect to
the
possible existence of a cause of action on the part of the appellant arising
out of the circumstances in which he sustained an
amputation of four fingers of
his left hand."</b>
<P>

It may well be arguable that there was a positive duty to have appropriate
regard to the neighbour's complaint, and to take action,
if it was found to be
justified, to protect the appellant. Reference was also made to the judgment of
McHugh J at p.427, where his
Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"Nevertheless, it is not open to doubt that, in addition to the fiduciary
duty which the Director owed to the appellant, the circumstances
of the
guardianship and the injury to the appellant while under the care and control
of the Director, gave rise to a common law duty
on the part of the latter to
take reasonable care to ensure that the appellant did not suffer economic loss
by not being advised
of his rights in respect of that injury."</b>
<P>

129   	His Honour referred to <b>Williams (No 1)</b> and to
<b>Paramasivan</b>.  It was pressed upon him that he should regard himself as
bound to hold, as a result of that decision, that on the pleadings the
applicants did not have a cause of action against the Commonwealth for breach
of fiduciary duty.  He noted the refusal of the Full
Court to follow the
Canadian decision to which I have referred, which he contrasted with the
decision in <b>Williams (No 1)</b> to follow it.  He referred to the Full
Court's reliance on the decision of the High Court in <b>Breen v Williams</b>
and, at paragraph 134, said:-
<P>

<b>"But the warning in <i>Northern Land Council v Commonwealth</i> not to
determine the nature of any relationship in the abstract, the acceptance in
<i>Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare</i> that the relationship of
guardian and ward created a fiduciary relationship <u>and the acknowledgment in
</u><cite>Paramasivan v Flynn</cite><u> that the relationship of guardian and
ward may give rise to a fiduciary relationship</u> are sufficient to persuade
me that it would be premature to hold, at this stage, that the applicants have
failed to make out a case
of a fiduciary relationship on the pleadings.  It may
transpire, when all the evidence has been taken, that no such relationship
has
been proved: That is matter, however, that should await the trial of the
action."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

130   	Abadee J commenced his consideration of a fiduciary duty
in <b>Williams (No 2)</b> at paragraph 695 by suggesting that the action for
breach of fiduciary duty "is a novel one".
<P>

131   	He contrasted the different views of Kirby P and Powell
JA in <b>Williams (No 1)</b> although, I would have thought, with respect, that
the views of Kirby P, which were adopted by Priestley JA, established that for
which <b>Williams (No 1)</b> stood as authority.  His Honour thought that there
was much force in the views of Powell JA, although he did not consider he was
bound by them, but he said that in many ways they "perhaps" reflected his
"ultimate independent views".  His Honour continued, paragraph
703:-
<P>

<b>"It seems to me, that even assuming a fiduciary relationship is established,
there is no fiduciary duty of the kind urged by the plaintiff,
or that further
or alternatively, that no action for breach of fiduciary duty is available in
any event.  Indeed, in light of my
finding and reasons, no breach of such duty
has in the event been established."</b>
<P>

132   	His Honour pointed out in the subsequent paragraphs the
need to find the particular obligation or obligations owed and, at
the
conclusion of paragraph 706, said:-
<P>

<b>"Such an approach thus involves a consideration of whether a fiduciary
concept embraces a specific duty of the type urged in the instant
case.  In my
view it does not."</b>
<P>

133   	It is apparent, if I may say so with great respect, that
whilst his Honour rejected the general view that there could be
a fiduciary
relationship giving rise to fiduciary duties, he also found, on the facts of
that case, that there was no specific duty
of the type urged on behalf of Ms
Williams of which there had been a breach.
<P>

134   	He also drew the distinction between various legislation
to support his conclusion that no fiduciary duty arose in that case.
<P>

135   	His Honour was also referred to the decision of the Court
of Appeal in <b>Brunninghausen v Glavanics</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/199.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] NSWCA 199</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2046%20NSWLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 46 NSWLR 538</a> in which, on
several occasions, Handley JA, who delivered the principal judgment of the
Court, noted that the relationship of guardian
and ward had always been one
which gave rise to fiduciary duties.  At paragraph 721, Abadee J said that it
was not necessary to decide,
in that case, whether the relationship of guardian
and ward or parent and child was of a fiduciary nature, and he noted that in
<b>Hospital Products</b> neither Gibbs CJ nor Mason J included those
relationships within their formulations of fiduciary duties.  However, his
Honour may
have overlooked that Dawson J did at p.141 in a passage to which
Kirby P drew attention in <b>Williams (No 1)</b>.   In the light of the
authorities to which I have referred, it is difficult, in my respectful
opinion, to say that the relationship
of child and guardian does not give rise
to a fiduciary relationship or obligation.  Of course, in every case it is
necessary to
examine the content of the duty and the alleged breach of it.  In
the end, paragraph 734, his Honour was of the view that <b>Paramasivan</b>
correctly stated the law and, subsequently, he drew upon various other
authorities in support of the proposition that there was no
fiduciary
relationship.
<P>

On the facts of that case his Honour was obviously of the view that even if
there had been a fiduciary duty, there was no breach
of it.
<P>

136   	I do not consider that in the light of <b>Williams (No
1)</b> and <b>Brunninghausen</b>, supported by the other authorities to which I
have referred, it can be said that there is not, relevantly for present
purposes,
an available action based on the existence of a fiduciary duty and
breach of it.
<P>

137   	Nextly Mr McCarthy submitted that there was no evidence
available to demonstrate the necessary link between any breach of
duty by the
respondents and the appellant's present condition.  The submission was that any
suggestion that isolated incidents in
a fourteen year period of substitute care
are relatively causative of the appellant's personal problems is without
evidentiary foundation.
 He submitted:-
<P>

<b>"The complexity of causation and the lack of evidence of the necessary link
between demonstrable breach of duty and causative effect
reinforce that the
relationship alleged by the appellant is non-justiciable."</b>
<P>

In my opinion the evidence of Dr Gertler provides the necessary causal link.
<P>

138   	In my opinion each of the claims made by the appellant
shows, prima facie, an available case of the type referred to in <b>Williams
(No 1)</b> and <b>McLean</b>, which the appellant is entitled to have heard.
The contentions to the contrary should be rejected, and the Master's decision,
in
this regard, upheld.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

139   	For these reasons I consider, with respect, that the
Master was in error in finding that there was an absence of evidence
in the way
in which she did.  In my opinion the appeal against these findings should be
allowed.  I am further of the opinion that
the Master was correct in finding
that the appellant had pleaded justiciable causes of action, sufficient to make
it just and reasonable
for the proceedings to go forward, and that her analysis
of the issue of prejudice does not indicate any failure to exercise her
discretion properly: see also <b>Sydney City Council v Zegarac</b> (1998) 43
NSLWR 195.  Finally, I am not satisfied by the submissions of Mr McCarthy that
the principles of law for which he contends,
namely the absence of any duty in
the respondents at common law or under statute or by virtue of a fiduciary
duty, irrespective of
the findings of fact, is correct.  It may be, eventually,
that the principles applied by Abadee J in the particular circumstances
of
<b>Williams (No 2)</b> are held, as principles of law, to be correct.  However,
even if that be so, it does not seem to me that that will necessarily lead
to
the conclusion that in any given case those principles should be applied
without regard to the particular facts of the case. 
In my view, however, that
position has not been reached at the moment.  The various authorities to which
I have referred show that
each area of law is in a somewhat fluid state, and I
can see no justification for declining to hold that on those facts pleaded,
which were accepted by the respondents as correct, and on the facts proved
before the Master to the extent necessary for the application,
the appellant
does not have an arguable case on each cause of action for which he contends.
The same facts are said to give rise,
essentially, to each cause of action.  As
that for breach of fiduciary duty does not require an extension of time, it is
difficult
to see what prejudice could apply to the hearing of the other causes
of action: <b>Williams (No 1)</b>.
<P>

140   	I would merely conclude by stressing that the evidentiary
material to which I have referred has not been tested.  The appellant's
case,
after trial, may lead to the conclusion that he is not entitled to succeed.
However, the situation has not been reached where
it has been demonstrated that
that case should be defeated <i>in limine</i>, in the sense that the limitation
provisions should provide a complete defence to it.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

141   	I order that:-
<P>

(a)	The appeal be allowed.
<P>

(b)	The orders of Master Harrison of 29 June 1999 be set aside.
<P>

(c)	In lieu thereof it be ordered that pursuant to s.60G and s.58 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> </b>1969, the limitation period for the causes of action for
negligence and breach of statutory duties set out in the Statement of Claim
filed on 24 July 1997, being for damages for personal injury, be extended to 24
July 1997.
<P>

(d)	The respondents pay the appellant's costs of the proceedings before Master
Harrison and of the appeal.
<P>

(e)	The exhibits be returned.
