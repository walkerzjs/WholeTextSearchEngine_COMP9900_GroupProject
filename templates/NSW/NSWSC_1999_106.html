<P>

	The plaintiffs in these proceedings have each suffered considerable physical
and emotional injury as a result of contracting pelvic
inflammatory disease
which has affected their fertility.  There is no doubt they have each suffered
considerably.
<P>

	They have sued the manufacturer and suppliers of the IUD device they each used
essentially on the basis that the manufacturer was
negligent in the design of
the device and failed to warn them of risks to their health of which they were
aware.
<P>

	The litigation was the longest and most complex product liability litigation
in Australian legal history.  The hearing of evidence
commenced on 24 January
1996 and concluded on 13 September 1996.  The oral evidence comprised
substantially approximately 15 lineal
metres of folders of exhibits.  The
written submissions of the parties comprised approximately 3 lineal metres of
folders of submissions
and supporting documents.  Oral submissions were
delivered between 27 October, 1997 and 23 December, 1997.
<P>

	It was common ground that injury of the type sustained by the plaintiffs could
be sustained without the use of the defendants'
device and that it could also
be sustained with the use of the defendants' device.  The plaintiffs submitted
that if they showed
any negligence on the part of the defendants which
materially increased the risk to the users of the devices then that was
sufficient
to establish causation of their injuries so as to entitle them to
succeed against the defendants unless the defendants established
that the
injury was due to some other cause.
<P>

	In my view this is not the law and until it is changed by either a decision of
the High Court of Australia or by the Parliament
of New South Wales it is
necessary for the plaintiffs to establish that their injuries were, on the
balance of probability, caused
by or materially contributed to by the negligent
acts of the defendants.
<P>

	In my view the plaintiffs have not established that the defendants were
negligent in any material way nor that the actions of the
defendants caused or
materially contributed to the injuries to the plaintiffs.
<P>

	Further, in my view, the plaintiffs have not established any breach of any
duty to warn the plaintiffs of any matter.
<P>

	There will be judgment for the defendants in each of the cases.
<P>

<center><b><u>1.     INTRODUCTION</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

	This litigation involves nine lead cases selected from some two hundred
commenced in this Court claiming damages for injury said
to arise from the use
of an interuterine device known as Copper 7 (Cu-7) or Gravigard or from the use
of another interuterine device
known as the Mini-Gravigard which was a smaller
version of the first device.  These devices will be referred to respectively as
"<i>Cu-7</i>" and "<i>Mini</i>".
<P>

	The devices used fine copper wire carried on a plastic vehicle which is
somewhat in the shape of the number 7 for contraceptive
purposes.  The devices
were inserted into the uterus of the user and there was a tail of polypropylene
attached to the device which
after insertion passed from the device through the
cervix of the user into her vagina.
<P>

	The devices were apparently extremely successful in preventing pregnancies
occurring while they were in place.  The mechanism by
which the devices
achieved their objective is complex and not known with certainty even by the
manufacturer but an understanding
of the mechanism is not necessary for the
determination of the issues which arise in these cases.
<P>

	The Cu-7 was initially developed by a Chilean doctor, Hime Zipper.  A licence
agreement was entered into on 13 April 1970 between
a corporation with which Dr
Zipper was associated and one of the defendants which is a United States
corporation.  That licence agreement
ran until 31 December 1985 when there was
an option to purchase the intellectual property associated with the device.  By
about that
time the Cu-7 was no longer marketed in the United States although
it continued to be marketed in other countries including Australia
until
1990.
<P>

	The Mini was marketed in Australia but not in the United States.  This device
was apparently regarded as being more appropriate
than the Cu-7 for use by
women who had never conceived.
<P>

	Each of the nine plaintiffs had one or more Cu-7s inserted in the period
between 1974 and 1981.
<P>

	In the selection of the nine lead cases before the Court four plaintiffs were
identified as parous, that is they had already borne
children at the time they
used the Cu-7 devices, namely Moylan, Ottaway, Robertson, Southren and four as
nulliparous, that is they
had never borne a child, namely Gentle, Lane, Lee and
Orders.
<P>

	One of the plaintiffs, Denzin, was nulliparous when she began using the Cu-7
and when she subsequently used the Mini, the first
in 1983 and the second in
1985.
<P>

	Four of the plaintiffs, Denzin, Gentle, Lee and Ottaway had documented string
retractions, that is the polypropolene string attached
to the plastic device
retracted from the vagina into the uterus after the device had been
inserted.
<P>

	Four of the plaintiffs, Denzin, Orders, Ottaway and Southren had an ectopic
pregnancy or ectopic pregnancies.
<P>

	One of the plaintiffs, Gentle, had a septic abortion with her Cu-7 in
place.
<P>

	All of the plaintiffs except Gentle suffered either complete infertility or
impaired fertility.
<P>

	The defendants are all members of what is now the Monsanto Group of companies.
The first defendant carried on all aspects of the
business associated with the
Cu-7 at all times at least up to 24 May 1978.  At that time it was known as G D
Searle and Co., but
subsequently changed its name to The NutraSweet Company.
<P>

	The second defendant was called Searle Australia Pty Limited at all relevant
times and is now known as Monsanto Australia Pty Limited.
 It carried on the
business of distribution, sales, promotion, marketing and provision of
information and warnings for health care
 providers and users within Australia
at all relevant times.
<P>

	The third defendant carried on the business associated with the Cu-7 in the
period from 24 May 1978 to 1 January 1986 and the fourth
defendant carried on
that business from 1 January 1986.  The fourth defendant changed its name to G
D Searle &amp; Co.  on 2 January
1986.  However, almost all references to "G D
Searle &amp; Co." are references to the first defendant.
<P>

	The plaintiffs' case was in essence that use of the devices caused the
plaintiffs to contract Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
causing damage to
their reproductive organs and thus either permanent or partial infertility and,
in some instances, damage to the
fallopian tubes resulting in ectopic
pregnancies.
<P>

	They submitted that the use of the devices put the users at greater risk of
the introduction of infection into the uterine cavity
or the fallopian tubes or
to the ovaries than was the risk to non-users of the devices.
<P>

The plaintiffs claimed exemplary damages on the basis that the defendants acted
in knowing and contumelious disregard of their rights,
health and welfare.
<P>

The questions to be determined are:
<P>

1. 	Did the plaintiffs contract PID?
<P>

2. 	If so, was use of the defendants' products <i>causally</i> 
<P>

	<i>connected</i> with the contraction of PID by the plaintiffs?
<P>

3. 	If so, <i>how</i> were the defendants' products causally connected?
<P>

4. 	Did that connection or connections or any conduct of the 
<P>

defendants or any of them constitute a breach or 
<P>

breaches of the duty of care owed by the defendants to the 
<P>

plaintiffs?
<P>

5. 	If there was a breach, did the defendants or any of them act in 
<P>

knowing and contumelious disregard of the plaintiffs' rights, 
<P>

health and welfare?
<P>

The hearing of these cases commenced on 29 January, 1996 and the evidence
concluded on 13 September, 1996. The addresses concluded
on 23 December, 1997.

<P>

The oral evidence comprised substantially cross-examination of expert witnesses
on written statements of evidence tendered by them.
 The documentary evidence
comprised approximately 15 lineal metres of folders of exhibits and included
numerous photocopies of medical
and scientific papers and publications.  A
great deal of the exhibits are difficult to read.
<P>

The quality and complexity of the evidence was such that I clearly informed the
parties a number of times during the hearing that
the issues which would be
determined were:-
<P>

1.	Those properly raised by the pleadings and in accordance
<P>

with the particulars provided,   and
<P>

2.	Those which were the explicit subject of  submissions by the
<P>

parties.
<P>

	I also informed the parties that the only evidence which would be considered
would be that evidence which was explicitly referred
to in the submissions.
<P>

	The submissions of the parties were partly written and partly oral.  The
written submissions are contained in approximately 3 lineal
metres of folders
of submissions and supporting documents.  The oral submissions were delivered
between 27 October, 1997 and 23 December,
1997.
<P>

	In order to bring some order to the vast quantity of material before the Court
I have included the following schedules in this
judgment:
<P>

	Schedule I		A chronological list of relevant facts, documents
<P>

				and publications.

<b>SUMMARY OF PLAINTIFFS' CASE</b>
<P>

The two pillars of the plaintiffs' cases (T.7412, l.46) are based on
negligence.  They are:
<P>

1.	Failure to warn
<P>

2.	Defective design
<P>

<b>1.</b>	<b>Failure to warn</b>
<P>

	The plaintiffs' case on this basis is that
<P>

	1.1	A woman was placed at greater risk of contracting PID if
<P>

		she used an IUD including a Cu-7.
<P>

	1.2	That greater risk was known to the defendants.
<P>

	1.3	The defendants failed to warn:
<P>

		1.3.1	the plaintiffs;  or
<P>

		1.3.2	the plaintiffs' doctors.
<P>

	The threshold question in determining liability on this count is whether a
woman was placed at greater risk of contracting PID
if she used a Cu-7.  The
plaintiffs submitted that the affirmative of this question was established
by:
<P>

	1.	Epidemiological evidence.
<P>

	2.	The scientific case as to the role of the IUD and its design
<P>

		defects in increasing the risk of PID.
<P>

	3.	The causes of increased risk of PID as explained from 
<P>

		clinical expertise.
<P>

<b>2.</b>	<b>Defective Design</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>The plaintiffs allege that the Cu-7 had the following defects of which
the manufacturer was aware but which it failed to rectify:
<P>

	2.1	Fraying of the tailstring
<P>

	2.2	"Memory" of the tailstring which caused it to retract into the 
<P>

uterus
<P>

	2.3	The inserter tube had the string on the outside of the tube.
<P>

	<b><i>2.1	Fraying of the tailstring.</i></b>
<P>

		This was said to have materially increased the risk of injury 
<P>

		from ascending infection by:-
<P>

	(i)	fraying creating rough surfaces thereby increasing the area to 	which
bacteria could adhere;
<P>

	(ii)	bacteria prefer rough surfaces;
<P>

	(iii)	frayed surfaces allowed more bacteria to adhere; 
<P>

	(iv)	more bacteria could colonise the frayed tailstring;
<P>

(v)	the frayed surface provided a locus for infectious agents 
<P>

which can affect the uterus.
<P>

	The plaintiffs' evidence called to support the case pleaded that the 
<P>

tailstring had a design defect by virtue of being made of polypropylene and 
<P>

subjected to tension in manufacture making it prone to fray.
<P>

	It was not disputed that Cu-7 tailstrings frayed and suffered other 
<P>

morphological (although not chemical) breakdown. This extended to all 
<P>

Cu-7 tailstrings over time. The disputes as to fraying related to how much 
<P>

and where.
<P>

	The plaintiffs tendered a great many documents dating from 1974 
<P>

(the "<i>dogs breakfast</i>" memorandum - see document 1 dated 17 
<P>

September 1974 in the fraying bundle attached to Part 5, `Documentary 
<P>

Case'), including documents from Searle Australia and from the New 
<P>

South Wales Family Planning Association which show that the fraying was 
<P>

readily apparent to the naked eye and a source of real concern. Searle's 
<P>

documents state that "<i>Fraying of some degree exists throughout our </i>
<P>

<i>production</i>."  (Exhibit P8, Tab 2, page 30).
<P>

	The plaintiffs led evidence to show that Cu-7 tailstrings frayed 
<P>

throughout their length. Professor Fives-Taylor gave evidence as to 
<P>

research performed by her group at the University of Vermont which 
<P>

undertook quantitative scoring of fraying along the length of the tailstrings.

<P>

She said they found frays along the length of the tailstrings.
<P>

	Dr Piziali gave evidence for the defendants, that a number of new 
<P>

and used tailstrings were examined optically or by scanning electron 
<P>

microscope. These observations were that no or few fibrils appeared on 
<P>

polyethylene or nylon tailstrings whereas polypropylene tailstrings did 
<P>

exhibit fibrillation. However the observations reported by Dr Piziali's team

<P>

were of fraying on the vaginal portion only of such strings. In this respect

<P>

Dr Piziali's observations differ from those of Professor Fives-Taylor. They 
<P>

also differ from the observations made by the Australian National 
<P>

Biological Standards laboratory which in February 1980 examined a 
<P>

tailstring and reported to the Commonwealth Department of Health that 
<P>

"<i>numerous fraying parts were evident along the entire length of the </i>
<P>

<i>filament together with some lengths of split ends protruding from the
</i>
<P>

<i>filament</i>."  (Document No. 134 in Part 5, `Documentary Case'). 
<P>

	There is no dispute between the parties as to the fraying being 
<P>

caused by the way in which the tailstrings were manufactured. Professor 
<P>

Robertson gave evidence that application of tension (or drawing) to the 
<P>

Cu-7 tailstring aligned polymer chains along the length of the tailstring. 
<P>

This had the effect of strengthening the tailstring along its length at the 
<P>

cost of weakening lateral bonds within the tailstring. The result was that 
<P>

the tailstring would withstand a greater pull before breaking but became 
<P>

prone to fray. His evidence applies to the entirety of the length of the 
<P>

tailstring. 
<P>

	It was submitted that the evidence of Professor Fives-Taylor and 
<P>

Professor Robertson and the letter from the National Biological Standards 
<P>

Laboratory support the finding that Cu-7 tailstrings, being made of highly 
<P>

drawn polypropylene, frayed throughout their length.
<P>

<b>	</b>I accept<b> </b>that this was so.
<P>

	The defendants argued that fraying by itself was solely an aesthetic 
<P>

problem without medical consequences. The plaintiffs submitted that a 
<P>

frayed tailstring will have a larger and rougher surface area than a 
<P>

non-fraying tailstring and will thereby attract bacterial adhesion and 
<P>

colonisation, increasing the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.
<P>

	It appears that there is no dispute between the parties as to 
<P>

Professor Fives-Taylor's evidence that the body's primary defence against 
<P>

infection by micro-organisms is desquamation, that is, the defence of 
<P>

flushing out micro-organisms by shedding cells on the outer layer of 
<P>

organs. If a micro-organism has adhered to a surface which does not 
<P>

desquamate, then it is able to stay in the body. Professor Fives-Taylor 
<P>

described adhesion as "<i>the first and most primary virulence factor</i>" for
a 
<P>

micro-organism in the body.
<P>

	A Cu-7 or Mini, including its tailstring, cannot desquamate. Any 
<P>

biomedical implant becomes coated with a thin layer of host proteins 
<P>

immediately upon being placed into the body. An IUD is no exception. 
<P>

Micro-organisms can attach to this layer of proteins through specific 
<P>

adhesion. Specific adhesion involves the formation of bonds between the 
<P>

micro-organism and the surface layer on the tailstring. 
<P>

	Professor Ellner gave evidence that the initial attachment is due to 
<P>

physical and chemical forces but that within a few hours after attachment 
<P>

micro-organisms which have adhered to an IUD can exude a substance 
<P>

which forms a "<i>slime</i>" layer over the IUD  (para 16 of Professor Ellner's

<P>

first statement, Tab 1, Exhibit P282).  This, together with material from the

<P>

host, forms a biofilm which rapidly covers the whole of the surface of the 
<P>

device. Professor Ellner said micro-organisms can and do colonise the 
<P>

surface and interior of this biofilm.
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that because of the fibrillation which causes 
<P>

frayed and rough surfaces, bacteria are better able to adhere to the Cu-7
<P>

tailstring than to other tailstrings. This was said to be supported by the
evidence of Professor Katz.
<P>

	Professor Katz gave evidence that bacteria are better able to adhere 
<P>

to a rough surface than a smooth surface and that bacteria are more likely 
<P>

to colonise along the frayed areas.  (Paragraph 17, Statement of Professor 
<P>

Katz dated 25 August 1995, Tab 1, Exhibit P192).   Professor Kaplan 
<P>

agreed that bacteria might be able to adhere better to rough surfaces than 
<P>

smooth.  (T5370/L57-5371-L3).   Professor Robertson and Professor 
<P>

Fives-Taylor observed that the biofilm preferentially concentrated in the 
<P>

grooves of the tailstring created by fibrillation, frayed areas and areas of

<P>

pits, crevices and roughness. Professor Fives-Taylor undertook 
<P>

experiments which indicated that up to 10 times as many bacteria adhered 
<P>

to frayed parts of the Cu-7 tailstring as to smooth parts.  The defendants 
<P>

accept that bacteria can adhere to IUD tailstrings. 
<P>

	Professor Fives-Taylor conducted experiments to measure bacterial 
<P>

adhesion to various tailstrings and polymers. She measured specific 
<P>

adherence of radioactively "<i>tagged</i>" bacteria to unprocessed beads of 
<P>

polyethylene, polypropylene and co-polymer. While some bacterial species 
<P>

adhered better to one material and some to another, there was little or no 
<P>

overall preference shown by various bacterial species for one over another. 
<P>

Six of ten bacterial species tested adhered better to polyethylene and four 
<P>

adhered better to polypropylene. 
<P>

	She then measured specific adherence of bacteria to tailstrings of 
<P>

IUDs. The results demonstrated much greater adhesion to the 
<P>

polypropylene tailstring of the Cu-7 over the tailstrings of other devices. 
<P>

This held true across bacterial species. Twelve of the thirteen bacterial 
<P>

species tested adhered better to polypropylene in tailstring form. There 
<P>

was no result for the thirteenth. 
<P>

	Professor Fives-Taylor concluded that it was the processing of the 
<P>

material, rather than the choice of polypropylene itself, which accounted 
<P>

for the greater adherence of bacteria to Cu-7 tailstrings over the tailstrings

<P>

of other materials.
<P>

	The defendants' witness, Professor Kaplan, an expert in 
<P>

microbiology from the University of Texas Medical School, criticised a 
<P>

number of techniques used in Professor Fives-Taylor's bacterial adherence 
<P>

experiments. His evidence was that the use of human saliva rather than 
<P>

oestrus fluid as a medium for coating the tailstrings deprived the results of

<P>

significance. He criticised the application of the method of counting 
<P>

bacteria and suggested that the experimental technique was sloppy, 
<P>

pointing to the recording in the laboratory notebooks of a number of 
<P>

experiments being spoiled by accidents in the laboratory. Professor 
<P>

Fives-Taylor's group conducted more than a thousand experiments, 
<P>

including replicates and gave evidence that some accidents were to be 
<P>

expected. Professor Kaplan did not point to any scientific 
<P>

literature which suggested that Professor Fives-Taylor's experiments 
<P>

should  not be given weight.
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that the Cu-7 tailstring has been shown to 
<P>

have certain characteristics resulting from its manufacturing process. The 
<P>

fibrillation and morphological breakdown of the tailstring led to it having a

<P>

greater surface area and greater surface roughness than tailstrings of the 
<P>

same diameter made of other materials. 
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that Professor Fives-Taylor's conclusion, 
<P>

that the fraying and degradation of the Cu-7 tailstring promote the 
<P>

adhesion of bacteria should be accepted because: 
<P>

*			Professor Fives-Taylor and her group undertook many experiments 		and
replicates so even though some are criticised, the overall
weight 		is
convincing.
<P>

*			there are no contrary experiments.
<P>

*			the only experimental work of the defendants about which there is
evidence is supportive in that it indicates that E. coli,
a recognised 		PID
pathogen, can adhere to the Cu-7 tailstring.
<P>

*			Professor Ellner gave evidence to similar effect including citations 		of
the published science which is itself supportive (Statement
31 
<P>

		July 1995, Exhibit P 282, Tab 1) and Exhibits P 205 (Wilkins et al 
<P>

		1989 IJP 57 1-7) and D347 	(Wilkins et al Contraception Vol 
<P>

		39, No 2, p. 205), being two of the footnotes to paragraph 16 of 
<P>

		Professor Ellner's statement. 
<P>

*			the defendants concede that bacteria adhere to tailstrings so there is
nothing unlikely in Professor Fives-Taylor's results.
<P>

<b><u>Medical Risks Due To Defects</u></b>
<P>

		The defendants argued that, even if there are medical risks due to defects,
these nevertheless have no clinical implications.
<P>

		Professor Kaplan agreed that microbial adherence based on biofilm 
<P>

is a fundamental and pivotal factor in sepsis involving biomaterials.  
<P>

(T5218/L54-T5219/L5) but was not prepared to extrapolate from this 
<P>

position, which applied to a wide range of other implanted devices, to the 
<P>

case of IUDs. He expressed the view that because the epidemiological 
<P>

data cleared IUDs from involvement in infections, IUDs were necessarily 
<P>

different from other biomedical devices.
<P>

		Professor Kaplan accepted that cells might detach from the biofilm 
<P>

of an IUD in situ and, in a host whose defences are lowered sufficiently, 
<P>

might cause infection. However he suggested that the probability would be 
<P>

that the large numbers of pathogens constantly accessing the upper genital 
<P>

tract would cause PID rather than pathogens detaching from the biofilm-
<P>

covered IUD.  (T5266/L9-41).
<P>

		It was submitted that Professor Kaplan's opinion that pathogens 
<P>

detaching from the biofilm were not likely to cause PID was not based on 
<P>

his expertise in microbiology but rested on his understanding of the 
<P>

epidemiology as exonerating the Cu-7. He agreed that his opinions were 
<P>

not informed by any expertise as an epidemiologist (T5192/L25-332) 
<P>

although he has read the literature and formed opinions.  If the 
<P>

epidemiological prop to his argument is removed, it was submitted that his 
<P>

concession as to the microbiological point goes a long way to support the 
<P>

plaintiffs' case.
<P>

		Professor Ellner expressed a quite different view as to the 
<P>

importance of pathogens leaving the biofilm. He expressed the view (as 
<P>

did Professor Katz) that the biofilm protects bacteria from the host immune 
<P>

system and antibiotics, allowing pathogens to survive in the upper genital 
<P>

tract, an area of the body where they would ordinarily be eliminated by the 
<P>

immune system. His evidence was that the biofilm on an IUD can 
<P>

concentrate nutrients, enabling the bacteria to multiply within the biofilm.

<P>

He stated that the biofilm covered Cu-7 forms a "<i>nidus</i>" or infective 
<P>

reservoir from which micro-organisms can emerge to infect the host. His 
<P>

evidence was that whether the bacterial colonisation of the Cu-7 results in 
<P>

infection or not depends upon many factors involving the state of host 
<P>

defences and the numbers and virulence of the micro-organisms. However 
<P>

the role of the fraying as a design defect was to provide a reservoir of 
<P>

pathogens able to infect the uterus.
<P>

		The danger of frayed strings was said to be given support by Dr 
<P>

Stewart who declared that frayed strings were "<i>medically unacceptable</i>"

<P>

(Exhibit P 486).  A number of Searle documents refer to the dangers of 
<P>

infection from frayed tailstrings.  The plaintiffs submitted that the evidence

<P>

of Professor Ellner, supported by the plaintiffs' and defendants' clinicians,

<P>

(who agreed that they would remove the Cu-7 in the event of infection), 
<P>

should be preferred to that of Professor Kaplan.
<P>

<b>Colonisation</b>
<P>

		The plaintiffs alleged in their pleadings that the Cu-7 and Mini 
<P>

tailstring provided a suitable environment for colonisation by bacteria 
<P>

and/or other infectious organisms.
<P>

		There is no issue that the normal uterus is subject to periodic 
<P>

incursions of bacteria which are almost always effectively eliminated by 
<P>

the immune system. There is also no issue that a uterus which has an IUD 
<P>

in it will always have permanent colonies of micro-organisms associated 
<P>

with the biofilm on that IUD. These micro-organisms are protected by the 
<P>

biofilm from the action of the immune system.
<P>

		It is common ground that it is only upon ascension through the 
<P>

cervix into the upper genital tract that micro-organisms, including virulent

<P>

pathogens such as gonococcus and chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobes, 
<P>

can cause PID. 
<P>

		An issue between the parties was the extent, if any, to which the 
<P>

tailstring of the Cu-7 could assist a potential pathogen to "<i>ascend</i>".
One 
<P>

mechanism pleaded in relation to this is the contamination of the device 
<P>

with bacteria from the vagina or lower cervix upon insertion. There is no 
<P>

dispute that this occurs. Another mechanism pleaded is the retraction of 
<P>

the tailstring into the uterus. 
<P>

		Leaving these mechanisms aside, it was submitted that there does 
<P>

not seem to be any dispute that, upon insertion into the body, the Cu-7 
<P>

rapidly becomes coated by a biofilm which is colonised by bacteria and 
<P>

that some of these bacteria can be pathogenic in the upper genital tract. 
<P>

There was no dispute as to the evidence of Professor Ellner and Professor 
<P>

Fives-Taylor that there are colonies of bacteria in the device biofilm which

<P>

have bypassed the cervical defences and which enjoy a measure of 
<P>

protection from the immune system whenever an IUD is in situ.  These 
<P>

colonies of bacteria are said to be able to exist in the upper genital tract

<P>

solely by reason of the presence of the device. In this sense it was 
<P>

submitted there is no real argument that the presence of the device has 
<P>

assisted in the establishment of micro-organisms in the upper genital tract.

<P>

The question is whether they can do any harm.
<P>

		There is consensus that all IUDs (and other biomedical implants) 
<P>

rapidly become covered in biofilm upon insertion into the body. There is 
<P>

debate as to how much of the biofilm is produced by adherent bacteria and 
<P>

how much is host material, an issue which does not need to be decided and which
on the evidence cannot be decided. 
<P>

		Professor Ellner gave evidence that biofilm confers a substantial 
<P>

number of advantages upon bacteria which permit them to survive 
<P>

permanently in the upper genital tract.  Professor Katz supported this 
<P>

evidence as did Professor Fives-Taylor. 
<P>

		Professor Kaplan suggested that biofilm might "<i>entomb</i>" bacteria 
<P>

based upon a reference made by Professor Costerton. 
<P>

		It was submitted by the plaintiffs that the views of Professors Ellner, 
<P>

Katz, Fives-Taylor, Robertson should be preferred to those of Professor 
<P>

Kaplan.  Their views were said to be supported by the published science in 
<P>

the area, including recent work of Professor Costerton. Professor Kaplan 
<P>

put forward no published work other than the older work of Professor 
<P>

Costerton (covered by his disavowal of pre-scanning confocal microscope 
<P>

work), to support it and Professor Kaplan admitted that his use of terms 
<P>

such as "<i>cement</i>" to describe biofilm and "<i>entombed</i>" to describe
living 
<P>

bacteria was "<i>theatrical</i>".  (T5394/L1-15).
<P>

		There was disagreement between the parties as to the mechanisms 
<P>

which may allow bacteria to move into the upper genital tract. Professor 
<P>

Ellner identified mechanisms by which he said the Cu-7 and Mini assisted 
<P>

bacterial ascension including: 
<P>

(a) 	movement of the perimeter of individual colonies, 
<P>

(b) 	"<i>pollination</i>" from existing colonies on the string, and 
<P>

(c) 	the establishment of new colonies by planktonic bacteria attaching to the
tailstring, whether or not they had emerged from
other colonies on the
tailstring. 
<P>

		Professor Robertson identified a number of mechanisms including 
<P>

the extension of boundaries of a colony by lateral extension driven by 
<P>

multiplication of organisms causing growth of the colony. He also 
<P>

identified "<i>pollination</i>" in which micro-organisms or entire colonies
detach 
<P>

from the string and reattach at different places. 
<P>

		Professor Katz also identified a tendency of motile organisms to 
<P>

move along the tailstring surface towards a source of nourishment, a 
<P>

process known as chemotaxis. 
<P>

		Professor Coughlin demonstrated that micro-organisms can and do 
<P>

grow along Cu-7 tailstrings in the laboratory in preference to random 
<P>

growth. The defendants criticised the laboratory techniques used in the 
<P>

experiments and indeed the applicability of in vitro experiments at all but 
<P>

did not call evidence to the effect that the mechanisms identified by the 
<P>

plaintiffs' scientific experts did not operate. 
<P>

		The only evidence as to experiments carried out by the defendants 
<P>

was tendered by the plaintiffs. This related to experiments carried out in 
<P>

1986/7 which suggested that at least one micro-organism associated with 
<P>

PID, E. coli, was able to attach and to move through mucus in the presence 
<P>

of the tailstring. 
<P>

		It was submitted that the evidence of Professors Ellner, Katz, 
<P>

Robertson and Coughlin that the Cu-7 and Mini tailstring can facilitate the 
<P>

transport of micro-organisms into the upper genital tract should be 
<P>

accepted.
<P>

<b>Design Criteria</b>
<P>

		The plaintiffs pleaded that a number of negligent actions were 
<P>

involved in the design of the tailstring of the Cu-7 and the Mini. An aspect

<P>

of this is the case the plaintiffs sought to make that the defendants failed to

<P>

apply applicable design criteria in the decision to use highly drawn 
<P>

polypropylene as the tailstring material. 
<P>

		Professor Robertson gave evidence in his reply statement to the 
<P>

effect that criteria are and were applicable, and were routinely applied, to

<P>

medical devices such as IUDs at the relevant times. He referred to criteria 
<P>

for safety of biomedical implants which were formulated by Hegelyi in an 
<P>

article published in 1971.  (Annexure to reply statement of Professor 
<P>

Robertson, Exhibit P.136, Tab 2). 
<P>

		These criteria included consideration whether properties of the 
<P>

materials used might exert an effect on the health of the user and whether 
<P>

the biological environment might exert an effect on the material.  Dr 
<P>

Piziali's claim said that such criteria only applied to prostheses or 
<P>

materials used to repair or replace organs.  (Paragraph 2 of Professor 
<P>

Robertson's reply statement, Exhibit P.136, responding to paragraph 44 of 
<P>

Dr Piziali's statement).  
<P>

		Professor Robertson's evidence was that the (primary) principle 
<P>

applicable to the design of biomedical devices was to eliminate risks or, if

<P>

that could not be achieved, then to reduce them as far as possible and warn 
<P>

of remaining risks.  His evidence was that Searle's polypropylene tailstring

<P>

failed to meet these criteria. He said that at the time the Cu-7 was being 
<P>

designed there was available literature as to the nature of polypropylene 
<P>

and the migration of bacteria and gave a number of references.  He was not 
<P>

challenged in cross-examination on this material.
<P>

		It was submitted that Professor Robertson's opinions should be 
<P>

given greater weight because he had direct experience with the design of 
<P>

another IUD in 1970/1, the relevant period. He gave evidence as to the 
<P>

design process for this device. This involved the pharmaceutical 
<P>

manufacturer, Alza, assembling a team of scientific experts to undertake 
<P>

the design. This was said to contrast with the action of Searle in handing 
<P>

device design and development to its in-house Packaging Development 
<P>

group, which according to an internal Searle document, did not have the 
<P>

resources in number or expertise to deal with the issues but accepted the 
<P>

challenge anyway.
<P>

		Dr Piziali gave evidence that an IUD tailstring should be made of a 
<P>

material which resists biodegradation and is biocompatible with the 
<P>

environment to reduce interaction with host tissues.  (Paragraph 42 of Dr 
<P>

Piziali's first statement of 19.10.95, Exhibit D.306).  This was not 
<P>

challenged by the plaintiffs' experts in biomedical devices, Professor 
<P>

Robertson and Professor Katz.
<P>

		Dr Piziali suggested that Searle had complied with these 
<P>

requirements because polypropylene was more resistant to degradation 
<P>

than other choices, although he appeared to be referring to chemical rather 
<P>

than morphological degradation. Professor Robertson however said that it 
<P>

was all kinds of degradation which could pose a risk to the health of the 
<P>

user which ought be considered. In this regard he was critical of the choice

<P>

of drawn polypropylene as the polymer used for the Cu-7 tailstring. 
<P>

Professor Katz was also critical of the use of a material which degraded 
<P>

and was unpredictable in its action in the Cu-7/Mini tailstring. It was 
<P>

submitted that the views of Professor Robertson and Professor Katz should 
<P>

be preferred to those of Dr Piziali and it should be found that Searle failed

<P>

to comply with design criteria applicable and accepted in the early 1970s.
<P>

<b><i>2.2	"Memory" of the tailstring which caused it to retract into</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	the user's uterus.</i></b>
<P>

	This was said to materially increase the risk of injury from 
<P>

ascending infection by:
<P>

	(i)	string retraction into the uterus introducing more potential 
<P>

		pathogens than otherwise would be introduced;
<P>

	(ii)	string retraction required additional instrumentation of the 	uterus to
remove device the device which instrumentation 	increased
risk of introducing
infection;
<P>

	(iii)	the defendants admitted that uterine instrumentation increases 	the risk
of introducing infection.
<P>

	Following the successful insertion of a Cu-7 in the uterus, the 
<P>

tailstring ran from the bottom of the Cu-7 in the uterus through the 
<P>

cervix and into the vagina to provide the user or her doctor with an easy 
<P>

method of checking that the device was still in place and to facilitate the 
<P>

removal of the device. 
<P>

	The Cu-7 is shaped like a figure 7 with a small rounded cap which 
<P>

fuses the horizontal arm and the curved vertical stem together. Copper 
<P>

wire is wound around the vertical stem. The polypropylene tailstring is 
<P>

attached to the lower end of the vertical stem. When the device is 
<P>

packaged, the Copper 7 stem sits in the inserter tube. The tailstring joins at

<P>

the base of the stem (inside the inserter tube), and turns to pass up the tube

<P>

beside the device before emerging from the top of the inserter. It then 
<P>

loops through 180 degrees to run down the outside of the inserter tube. 
<P>

This can be seen clearly in Exhibit P3, a box of packaged Copper 7s.
<P>

	The plaintiffs alleged in each case that in its packaged configuration 
<P>

the tailstring was looped out of the top of the inserter tube rather than run

<P>

down the inside of the inserter tube, such loop resulting in a string 
<P>

"<i>memory</i>" which caused the tailstring to have a propensity to retract
into 
<P>

the uterus resulting in: 
<P>

(A) 	the tailstring transferring bacteria and/or other infectious organisms
from the vagina into the uterus; 
<P>

(B) 	the need for instrumentation of the uterus;  and an increased risk of
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ("<i>PID</i>"). 
<P>

	The plaintiffs also pleaded, as particulars of the exemplary damages 
<P>

sought, that Searle was aware that the Copper 7 tailstring had a tendency 
<P>

to retract into the uterus increasing the risk but chose not to remedy the 
<P>

defect.
<P>

	The defendants do not dispute that retraction of the Cu-7 tailstring 
<P>

into the uterus occurs.  They say that this retraction phenomenon is 
<P>

unrelated to the design of the Cu-7, and, in any event, does not 
<P>

increase the risk of upper genital tract infection.
<P>

	Dr O'Brien, the Associate Director of Clinical Research of Searle 
<P>

between July 1974 and September 1985, gave evidence for the defendants. 
<P>

His evidence was that Searle received reports of retractions during the 
<P>

clinical trial and following marketing of the Cu-7 and that he became 
<P>

aware of them shortly after they were received.  Reports were received 
<P>

from August 1974 through to 5 December 1983.  Dr O'Brien explained 
<P>

that the efforts Searle made to find a way to eliminate the string retraction

<P>

effect were not motivated by any concerns that the retraction of the string 
<P>

might promote infection by the drawing up of micro-organisms into the 
<P>

uterus but rather that these efforts were made for marketing purposes. He 
<P>

went on to say that all IUD tailstrings retract and there was no evidence 
<P>

that the Cu-7 retracted at a rate greater than did the tailstrings of the 
<P>

Lippes Loop. Finally he stated that there was no evidence that retraction 
<P>

promoted infection.
<P>

	The defendants also called Dr Piziali. He is a consultant with a 
<P>

background in mechanical engineering who has experience in the fields of 
<P>

biomechanics and bioengineering. He disclaimed particular expertise in 
<P>

polymer chemistry. His evidence was that while there was a memory effect 
<P>

with the Cu-7 tailstring, it was not of sufficient strength or persistence to

<P>

account for retraction into the uterus. His evidence included a video of a 
<P>

Cu-7 inside a plastic uterus. While this video showed movement in the 
<P>

tailstring, he was of the opinion that the forces involved would not be 
<P>

sufficient to account for the retractions. He said that although he had given

<P>

the matter considerable thought, he did not have a theory as to why 
<P>

tailstrings retracted but was confident that it could not be the memory.
<P>

	The defendants relied upon his evidence to counterbalance the 
<P>

exhibits tendered by the plaintiffs many of which are Searle documents 
<P>

referring to the effect that the special characteristic of the polypropylene

<P>

(the "<i>memory</i>") used in the tailstring accounted for the retraction 
<P>

phenomenon. These exhibits document reports commencing prior to 
<P>

the period in which all insertions in the lead cases occurred.  
<P>

	The defendants' case was that Searle employees believed at the time 
<P>

that there was a memory effect inherent in the polypropylene which 
<P>

accounted for the retractions, but that they were wrong. Searle said that its

<P>

employees did not have sufficient expertise to know why the tailstrings 
<P>

retracted.  The plaintiffs refer to statements to a similar effect from 
<P>

Battelle, expert design engineers employed by Searle to assist in solving 
<P>

the retraction problem.  The documents include statements that the 
<P>

alternative polyethylene string Searle proposed for use on the Copper 
<P>

(used on Searle's Tatum T) was a definite improvement in that it had 
<P>

almost no memory.  It was submitted that this suggested that Searle 
<P>

employees were right to ascribe the memory problem to the particular 
<P>

characteristics of the highly drawn polypropylene tailstring. 
<P>

	Doctors using the Cu-7 reported similar experiences to Searle. For 
<P>

example, Dr Michaelow, described in an internal Searle memo as a 
<P>

"<i>Gravigard devotee</i>" reported that up to 80% of Cu-7 tailstrings
retracted 
<P>

in his experience of 2,000 insertions and that the phenomenon was 
<P>

definitely not occurring with other devices. Mr Edmunds of Searle South 
<P>

Africa asked "<i>Why does this not happen with our Tatum-T thread or </i>
<P>

<i>threads of other devices</i>?"
<P>

	The plaintiffs have relied on the Searle documents and the evidence 
<P>

of Professor Channing Robertson and Professor David Katz to establish 
<P>

that the polypropylene used by Searle in the tailstring had a propensity to 
<P>

retract.  They submitted that unless these documents are ignored or proved 
<P>

to be all wrong on the question, the plaintiffs are entitled to a finding in

<P>

their favour.
<P>

	Professor Robertson also gave evidence for the plaintiffs. He is a 
<P>

Professor of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University.  He is the 
<P>

witness in the case with the greatest expertise in polymer chemistry. 
<P>

Polypropylene is a polymer. It was common ground that the memory effect 
<P>

was a result of the stresses within the polypropylene tailstring deriving 
<P>

from the chemical conformation of polypropylene processed by drawing. 
<P>

Searle designed the packaging so that the tailstring looped above the 7 and 
<P>

then ran down along the outside of the inserter tube. Professor Robertson 
<P>

gave evidence as to the effect of the packaging of the tailstring. His 
<P>

evidence was that by using polypropylene and packaging the Cu-7 
<P>

with a loop in the tailstring, the result was that the tailstring was prone to

<P>

resume the shape it had within the packaging. The effect of this was that 
<P>

the tailstring after insertion of the device would have a tendency to 
<P>

withdraw into the uterus, playing a role in the introduction of infection 
<P>

(para 40, Statement dated 28 July 1995, Tab A, Exhibit P 136).
<P>

	Professor David Katz is a Professor in both the Department of 
<P>

Biomedical Engineering and in the Department of Obstetrics and 
<P>

Gynaecology at Duke University, North Carolina. He had previously held 
<P>

a position as a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the 
<P>

University of California, Davis.  He has expertise in polymer chemistry. 
<P>

His evidence was that one of polypropylene's characteristics was to have a 
<P>

memory, in the sense of a tendency to resume a position in which the 
<P>

material had previously been placed, and that this characteristic cannot be 
<P>

removed and cannot be predicted with certainty.
<P>

	It was submitted that the evidence of Professors Robertson and Katz 
<P>

should be accepted and a finding made that the memory characteristic of 
<P>

the polypropylene used in the Cu-7 tailstring caused the tailstring to have a

<P>

propensity to retract and that this characteristic existed to a markedly 
<P>

greater degree in Cu-7 tailstrings than in the polyethylene alternative which

<P>

Searle used on its Tatum-T and proposed to use on the Cu-7 and Mini. 
<P>

	The second dispute about retraction is whether it increased the risk 
<P>

of PID. 
<P>

	Dr O'Brien gave evidence that there was no study which concluded 
<P>

that string retraction played any role in the development of PID. His 
<P>

evidence was that the efforts made to resolve the tailstring retraction 
<P>

problem were made for marketing reasons (i.e. presumably that doctors 
<P>

were reluctant to insert a device that might cause problems) rather than out

<P>

of concerns about safety of users. 
<P>

	Denzin, Gentle, Lee and Ottaway suffered tailstring retractions. 
<P>

It is common ground between the parties that any instrumentation of the 
<P>

uterus increases the risk of contracting, or exacerbating, PID. Each of 
<P>

Denzin, Gentle, Lee and Ottaway required instrumentation of the 
<P>

uterus to remove her Cu-7 because the tailstring had retracted, although in 
<P>

Gentle's case this was associated with treatment of septic abortion.  It was

<P>

submitted that there is no real dispute that the tailstring retractions 
<P>

increased the risk of injury to the plaintiffs by requiring instrumentation.

<P>

	Professor Ellner gave evidence that it was obvious that retraction of 
<P>

the tailstring was a mechanism for contaminating the uterus with bacteria, 
<P>

causing infection.  Professors Eschenbach, Robertson and Katz gave 
<P>

evidence to the same effect.  In addition, the defendants' expert medical 
<P>

witness, Professor Fraser, confirmed that the retraction of the tailstring 
<P>

might introduce bacteria into the uterus and it would depend upon the type 
<P>

of bacteria and the health of the woman as to whether this would create an 
<P>

infectious process. 
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that:
<P>

(a)	the evidence of Professors Ellner, Robertson, Katz and Fraser as to the
direct contamination of the uterus by string retraction
combined with 
<P>

(b)	the Searle documents, 
<P>

(c)	the consensus as to the risk of instrumentation (necessitated by the
retraction in at least three of the lead cases)   and 
<P>

(d)	the concerns as to the potential of the frayed tailstring to pose a risk of
infection independently of fraying to support a
finding that the retraction of
the tailstring provided a means whereby bacteria could be carried from the
vagina into the uterus,
thereby increasing the risk of PID for users of the
Cu-7. 
<P>

<b><i>2.3	The design of the inserter of the Cu-7 had the string on
the</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	outside of the inserter tube </i></b>
<P>

As a result of this, the string trailed through the bacteria laden 
<P>

parts of the lower genital tract and trans-cervically introduced 
<P>

potential pathogens into the uterus.
<P>

In the case of each of the nine plaintiffs it was submitted that
<P>

two or more of the alleged defects increased the risk of injury:
<P>

1.	Denzin:		memory plus fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

2.	Gentle:		memory plus fraying (septic abortion 
<P>

case)
<P>

3.	Lane:			fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

4.	Lee:			memory plus fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

5.	Moylan:		fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

6.	Orders:		fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

	7.	Ottaway:		memory plus fraying plus inserter
<P>

	8.	Robertson:		fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

9.	Southren:		fraying plus inserter tube
<P>

			
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that the general matters which prove liability on the
part of the defendants are:
<P>

(a)	the use of the Cu-7 increased the risk of PID and its sequelae;
<P>

(b)	the defendants were aware of the epidemiological data which 
<P>

proved or provided compelling evidence that use of IUDs in general 
<P>

and of the Cu-7 in particular caused an increased risk;
<P>

(c)	the defendants knew or ought to have known that the design defects 
<P>

caused or were likely to cause an increased risk;
<P>

(d)	the defendants, notwithstanding their knowledge as set out in (b) 
<P>

and (c) above, negligently failed (i) to warn of the increased risk; 
<P>

and (ii) to remedy the defects;
<P>

(e)	the plaintiffs suffered injury, namely PID and its sequelae, and for 
<P>

Gentle a septic abortion, as a result of the defects and/or the 
<P>

increased risks;
<P>

(f)	the plaintiffs would not have suffered the injury had each been 
<P>

warned of the increased risks;
<P>

(g)	the plaintiffs were not warned of the increased risks.
<P>

	It was submitted that each of the three alleged design defects dealt with
above was a <u>material</u> contribution to the risk of injury and not <i>'de
minimis'</i> because:
<P>

1.	(i)	the defendants' own behaviour revealed its recognition that 	the problem
(ie the added risk) was not de minimis.
<P>

	(ii)	contemporary medical opinion: eg Dr Hatcher, Dr Tyrer of 	the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, the Food and 	Drug
Administration, the
Australian National Biological 	Standards Laboratory was of that view.
<P>

	(iii)	epidemiological data showed that users of Cu-7 were at an 	increased
risk of PID and its sequelae.
<P>

	(iv)	the foreign body effect potentiates and prolongs the risk of 	infection
from additional bacteria introduced because of 	design
defects.
<P>

2.	No alternative causes were proved by defendants.
<P>

The plaintiffs submitted that each of the three defects were negligently
incorporated in the design of the Cu7 by the defendants
and that  independently
and jointly they made a material contribution to the risk of injury to each
plaintiff.
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that each of the plaintiffs suffered tubal
<P>

 damage which is said to be explained by a prior episode of PID.
<P>

 Therefore it was said the task for the medical experts was to identify 
<P>

when the episode was most likely to have occurred, rather than whether it 
<P>

occurred.
<P>

	In the diagnosis of PID, the parties did not disagree as to the fact that 
<P>

the disease could present with severe symptoms ie classic PID, or with 
<P>

less obvious and fewer symptoms ie atypical or unrecognised PID.  
<P>

However on behalf of the plaintiffs Dr Sweet gave evidence that a doctor 
<P>

could identify the signs and symptoms of PID in a woman who had 
<P>

suffered an unrecognised attack if a careful history was subsequently 
<P>

obtained from her. 
<P>

	In the case of each plaintiff, it is impossible to identify the pathogen 
<P>

which caused the PID suffered by the plaintiffs.
<P>

	
<P>

	The defendants attempted in all cases except Mrs Denzin to prove 
<P>

that it must have been a sexually transmitted disease (STD), not an IUD,
<P>

 which caused any episode of PID suffered by the plaintiffs.
<P>

	
<P>

	However the plaintiffs submitted that because the IUD plays an 
<P>

independent and additive role in the presence of infection it is irrelevant
<P>

to enquire whether the pathogen causing the PID was an STD or non-STD 
<P>

micro organism.
<P>

	
<P>

	They also submitted that the attempts by the defendants to establish 
<P>

the occurrence of STD failed because:
<P>

(i)	no identification of an STD pathogen causative of PID was ever made;
<P>

(ii)	the only STD micro-organisms ever identified were <i>"innocent"</i> in the
sense that they were not causative of PID eg genital warts or trichomonads;
<P>

(iii)	it was never argued that if a woman had evidence of an <i>"innocent"</i>
STD micro-organism she must have also had a <i>"pathogenic"</i> STD capable of
causing PID viz. Neisseria gonorrhoea or Chlamydia trachomatis;
<P>

(iv)	the defendants' experts never committed themselves to an opinion that a
plaintiff's history and records prior to using a Cu-7
proved an attack of PID;

<P>

(v)	any signs or symptoms of PID identified in association with the
hypothetical STD were much less persuasive of PID than the signs
and symptoms
in association with the use of the Cu-7.
<P>

	The defendants also sought to implicate other occasions in the 
<P>

histories of the individual plaintiffs as establishing an alternative to the

<P>

IUD as the cause of PID.  These included appendectomies, termination of 
<P>

pregnancy, hysterosalpingogram and post-partum infection.  
<P>

	The plaintiffs' experts were of the view that in each case the PID 
<P>

occurred during IUD use and not at any other time alleged by the 
<P>

defendants' experts.  
<P>

		The plaintiffs' case also included the proposition that the IUDs 
<P>

materially contributed to the PID by reason of their effect on the body's 
<P>

immune system.
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that the opinions of the plaintiffs' medical experts
as to the occurrence of PID during Cu-7 use (Gravigard
and Mini-Gravigard) and
the role of the IUD in causing the PID should be preferred to those of the
defendants' medical experts who
were, it was submitted,  not able to offer any
convincing alternative explanation for the PID suffered by the plaintiffs.  It
was
also submitted that the expert opinions of the plaintiffs' medical
witnesses as to the causal role of the Cu-7 in PID were consistent
with and
supported by the epidemiological data, the medical principles relating to
infections and the foreign body effect, and their
own clinical experience.

<P>


<P>

<b>1.  <u>The Female Reproductive System</u></b>
<P>

The female reproductive system above the vagina consists of:
<P>

<b>1.1	The Uterus</b>
<P>

	The uterus is a hollow muscular organ in which the fertilised ovum normally
becomes embedded and in which the developing embryo
and foetus is nourished.
<P>

	It has a mucous membrane lining known as the endometrium.
<P>

	Its cavity opens into the vagina below and above into two Fallopian Tubes, one
on either side of the uterus.
<P>

	At the lower portion of the uterus there is a constricted portion known as the
isthmus leading to the cervical canal which is the
narrow lower end of the
uterus between the isthmus and the opening of the cervix into the vagina.  The
opening of the cervix into
the vagina is known as the cervical os.
<P>

<b>1.2	Fallopian Tubes</b>
<P>

	There are two fallopian tubes, one on each side of the uterus.  They extend
laterally from the uterus and terminate in the peritoneal
cavity near each
ovary.  They serve to convey the ovum from the ovary to the uterus and
spermatozoa from the uterus toward the ovary.
 In the event that an ovum is
fertilised by spermatozoa the fertilized ovum is conveyed, in normal cases, to
the uterus where it
is embedded in the endometrium.
<P>

<b>1.3	Ovaries</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>There are two Ovaries, one on each side of the body near the ends of
the fallopian tubes.
<P>

	The ovaries are glands which produce the reproductive cells, the ovum, which
pass into the fallopian tubes and then to the uterus.
<P>

<b>2. <u> PID - Definition</u></b>
<P>

The term "<i>pelvic inflammatory disease</i>" is used to describe infections of
various parts of the upper reproductive organs covering:
<P>

1.	endometritis - an infection to the endometrium (the lining of the 
<P>

uterus).  In the course of his evidence Eschenbach said that most patients with
pelvic inflammatory disease have endometritis, because
the infection "<i>starts
in the lower genital tract and the lower parts of the uterus and moves up the
uterus and into the fallopian tubes and out.
 So most individuals who have
pelvic inflammatory disease would also have endometritis.</i>"
(T1664/L25-L30).
<P>

2.	salpingitis - an infection of the fallopian tubes;
<P>

3.	oophoritis - an infection of the surface of the ovaries;
<P>

4.	pelvic peritonitis - in diffuse cases all of the above may be infected 
<P>

together with the pelvic peritoneum.
<P>

	PID may be:
<P>

1.	Acute
<P>

2.	Chronic
<P>

3.	Silent
<P>

	On gynaecological examination tubal scarring or blockage is found and this
leads to a retrospective diagnosis of silent PID.
<P>

<b>3.	The cause of PID</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>The cause of the infections known as PID is usually pathogens which
ascend from the vagina to the cervix and then through the cervix
into the
endometrial cavity where they break the lining of the uterus and group in
sufficient numbers to produce an infection.  That
infection can then move into
the fallopiana tubes and to the ovaries, and possibly the abdominal cavity
(Eschenbach, Ex. 108 Tab
1, para 12).
<P>

	Eschenbach and Newton's view was that there are two major groups of organisms
which, when found in the uterine cavity have been
found to lead to PID:
<P>

	(a)	exogenous organisms including STD organisms, in particular 
<P>

		gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis; and
<P>

	(b)	endogenous bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria which 
<P>

		are commonly isolated from the vagina and /or vulva and 
<P>

		perineum of healthy women.
<P>

	Gonorrhoea and Chlamydia are most commonly, although not exclusively,
transmitted to the women's body through sexual contact 
<P>

(Ex. 108 Tab 1, para 14).
<P>

	The presence of gonorrhoea and chlamydial infections in the vagina or cervix
may cause localised infections but they will only
have serious complications
related to a woman's fertility if they are introduced into the upper
reproductive tract (Ex.108 Tab 1,
para 17).  They do not automatically ascend
to the uterus and are often prevented by the barrier of the cervix and the
body's defence
mechanisms.
<P>

	Sweet said that in the absence of a factor such as an IUD, cervical gonorrhoea
or chlamydia will cause PID in approximately 10%
to 20% of cases (T3070/L38
para 24 as corrected in memorandum of 28 April 1996. Tab 1).  Similarly, the
vaginal bacteria do not usually
ascend into the uterus unless aided in some way
(para 25).
<P>

	Sweet said that approximately 65% of women with PID have chlamydia and/or
gonorrhoea, and of these about half  also displayed evidence
of infection with
aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria (Par.26).  Approximately 30% of women with
PID have only aerobic and/or anaerobic
bacteria present. (para 26).
<P>

	Polymicrobial bacteria exist naturally within the vagina, most commonly
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria including streptococci,
lactobacillus, e. coli,
gardnerella, vaginalis, peptostrepococci and acteroides (Ex. 108 Tab 1, para
15).  These bacteria are harmless
when they form part of the vaginal flora, but
if they are introduced into the upper genital tract they can be pathogenic
(i.e.  they
can cause disease) 
<P>

(Ex. 108 Tab 1, para 16).
<P>

By the 1970s it had become evident, following the widespread development of
anaerobic bacteriology, that multiple organisms were
often isolated from
infected sites, particularly from intra-abdominal abscesses.  Polymicrobial
infections, consisting of both aerobic
and anaerobic bacteria, were commonly
identified among women with pelvic inflammatory disease and vaginitis (Ex. P108
Tab 1, para
142).
<P>

	In 1984 Dr Eschenbach presented a paper <i>"Acute pelvic inflammatory disease"
</i>at a symposium on sexually transmitted diseases in which he said:  (Ex.
P108. Tab.12).
<P>

	<i>"Primary pelvic inflammatory disease is usually an acute infection</i>
<P>

<i>in which organisms ascend into the uterus and fallopian tubes from the
cervix.  Chronic active infections are unusual except in neglected
cases and in
actonomyces infection.  However, sterile chronic inflammatory adhesions are
common residuals of an acute infection."
 </i>(Tab 12, pp 65-66).
<P>

	As well as sexually transmitted organisms, Dr Eschenbach said that
non-sexually transmitted bacteria can also cause pelvic inflammatory
disease:
<P>

	<i>"Sexually transmitted organisms, most noticeably Neisseria</i>
<P>

<i>gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis, and genital mycoplasmas, are recovered
from the majority of women who develop pelvic inflammatory
disease.  However,
non-sexually transmitted aerobic and anaerobic endogenous cervicovaginal
bacteria also cause pelvic inflammatory
disease in a significant number of
incidences.  The rate with which these micro-organisms have been isolated with
pelvic inflammatory
disease differs widely in various studies, probably because
of the differences between the various populations studies and differences
in
infection."  </i>(Tab 12 p 67 right hand column, paragraph headed `Microbial
Etiology').
<P>

The complexity of the infectious position is such that it is possible
<P>

to:
<P>

1.	have a sexually transmitted disease in the vagina 
<P>

e.g.  gonorrhoea, and not have PID;
<P>

	2.	have a sexually transmitted disease eg gonorrhea, and have 
<P>

PID;
<P>

3.	not have a sexually transmitted disease and not have PID;
<P>

4.	not have a sexually transmitted disease and have PID.
<P>

	By 1982, when Eschenbach published "<i>New concepts of obstetric and
gynaecological infection</i>" (Ex.P108, Tab 11) research had established that
polymicrobial infections of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria had been detected in
20% to 60% of women with PID in the United States (he cited Eschenbach 1975;
Sweet <i>et al.</i> 1979 and Monif <i>et al.</i> 1976).  Eschenbach
concluded:
<P>

"<i>Although it had become clear that PID is sexually transmitted including by
N. gonorrhoea and by C. trachomatis, it is also non-sexually
transmitted by
polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic bacteria</i>" (Tab 1,
Par.145).
<P>

	Eschenbach said that N. gonorrhoea and C. trachomatis could be found in
anywhere between 50% and 60% of PID cases (T166/L7).  However,
the actual
proportion is very "population dependant" and may be as low as 30% (T1668/L29).
In Eschenbach's opinion, he would include
in the top category of pathogens
causing PID, gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, and commensals such as E. coli and
anaerobic bacteria (T1683/L9).
<P>

	Fraser, in para 79 of his first witness statement said that:
<P>

	<i>"Using careful investigations, specific sexually transmissible</i>
<P>

<i>	infection is identifiable in 60% to 80% of cases."</i>
<P>

<b>The body's defence mechanism</b>
<P>

	Dr Eschenbach said in his first witness statement that the inoculum (i.e.  the
number of bacteria required to cause infection to
a particular organ) varies
and depends upon the woman's immunity and other factors (Tab.1 Par. 18;),
(T1690/L10-L35).
<P>

	Among the other factors to which he referred is the effect of a foreign body
(in this case an intrauterine device) inserted in
the uterus.  Dr Eschenbach
said (second witness statement, Tab  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=17%20Public%20Administration%20Review%202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">17. Par. 2)</a> that the immune system within
the uterus and within other organs is similar for non-pregnant women.  The
effect of inserting a foreign
body in the uterus will be similar to inserting a
foreign body elsewhere.  <i>"The hypothesis of the uterus as an
immunologically-privileged organ only exists during pregnancy, and then, only
for a small portion
of the intra-uterine contents, the foetal - decidual
interface"</i> (Tab.17. Par. 2).  It was said that the presence of the IUD
modifies the body's normal defence mechanisms, leading in some instances
to
pelvic infection.  Eschenbach reported in March 1976 (Ex. P108. Tab. 5)
<i>"Acute pelvic inflammatory disease:  aetiology, risk factors and
pathogenesis" </i> (NEJM pp.147-169) that the intrauterine device was a risk
factor for pelvic inflammatory disease, a major public health problem and
that
prospective studies of the magnitude of the problem were long overdue (Tab. 5.
p.166 at 2).  Dr Eschenbach said in that article:
<P>

	<i>"The role of the IUD in the pathogenesis of PID may be similar</i>
<P>

<i>to that of a foreign body in the presence of bacteria elsewhere in human
tissue:  it allows colonisation of bacteria on its surface,
reducing the
effectiveness of normal defence mechanisms.  The concentration of anti-body,
phagocytes, and other components of the
defence mechanism surrounding an IUD is
unknown but possibly is inadequate to prevent bacterial colonisation from
resulting in infection.
 Perhaps well-vascularised tissues, without the
presence of a foreign body, are more likely to possess defences capable of
preventing
infection."  </i>(Tab. 1 Par.66).
<P>

	It was said that the presence of the intrauterine device, being a foreign body
also lowers the inoculum or the amount of bacteria
that may be needed to cause
an infection.  (Tab. 1 Par.21).
<P>

	Dr Eschenbach described a number of ways in which the presence of a Copper 7
adversely affects a woman's defence mechanisms:
<P>

	1.	the string of the Copper 7 acts as a bridge for bacteria which
<P>

attach to the string and produce a biofilm which protects them from the body's
defence mechanism; the biofilm prevents the white
cells from destroying the
bacteria; and the bacteria can also transfer along the string from the vagina
into the uterus.  (Tab  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Public%20Administration%20Review%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1. Par. 22(i)).</a>  Elstein had shown in 1967 greater
evidence of signs and symptoms suggestive of PID in women using an IUD with a
tail.  (Ex. D113,
first Par.).  Dr Eschenbach said with regard to bacterial
motility, that bacteria had a capability of using the contiguous spread
mechanism as well as the walls of the uterus to ascend to the tubes.
(T1997/L5.).
<P>

2.	the arm of the Copper 7 or its projection can embed in the
<P>

lining of the uterus giving bacteria access to the basal layers of tissue,
creating a more resistant and difficult infection to
treat.  (Tab  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Public%20Administration%20Review%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1. Par.
22(ii)).</a>
<P>

3.	the Copper 7 by increasing the amount of bleeding 
<P>

experienced by the women during and or between menstruation provides nutrients
for bacteria to grow within the uterus  (Tab.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Public%20Administration%20Review%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1. Par. 22(iii)).</a>
<P>

4.	the Copper 7 affects the uterine environment by lowering the
<P>

oxygen and permitting preferential growth of anaerobic bacteria, thus
increasing the likelihood of uterine infection  (Tab.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Public%20Administration%20Review%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1. Par. 22(iv)</a>;
T1907/L45-L55; see also T1984/L5-L20).
<P>

5.	the device affects the natural barriers in the woman's
<P>

reproductive system designed to protect the uterus from infection namely the
cervix, cervical mucous and epithelial lining; because
of the string, the body
has no barrier to infection being transmitted between the uterus and the
fallopian tubes  (Tab 1, Par.23).
<P>

6.	the retraction of the string associated with the Copper 7
<P>

provides another mechanism by which pathogens within the vagina can be
transferred to the uterus and cause infection  (Tab. 1. Par.24).
<P>

	It was submitted by the plaintiffs that HSG studies reported by Elstein in
1969 (Ex.D113) established an increased incidence of
tubal damage and occlusion
in women with signs and symptoms of PID which occurred in association with the
use of an IUD with a tail
 (p.279, second last Par.).
<P>

<b>Effects of PID</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>PID can cause tubal damage leading to a greater risk of impaired
fertility, infertility and ectopic pregnancy.
<P>

	PID often takes the form of salpingitis which causes damage to the fallopian
tubes in a number of ways:  
<P>

1.	Inflammation or obstruction of the fallopian tube may prevent the egg 	and
the sperm from meeting.  
<P>

2.	The cilia or finger-like projections within the fallopian tube and the
secretory cells within the tubes may be damaged, such
that the ability 	of the
tubes to keep the egg alive and move the egg and sperm together 	is destroyed.

<P>

3.	Adhesions between the tubes and ovaries may be created such that the
fallopian tubes cannot move over the ovary during the menstrual
cycle 	to pick
up the egg and move it along. 
<P>

	Eight per cent of patients who experience infections to the fallopian tube are
rendered infertile.  85%-90% of women who develop
tubo-ovarian abscesses are
rendered infertile (Dr Eschenbach, Ex P108, Tab 1, Paras 27 &amp; 28).
<P>

	There is also the possibility of suffering tubo-ovarian abscesses.
<P>

	
<P>

	Dr Eschenbach said that the most serious form of pelvic inflammatory disease
is tubo-ovarian abscesses which are very difficult
to treat because the body
<i>"walls off the abscess through production of collagen walls, particularly
where anaerobic bacteria have been the cause of the abscesses.
 Given that the
collagen walls have no blood vessels within, it is difficult to get the
antibiotics to the abscess."</i> (Tab.1 Par.33).  Tubo-ovarian abscesses are
typically polymicrobial: that is <i>"they are normally produced by infections
relating to the bacteria found within the vagina, most normally bacteroides and
peptostreptococci.
 As such, they are not normally associated with STD PID
alone, but instead are more commonly associated with the ascension of vaginal
bacteria through external means such as through the introduction of an
IUD</i>."<i> </i>(Tab.1 Par.33, 34).
<P>

	Ectopic pregnancies are a further risk.  Infections in the fallopian tubes
create holes or craters in the tubal area which provide
traps for the
fertilised egg, or the egg alone, so that the risk of ectopic pregnancies is
increased.  The seriousness of the health
risk from ectopic pregnancy is not in
dispute.  As Dr Eschenbach said: <i>"The real danger is the rupturing of the
ectopic pregnancy which causes great haemorrhaging and can lead to a woman's
death."</i> 
<P>

(Ex. P108. Tab 1, paras 29 &amp; 30).
<P>

	Dr Keeping also gave evidence to the effect that PID created an increased rate
of ectopic pregnancy (T 6387/L51 - T6388/L12) as
did Professor Newton (Ex.
D299, para 87). 
<P>

	Chronic pain is experienced by approximately 20% of women after contracting
pelvic inflammatory disease.
<P>

	Dr Eschenbach summarised the consequences of PID (chronic pain, subsequent
episodes  of  PID, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy)
 (Ex. P108 Tab 11,
p2041) as follows:

<b>Diagnosis of PID</b>
<P>

	PID may be categorised as:
<P>

1. 		Acute PID
<P>

	This presents with classic symptoms which are usually quite severe.
<P>

Pelvic inflammatory disease may manifest itself by <i>"classic symptoms"</i>
evidenced by inflammation or infection which is accompanied by abdominal
tenderness, cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness,
but it may also
occur without these symptoms. The classic full-blown syndrome of PID includes
fever, elevated white count, cervical
motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness.
<P>

2.	Atypical PID
<P>

	This may be:
<P>

2.1 	subacute;  or
<P>

2.2 	chronic
<P>

	Each of these subcategories presents with lesser signs and symptoms.
<P>

They are usually characterised by inter-menstrual bleeding and pain.  It is
often termed '<i>asymptomatic</i>' though it is probably more accurately a case
of '<i>unrecognised</i>' pelvic inflammatory disease. 
<P>

	Atypical PID has also been called "silent" PID.  This suggests that 
<P>

there are no recognisable symptoms, but Dr Sweet gave evidence to the effect
that a survey of histories of patients with "silent"
PID would reveal episodes
from which a retrospective identification of the presence of PID can be made (T
3055/L33-35, Ex. P247,
p3163).
<P>

	The damage which might be suffered by a woman who suffers from 
<P>

atypical PID may not be any less than that suffered by a woman with acute PID,
including severe tubal damage (Dr Keeping, T6153/L10;
 Dr Sweet, 
<P>

T 3054-7).
<P>

	
<P>

	Dr Sweet said that a person can have acute pelvic inflammatory disease that is
unrecognised and <i>"we are beginning to understand that probably the majority
of pelvic inflammatory disease is actually of the unrecognised or atypical
which physicians have not been attuned to addressing.  It is very similar to
the point I tried to make to the FDA back in 1977, that
we needed to be aware
that these patients with abnormal bleeding, with pain who did not have fever
did indeed have pelvic inflammatory
disease." </i>
<P>

(T3054/L49-T3055/L2).  
<P>

	PID may be acute, involving infection of the fallopian tubes, but not
manifested by significant severe pain or fever, presenting
as Dr Sweet said a
more subtle picture (T3055/L15-L20).
<P>

	In the case of atypical PID, a woman may not even elicit tenderness on
bimanual examination: 
<P>

		<i>"That can happen, we now recognise that women may have </i>
<P>

<i>		endometritis and have low grade infection, may have some </i>
<P>

<i>		bleeding, spotting, pain, but may not actually have the </i>
<P>

<i>		tenderness."</i> (T3066/L10).  
<P>

	In the case of unrecognised PID, Dr Sweet said that the doctor typically sees
things such as <i>"abnormal bleeding, complaints of abdominal or pelvic
discomfort, you may get discharge, maybe discomfort with sexual intercourse,
those types of things" </i>(T3066/L35).
<P>

	The degree of bleeding may be heavy which the patient would notice, or simply
something that the doctor might notice at the time
of a speculum examination
(T3067/L24) or it may simply be spotting which may not occur on the days the
patient sees the doctor (T3067/L29).
 The pelvic discomfort may be cramps or
aches, commonly symptoms reported by menstruating women (T3068/L39), but the
patients usually
know the pattern of their own menstruation established over
time and are aware of differences (T3069/L5).  
<P>

	
<P>

	In the case of vaginal discharge, particularly with bacterial vaginosis, 40%
of those women <i>"have histologic and microbiologic evidence of
endometritis"</i> with bacterial vaginosis being present (T3069/L30).  The
presence of dyspareunia is something which the patient may describe.
(T3070/L5).<i> </i>
<P>

	Dr Sweet said that the studies by Wolner-Hanssen showed that<i>"....If you
went back and took a careful history from the women, asked questions about
pain, discomfort, that the overwhelming majority
of women had had those types
of symptoms that had not been diagnosed as PID because physicians were relying
on the classis criterion.
 When you questioned the patients closely they could
have symptoms, that is why its has moved to be unrecognised or atypical"</i>
(T3055/L40-L45) 
<P>

	Dr Sweet said that the mild clinical PID can have the same outcome for the
patient as full-blown PID (T3057/L55).
<P>

	A question to be determined in each of the nine cases is whether the
plaintiffs suffered PID in association with Cu-7 use.  The
plaintiffs submitted
that in eight of the cases (Denzin, Lane, Lee, Moylan, Orders, Ottaway,
Robertson and Southren) the existence
of PID has been confirmed by objective
tests so that the task of the expert witnesses was to identify whether or not
there were signs
or symptoms of PID in association with Cu-7 use.
<P>

	They submit that the presence of tubal damage in the absence of any
alternative cause supports the finding that it was caused by
PID.
<P>

<center><b><u>3.   CAUSATION</u></b></center>
<P>

	The evidence established that women who have not used the 
<P>

Cu-7 device both do and do not contract PID and that women who do use the Cu-7
device both do and do not contract PID.
<P>

	Thus if a woman uses a Cu-7 and contracts PID the question to be determined is
whether the Cu-7 was causative of the PID in the
particular case.
<P>

	The plaintiffs stated the legal principle upon which their case is based as
follows (in the Summary of Plaintiffs' Case  B.1.):
<P>

"The defendant is liable for negligent defects which result in injury  where
those defects materially increase the risk of injury,
i.e. other than de
minimis, unless the defendant proves that the injury was in fact caused by some
other cause unrelated to its negligent
act."
<P>

	This statement appears to me to beg the question and should be stated properly
to reflect their position as follows:
<P>

"The defendant is liable for injury to the plaintiffs where there are negligent
defects which materially increase the risk of injury,
i.e. other than de
minimus, unless the defendant proves that the injury was in fact caused by some
other cause unrelated to its negligent
act."
<P>

	Their proposition was stated orally by their counsel at 
<P>

T.7435-6:
<P>

"If you use a Copper 7, you are more likely to get PID than if you don't, and
that is our client's case.  That is to say, applying
the reasoning, for
example, in <b><u>Bonnington Castings </u></b> and in <b><u>McLean</u></b> if
there is negligence on the part of the defendant that places the woman at an
increased risk of contracting PID, then if the injury
is suffered, that will be
sufficient to establish legal causation.
<P>

......it is always open to the defendant to attempt to prove that irrespective
of the increased risk of using the IUD, the injury
was suffered because of some
other entirely different event.  For instance, if there was a case of a
ruptured appendix as a young
woman and if it was shown of course that damage
was suffered and caused by a ruptured appendix....the plaintiff cannot succeed
because
the injury would have been suffered irrespective of the IUD...
<P>

If the defendant wants to prove an alternative cause, then it must do so
according to the laws of proof.  It must satisfy the Court
that there is
another cause...."
<P>

	The first proposition that if you use a Copper 7 "<i>you are more</i>
<i>likely to get PID than if you don't</i>" is a factual question to which I
shall come later.
<P>

	The next proposition is that if the first proposition is established and the
woman has suffered PID, that in itself (subject to
the third proposition) is
enough to establish causation in the legal sense.
<P>

	The third proposition was that it is open to the defendant to attempt to prove
that irrespective of the increased risk of using
the IUD, the injury was
suffered because of some other entirely different event.
<P>

	In <b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20AC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) AC 613</a> an employee
was exposed to silica dust by his employer from two sources.  One source of
exposure did not render the employer legally
liable but the other source
did.
<P>

	Lord Reid said (p.622):
<P>

"I think that the position can be shortly stated in this way.  It may be that,
of the noxious dust in the general atmosphere of
the shop, more came from the
pneumatic hammers than from the swing grinders, but I think it is sufficiently
proved that the dust
from the grinders made a substantial contribution.  The
respondent, however, did not only inhale the general atmosphere of the shop;
when he was working his hammer his face was directly over it and it must often
have happened that dust from his hammer substantially
increased the
concentration of noxious dust in the air which he inhaled.  It is therefore
probable that much the greater proportion
of the noxious dust which he inhaled
over the whole period came from the hammers.  But, on the other hand, some
certainly came from
the swing grinders, and I cannot avoid the conclusion that
the proportion which came from the swing grinders was not negligible.
 He was
inhaling the general atmosphere all the time, and there is no evidence to show
that his hammer gave off noxious dust so frequently
or that the concentration
of noxious dust above it when it was producing dust was so much greater than
the concentration in the general
atmosphere, that that special concentration of
dust could be said to be substantially the sole cause of his disease."
<P>

	At p.623 his Lordship said:
<P>

"No doubt the total amount from both sources in the atmosphere was small at any
one time, but the combined effect over a period
of eight years was to cause the
respondent's disease.  The importance of evidence of the fellow-workmen is that
it shows that the
visible dust and therefore also the invisible dust from the
swing grinders was not immediately dispersed, and therefore that the
respondent
was bound to inhale some of the invisible noxious dust from the swing grinders.
On this matter Lord Carmont said:  "Even
if the majority of the pursuer's
inhalations took place near the source where the silica dust was produced,
i.e., at his hammer,
a minority of inhalations from the general atmosphere of
the shop needlessly contaminated owing to the breakdown of the extracting
hood,
duct and fan at the swing grinders may well have contributed a quota of silica
dust to the pursuer's lungs and so helped to
produce the disease."  On his view
of the onus of proof Lord Carmont did not require to go farther than that.  In
my opinion, it
is proved not only that the swing grinders may well have
contributed but that they did in fact contribute a quota of silica dust
which
was not negligible to the pursuer's lungs and therefore did help to produce the
disease.  That is sufficient to establish liability
against the appellants, and
I am therefore of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed."
<P>

	This decision turned on a factual finding that the exposure of the employee to
silica dust negligently by his employer did in fact
materially contribute to
the onset of the disease from which he suffered.
<P>

	The plaintiffs accepted that the onus of proving that the defendant's
negligent conduct caused the plaintiffs' injury remains on
them but submitted
that the onus is discharged by proving exposure to increased risk that could
materially contribute to the injury.
 
<P>

	They submitted that establishing increased exposure to risk caused by the
negligence of the defendant prima facie establishes causation
 (T.7438).
<P>

	The determination of causation is governed by <b><u>March v E &amp; MH
Stramare PtyLtd</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506.</a>  It is essentially a question of
fact to be answered by reference to commonsense and experience and one into
which considerations
of policy and value judgments necessarily enter.
<P>

	The plaintiffs referred to authorities cited by Mason CJ at page 514 of
<b><u>Stramare</u></b> in support of the statement:
<P>

"Nonetheless, the law's recognition that concurrent or successive tortious acts
may each amount to a cause of the injuries sustained
by a plaintiff is
reflected in the proposition that it is for the plaintiff to establish his or
her injuries are `<i>caused or materially contributed to</i>' by the
defendant's wrongful conduct."
<P>

	Those authorities were:
<P>

	1.	<b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20AC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) AC 613.</a>
<P>

	2.	<b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b> (1973) 1 WLR1.
<P>

	In <b>McGhee</b>, Lord Reid referred to <b>Bonnington Castings</b>.  He 	said
at p.4D:
<P>

"It has always been the law that a pursuer succeeds if he can show that fault
of the defendant caused or materially contributed
to his injury.  There may
have been two separate causes but it is enough if one of the causes arose from
fault of the defendant.
 The pursuer does not have to prove that this cause
would of itself have been enough to cause his injury.  That is well illustrated
by decision of this House in <b>Bonnington Castings</b>...."
<P>

	The medical evidence in that case could not explain why it was that the
employee's cycling home caked in grime and sweat had added
to the risk that the
disease might develop.  Lord Reid said:
<P>

"It does not and could not explain why this is so.  But experience shows that
it is so.  Plainly that must be because what happens
while the man remains
unwashed can have a causative effect, though just how the cause operates is
uncertain....  From a broad and
practical viewpoint I can see no substantial
difference between saying what the defendant did materially increased the risk
of injury
to the pursuer and saying that what the defendant did made a material
contribution to his injury."
<P>

3.	<b><u>Duyvelsheff v Cathcart &amp; Ritchie Ltd </u></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2047%20ALJR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 47 ALJR 410.</a>
At 417 Gibbs J said:
<P>

"The plaintiff had to prove that the defendant's breach of duty caused or
materially contributed to the injury.  It was sufficient
where there was a
breach and an injury of the kind that might thereby be caused to justify the
drawing of an inference, in the absence
of any sufficient reason to the
contrary, that in fact the injury did occur because of the breach."
<P>

	4.	<b><u>Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2050%20ALJR%20720" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 50 	ALJR
720.</a>
<P>

Mason J said (p.724E) that where the issue of causation is not within the realm
of common knowledge and experience and "<i>fails to be determined by reference
to expert medical evidence</i>"<i>, </i>if the expert evidence provided a
sufficient basis for the inference that on the probabilities a particular act
or event caused or
materially contributed to the occurrence of the medical
condition, then liability is established.
<P>

	It was submitted that the following conclusions arise from these
authorities:
<P>

	1.	Where medical evidence does not explain a causative effect,
<P>

	nevertheless such an effect will be found where clinical 	experience or
observation confirms the causal link.
<P>

2.	Where the injury may be caused by more than one factor, if 	the defendant's
conduct materially contributed to the injury in 
the sense that it is not de
minimis, then the defendant will be 	liable.
<P>

3.	Conduct of the defendant which materially increased the risk 	of injury will
be found to have materially contributed to the 
injury.
<P>

	The plaintiffs also relied on <b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 389.</a>
<P>

	The plaintiff in that case suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and, as a
result, over the next thirty years and more he drank
alcohol and smoked
tobacco, both to excess, which caused him to develop throat cancer.
<P>

	Handley JA and Beazley JA referred inter alia to <b><u>Bonnington Castings
Limited</u></b> and <b><u>McGhee</u></b> and said (p.409A):
<P>

"These cases decide that where medical science does not permit a clear answer,
the court can find that a disease was caused by a
breach of duty which
materially increased the risk of contracting it:  see also <b><u>Duyvelshaff v
Cathcart &amp; Ritchie Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2047%20ALJR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 47 ALJR 410</a> at 417, per Gibbs J."
<P>

	Their Honours then referred to <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health
Authority</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%201074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC 1074.</a>  This was a medical negligence case where
there were five possible causes of the blindness suffered by the plaintiff only
one of
which arose from the negligence of the defendant.  The English Court of
Appeal followed <b>McGhee</b> and the plaintiff was successful.
<P>

	In the House of Lords, Lord Bridge said that in <b>McGhee</b> the House had
done no more than adopt a robust and pragmatic approach to the drawing of an
inference of causation, but the decision
did not assist a plaintiff where there
were four other possible causes.
<P>

	Causation is a question of fact to be resolved as a matter of commonsense.
Their Honours said  (p.410B):
<P>

"Some of the plaintiff's consumption was not caused by the tort because the
`<i>but for'</i> test was not satisfied.  However on the jury's findings a
significant part of his total consumption would not have occurred <i>`but for'
</i>the tort seems to us that the rule in <b><u>Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw
</u></b>and the related cases applies and that the nature of the duty and the
chain of causation under consideration were not fundamental
to those decisions.
They supply a principle for deciding responsibility where injury results from a
noxious substance situation where
only some of the exposure was caused by the
tort.
<P>

Those cases do not stand alone.  A tribunal of fact is entitled to find
causation as a matter of commonsense from the sequence of
events, although
medical science does not support an affirmative answer, provided it does not
exclude such a finding:  see <b><u>Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2064%20CLR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 64 CLR 535</a> at 563-564, 569 and <b><u>Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v
Fernandez</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2050%20ALR%20720" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 50 ALR 720.</a>
<P>

The principle established in <b><u>Purkess v Crittenden</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1965/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20114%20CLR%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 114 CLR
164</a> is also relevant.  The majority there said (at 168):
<P>

"....where a plaintiff has....made out a prima facie case that incapacity has
resulted from the defendant's negligence, the onus
of adducing evidence that
his incapacity is wholly or partly the result of some pre-existing condition or
that incapacity, either
total or partial, would, in any event, have resulted
from a pre-existing condition, rests upon the defendant."
<P>

The plaintiff's pre-collision smoking and drinking habits were not literally a
`<i>pre-existing condition'.  </i>However the defendant's case that the throat
cancer would `<i>in any event' </i>have resulted from those habits is
equivalent to the situations referred to in this passage.  The later reasoning
of the majority
(at 168) therefore applies:
<P>

"...it is not enough for the defendant merely to suggest the existence of a
progressive pre-existing condition in the plaintiff
or a relationship between
any such condition and the plaintiff's present incapacity.  On the
contrary...both the pre-existing condition
and its future probable effects or
its actual relationship to that incapacity must be the subject of evidence
which, if accepted,
would establish with some reasonable measure of precision
what the pre-existing condition was and what its future effects both as
to
their nature and their future development and progress, were likely to be.
That being done, it is for the plaintiff upon the whole
of the evidence to
satisfy the tribunal of fact of the extent of the injury caused by the
defendant's negligence."
<P>

The defendant's evidence did not satisfy these tests.  The defendant did no
more than `<i>suggest'</i> that the plaintiff's consumption of alcohol and
tobacco, without any increase due to the tort, could have caused the cancer in
any
event.  In our judgment the direction to the jury that they were entitled
to award damages for the cancer if they found that the
increase in consumption
caused by the tort was significant was correct.
<P>

The issue was causation in fact of an actual event, and not causation of an
hypothetical event where the court allows for the probability
that the event
would or would not have occurred:  see <b><u>Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638.</a>  Causation in fact of an actual event is an all or nothing
issue.  The plaintiff was not entitled to recover anything for his throat
cancer unless he established, on the balance of probabilities, that it had been
caused by the tort.  Once the plaintiff succeeded
on that issue the defendant
was not entitled to any deduction for the chance that the plaintiff might have
contracted throat cancer
in any event:  see <b><u>Hotson v East Berkshire
Health Authority</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20AC%20750" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) AC 750</a> at 783."
<P>

	The question was again dealt with by the Court of Appeal (Mason P, Beazley JA
and Stein JA) in <b><u>Bendix-Mintex Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barnes</u> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997)
42 NSWLR 307.</a>
<P>

	The learned President said (p.311D):
<P>

"It is sufficient for a plaintiff to establish that his or her injuries were
"<i>caused or materially contributed to" </i>by the defendant's wrongful
conduct:  <b><u>March v E &amp; MH Stramare Pty Ltd </u></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506</a>
at 514.  The basal principle does not change when the plaintiff sues more than
one defendant.  The test must be satisfied as against
each defendant from whom
the plaintiff seeks a verdict before such a verdict will be entered.  Hope JA
summed-up the principle in
<b><u>Kilgannon v Sharpe Bros Pty Ltd </u></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20NSWLR%20600" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)

were negligent; it is not
enough that he can say that one of them must have been and all of them may have
been negligent."
<P>

The law might, and in some jurisdictions does, distinguish between proof of
unreasonable want of care and causation of damage. 
But it does not do so in
Australia, on my understanding.  While the law is prepared to adopt "<i>a
robust and </i>pragmatic<i> approach" </i><b><u>(Wilsher v Essex Area Health
Authority)</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] UKHL 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20AC%201074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) AC 1074</a> at 1090, per Lord (Bridge) to proof of
causation in fact, the principles I have referred to extend to proof of damage
as I shall
endeavour to demonstrate.
<P>

In this sense, where only one of two events could have caused or materially
contributed to an injury, there is no difference in
principle between a
plaintiff who is in doubt as to which of several defendants is liable and a
plaintiff who is in doubt as to which
event (one innocent, the other negligent)
touching a single defendant was the cause of compensable injury."
<P>

<P>

"The sufficiency of material contribution is well attested:  <b><u>March v E
&amp; MH Stramare </u></b>(at 514); <b><u>Bennett v Minister of Community
Welfare</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176 CLR 408</a> at 420.  However, introduction of the notion
of increased risk involves a different universe of discourse, albeit one which
is not
unhelpful, provided that the plaintiff's ultimate onus of proof is not
displaced."
<P>

	At page 312B he said:
<P>

"Before the House of Lords decided <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority,
</u></b>English courts had moved to the idea that a plaintiff who was unable to
weigh the scales down in favour of one of several competing
but independent
causative events could still succeed if the defendant(s) owed a duty of care
and was/were engaged in conduct that
created the risk of the injury which
occurred, even though the plaintiff was unable to ascertain the existence or
extent of the contribution
made by the breach(es) to the injury suffered.  The
trend reached its final and highest exposition in the judgment of Mustill LJ
in
the Court of Appeal in <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority
</u></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20QB%20730" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) QB 730</a> at 771-772, where he said:
<P>

"There is, however, one problem which must be tackled.  I had at one time
believed that the present case is on all fours with the
<b>McGhee </b>case
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/1973_SC_HL_37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20WLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 WLR 1</a> and that any apparent difference between the two simply stemmed
from the way in which the problem happened to be expressed.  I am
now persuaded
that this is not so, and that the two situations really are different.  In the
<b>McGhee</b> case there was only one risk operating, namely that contact of a
sweaty skin with brick dust would lead to dermatitis.  The fact
that such
contact did cause the injury was not in dispute.  Just as in <b><u>Bonnington
Castings Ltd v Wardlaw </u></b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20AC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) AC 613</a> the defenders' fault lay in not
taking proper steps to reduce that single risk.  The uncertainty was whether
the fault had tipped
the scale.  In the present case there is a greater
uncertainty.  Instead of a single risk factor known to have caused the injury
there is a list of factors, which cannot be fully enumerated in the current
state of medical science, any one of which might have
caused the injury.  What
the defendants did was not to enhance the risk that the known factor would lead
to injury, but to add to
the list of factors which might do so.  I acknowledge
that this is much further from the fact of <b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v
Wardlaw, </u></b> which was the springboard for the <b>McGhee</b> case than
were the facts of the <b>McGhee </b>case itself.
<P>

The question is whether this makes a crucial difference.  The root of the
problem lies in the fact that, for reasons of policy their
Lordships' House
mitigated the rigour of the rule that the plaintiff must prove that the breach
caused the loss, in the interests
of achieving a result which was considered to
be just.  Given that this was a decision based on policy, rather than a chain
of direct
reasoning, the difficulty is to know whether a similar approach can
properly be adopted in the different circumstances of the present
case.  After
much hesitation I have come to the conclusion that it can.  Reading all the
speeches together, the principle applied
by the House seems to me to amount to
this.  If it is an established fact that conduct of a particular kind creates a
risk that injury
will be caused to another or increases an existing risk that
injury will ensue; and if the two parties stand in such a relationship
that the
one party owes a duty not to conduct himself in that way; and if the first
party does conduct himself in that way; and if
the other party does suffer
injury of the kind to which the risk related; then the first party is taken to
have caused the injury
by his breach of duty, even though the existence and
extent of the contribution made by the breach cannot be ascertained."
<P>

Expressed in such terms, an onus was placed on the defendant to whom the
principle applied to prove that he or she was not in fact
responsible for the
injury suffered:  see also <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board </u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%203%20All%20ER%201008" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 3
All ER 1008</a> at 1012-1013, per Lord Wilberforce.
<P>

This beneficial approach to proof of causation by plaintiffs was applied to a
single defendant where it was uncertain whether a
negligent or innocent act was
the cause of injury (<b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board)</u></b> as understood
before <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</u></b>; and <b><u>Wilsher v
Essex Area Health Authority </u></b>in the Court of Appeal) and to multiple
defendants (<b><u>Fitzgerald v Lane</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20QB%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) QB 781</a>; reversed on other
grounds <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20AC%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) AC 328).</a>  And it was seen to offer a just solution to plaintiffs
facing difficulties of proving causation due to the absence of factual evidence
of which lay persons might attest (<b><u>Fitzgerald v Lane</u></b>) or due to
the imperfect state of medical knowledge of which expert testimony was required
(<b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</u></b> (at 766E-F, 771B-C, 776E);
<b><u>Fitzgerald v Lane</u></b> (at 799F-G). <b><u>Fitzgerald v Lane</u></b>
was an example of the former and <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority
</u></b>(in the English Court of Appeal) an example of the latter.
<P>

In <b><u>Fitzgerald v Lane</u></b>, there were three possibilities touching a
complicated motor accident (two affecting one defendant and the third affecting
the other
defendant) that could account for the plaintiff's tetraplegia.  The
trial judge held that each of the three possibilities was equally
probable and
that he was unable to distinguish between them.  The Court of Appeal recognised
that this did not mean that all three
combined to produce the injury by
cumulative effect:  see at 795D.  Nevertheless each defendant was held liable.
In <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</u></b>, the plaintiff's
blindness could have been caused either by one of four medical conditions
associated with the plaintiff's premature
birth, or by the negligent saturation
of oxygen by medical staff.  Medical science was unable to identify the causal
culprit.  Since,
however, the administration of excess oxygen increased the
risk statistically in the sense of doubling the "<i>contingency"</i> (19887) 1
QB at 771) a causal connection was "<i>presumed" </i>(at 771) by the majority
of the English Court of Appeal.  Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C dissented.
<P>

This approach put English law in line with that then prevailing in North
America with respect to what Prosser and Keeton describe
as "<i>clearly
established double fault and alternative liability</i>":  <b>Prosser and Keeton
on Torts, </b>5<sup>th</sup> ed (1984) at 271.  The classic example is where
two defendants negligently shoot but the plaintiff is struck by one bullet
which
might have been fired from either gun.  As the matter stood in 1984, the
North American case law took the position that, where negligence
on the part of
both defendants was clear, and it was only the issue of causation which was in
doubt, the onus shifted to each defendant
to displace that burden.  If it could
not be displaced, then a verdict should be entered against each defendant with
equal contribution
towards satisfying the verdict:  <b><u>Summers v Tice
</u></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=199%20P%202d%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">199 P 2d 1</a> (1948); <b><u>Cook v Lewis </u></b>(1952) &#180; DLR 1.
(The two cases are criticised by T B Hogan in "<b><cite>Cook v Lewis</cite><u>
</u></b><i>Re-examined</i>" (1961) 24 Mod LR 331).  A similar principle has
been applied to products liability cases where a number of manufacturers were
negligent
in the preparation of a common drug but where the plaintiff was
unable to identify the manufacturer of the precise product which
led to his or
her injuries. However, in that case each manufacturer's liability was limited
to its market share:  <b><u>Sindell v Abbott Laboratories </u></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=607%20P%202d%20924" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">607 P 2d 924</a>
(1980) (cert denied  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=449%20US%20912" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">449 US 912).</a>
<P>

However, the Court of Appeal (majority) decision in <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area
Health Authority </u></b>was overturned in the House of Lords.  The proceedings
were remitted for a re-trial on the issue of causation.  Significantly, the
House of Lords adopted the dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal (that of
the Vice-Chancellor) who had said (1987) 1 QB at 779)
that:
<P>

"....A failure to take preventative measures against one out of five possible
causes is no evidence as to which of those five caused
the injury."  (see
(1988) AC at 1091).
<P>

In <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</u></b>, Lord Wilberforce's
speech in <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b> was identified as adopting
a minority position which should be rejected:  see <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area
Health Authority</u></b> (at 1087).  Nevertheless the conclusion was affirmed,
<b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b> being explained as promoting a
robust and pragmatic approach to the particular facts which allowed an
inference of negligence to
be drawn even though medical or scientific expertise
could not arrive at a definite or more probable conclusion.  This was because
the risk of contracting the particular disease in <b><u>McGhee v National Coal
Board</u></b> (dermatitis) was increased the longer the brick dust remained on
the body.  In those circumstances, the trier of fact was able to
infer that a
failure to provide washing facilities materially contributed to the disease by
materially increasing the risk.
<P>

The Supreme Court of Canada followed <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health
Authority </u></b>in <b><u>Snell v Farrell </u></b>(1990) 72 DLR
(4<sup>th</sup>) 289, holding that the onus of proof does not shift in medical
malpractice cases.  In doing so, the Court explained that causation
need not be
determined by scientific precision; and that the common situation where the
facts lie particularly within the knowledge
of the defendant in malpractice
cases means that very little affirmative evidence on the part of the plaintiff
would justify the
drawing of an inference of causation in the absence of
evidence to the contrary:  see at 299-301.  Nevertheless, the reasoning was
confined to medical malpractice cases, and <b><u>Cook v Lewis</u></b> was
inferentially re-affirmed (at 299) on the basis that:
<P>

		"...Reversing the burden of proof may be justified where 
<P>

two defendants negligently fire in the direction of the plaintiff and then by
their tortious conduct destroy the means of proof
at his disposal.  In such a
case it is clear that the injury was not caused by neutral conduct.  It is
quite a different matter to
compensate a plaintiff by reversing the burden of
proof for an injury that may very well be due to factors unconnected to the
defendant
and not the fault of anyone."
<P>

See also <b><u>Hollis v Dow Corning Corporation</u></b> (1996) 129 CLR
(4<sup>th</sup>) 609 at 639.  
<P>

In <b><u>Snell v Farrell</u></b>, a robust factual approach to causation issues
was compared to the theoretical reversal of onus of proof suggested by Lord
Wilberforce
in <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b>.  The Supreme Court
endorsed Lord Bridge's speech in <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health
Authority</u></b> (1988) AC at 1088 where he explained <b><u>McGhee v National
Coal Board</u></b> in the following terms:
<P>

".....where the layman is told by the doctors that the longer the brick dust
remains on the body, the greater the risk of dermatitis,
although the doctors
cannot identify the process of causation scientifically, there seems to be
nothing irrational in drawing the
inference, as a matter of common sense, that
the consecutive periods when brick dust remained on the body contributed
cumulatively
to the causation of the dermatitis.  I believe that a process of
inferential reasoning on these general lines underlies the decision
of the
majority in <b><u>McGhee's</u></b> case."
<P>

In <b><u>Bennett v Minister for Community Welfare</u></b> (at 421), Gaudron J
notes that the debate in Canada on a possible shift in the onus of proof is
seemingly resolved in the manner
indicated by Lord Bridge in <b><u>Wilsher v
Essex Area Health Authority.</u></b>
<P>

Where stands the current law in Australia?  I am not aware of rejection of
<b><u>Wilsher's</u></b> reassessment of <b><u>McGhee v National Coal
Board</u></b> .  In <b><u>March v E &amp; MH Stramare</u></b> (at 524), Mason J
cites various passages in <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b>, including
a passage from the speech of Lord Wilberforce.  It is significant, however,
that he does so in support of the uncontroversial
proposition that the
plaintiff must prove that his or her injuries are "<i>caused or materially
contributed to"</i> by the defendant's wrongful conduct.  In <b><u>St George
Club Ltd v Hines</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2035%20ALJR%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 35 ALJR 106</a> at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=107%20ALR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">107; (1962) ALR 30</a> at 41, the
High Court, in a joint judgment of five justices, said:
<P>

		"In an action of law a plaintiff does not prove his case merely
<P>

by showing that it was possible that his injury was caused by the defendant's
default, <b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20AC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) AC 613</a>; nor
does proof of default followed by injury show that the default caused the
injury, for as Viscount Simonds said in <b><u>Quinn v Cameron &amp; Robertson
Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%20AC%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) AC 9</a> at 23, "`<i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>'" is a
fallacy in respect of a breach of a statutory regulation as it is in respect of
any other event in life'.  Similar principles
apply to a claim for compensation
where it is necessary to show that the employment contributed to the
injury."

<P>

I respectfully agree.  Only parliament or the High Court may change this.
<P>

	
<P>

The difficulties which these principles place in the way of a plaintiff can be
very considerable.  To say that they are the logical
outcome of a legal system
that requires proof of fault before damages flow against a particular defendant
does not remove a lingering
sense of injustice, particularly in the case of
multiple defendants where each has been shown to have negligently exposed a
plaintiff
to a risk of injury.  Nevertheless our law remains wedded to the
principle that if the risk does not come home in a way that is causally
linked
to the particular defendant's negligence, then it is the plaintiff who must
bear the loss:  see <b><u>Rhesa Shipping Co SA v Edmunds, The "Popi M"</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 Lloyd's Rep 1</a> at 5.  These principles have been reversed by
legislation in several jurisdictions, including Ireland, Germany and the
Netherlands:
 <i>Civil Liabilities Act 1961 </i>(Eire), s 11(3); J G Fleming,
"<i>Probabilistic Causation in Tort Law" </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2068%20Canadian%20Bar%20Review%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 68 Can Bar Rev 661</a> at 671;

<P>

In <b><u>Kilgannon v Sharpe Bros Pty Ltd, </u></b>Kirby P suggests that the
principles of res ipsa loquitur may bring about a similar result in some
circumstances involving multiple
defendants all having "<i>control" </i>of the
relevant situation:  see at 6140619.  However, this view was rejected by the
majority of the Court (Hope JA and Priestley JA).
 More importantly for present
purposes, Kirby P recognised that it would be unreasonable and possibly unjust
to apply the principle
he espoused where "<i>there is a possible explanation,
in an extraneous cause, originating in a party who is not before the Court"</i>
(at 617D; see also at 618B).  The absence of the Royal Navy as a defendant in
the present case is therefore critical, even on Kirby
P's approach.
<P>

It can be demonstrated that the common law is not unsympathetic to the plight
of plaintiffs who are faced with multiple defendants
yet uncertain as to which
of them was legally responsible, where it appears that not all of them
were........"
<P>

	At page 318A he said:
<P>

"But none of these procedural or adjectival concessions in favour of an
uncertain plaintiff support the principle that a party who
negligently exposes
a plaintiff to a risk of injury will be liable unless the plaintiff can
persuade the trier of fact that it was
probable that the risk came home.  The
basal principle remains that:  "<i>The law never gives judgment in favour of a
plaintiff when the only finding is equally consistent with liability and
non-liability."
 </i><b><u>(Moriarty v Evans Medical Supplies</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%201%20WLR%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 1
WLR 66</a> at 91, per Lord Denning.)
<P>

	At page 319C he said:
<P>

"I agree with Beazley JA on the issue of causation.  My view may be summarized
as follows:
<P>

	1. .........
<P>

2.  The ultimate issue, in the light of the principles which I have endeavoured
to summarise, is which (if any) of the persons sued
by the respondent were
shown, on the balance of probabilities, to have caused or materially
contributed to Mr Barnes' mesothelioma.
<P>

3.  Expert evidence, which the trier of fact is entitled to accept despite the
weight of evidence to the contrary, established that
the appellants
<i>might</i> have caused or materially contributed to Mr Barnes' fatal
illness..  (I refer to the evidence of Dr Burns and Dr Joseph.)
<P>

4.  Nevertheless, the evidence as to the type of fibre to which the respondent
was exposed in the Royal Navy (crocidolite), the
dose to which he was then
exposed and the lag time involved all pointed strongly in the direction of the
Royal Navy.  Although that
evidence, in the final analysis, merely supported
the greater risk of the fatal disease having been contracted by the respondent
during this period of his working life, that evidence (taken cumulatively) can,
and in my mind does, support the finding that this
was the employer more
probably than not whose act or omission caused the fatal disease.  As against
the Ministry of Defence (UK)
it is a situation where an inference of causation
is warranted in that there is no practical difference between materially
contributing
to the risk of harm and materially contributing to the harm
itself:  cf <b><u>Snell v Farrell</u></b> (at 296G).  Another way of addressing
the issue is to hold that, were the Ministry of Defence (UK) the sole
defendant, then a verdict
against that defendant would be clearly open on the
evidence.  Judge Maguire reached a similar conclusion in the passage quoted
early
in this judgment.
<P>

5.  None of this precludes a verdict against one or more of the appellants each
of whom have been shown to have negligently exposed
Mr Barnes to a risk of
contracting the fatal disease.  But that is not enough.  Has it been shown to
be probable that the risk they
or any of them created actually caused injury?
It will be sufficient if their several acts caused or contributed materially to
the
onset of mesothelioma.
<P>

6.  As Beazley JA demonstrates, the evidence of the respondent's principal
expert witnesses (Dr Burn and Dr Joseph) does not rise
higher than
demonstrating that the chrysotile in the brake linings was a potential
contributor to Mr Barnes' mesothelioma.  Unlike
the appellants' expert
witnesses, Dr Burns considered that chrysotile was <i>"just as likely to be
harmful as any other asbestos."  </i>This, if accepted, provided the
evidentiary basis upon which the trier of fact might conclude that the
appellant were responsible
in fact and law for the fatal disease.  But it does
not compel that conclusion.  I read the evidence about repeated stimuli
increasing
the chances of getting mesothelioma in the same sense.
<P>

The effect of the evidence of Mr Barnes' exposure to greater quantities of the
more risky crocidolite at a more likely time cannot
be ignored.  Nor can one
ignore the evidence of lighter exposure to the less lethal cyrysotile in the
more recent periods involving
the appellants.  The evidence of Dr Burns and Dr
Joseph simply fails to offer a scientific or indeed a rational basis for
preferring
the chrysotile of the appellants over the crocidolite of the Royal
Navy; or for concluding that the later exposure had a harmful
cumulative
effect, like the brick dust in <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b> on
prolonged exposure to noise.  The essence of this view is that the scales
remain equipoised because medical science cannot say
which exposure was
significant.  If the Royal Navy exposure had not occurred, the trier of fact
(and, one infers, even the appellants'
experts) would have found it probable
that the appellants were liable.  But the presence of the Royal Navy cannot be
ignored, especially
since the evidence points strongly to it in the sense that
it, more than any other person, materially increased the risk of contracting
mesothelioma.
<P>

7.  It would be speculation, not inference, to conclude that it was more
probable than not that the appellants or any of them materially
contributed to
the respondent's disease.  The highest that the respondent's case can be put is
that the appellants' involvement increased
the statistical contingency that
their acts or omissions may have caused or materially contributed to the
mesothelioma.  The inability
of medical science to identify the aetiology of
the disease or to establish a likelihood let alone probability that the
appellants'
asbestos contributed to the disease, means that the respondent has
not established against any party from whom he seeks a verdict
that that party
is liable in the tort of negligence.

	Beazley JA also dealt with causation, reaching the same conclusion as the
learned President.

exceedingly simple formulation of principle, its application in a case of this
sort is not easy of resolution.
 Mesothelioma is a condition of uncertain
aetiology and Mr Barnes was serially exposed to asbestos which the evidence
indicated possibly
had different degrees of toxicity depending upon the
particular fibre, the first exposure being to crocidolite, which is considered
to be a more virulent causative agent of mesothelioma than chrysotile, to which
Mr Barnes was later exposed.
<P>

The factual question which calls for resolution in the first instance is
whether, on the balance of probabilities, the exposure
to chrysotile during the
period 1962 to 1985 or any relevant part of this period, caused or materially
contributed to Mr Barnes'
contraction of mesothelioma:  <b><u>Bonnington
Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20AC%20613" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) AC 613.</a>
<P>

In <b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b>, a steel dresser was exposed
to silica dust from two sources in the course of his employment:  a pneumatic
hammer and swing grinders.
 There was no dust extraction plant known or
practicable for use with the hammer.  Although the swing grinders were fitted
with such
equipment, they were not kept free from obstruction.  The employer
conceded it was thereby in breach of relevant regulations which
governed its
operations.  The steel dresser contracted pneumoconiosis.  The question which
arose was whether the worker had established
that the cause of his
pneumoconiosis was due to the breach of statutory duty.  Lord Reid stated (at
620-621):
<P>

"...In my judgment, the employee must in all cases prove his case by the
ordinary standard of proof in civil actions:  he must make
it appear at least
that on balance of probabilities the breach of duty caused or materially
contributed to his injury....
<P>

....I am in agreement with much of the Lord President's opinion in this case,
but I cannot agree that the question is:  which was
the most probable source of
the respondent's disease, the dust from the pneumatic hammers or the dust from
the swing grinders?  It
appears to me that the source of his disease was the
dust from both sources, and the real question is whether the dust from the
swing
grinders materially contributed to the disease.  What is a material
contribution must be a question of degree.  A contribution which
comes within
the exception de minimis non curat lex is not material, but I think that any
contribution which does not fall within
that exception must be material.   I do
not see how there can be something too large to come within the de minimis
principle but
yet too small to be material...."
<P>

	Dealing with the particular facts in the case, Lord Reid stated 	(at 622):
<P>

"I think that the position can be shortly stated in this way.  It may be that,
of the noxious dust in the general atmosphere of
the shop, more came from the
pneumatic hammers than from the swing grinders, but I think it is sufficiently
proved that the dust
from the grinders made a substantial contribution.  The
respondent, however, did not only inhale the general atmosphere of the shop:
when he was working his hammer his face was directly over it and it must often
have happened that dust from his hammer substantially
increased the
concentration of noxious dust in the air which he inhaled.  It is therefore
probable that much the greater proportion
of the noxious dust which he inhaled
over the whole period came from the hammers.  But, on the other hand, some
certainly came from
the swing grinders, and I cannot avoid the conclusion that
the proportion which came from the swing grinders was not negligible."
<P>

Lord Reid reiterated the principle he had formulated in

<P>

The causation issue in <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b> was slightly
different to the problem encountered in <b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v
Wardlaw</u></b>.  McGhee had been a long time employee in brickworks and during
the course of his daily employment would become covered in brick
dust.  The
respondent failed to provide him with showering facilities so that at the end
of the work day, he would cycle home still
covered in the brick dust.  He
contracted dermatitis.  Lord Reid noted that the evidence did not establish how
dermatitis of the
type suffered by the worker was contracted.  Two possible
theories were advanced, one to the effect that there had t be multiple
tiny
abrasions to the horny layer of the skin before the dermatitis developed, the
other to the effect that a single abrasion was
sufficient, the effect of
multiple abrasions being to increase the possible sites where the disease could
start.  Lord Reid considered
that the evidence tendered to the former view.
However, the lack of certainty as to the precise cause of the disease did not
mean
that a plaintiff could not establish causation.  As Lord Reid further
stated (at 4; 1011):
<P>

"...in a field where so little appears to be known with certainty I could not
say that that is proved.  If it were, then this case
would be indistinguishable
from Wardlaw's case.  But I think that in cases like this we must take a
broader view of causation.  The
medical evidence is to the effect that the fact
that the man had to cycle home caked with grime and sweat added materially to
the
risk that this disease might develop.  It does not and could not explain
just why that is so.  But experience shows that it is so."
<P>

See also Lord Simon (at 8), Lord Kibrandon (at 10) and Lord Salmon (at 12).
<P>

Lord Reid added that he saw no distinction between "<i>materially increasing
the risk that the disease will occur and making a material contribution to its
occurrence."</i>
<P>

<b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b> and <b><u>McGhee v National
Coal Board </u></b>were explained in <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health
Authority </u></b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] UKHL 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20AC%201074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) AC 1074</a> at 1087, by Lord Bridge of Harwich in there
terms:
<P>

"A distinction is, of course, apparent between the fact of <b><u>Bonnington
Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b>, where the `<i>innocent'</i> and <i>guilty'</i>
silica dust particles which together caused the pursuer's lung disease were
inhaled concurrently and the fact of <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/1973_SC_HL_37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20WLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 WLR 1</a> where the <i>`innocent'</i> and `<i>guilty'</i> brick dust was
present on the pursuer's body for consecutive periods.  In the one case the
concurrent inhalation of `<i>innocent'</i> and `<i>guilty' </i>dust must both
have contributed to the cause of the disease.  In the other case the
consecutive periods when `<i>innocent'</i> and `<i>guilty'</i> brick dust was
present on the pursuer's body may both have contributed to the cause of the
disease or, theoretically at least, one
or the other may have been the sole
cause.  But where the layman is told by the doctors that the longer the brick
dust remains on
the body, the greater the risk of dermatitis, although the
doctors cannot identify the process of causation scientifically, there
seems to
be nothing irrational in drawing the inference, as a matter of common sense,
that the consecutive periods when brick dust
remained on the body probably
contributed cumulatively to the causation of the dermatitis.  I believe that a
process of inferential
reasoning on these general lines underlies the decision
of the majority in McGhee's case."
<P>

Lord Bridge further stated (at 1090):
<P>

"The conclusion I draw from these passages is that <b><u>McGhee v National Coal
Board</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/1973_SC_HL_37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20WLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1 WLR 1</a> laid down no new principle of law whatever.  On
the contrary, it affirmed the principle that the onus of proving causation lies
on
the pursuer or plaintiff.  Adopting a robust and pragmatic approach to the
undisputed primary facts of the case, the majority concluded
that it was a
legitimate inference of fact that the defenders' negligence had materially
contributed to the pursuer's injury.  The
decision, in my opinion, is of no
greater significance than that and to attempt to extract from it some esoteric
principle which
in some way modifies, as a matter of law, the nature of the
burden of proof of causation which the plaintiff or pursuer must discharge
once
he has established a relevant breach of duty is a fruitless one."
<P>

In <b><u>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority, </u></b>the defendant's staff
negligently allowed the plaintiff to be exposed to excess oxygen which could
have caused his blindness.  During
the same period he suffered from four other
conditions which could also have caused his blindness.  The Court of Appeal,
purporting
to apply <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board </u></b>held that the
breach of duty established a presumptive inference that the exposure to the
oxygen was the cause of the blindness. 
However, the House of Lords rejected
the proposition that there was any reversal of onus in such a case such that
the defendant had
to prove that its breach had not materially contributed to
the plaintiff's injury.  They endorsed the dissenting view of Browne-Wilkinson
V-C (at 1091) that:
<P>

		
<P>

"A failure to take preventative measures against one out of
<P>

five possible causes is no evidence as to which of those five caused the
injury."
<P>

The principle established by <b><u>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</u></b>
and <b><u>McGhee v National Coal Board</u></b> has been consistently applied in
England and Australia.  In <b><u>March v E &amp; MH Stramare</u></b>,  Mason CJ
stated (at 514):
<P>

"....the law's recognition that concurrent or successive tortious acts may each
amount to a cause of the injuries sustained by a
plaintiff is reflected in the
proposition that it is for the plaintiff to establish that his or her injuries

that the plaintiff would not have sustained
his or her injuries had the

often extremely difficult to demonstrate what would have happened
in the
absence of the defendant's negligent conduct."

"In cases such as that with which the court is now concerned the burden of
proof of actionable negligence against any defendant
remains firmly with the

defendant carried the burden of disproof if it were shown that he was one of a

<P>

The clear effect of these cases is that the onus remains on the plaintiff to
prove causation on the balance of probabilities.  The
onus is not discharged by
establishing that a particular matter cannot be excluded as a cause of the
injury:  see <b><u>Sydney County Council v Furner</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%207%20NSWCCR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 7 NSWCCR 210</a>,
where Hope A-JA said (at 214):
<P>

"...To find that a particular cause cannot be excluded as the cause of the
relevant injury does not establish that on the probabilities
it was the cause
of that injury; it may have been `<i>the'</i> or `<i>a'</i> cause.  In other
words, to establish that medical evidence supports a conclusion that the cause
could not be excluded as a cause
of an injury does not establish, without more,
that particular cause in fact resulted in or caused the injury."
<P>

	Subsequently the Court of Appeal decided <b><u>ICI Operations Pty Limited v
Watel &amp; Ors</u></b>.  (Unreported 3 October, 1997).  The bench consisted of
the President and Justices Handley and Meagher.  The learned President shortly
restated his views as expressed in <b>Bendix.  </b>  Handley JA (one of the
members of the Court in <b>McLean</b>) agreed with the views of the
President.
<P>

	In my view the law of New South Wales is as was stated by the learned
President in <b>Bendix.  </b>It is not, as he says, for an intermediate Court
of Appeal to change it let alone for a trial judge such as myself.
<P>

	Whatever may be one's views of the social desirability of the High Court and
Parliament of changing the law to in effect shift
the burden of proof to a
defendant of showing that his negligent actions did not cause injury to the
plaintiff where the plaintiff
has shown that the actions of the defendant
increased the risk of the plaintiff sustaining the injury which was sustained,
it is
not open to me to decide this case on that basis.
<P>

	Simply establishing that a causal connection between the actions of the
defendant and the injury to the plaintiff is possible does
not justify a
finding of causation unless the evidence justifies an inference of probable
connection. 
<P>

	Accordingly I do not accept the submission on behalf of the plaintiffs in
respect to the proof of causation.  In order to succeed
the plaintiffs must,
according to the law of New South Wales, establish that the or a probable cause
of their injury was the negligence
of the defendants.
<P>

<center><b><u>4.  PROBABILITY OF CAUSATION</u></b></center>
<P>

	The evidence of causation relied on by the plaintiffs as pointing to the
conclusion that Cu-7 use caused or materially contributed
to the acquisition of
PID and its sequelae and to septic abortion was as follows:
<P>

	4.1	Epidemiology
<P>

	4.2	Scientific analysis
<P>

	4.3	Clinical observation
<P>

<i>	</i>The plaintiffs' case is that use of IUDs<i> "enhanced"</i> or<i>
"materially</i> <i>contributed</i>" to PID.
<P>

<center><b><u>4.1   EPIDEMIOLOGY</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

	The threshold question is whether a user of a Cu-7 was placed at a greater
risk of PID than if she had not used a device.  The
parties were diametrically
opposed on the answer to this question.  
<P>

The plaintiffs assert that there was an increased risk.  The defendants assert
that the only increased risk involved was a risk
associated with the process of
insertion of the device into the uterus (an iatrogenic risk).
<P>

The plaintiffs seek to establish the existence of an increased risk by the use
of epidemiological evidence.  They submitted that
throughout the decade from
1975 when the first insertion of an IUD relevant to these proceedings occurred
"<i>there was a drum beat of concern in the medical literature about the
increased risk from IUD use, PID and its sequelae." </i>
<P>

	The defendants conceded that virtually all of the numerous case studies
published reported a statistical association between PID
and the use of an IUD
but submitted that there are "<i>cogent reasons</i> <i>why these studies, when
properly interpreted, cannot establish a causal link between the use of the
Gravigard/Mini and PID with its
sequelae.</i>"  
<P>

	Epidemiology is the statistical study of disease in relation to such things as
prevalence or factors associated with suffers of
the disease which may be
causative of it.  
<P>

One method of statistically determining cause is by conducting what is known as
an observational cohort study.  An example of this
is given by the defendants
in Chapter 7 Volume  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Page%206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 Page 6</a> of their submissions.  That example is that if an
investigator suspects that tea drinking causes renal stones, a group of four
thousand
tea drinkers and a group of four thousand non-tea drinkers are
assembled.  They are then followed for ten years and results of their
renal
stone incidents are tabulated.  If there are fewer renal stone incidents among
non-tea drinkers than there are among tea-drinkers
then that may suggest that
tea drinking may cause renal stones.  The difference in the number of incidents
will indicate the seriousness
of the hazard.  
<P>

An alternative method of determining cause is a case control study which
follows a reverse direction.  
<P>

The investigator studies people who already have the disease and a control
group is assembled comprising people in whom the disease
has not been noted.
The two groups are then followed in a backward direction with enquiries aimed
at determining each member's antecedent
exposure to the alleged aetiological
agent or cause of the disease.  
<P>

	The defendants submitted that one can conclude that any difference which
appears in the results of a case control study only reflects
some causal link
if it is possible to exclude all other plausible explanations for the
difference.  They refer to "<i>non-causal" </i>explanations which they submit
must be excluded as:
<P>

	(a)	Selection bias: 
<P>

This is said to mean that there is some fundamental difference 
<P>

between the members of the two groups "<i>rather than the tea </i>
<P>

<i>drinking having any effect.</i>"
<P>

In support of this proposition the defendants refer to an article 
<P>

by Grimes  "<i>Biases:  the Saboteurs of Silence</i> ".
<P>

(Exhibit D384 Tab 10).  In that article Grimes refers to an 
<P>

example of methological weaknesses in cohort studies as 
<P>

examples, which methological weaknesses may have 
<P>

damaged a study's validity.  The first he refers to is selection 
<P>

bias where he opines that "<i>selection bias implies that </i>
<P>

<i>subjects in one study group are different from those in</i>
<P>

<i> another in some feature other than the exposure of interest.</i>
<P>

<i>  If this feature is not measured it cannot be controlled for </i>
<P>

<i>in the analysis and thus may bias the results.</i>"  
<P>

He concluded:  "<i>In a cohort study, both groups should be </i>
<P>

<i>comparable in all respects, except for the exposure of </i>
<P>

<i>interest (here hormone therapy)</i>".
<P>

Grimes is referring to cohort studies in the article referred to 
<P>

but it is difficult to see why there should be any difference in 
<P>

principle in this aspect between cohort studies and case 
<P>

control studies.
<P>

(b)	Assessment or data bias: 
<P>

The diagnosis is not assessed in identical ways in the two 
<P>

groups that are being studied.
<P>

(c)	Chance:
<P>

Despite there being no "<i>real"</i> difference sampling error or 
<P>

random variation has resulted in difference in the study data.  
<P>

The studies referred to in these proceedings are essentially case control
studies. They are "<i>retrospective studies.</i>"  They compare women who had
the problem under investigation and "<i>controls</i>", women who did not have
the same problem.  
<P>

Professor Newton said that the disadvantage of this type of investigation is
that "<i>bias is inherent and difficult to control."</i> 
<P>

(Exhibit D299 para 105(b)).  
<P>

Another difficulty with case control studies are what are known as confounders.
The most common confounder in medical studies is
the age of the persons
studied.  In a comparison there should be an adjustment for age so that the
comparison is between people of
the same age.  
<P>

Professor Daling who gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs said (T2770)
that it is not possible to entirely remove bias but
"<i>I mean we do the best
we can to remove all possible bias.</i>"  
<P>

At T2773 Professor Daling said, when referring to the elimination of the effect
of other factors relating to a disease, "<i>you have taken all those steps made
possible by your data collection and your statistical tools to reduce as much
as possible.</i>"
<P>

	Studies may suffer from bias for various reasons and the effect of that is
that you may get an estimate of the risk which is not
the true estimate of the
risk.  (Daling, T2768).  
<P>

The defendants in their submissions dealt simply with the definition of a
number of relevant epidemiological terms and it is convenient
to deal with
those definitions at this stage.  They were illustrated by the following
example. 
<P>

5,000 men and 5,000 women crossed Elizabeth Street and the number of each group
who stumbled were counted.  
<P>

Of the 5,000 men 100 or 2% stumbled.  Of the 5,000 women 150 or 3% stumbled.

<P>

Those percentages are both <u>incidence rates</u> or simply the likelihood of
stumbling.  From the figures appearing in this example it would be correct to
say that women have an
increased <u>incidence rate</u> of stumbling compared to
men.  
<P>

The <u>relative risk</u> is 3%/2% or 1.5 which means that women are 1.5 times
more likely to stumble while crossing Elizabeth Street as men.  One can then
say that women have an <u>increased risk</u> of stumbling compared to men.  
<P>

A case control study does not obtain data which enables <u>incidence rates</u>
to be calculated so what is known as an "<cite>odds ratio</cite>" is used to
estimate the <u>relative risk</u> and adding a confidence interval.
<P>

If it is sought to use data from a case study to estimate relative risk one
assumes that the larger study is the more accurate will
be the estimate.  
<P>

A <u>confidence interval</u> is calculated. This is an interval within which
the true relative risk probably falls.  In simple terms, it is likely that the
larger
the data set the greater is the confidence interval.  A 95% confidence
interval is used to indicate that the true odds ratio or relative
risk is 95%
likely to be at the figure or band determined.  
<P>

If the relative risk was 1.5 a 95% confidence interval means that if repeated
samples of the same size were taken from the population
study and studied,
ninety-five times out of one hundred the relative risk calculated would fall
within the confidence limit.  
<P>

	The defendants submitted that it is not possible to come to a conclusion
regarding causation from statistical results obtained
in observational
epidemiology or at least coming to a conclusion is fraught with difficulty.
The defendants refer to <b><u>Feinstien </u></b>and<b><u> Horwitz</u></b>
(Exhibit D291) where the author attacked the scientific methods used by
epidemiologists. 
<P>

Keeping gave evidence in relation to the use of epidemiology at some length and
concluded that the procedures and processes "<i>still falls short of the only
true method, which would be a control trial." </i>
<P>

There have been two significant reviews of the literature relevant to the issue
of causal connection between IUD use and PID and
its sequelae including ectopic
pregnancy..  First was <b>Senanayke and Kramer 1980</b> and second was the
<b>WHO Technical Group Report 1987</b>.
<P>

The conclusion reached by <b>Senanayke and Kramer</b> was:
<P>

		"Taken together, the reported studies on the IUD and PID 
<P>

deal with most of biases that could explain the apparent 
<P>

increases in risk with the IUD.  Results of the studies are 
<P>

consistent in direction despite varying study designs, 
<P>

researchers, and locations, and they generally point to an 
<P>

increased risk of 150% to 400% for IUD users when 
<P>

compared with all non-users of contraceptives."  
<P>

(p.857, LHC, last para).
<P>

Review Articles are articles which overview the relevant medical literature and
attempt to synthesise the state of knowledge researched
at the time of writing.
Professor Daling gave evidence that one criterion to be looked at is what is
known as "<i>consistencies across the studies</i>", namely a pattern mostly in
one direction or the other across different study populations observed by
different researchers.
<P>

<b>Senanayke and Kramer 1980</b> referred to above, canvassed sixteen studies.
They are set out in Attachment 2 which forms part of the review.  The WHO
Technical
Group Report 1987 canvassed those sixteen studies together with nine
others.
<P>

In all sixteen studies reported on by <b>Senanayke and Kramer </b>that there
was an increased risk of PID from IUD use whether the comparison was made with
women using other forms of contraception
(the results show an increased risk
varying from 1.9 to 9.3) or using no contraception at all (the results show an
increased risk
varying from 1.5 to 7.3).
<P>

	The nine further studies dealt with by the <b>WHO Report</b> show on their
face an increased risk for IUD users varying between 2.1 and 10.5 compared to
women using other forms of contraception
and between 1.5 and 11.5 compared to
women using no contraception.
<P>

	The conclusion reached by the WHO Technical Group was:
<P>

"Since 1980, when 16 reports were reviewed by Senanayke
<P>

and Kramer, 9 additional reports of significantly increased risk of pelvic
inflammatory disease or tubal infertility among IUD users
have been published.
These 25 studies, conducted in many different countries by different
investigators, albeit with different diagnostic
criteria, have all found an
increased risk of the disease or its sequelae among IUD users, which argue
strongly for a causal relationship"
 (WHO Report p.38, LHC, para 7.4).
<P>

Eschenbach gave evidence (T1822, L46-57) that the three studies of <b>Wright
and Laemmle</b> 1968, <b>Noonan and Adams </b>1974 and <b>Targum and Wright
</b>1974 were enough to lead to the conclusion that that there was an increased
risk of PID from IUD use.  
<P>

Ory said of the six epidemiological studies he reviewed:
<P>

	"In summary, then, I think that these six studies point in the
<P>

same direction, that IUD use is associated with the increased risk of acute
PID.  The best estimate suggests that IUD users have
from three to five times
the risk of developing PID compared to non-users, that teenagers appear as
likely to be affected as older
women, that copper IUD's do not offer any
protection from gonococcal PID, and finally, there is the intriguing but as yet
unconfirmed
suggestion that nulliparous IUD users are more likely to develop
acute PID than are multi-parous users.
<P>

As an epidemiologist, I kind of look at these six studies, you know, done by
five different investigators at three different countries,
all showing the same
results, and that, to me, provides some evidence that the association is one of
cause and effect.  Each study
had its strengths and its weaknesses.  However,
all together, they rule out virtually every major source of bias as a possible
reason
for observing this association.
<P>

In addition, when you couple it with Dick Soderstrom's recent report of the
histologic changes and the possibility that this is
altering tubal defense
mechanisms; also if you couple it with the fact that previously rare syndromes,
or so they are said to be
in the literature, such as unilateral tubo-ovarian
abscess and infective agents like Actinomycoses are now being reported in
association
with IUD use, I think biologic plausibility is added to a causal
interpretation of these six studies."   (Ex. P228, Tab 13, pp.72-73).
     
<P>

The plaintiffs sought a finding that at the time of each IUD insertion relied
upon by the plaintiffs, Searle was in possession of
strong evidence from
epidemiological studies which pointed to a causal association between IUD use
and PID.  The association, as
revealed by the studies referred to above, was so
strong and consistent that Searle was under a legal obligation to act on the
basis
of that causal association.  
<P>

The plaintiffs submitted that if this finding is made and if subsequent
scientific research has not reviewed the conclusion in so
far as it applies to
Cu-7 then their case relating to a failure to warn is made out.
<P>

The defendants submitted that later epidemiology was able to isolate the risk
associated with Cu-7 itself and established that there
was no increased rate of
PID associated with Cu-7 use.  The defendants further submitted that there was
no increased risk among women
in stable monogamous relationships.
<P>

The defendants dealt with the papers referred to in the two overview papers to
attempt to demonstrate that they could not be relied
upon to support the
conclusion contended for by the plaintiffs.
<P>

	
<P>

I shall deal with each of the papers in the order in which they appear in the
reports.
<P>

<b>Wright &amp; Laemmle 1968</b>
<P>

	This is one of the first studies which attempted to look at the aetiology and
epidemiology of PID within a large family planning
program:
<P>

          The study was carried out in 1965 at the Grady Memorial Hospital,
Atlanta, Georgia amongst a population of black indigent
women.
<P>

           The methodology was that 902 first episode cases of acute PID were
obtained from the Hospital records.  The denominator
used was the estimated
total population of indigent women aged between 15 to 44 years in the 2
counties surrounding the hospital.
 A rounded-up figure of 50,000 was used to
calculate the rates.
<P>

	A definite diagnosis of acute PID was made if a patient presented with a fever
plus 2 or more of the following:
<P>

*	lower abdominal tenderness with or without guarding;
<P>

*	cervical motion tenderness;
<P>

*	uni- or bi-lateral adnexal tenderness with or without masses.
<P>

	An exception was made if there was actual visualization of PID at
laparotomy.
<P>

	The authors looked at different factors which might have been relevant to the
incidence of PID including age and marital status.
 They also looked at attack
rates of acute PID among women according to the type of contraceptive method
that was currently being
used.  
<P>

	The results of an analysis of 108 subjects with PID appear in Table VIII on
page 985 of the paper.  A summary of the table prepared
by the defendants
appears below:

<P>

	The summary table shows a significantly higher incidence of PID
<P>

 among IUD users than among the other types of contraceptors reported 
<P>

on.
<P>

	The defendants point to the following alleged shortcomings:
<P>

1.	No information is given in the paper as to the type of IUD used 
<P>

	by the subjects in this study but they would not have included 
<P>

	Cu-7s.  (It was not on the market then).
<P>

2.	There is no information in the paper as to the duration of use and 
<P>

	the incidence of PID among cases.
<P>

3.	No relative risk estimates were reported by the authors.
<P>

4.	The authors state that the study findings should be considered 
<P>

	as being tentative.
<P>

5.	It appears that most of the IUD-associated attacks of PID 
<P>

	referred to in the paper were mild and were treated with the 
<P>

	device in place.
<P>

	Given the above matters the defendants submitted that extrapolation from the
results of the study is "<i>fraught with difficulty</i>".  
<P>

<b><i>Noonan &amp; Adams 1974</i></b>
<P>

	The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the prevalence
of gonorrhoea and the presence of symptoms and the
use of various contraceptive
methods.
<P>

	This study was also carried out in the Family Planning Clinic of Grady
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia amongst a population
of black indigent
women.
<P>

	1,706 women were selected from the clinic being every third non-post partum
patient presenting at the clinic.  They were screened
for cervical gonorrhoea
and questioned for a history of PID symptoms.
<P>

	A non-specific definition of PID was used.  Subjects were classified as being
symptomatic if:
<P>

(a)	they complained of pelvic pain or cramping abdominal pain at 
<P>

	times other than during menstruation; or
<P>

(b)	if the examining physician elicited pelvic tenderness that the 	reviewer
felt was pathological.  Dyspareunia alone was not 
considered a symptom.
<P>

	Among women with symptoms of PID, 20.6% used oral contraceptives, 33.3% used
IUDs and 16.2% used other methods of contraception.
<P>

	Among women diagnosed with gonococcal PID, 0.7% used oral contraceptives, 3.1%
used IUDs and 0.2% used other methods of contraception.
<P>

	There were no relative risk estimates reported.  However it was subsequently
reported in <b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> that women with IUDs had
symptoms of PID 2.5 times more frequently than  women not using any
contraception and 1.8 times more frequently
than women using all other methods
of contraception combined  (Ex. P124 page 854).
<P>

	No information was given as to the type of IUDs being used by subjects in this
study but Cu-7s were not used.
<P>

	The authors stated that the prevalence rate of gonorrhoea was essentially the
same for IUD and other contraceptive users.  They
concluded (page 704) that
none of the methods of contraception (including IUDs) seemed to be associated
with an increase in the prevalence
of gonorrhoeal infection.
<P>

	The increased prevalence of symptoms of PID in IUD users was a comparative
observation to those women who were using methods of
contraception which
provided a chemical or physical barrier against the ascension of bacteria from
the vagina.  The authors hypothesized
that the protective effect of other types
of contraceptors may have given rise to the differing prevalence rates of
PID.
<P>

<b><u>Targum &amp; Wright 1974</u></b>
<P>

	This was a case-control study which examined first-episode acute PID in 50
disadvantaged black and Hispanic patients in a major
New York hospital:
<P>

	For a diagnosis of PID there needed to be a temperature in excess of
37.7<sup>o</sup>C and 2 of the following 3 findings:
<P>

*	lower abdominal pain and tenderness;
<P>

*	cervical motion tenderness;
<P>

*	adnexal tenderness.
<P>

	Two sets of controls were chosen, one from women attending the general medical
clinic and the other from women appearing with sick
children in the paediatric
emergency room.
<P>

	100 controls were selected and their current contraceptive practises were as
follows:
<P>

*	9% IUDs;
<P>

*	50% OCs;
<P>

*	41% no contraception.
<P>

	The current contraceptive practises of the 50 cases were:
<P>

*	48% IUDs
<P>

*	22% OCs
<P>

*	36% no contraception.
<P>

	Of the 24 cases using an IUD, 11 women had Lippes Loops, 8 had the Majzlin
Springs (ultimately recalled by the FDA) and 4 were
using the Saf-T-Coil.  One
women did not know which IUD she was wearing.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-users was 9.3 
<P>

(4.2 - 20.9).
<P>

	The relative risk for IUD users versus non-contraceptors was 7.3 
<P>

(2.9 - 18.4):
<P>

	The relative risk estimates for IUD users in this study is one of the highest
reported in any of the studies and may have been
due in part to the fact that
of the 50 subjects 40 had been hospitalised.
<P>

Of the 50 PID cases, there were 24 IUD users. Of the 100 controls, there were 9
IUD users.  There were no copper devices in the
study.  The relative risk
estimates were accompanied by very wide confidence intervals.   Eschenbach
said, as I have stated above
that in his view those three studies were enough
to lead to the conclusion that there was an increased risk of PID from IUD
use.
<P>

<b>Lippes<i> </i>1975</b>
<P>

	This study was a preliminary report to answer the question "<i>Does the IUD
increase the incidence of pelvic infection?</i>"  It was prepared by Dr Jack
Lippes and presented to the FDA at its hearing on IUDs in August 1974.
<P>

	To prepare for his testimony (and therefore the study) the medical record
library of the Buffalo General Hospital was asked to
review all cases carrying
a discharge diagnosis of PID, salpingitis or endometritis for the year 1973.
91 patients were identified
as a result.
<P>

	The diagnosis of PID was based on acceptance of a discharge diagnosis of PID,
salpingitis or endometritis but was otherwise not
specified.
<P>

	Controls were identified by a review of the charts of all women of
reproductive age with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis for
the years 1972 and
1973.  38 controls were identified.
<P>

	Among the cases identified, 13 of the 91 (14%) were wearing an IUD.  Among
controls, 3 of 38 (8%) were wearing an IUD.  The difference
on these very small
numbers is not statistically significant.
<P>

	One Dalkon Shield associated with a serious bacterial septicaemia was
specifically identified, but otherwise, individual devices
were not
specified.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-users was 1.9 (0.5-7.2).

<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-contraceptors was not
ascertained.
<P>

	Dr Lippes concluded from the data collected that the incidence of PID was
no higher in women wearing an IUD than in women who did
not.  However, he
acknowledged that there was a potential for hospital bias as the PID cases who
were admitted to the hospital were
the more seriously ill patients with PID.
<P>

<b>Phaosavasdi et al 1975</b>
<P>

	This was a retrospective case series in which evidence of PID was observed
during 200 transvaginal tubal sterilisations carried
out at the Chulalongkorn
Hospital, Bangkok between October 1972 and June 1973.
<P>

	200 patients selected from the Family Planning Unit at the hospital underwent
transvaginal tubal sterilisation.  Among the cases,
101 patients were immediate
past users of the Lippes Loop (the only device in the study), 73 were past
users of other contraceptives
and 26 were non-contraceptors.  The authors state
that no prostitutes or other unspecified categories particularly prone to PID
were
included among the cases.
<P>

	PID was diagnosed if at least one of the following were present: 
<P>

*		adhesions
<P>

*		congestion 
<P>

*		tubal occlusion with clubbing or oozing of pus from the fimbria.  
<P>

	No hysterological examination was performed.
<P>

	There were 33 patients with evidence of pelvic inflammatory change.  Among
those 28 (of 101) were Lippes Loop users, 3 (of 73)
were other contraceptive
users and 0 (of 26) were non-contraceptors.  This calculated that 84% of those
with evidence of pelvic inflammatory
diseases were Lippes Loop users, 9% were
other contraceptors and 0% were non-contraceptors.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-users was 9.2 (3.7 - 22.5)
<i>(</i><b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b><i>)</i>: 
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-contraceptors was not
reported.
<P>

	The authors stated that the observations contained in this study were very
preliminary and there was a need for further studies
on larger groups of
women.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> noted that this retrospective
(self-selected) cohort involved a non-specific definition of previous or
current PID which was diagnosed
visually at sterilization.  There was a
reported prevalence rate of 15% of PID in the cohort whose method of selection
(other than
being sterilization patients) was not clear:
<P>

<b>Combined Bangkok Hospital Group 1975</b>
<P>

	This study involved an examination of unsuspected pelvic infection in 1583
healthy, previously fertile Thai women undergoing interval
sterilization over a
5 month period in 1974 at 4 Bangkok hospitals:
<P>

	Cases were taken consecutively.  The diagnosis of PID depended on surgical
putative evidence of past PID including adhesions, hydrosalpinx,
adnexitis,
uterine adhesions or enlarged ovaries.
<P>

	Post-partum sterilization cases were excluded to ensure adequate
visualization.  The pathological examination of tissue was only
undertaken in a
minority of cases and there were no pre-operative cervical smears.
<P>

	Associated demographic information was collected but no information about
prior pelvic infection or sexual history, other than
contraceptive use, was
obtained nor was there any differentiation between the types of devices
used.
<P>

	60% of subjects were sterilized by laparoscopy, 19% by laparotomy and 16% by
culdoscopy.
<P>

	Among the 1583 subjects, 86.5% had used contraception and 71% were current
contraceptors, 13.5% had never used any form of contraception
and 29% were
non-current contraceptors.
<P>

	At sterilization, 10% had putative evidence of unsuspected past PID.
<P>

	The authors then focussed on the largest group with putative evidence, namely,
120 cases involving tubal adhesions.
<P>

	Despite absence of detail in the report, <b>Edelman 1980</b> concluded that
8.9% of cases with tubal adhesions had never used a contraceptive method, 12.3%
had used the IUD only and 4.9% had
used the pill only.  
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUDs versus non-users was 2.1 (1.3-3.3).
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-contraceptors was 1.4
(0.8-2.5) (<b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b><i>)</i>:
<P>

	The authors proposed a risk gradient which showed that IUD only users had the
highest chance of tubal adhesion, pill only users
had the lowest chance and
users of both methods had an intermediate level of chance of tubal adhesion.
<P>

	The authors suggested that there was a high risk of developing adhesions or
hydrosalpinx among women who did not wear or had not
worn the IUDs very long
flattening out to a low and reasonably constant risk over longer wearing
periods.
<P>

	The authors urged caution in relation to the results from this self-selected
population because of the perceived difference between
women seeking
sterilization and women abandoning a non-permanent method.  The reasons for
their discontinuances were not dealt with.
<P>

	The authors also noted that, given the population would never again test their
fecundity, it was not possible to say whether the
lesions would have
compromised their ability to become pregnant.
<P>

<b>Faulkner &amp; Ory 1976</b>
<P>

	This was a case-control study which was designed to investigate the
relationship between PID and IUDs.
<P>

	Following <b>Wright &amp; Laemmle 1968</b> and <b>Noonan &amp; Adams 1974</b>,
this study was also conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia
amongst a population of substantially black women.
<P>

	Cases were selected from women seen in the emergency room of the Hospital.

<P>

	50 febrile PID cases were identified.  These were women who:
<P>

(a)	were seen in the emergency room with a complaint of abdominal 
<P>

	pain for discomfort;
<P>

(b)	were confirmed to have an oral temperature of 38&#176;C or more;
<P>

(c)	had uterine or adnexal tenderness on pelvic examination; and 
<P>

(d)	had no diagnosis other than PID to explain this illness either at 	the time
of the initial visit or within one month.
<P>

	100 cases of afebrile PID were also identified.  These women did not have
confirmed oral temperatures as high as 38&#176;C.
<P>

	200 women were selected as controls from women who:
<P>

(a)	were seen in the same emergency area;
<P>

(b)	had an initial complaint other than abdominal pain or discomfort; 
<P>

	and
<P>

(c)	did not have this complaint diagnosed as a gynaecologic problem 	
<P>

	either at the time of the initial examination or within 1 month.  
<P>

	Distribution of IUDs among cases and controls appear by type in Table 4 of the
article.  Only 1 Gravigard was used by 1 control.
 The balance of the IUDs were
primarily Lippes Loops and Dalkon Shields.  The Dalkon Shield was found in a
higher proportion of febrile
cases than the controls.
<P>

	The relative risk estimates for IUD users versus non users was 5.1 (2.5 -
10.5).
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non contraceptors was 3.7 (1.7
- 8.2).
<P>

	The authors concluded that there was no association between the length of IUD
use and the risk of developing PID or febrile or
afebrile cases.  
<P>

	The numbers in this study are comparatively small.  Among the 50 febrile PID
cases, 19 women were using an IUD.  This can be compares
with 17 women who were
using no method of contraception and 10 women who were using an oral
contraceptive.
<P>

	Among the 100 afebrile PID cases, 24 women were using an IUD.  This compares
with 48 women who were using no method of contraception
and 23 women who were
using an oral contraceptive.

<b>Westrom et al 1976</b>
<P>

	This was a case-control study which examined the frequency of IUD use among
women with acute salpingitis who had been laparoscopically
verified against the
frequency of age matched controls selected from patients seen in the University
Hospital, Lund, Sweden between
January 1971 and June 1975:
<P>

	In the study period, 515 cases of acute salpingitis which had been
laparoscopically verified were treated in the Department of
Obstetrics and
Gynaecology at the University Hospital.  
<P>

	1545 potential controls were matched for age from the Lund regional register
and contacted by postal questionnaire.  Currently
pregnant and women using no
contraception were excluded leaving 741 contracepting controls.
<P>

	The authors reported that in the period up to August 1972, IUDs available in
Sweden consisted of Lippes Loops and Saf-T-Coils.
 After August 1972, the
Copper-T 200 and Gravigard were used almost exclusively.  There was no precise
analysis of cases and controls
by reference to the type of device used.  The
authors state that there had been a significant increase in the frequency of
IUD use
per se both among patients and controls in the period 1971 to 1975.
<P>

	125 of the 515 patients were IUD users compared with 72 of 741 controls.  The
higher rate of usage of IUDs was most pronounced
in women who were less than 20
years of age and who had never been pregnant.
<P>

	The authors concluded that if the relative risk of acute salpingitis in women
not using IUDs (but still contracepting) is 1, then
the relative risk for IUD
users was 3.1 for all women, 6.9 for those who had never been pregnant and 1.7
for those women who had
previously been pregnant.
<P>

	<b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b>, calculated the relative risk estimate in
IUD users versus all other contraceptors as 2.9 (2.1-4.0): 
<P>

	The relative risk estimate in IUD users versus non-contraceptors was not
ascertained.
<P>

	The authors considered that a higher proportion of sexually promiscuous women
amongst the cases than among the controls could possibly
explain the
differences shown but there was no basis reported for asserting that there was
in fact any such difference between the
two groups.

<b>Vessey et al 1976</b>
<P>

	This was the Interim Report of a long term follow-up prospective study of
British women using different methods of contraception
seen by the Oxford
Family Planning Association which commenced in 1968:
<P>

	To be eligible for admission to the study a woman had to be married, aged
25-39, a white British subject, willing to participate,
and either a current
user of oral contraceptives of at least 5 months standing or a current user of
the diaphragm or an IUD of at
least 5 months standing without prior exposure to
oral contraceptives.
<P>

	By the end of July 1974, when recruiting ended, 17,032 subjects had been
admitted.  56.6% were oral contraceptive users, 24.8%
were diaphragm users and
18.6% were IUD users.
<P>

	Cases of PID were classified as acute (surgically confirmed) definite but not
acute (not surgically confirmed) and other (inconclusive
clinical diagnosis
without confirmation).  
<P>

	On admission to the study 0.28% of women reported a past occurrence of
salpingitis or oophoritis.  There were no statistically
significant differences
between oral, diaphragm and IUD users in this group.
<P>

	The report included almost 10,000 woman-years observation of IUD users.  58%
used the Lippes Loop; 29% used the Saf-T-Coil and
13% used an unknown IUD. 
<P>

	Table 19 in the Interim Report records results for salpingitis, PID and
endometritis as a standardized first event rate (per 1000
woman-years)
according to method of contraception actually used during follow-up among
subjects with no past history of salpingitis
on admission.  
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus all other contraceptors was
3.5 (2.1-6.1) <i>(</i><b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980 p.855</b><i>)</i>:
<P>

	The study did not include non-contraceptors.  There was no relative risk
estimate in IUD users versus non-contraceptors reported.
<P>

	Further analysis of the Oxford Family Planning Study resulted in papers by
Vessey et al in 1981 (not tendered) and a reanalysis
by <b>Buchan et al
1990</b><i>.</i>
<P>

	<b>Kessel 1989</b><i> </i>reported that the 1981 paper by <b>Vessey et al</b>
summarized the findings of the Oxford Family Planning Study up to 1979.  By
that time data from 20,482 woman years of use for all
devices had been obtained
and the rate was 1.51 per 1000 woman-years. The data revealed a PID rate of
1.15 per 1000 woman-years in
Lippes Loop users, 2.09 per 1000 women years in
Saf-T-Coil users, 8.09 per women years in Dalkon Shield users and 0.90 per
women
years in Cu-7 users.  
<P>

	Although the Dalkon Shield results were significantly higher, this outcome was
based on only 3 cases in a study where  all non-users
were current
contraceptors.
<P>

 
<P>

	The reanalysis by <b>Buchan et al 1990</b><i> </i>was published 14 years after
the Interim Report.  The authors noted the influence of the WHO Scientific
Group Technical Report (<b>WHO 1987</b>) which had identified a number of what
were said to be significant epidemiological flaws in earlier studies, including
previous reports
from the Oxford Family Planning Study:
<P>

	Using multiple regression analysis the authors subjected the data to control
for age, parity, social class, cigarette smoking and
age at first marriage.

<P>

	Parity was excluded (there were no nullips).  
<P>

	Having examined the remaining associations without reference to the influence
of contraceptive methods, it was decided to allow
for the influence of age,
social class, cigarette smoking and age at first marriage.  These results are
reported in Tables I to IV
of the study.
<P>

	First hospital referral rates for acute, definite and other pelvic
inflammatory disease in relation to current use of various contraceptive
methods are given in Tables V-VII.
<P>

	IUD users were divided into non-medicated devices (Lippes Loop, Saf-T-Coils
and Dalkon Shields) versus the more modern medicated
devices (Cu-7s and
Copper-Ts).
<P>

	The reference group was taken as women who used any other method of
contraception.  This would have included a large number of
oral contraceptive
users.
<P>

	Table VIII records the first hospital referral rates per 1000 woman years for
all pelvic inflammatory disease by contraceptive
method.  Non-medicated IUDs
gave rise to a relative risk versus non-users of 3.3 (2.3-5.0).  Medicated IUD
users had a relative risk
estimate versus non-users of 1.8 (0.8-4.0), which was
said to be not statistically significant.
<P>

	Table VIII also confirmed that the protective effect of oral contraceptives is
statistically significant.  The authors indicated
that there was then
considerable evidence that barrier methods and female sterilisation are also
protective. 
<P>

	Among current users of an IUD who have had previous exposure to a Dalkon
Shield, the relative risk of hospital referral for PID
was estimated as 4.7
(2.1-9.0) compared to current users of IUDs who had had no exposure to a Dalkon
Shield.  Use of the Dalkon Shield
appeared to be a greater risk than other
inert and medicated devices.
<P>

	The authors aligned their finding in relation to the relatively lower rate of
referral for PID in users of modern medicated devices
by comparison with older
inert devices with the results of the two leading studies on tubal infertility
which had reported lower
risks of tubal occlusion in users of copper containing
devices than in users of unmedicated devices (<b>Daling et al 1985, Cramer et
al 1985</b>).
<P>

	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the data set did not allow
an effective study of the relationship between the
onset of PID and the
duration and use of IUDs as was possible in the other significant data set, the
Women's Health Study.
<P>

<b>Eschenbach et al 1977</b>
<P>

	This study involved the case-control matching of patients with gonococcal and
non-gonococcal PID against control subjects without
PID who had uncomplicated
gonorrhoea or no gonorrhoea in order to elucidate risk factors which contribute
to infection of the Fallopian
tubes and pelvic peritoneum by bacteria which
normally remain confined to the cervix and vagina.
<P>

	204 women with a diagnosis of acute PID were recruited between July 1972 and
February 1973 (102 consecutive women) and between
January 1974 and July 1974
(102 consecutive women) at University of Washington affiliated hospitals, were
matched against 308 consecutive
sexually active women without PID who had
entered a Seattle VD clinic between February 1972 and December 1972 and 399
consecutive
sexually active women without PID or contraceptive related
complaints who had attended the gynaecology clinics at the University
of
Washington Hospital and Harbourview Medical Centre between February 1973 and
July 1974.
<P>

	The clinical diagnosis of acute PID required the patient to have had:
<P>

*		pain in the lower abdomen for less than or equal to 3 weeks 
<P>

	duration, 
<P>

*		abdominal tenderness and, 
<P>

*		on pelvic examination, moderate to severe tenderness maximally 
<P>

	localized to one or both adnexal areas with involuntary guarding 
<P>

	proportional to the degree of tenderness. 
<P>

	Diagnosis of PID was only laparoscopically confirmed in 80 of 204 cases.  Of
these 80, salpingitis was diagnosed in 18 of 20 women
who subsequently
underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy because they presented with a clinical
course which was atypical.
<P>

	Each PID patient was matched with a patient in the concurrent comparison group
by age, race, marital status, presence or absence
of gonococcal infection,
parity and number of sex partners within the past 6 months. 
<P>

	Among the cases (204 patients), 30% were using an IUD; 23% were using oral
contraceptives; 4% were using mechanical (barrier) methods;
1.5% had undergone
tubal ligation; 0.5% were using the rhythm method and 41% were
non-contraceptors.
<P>

	Among the combined controls (707 patients) 15% were using an IUD; 39% were
using oral contraceptives; 8% were using mechanical
(barrier) methods; 5% had
undergone tubal ligation; 1% had had a hysterectomy; 1% were using the rhythm
method and 30% were non-contraceptors.
<P>

	Case-control matching for the analysis of contraceptive methods produced 173
matched pairs (Table II).  In these pairs, 29% of
cases versus 11% of controls
used an IUD.  Oral contraceptive use was lower amongst PID patients (24%) than
among the matched controls
(42%).
<P>

	In these 173 matched pairs, there were 40 pairs in which the PID patient was
using an IUD but the control was not.  In 9 pairs,
the PID patient was not
using an IUD but the control was.  This ratio, expressed as a relative risk, of
4.44 was statistically significant.
<P>

	The analysis was then further limited by exclusion of women who had undergone
tubal ligation or hysterectomy and all non-contraceptors.
 Among the balance,
50 of 99 PID patients (50%) and 19 of 114 controls (17%) were using IUDs.
<P>

	At 95% confidence, the relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-users
was calculated at 4.4 (3.0-6.9).
<P>

	The authors concluded that PID was attributable to use of an IUD in the case
of 77% of IUD users.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-contraceptors calculated
by <b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> as 4.0.  (No confidence interval was
available.)  <b>P124 <i>page 855.</i></b>
<P>

	Among IUD users, 70% used Dalkon Shields,  18% used Lippes Loops, 11% used the
Saf-T-Coil and there was only one case who used
the Cu-7.
<P>

	No type of IUD was specifically associated with a disproportionate risk of
PID, although the number of IUDs other than the Dalkon
Shield were probably too
small to permit a statistical comparison.
<P>

	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that this paper is significantly
at odds with other studies for the following reasons:
<P>

(a)	The study included a disproportionate number of Dalkon Shield 	
<P>

	users by comparison with only one identified Cu-7.
<P>

(b)	The authors found no increased risk of PID with an increased 	frequency of
intercourse or number of sexual partners.
<P>

(c)	The highest relative risk was in the higher socio-economic group, 	
<P>

	the lowest relative risk was in the lower socio-economic group.
<P>

(d)	The IUD was usually in place several months before the 	development of
PID.
<P>

(e)	Fever was less common in IUD cases.
<P>

<b>Thaler 1978</b>
<P>

<b>Edelman 1980, Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b><i> </i>and <b>Kessel 1989</b>
all refer to a paper by Thaler et al entitled "<i>Intrauterine device and
pelvic inflammatory disease</i>" published in the International Journal of
Fertility in 1978 (not tendered).
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Kessel 1989</b><i> </i>indicates that the Thaler study took place in
Haifa, Israel, between 1969 and 1970:
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Edelman 1980</b><i> </i>stated that the Thaler study was a
case-control study in which 101 cases, not including women with recurrent PID,
were matched against
101 controls for age, current marital status and interval
since last pregnancy termination but that the type of IUDs were not stated.
<P>

	The study was said to have reported a relative risk estimate for IUD users
versus non-users of 2.3 (0.9-5.9).
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> point out that the population from
which the controls  for the study were drawn was unspecified and that the study
was limited to
first event acute PID only.
<P>

<b>Flesh et al 1979</b>
<P>

	This was a case-control study conducted in a hospital clinic serving an
indigent population in Central and East Los Angeles.  
<P>

	The authors asserted that recent studies had used inappropriate control
groups, (ie women using methods of contraception which
reduced the risk of
developing acute salpingitis). They asserted that it was therefore not known
whether IUDs increase the chance
of developing acute salpingitis compared to
non contraception.  However, they did not take any alleged protection effect of
using
certain contraceptors  into account in their analysis.
<P>

	The study initially involved 163 consecutive cases who were women hospitalized
with a clinical admission diagnosis of acute salpingitis.
 These were
ultimately reduced to 146.  
<P>

	There was no written diagnostic criteria for hospitalising patients with
salpingitis but those hospitalised were generally those
with physical signs of
acute pelvic peritonitis.  All of the study group had uterine or adnexal
tenderness and a temperature greater
than 99.8&#176; on admission.  
<P>

	
<P>

	There were 222 controls who were ultimately reduced to 199.  They were women
presenting to the minor trauma section of the emergency
room for treatment for
minor lacerations, burns, fractures and other injuries..
<P>

	Four variables were analysed: 
<P>

*		black versus non black; 
<P>

*		IUD versus no IUD; 
<P>

*		multiple sex partners versus one sex partner; and 
<P>

*		previous salpingitis versus no previous salpingitis.  
<P>

	The authors indicated that the control group in the study was not perfect but
concluded that their results demonstrated that the
number of sexual partners in
the previous 12 months was a major risk factor for PID.  They also warned
against women using IUDs who
are from a low socio-economic status, who are
black or who have had previous salpingitis on the basis that the study only
dealt with
women from a low socio-economic population and the author did not
know what the results would be in other socio-economic populations.
<P>

	There was no information given as to the type of IUDs used nor as to the
duration of use.  Relative risk estimates were not calculated
in the paper but
<b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> estimated the relative risk of IUDs versus
non users in this study to be 2.2 (1.3 - 3.9):
<P>

<b>Maqueo et al 1979</b>
<P>

	This is the report of a study of the histology of the fallopian tubes in
asymptomatic women who had used an IUD for at least one
and usually two years
by comparison with asymptomatic post-partum women and normally menstruating
women scheduled for surgical sterilisation.
<P>

	Among 225 patients, 75 had had an inert IUD in place for at least one year, 75
underwent a salpingectomy 2-3 days post-partum and
75 were normally
menstruating women (controls) who had an elective salpingectomy at various
stages of their cycles.
<P>

	On histological examination, there was no difference in the frequency of
oedema and congestion in the tissue of control subjects
versus those using an
IUD whereas there was a higher frequency of this alteration in post partum
subjects which was statistically
significant.
<P>

	An analysis of the intensity of acute inflammatory infiltrate
(patchy/moderate/marked) does not indicate any statistically significant
difference between the distribution in control patients (non-contraceptors) and
that observed in IUD or post-partum subjects.
<P>

	The authors refer to the histological observation reported by the <b>Combined
Bangkok Hospital Group (1975</b>) where only one of 39 subjects with external
adhesive disease showed histological evidence of salpingitis.
<P>

	The authors also refute the proposition by <b>Smith and Soderstrom</b> that
salpingitis "<i>similar to that found in the endometrium</i>" and, by
inference, possibly an extension thereof, is a concomitant of IUD use.
<P>

	The IUD device types were inert but were not otherwise specified.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b><i> </i>calculated a relative risk
estimate for IUD users versus non-contraceptors of 1.5 (0.8-2.8). <b>Senanayake
&amp; Kramer </b>stated that the small number of subjects, the absence of any
IUD users with a recently inserted device and a non-specific case definition
for PID limited the use of this study:
<P>

<b>Ryden et al 1979</b>
<P>

	This study involved an analysis of the influence of different contraceptive
techniques on the incidence of PID in 672 female patients
with gonorrhoea:
<P>

	The lowest frequency of PID was found in patients using hormonal contraceptors
(8.8%).  This compared with 23.5% of patients using
IUDs and 15.1% of patients
using neither technique.
<P>

	Between 1973 and 1977, 744 women were treated for uro-genital gonorrhoea at
the University Hospital in Link&ouml;ping, Sweden.
 72 women were excluded due
to pregnancy, sterilisation, being post-menopausal, as non- contraceptors or
because of doubtful diagnosis
of PID.  
<P>

	Among the remaining 672 patients, PID was diagnosed in 87 (12.9%).
<P>

	PID was confirmed by laparoscopy.  In all cases the diagnosis required a
reddened serosa of the tubes, oedema of the tubal wall
or purulent discharge
from the abdominal orifice of the tube.
<P>

	Each case was then matched against 2 uncomplicated gonorrhoea patients.
<P>

	All of the IUD users had used copper devices with the exception of some
isolated instances of use of plastic devices.  The authors
determined that it
was not possible to evaluate any difference in risk of PID in patients using
copper or plastic devices due to
the small number of plastic devices.
<P>

	Among the PID cases, 30 used hormonal contraceptives, 20 used IUDs and 37 used
neither hormonal contraception nor an IUD.
<P>

	Among the controls, 90 used hormonal contraceptives, 20 used IUDs and 64 used
neither.
<P>

	Each group was examined by age, marital status and the number of sexual
contacts (1, 2, 3, 4 or more).  
<P>

	By using multiple regression analysis, the authors concluded that, apart from
birth control methods, no other parameter (age, marital
status, number of
sexual contacts) influenced the incidence of PID in the patients.  
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-users was calculated by
<b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> at 2.3 (1.2-4.6) which difference is said
by the authors to be statistically significant:
<P>

	The relative risk for IUD users versus non-contraceptors was 
<P>

1.7 (0.8-3.6).
<P>

	The authors found that a statistical analysis demonstrated a significantly
lower incidence of PID amongst hormonal contraceptive
users than IUD users and
users of neither method.  However, it was said there was no significant
difference found between IUD users
and patients using neither hormonal
contraceptives nor IUDs.  Cervical gonorrhoea was also more common in women
with PID than in
women with uncomplicated gonorrhoea.
<P>

	The authors considered that the results obtained in the present study, with a
higher incidence of PID in the IUD group; and a lower
incidence in the hormonal
contraceptive group compared to patients using neither method, were related to
the contraceptive method
per se.
<P>

<b>Kaufman et al 1980</b>
<P>

	This was a hospital-based case-control study of the relationship between IUD
use and first episodes of PID amongst sexually active
women.  The effects of
duration of use of particular IUDs were also investigated.  
<P>

	There were 44 patients and 259 hospital control subjects.  All of the women
used IUDs or oral contraceptives.  The age adjusted
relative risk for those
using IUDs at the time of admission was 6.5 (95% confidence material 3.2 to
13.0).
<P>

	The records of 185 pre-menopausal women with a discharge diagnosis of PID,
salpingitis or pelvic abscess at hospitals in 7 metropolitan
areas in the
United States, one hospital in Canada and two in Israel were reviewed to
identify cases adjudged to be first episodes
of PID.  120 such cases were
identified.
<P>

	From 4891 pre-menopausal women available as potential controls, 2058 were
selected as suitable on the basis of having a first diagnosis
judged not to be
related to contraceptive use.  Women with gynaecological disorders were
excluded as were women who had recently
undergone an abortion or suffered an
ectopic pregnancy.  The analysis was then confined to women who were presumed
to be sexually
active, by virtue of their use of IUDs or other contraceptives.
All cases and controls were less than 45 years of age. 
<P>

	The study reported on a final analysis of 44 subjects and 259 control
subjects.
<P>

	Among the subjects, half of all diagnoses were based on laparotomy,
laparoscopy or observation of pus emerging from the cervix.
 The balance were
diagnosed on the basis of clinical evidence such as fever and adnexal
tenderness.
<P>

	Table IV of the report sets out the relative risk of PID amongst IUD users by
reference to specific devices.  The referent group
were oral contraceptive
users rather than non-contraceptors.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for Cu-7 users versus non-users was 3.8 (9 of 44
cases versus 29 of 259 controls).  The relative risk
for Dalkon Shield users
was 12.3 (5 of 11 versus 5 of 259).  Lippes Loop users had a relative risk of
7.9 (11 of 44 versus 17 of
259).  For users of the Saf-T-Coil, the relative
risk was 9.2 (3 of 44 versus 4 of 259).  The referent group consisted of 14 of
44
 cases versus 172 of 259 controls.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> calculated an overall relative risk
estimate for IUD users versus non-users of 7.9 (3.7-16.9) and expressed their
view that the limitation
of the study population to only sexually active women
who used either IUDs or oral contraceptives meant that no other comparison
group was included, producing a spuriously low relative risk for oral
contraceptive users and a spuriously elevated risk for IUD
users.
<P>

	In 1983 <b>Kaufman et al</b> published a further report (not tendered).
According to <b>Kessel 1989</b>, this further report updated the study period
to March 1981 with a total subject population of 460.  The relative risk for
IUD users
versus non-users reported was said to be 4.7 (3.1-7.1) which, when
adjusted for the use of oral contraceptives, was 3.2 (1.6-6.6).
 However, the
relative risk for users of the Dalkon Shield versus non-users was 78.7
(22.7-272).
<P>

<b>Osser et al 1980</b>
<P>

	This was a study conducted in Malmo, Sweden to investigate whether PID was
more common amongst IUD users than in a sexually active
age matched control
group and, if so, whether it is more common amongst those who have not
previously been pregnant:
<P>

<b>	</b>The authors concluded that the risk of PID was raised twofold by IUD
use and that there was no significant difference<b> </b>between women<b>
</b>who had never been pregnant and those who had been pregnant.
<P>

	The records of 720 patients admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology at the General Hospital in Malmo between 1973
and 1975 were traced
and all relevant gynaecological and obstetric notes were extracted.  
<P>

	Age matched controls were then selected by questionnaire in relation to the
month that the matched case was in hospital for PID.
 Apart from questions
concerning pregnancy and health, each potential control was queried about her
use of any method of contraception
in that month, the number of sexual partners
she had had and how often she had had intercourse during that month.  Women who
were
not apparently sexually active were excluded.  By this method, 690 of the
720 patients were matched with one control each and were
included in the
study..
<P>

	A diagnosis of PID was confirmed by laparoscopy in 86.1% of cases.  
<P>

	The authors asserted that a complete statistical analysis of the frequency and
distribution of PID in the balance of patients gave
the same frequency of IUD
use and the same risks in the different groups.
<P>

	Among the patients, 31.9% were IUD users, 23.0% were users of oral
contraceptives and 45.1% used other methods or none.  Among
the controls, 16.5%
were IUD users, 47.1% used oral contraceptives and 36.5% used other or none.
The relative risk estimate for IUD
users versus non-users was said to be 2.1
(1.6-2.7).  <b>Senanayake &amp; Kramer 1980</b> calculated a slightly different
risk of 2.0 (1.6-2.6).
<P>

	The type of IUDs included in the study were not specified.
<P>

	These authors found a relative risk of PID for parous women of 2.6 compared
with that for nulliparous women of 1.6.  This difference
between parous and
nulliparous women contrasts with results reported in earlier studies but it
does not appear to be statistically
significant. 
<P>

	The authors suggested that whereas Professor Westrom had considered the mere
use of a contraceptive as proof of sexual activity
and excluded women not using
contraceptives, this study had made greater efforts to ensure that all controls
were sexually active.
<P>

	As in <b>Westrom et al 1976</b>, this study reported more oral contracepting
controls than patients and that there appeared to be a significant protective
effect
which reduced the relative risk of PID by two thirds.
<P>

	In reviewing this paper, <b>Senanayake and Kramer 1980</b> calculated the
relative risk for IUD use compared to no contraceptive use as 1.6 (1.2-2.1),
which is the lowest  statistically significant
increase in risk shown in any of
the studies reviewed by them.  
<P>

<b>Paavonen &amp; Vesterinen 1980</b>
<P>

	This study sought to evaluate the contraceptive practices of hospitalized
patients with clinically verified acute salpingitis,
in particular the
frequency of IUD use, compared with that of controls for asymptomatic partners
of men suffering from non-gonococcal
urethritis.  
<P>

	The control group was chosen by the authors because of their concern that
prior studies (cited in Table I of the study) may have
included sexual exposure
differences between cases and controls making it difficult to define the actual
risk of salpingitis in IUD
users.
<P>

	The patient series consisted of 144 women treated for symptoms of acute PID at
the University Central Hospital in Helsinki, Finland
between October 1977 and
August 1978.
<P>

	Clinical diagnosis of acute salpingitis was based on:
<P>

*		pelvic pain of short duration, 
<P>

*		increased vaginal discharge, 
<P>

*		tender adnexal masses, 
<P>

*		increased ESR (greater than 15) and usually fever.  
<P>

	
<P>

	All patients were hospitalized because of severe symptoms.
<P>

	The control group consisted of 240 consecutive women below 50 years of age who
were examined at the same outpatient clinic during
the same period of time and
was limited to women whose partners were suffering from non-gonococcal
urethritis diagnosed within the
same hospital.  Following the exclusion of
pregnant women, 229 of these 240 women were included in the study.
<P>

	The patients provided a contraceptive history by answering a standard
questionnaire.  They were divided between IUD use, oral contraceptive
use and
use of other methods or none at all.  The third category was selected to
represent the basal level of disease when calculating
relative risks for
salpingitis.
<P>

	The types of IUD in the study were not specified however copper devices were
included.
<P>

	Among these patients, 58% were IUD users, 11% were oral contraceptive users
and 31% used other methods or none at all.  Among the
controls, 32% were IUD
users, 30% were oral contraceptive users and 38% used other methods or none at
all.
<P>

	The authors estimated the relative risk for salpingitis in IUD users versus
the referent group, other methods or none at all was
2.06 (1.23-3.46).  This
appears to be attributable mainly to a higher relative risk 2.20,  (1.09-4.43)
in nulliparous women.  Oral
contraceptives were significantly protective with a
relative risk of 0.37 (0.19 - 0.73).
<P>

	Table IV of the article shows the relative risk in parous women as 1.92 but
the confidence interval crossed unity.  In nulliparous
women, the relative risk
was statistically significant but the lower confidence interval was only just
above unity.
<P>

	The referent group (other method or none at all) included users of barrier
methods of contraception which, themselves, are protective
against the
transmission of STDs.
<P>

<b>Burkman et al 1981</b>
<P>

	This is the first of 3 papers <b>(Burkman et al 1981, Lee et al 1981
</b>and<b> Lee et al 1988</b>) which analysed data collected through the
Women's Health Study.  This was a concurrent case-control study conducted at 16
hospitals
in 9 cities throughout the United States.  It was designed to examine
the relationship between the use of an IUD and PID severe enough
to require
hospitalization:
<P>

	Data collection for the study commenced in October 1976 and concluded in
1978.
<P>

	In attempting to detect whether the use of an IUD resulted in serious
complications which required hospitalisation, the Women's
Health Study examined
uterine perforation, PID, vaginal haemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, foetal loss,
abruptio placentae and placenta
previa.  <b>Burkman et al 1981</b> and the
subsequent reports examined the findings of the Women's Health Study regarding
PID.
<P>

	Subjects in the study were between 18 and 44 years of age, sexually active,
not surgically sterile (and the partner not surgically
sterile) and
menstruating within the last year.  Women who had been pregnant in the previous
6 weeks were excluded.  In addition,
women with a hospital discharge diagnosis
of epilepsy, thromboembolism, cerebrovascular disease or cancer were
excluded.
<P>

	Cases were confined to patients who required hospitalization with a diagnosis
of PID which diagnosis had been confirmed on discharge.
<P>

	Patients were presumed to have an  infection of the upper genital tract if
they had:
<P>

*		low abdominal pain, fever
<P>

*		adnexal pain on examination
<P>

*		adnexal masses and 
<P>

*		vaginal discharge.  
<P>

	PID cases were then sub-categorized as: 
<P>

*		certain (visualization of the adnexa or the draining of an 
<P>

	abscessed cavity) 
<P>

*		moderately certain (hospitalization with acute symptoms but no 
<P>

	surgery),   and 
<P>

*		less certain (discharge diagnosis of PID without surgery and not 
<P>

	acute).
<P>

	From 2761 potential PID cases, 1447 patients were finally classified as having
PID and were included in the study.
<P>

	Controls were drawn from women admitted to the same hospital during the same
period but excluding women admitted for several diseases
that might influence
contraceptive practice.  Both surgical and medical controls were admitted.
However, in the absence of any discernible
difference, the two groups were
combined in the analysis.  While controls were not matched to cases, they were
parallelled by hospital
and time of admission.
<P>

	From 7199 potential controls, 3453 women were included in the study as
controls.
<P>

	Age, race, gravidity, parity, sexual activity and number of sexual partners
were all considered potentially confounding factors
and were analysed using a
multi-variate analysis to determine whether IUD use had any effect in the
presence of other risk factors.
<P>

	In order to determine contraceptive method women who had used a method during
the 30 days prior to hospital admission or, for IUD
users, had the IUD present
at the time of admission or had had it removed within 30 days prior to
admission were all included as
current users of the various contraceptive
methods.
<P>

	An analysis of past users and women who had never used contraception produced
little discernible difference and accordingly those
two groups were combined
and labelled as non-users.
<P>

	The study was designed to ensure that the non-contracepting group did not
include women who very recently ceased using methods
known to be relatively
protective against PID, such as oral contraceptives.
<P>

	Among cases, 22% were IUD users, 15% oral contraceptive users, 8% barrier
users, 5% used other methods and 50% were non-contraceptors.
 Among controls,
15% were IUD users, 29% were oral contraceptive users, 13% were barrier users,
15% used other methods and 28% were
non-contraceptors.
<P>

	27% of cases versus 16% of controls had had more than one sex partner in the
last six months.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate for IUD users versus non-users was 1.6 (1.4-1.9).
In patients with a PID history, this relative risk
was 1.2 (1.0-1.6) whereas
patients without a history of PID had a higher relative risk of 2.1 (1.8-2.5).
It was submitted that this
report of an increased relative risk for patients
without a history of PID was anomalous given earlier findings and argues
against
the proposition that previous PID compromises the host tissue against
the threat of future episodes.
<P>

	Table VI on page 274 of the article provides a ranking of selected risk
factors for PID among women without a prior PID history.
 The highest relative
risks were associated with a woman's number of sexual partners and potential
for exposure to STDs.  Other significant
relevant risk factors included women
who were black and under the age of 25.  These relative risks were all greater
than current
use of an IUD.  
<P>

	There were no major differences between nulligravid and gravid women with or
without adjustment for age, race, sexual activity
and number of partners.
<P>

<b>Lee et al 1983</b>
<P>

	In this analysis 657 cases and 2566 controls were identified in the Women's
Health Study and data was analysed to attempt to determine
the PID risks
associated with individual IUD types.
<P>

	The risk of PID by different contraceptive methods compared with women who
used no contraceptive method was analysed.  The results
appear in Table 1
of the article.  Oral contraceptives and barrier methods were found to be
protective against PID whereas IUDs were
found to have a relative risk of
1.9.
<P>

	The next matter analysed was the risk of PID associated with the various types
of IUDs.  This had not been done before.  The results
are set out in
Table 2 of the article.  Compared with users of other types of IUDs,
Dalkon Shield users had 5 times the risk of pelvic
inflammatory disease.  Cu-7
users had a relative risk of 1.9.
<P>

	The analysis continued by excluding the Dalkon Shield users.  It was then
found that the increased risk of PID was greater in the
first four months after
insertion than after that time.  The highest PID risk was within the first
month, a point estimate of 3.8.
 However, after the first four months, the
relative risk was 1.1.  These results are set out in Table 4 of the article.
<P>

	The study then further analysed the effect of duration of use by specific IUD
types.  The relative risk for Cu-7 users in the first
four months after
insertion was 3.3 and after four months was 1.3.  Both these figures are higher
than for the Lippes Loop whose
figures were 2.5 and 1.0.
<P>

	The defendants submitted that the main finding of Dr Lee's 1983 analysis is
that the risk of PID from all IUDs was double that
of using no contraception.
However, part of this risk is due to the Dalkon Shield because it had five
times greater risk than other
IUD types.  Once the Dalkon Shield users were
excluded from the analysis, it was submitted the increased risk was confined to
the
first four months after insertion.  This submission must be considered in
the light of the figures set out above.
<P>

	It was submitted that the duration of use results reported by this study
represented a significant advance in state-of-art knowledge
about iatrogenic
PID.  There had been previous reports of PID incidence rates over duration of
use, but they had provided only limited
information.
<P>

<b>Witoonpanich et al 1984</b>
<P>

	This was the report of a multinational case-control study of PID in relation
to contraceptive use initiated through the World Health
Organisation Special
Program of Research Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction and
conducted concurrently in 12
centres located in 10 developed and developing
countries worldwide.  
<P>

	The objective was to compare characteristics of patients with acute febrile
episodes of moderate or severe PID with the characteristics
of controls and, in
doing so, to take into account the extent of PID associated with contraception
in developing countries:
<P>

	Cases included women aged 15-44 with acute PID treated as inpatients or
outpatients between March 1978 and December 1979.
<P>

	A definitive diagnosis of PID required:
<P>

*		a temperature of 38&#176;C or higher within 24 hours of presentation 	
<P>

suprapubic tenderness with guarding on physical examination 
<P>

	and, 
<P>

*		in addition to these mandatory signs, on vaginal examination 
<P>

	there should have been at least tenderness on movement of the 
<P>

	cervix. 
<P>

*		adnexal tenderness or a palpable adnexal mass.  
<P>

*		Operative diagnosis was acceptable and, where possible,
<P>

	bacteriology and histopathology was performed.
<P>

	Controls were selected from non-gynaecological non-obstetrical hospital
admissions or outpatients in a six month period before
or after the
identification of each case. Controls were then individually matched (2 for 1)
by age band, parity, marital status and
by in or out patient status.  Controls
were also matched by post-abortal or post-partum status.
<P>

	Subjects were questioned as to this relevant medical history and use of
current and previous contraceptive types.  However, due
to cultural sensitivity
in some centres, the study did not obtain a history of sexual activity and
matching for marital status was
used as a proxy.  It was submitted that in
light of the findings from the Women's Health Study, the use of this proxy
introduced
a problematic bias.
<P>

	There were 968 cases and 1936 controls identified. From this, 862 initial
case-control sets included 608 sets of women who were
either nulliparous or had
a pregnancy which terminated more than 6 weeks prior to interview were
studied.
<P>

	Types of devices were not differentiated in the study.
<P>

	The relative risk estimate of the first episode of PID in IUD users compared
with non-contraceptors reported ranged from 11.5 (3.6-36.2)
in current
nulliparous IUD users in developed countries to 4.1 (1.1-15.1) in current
parous users in developed countries.  When differentiating
between first
episodes and recurrent PID and between nulliparous and parous women, the study
produced increased relative risks associated
with IUD use ranging between low
and statistically insignificant risks to high risks with very wide confidence
intervals.  
<P>

The authors stated that the inability to properly assess sexual activity would
introduce serious bias if a higher proportion of
cases were generally active
compared with the controls.
<P>

<b>Cramer et al 1985</b>
<P>

	The  study was directed by Dr Cramer of Harvard University. It was a
case-control study conducted at 7 different centres across
the North American
continent designed to investigate tubal infertility and IUD use.  Data was
collected between 1981 and 1983.  Over
2,000 potential cases were interviewed
and over 4,000 controls were identified.  
<P>

	
<P>

	Eventually 388 women with tubal disease confirmed by HSG or laparoscopy were
identified and used in the analysis.  The profiles
of the cases and controls
are set out in Table 1 of the article. 
<P>

	The study concluded inter alia:
<P>

1.	The adjusted risk of primary tubal infertility associated with any 
<P>

	IUD use before a first time birth was 2.0 (95% confidence limits 
<P>

	1.5 to 2.6) relative to non-use.
<P>

2.	Users of copper IUDs had a risk of 1.6 (1.1 to 2.4).
<P>

3.	Women who reported having only one sexual partner had no
<P>

	increased rate of primary tubal infertility associated with IUD 	use.
<P>

4.	Tubal infertility is associated with IUD use but less so with
<P>

	copper IUDs.
<P>

	Cramer stated:
<P>

		"In general, the use of an IUD by women with a history 
<P>

of a genital or pelvic infection doubled their baseline risk.  As important,
even women without a history of infection at the time
of IUD insertion had a
significantly increased risk of tubal infertility from the IUD.  Thus, absence
of prior infection cannot be
used as an indicator that the use of an IUD by a
nulliparous woman will be safe."  (p.946, RHC, middle para). 
<P>

	
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that the duration of IUD use (Table 3 of the article)
showed an elevated risk for the first 3 months and
a more gradual increase
thereafter.  They also submitted that these results are contrary to the
defendants' submission that the increased
risk of PID is limited to iatrogenic
risk.  
<P>

	The defendants submit that the plaintiffs' submission is erroneous for the
following reasons:
<P>

	First, the duration of use estimates are for all IUDs including the Dalkon
Shield which the authors acknowledge artificially elevated
the relative risk
estimates. 
<P>

	
<P>

	Second, the study was designed to look at tubal infertility as opposed to
episodes of PID.  Accordingly, duration of use data cannot
provide any insight
concerning the impact of iatrogenic risk.  The cases in this study were all
women who were presenting for tubal
infertility.  Causal factors for their
infertility had all occurred at some unknown time in their past.  No data were
collected on
past episodes of PID or when it had occurred in relation to
contraceptive use.
<P>

	Therefore, it was submitted the duration of use results in Table 3 of the
article demonstrate something in the nature of cumulative
incidence rates of
tubal infertility.  It was submitted that tubal infertility is not PID and they
are not the same as the relative
risk estimates for PID of the kind presented
in the Women's Health Study (<b>Lee et al 1983</b> Table 5):
<P>

	It was submitted that if results for IUD users for less than 3 months are
reported as opposed to IUD users of more than 3 years,
it is inevitable that
additional risk factors will be incorporated and additional cases of tubal
infertility will be identified.
 More events happen as more time elapses.
Multi-variate analysis attempts to control for some of these known confounding
variables
but it cannot control for all of them so it was submitted that there
was a cumulative incidence effect.
<P>

	In Table 4 of the article the authors set out their findings of the influence
of certain subject characteristics on the risk of
primary tubal infertility.
They reported that women who had never used an IUD but reported having more
than one sexual partner had
a higher relative risk of tubal infertility than
women who had only one partner and did not use IUDs.  Further they reported
women
who had used a copper IUD and reported having only one sexual partner had
no increased risk of tubal infertility.  Finally women
who reported suffering a
minor infection in the past (genital herpes, venereal warts, trichomonas
infection or vaginitis other than
due to yeast) had an increased relative risk
of tubal infertility even if they had not used an IUD.  The relative risk
estimates
and confidence intervals are set out in the table below:

<P>

In Table 3 of the article the relative risk of primary tubal infertility for
women using a copper device only was 1.6 (1.1 - 2.4).
 Such an estimate is
similar to the relative risk of primary tubal infertility for women who had
never used an IUD before but had
either more than one partner or suffered an
episode of a minor infection in the past.  The defendants submitted that when
the relative
risk estimate for copper IUD users with one partner (1.1) is
compared to those other figures (1.5), the results of the study do not
support
the plaintiffs' submissions.  The authors concluded that the risk of tubal
infertility does not apply to women with a single
partner at low risk for
sexually transmitted diseases and that for women who have had one child copper
IUDs may offer a relatively
safe, if not risk-free, alternative to other
methods.
<P>

	In relation to the number of sexual partners which a woman had Cramer made the
following observation:
<P>

		"The risk of tubal infertility associated with IUD use was
<P>

 confined to women with more than one sexual partner.  The 
<P>

usefulness of the number of partners as a predictor variable as defined by this
study should not be overstated, however, because
it is based on the life-time
number of partners reported at interview, rather than on the number of partners
by the time of the first
use of an IUD.  Furthermore, not only the number of
partners, but obviously their likelihood of having sexually transmitted
diseases,
is important." 
<P>

(p.946, RHC, middle para). 
<P>

<b>Daling et al 1985</b>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Daling et al 1985</b> follows <b>Cramer et al 1985</b> in the same
edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.  In their introductory remarks,
the authors offered a summary of the
state of the literature as at 1985 in
relation to the increased risk of infertility for IUD users as a result of PID.
They said that
it was likely that users of an IUD had an increased risk of
subsequent involuntary infertility (through their susceptibility to
salpingitis)
although the data fell short of being conclusive.
<P>

	In her evidence, Professor Daling said that this state-of-art conclusion
related not only to the 12 references footnoted in her
paper but was an
accepted part of general knowledge at the time.  (<b>T2889 line 53 - T2890 line
6).</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>Daling dealt with Cramer in Ex. P209, Tab 2, para 20:
<P>

		"The selection out of one non-significant finding among
<P>

		monogamous women does not accurately depict this
<P>

		study's conclusions.  Cramer found a significant 
<P>

		increase in risk of infertility among women who use the
<P>

		Copper IUD, RR=1.9." 
<P>

	Cramer dealt with criticism of his study in a letter to the New England
Journal of Medicine on 5 September, 1985 when he said:
<P>

		"Dr Hasson's primary arguments may perhaps be
<P>

		paraphrased as follows:  There is only one cause of tubal 		
<P>

		infertility, and that cause is infection with sexually transmitted
diseases; therefore, IUDs cannot be a cause of tubal 		
<P>

		infertility.  Even if one assumes that the majority of cases of 	
<P>

		tubal infertility are preceded by infection, this does not negate 		a role
for the IUD in potentiating the damage from those 
	
<P>

		infections.  This is clearly illustrated in Table 4 of our original 		report,
which demonstrated that women who had minor 		
<P>

		genital or major pelvic infections and who had used an IUD 	
<P>

		had greater relative risks of infertility than women who had 		
<P>

		had these infections but had not used the IUD".
<P>

	     (p.637, LHC, second last para).
<P>

	Daling gave evidence consistent with Cramer's view as to the potentiating
effects of IUD use on infections.  (T3034, L5-25):
<P>

	"...A woman who uses an IUD, if she is exposed to those 		
<P>

	pathogens it is more likely to exhibit an infection of the 	  
<P>

              magnitude that rises up into the tube.  It is an effect modifier.
	Given a woman is exposed, her chance of getting
an infection that 	leads to
disease who wears an IUD is different than a woman 	who does not.  It is clear
from our data, clear from
other people's 	data, that is truly the case.  We
call that an effect modifier; 	something that modifies the effect of an
exposure."
 
<P>

	
<P>

	<b>Senanayake and Kramer 1980</b>  made similar observations.
<P>

(p.859, Ex. P124).		 	
<P>

	The study was a case-control study with data being collected between 1979 and
1981.  It was not a multi-centre study and 159 matched
pairs were identified
and used in the analysis.
<P>

	Like <b>Cramer et al 1985</b>, this report looked at the characteristics of
women with primary tubal infertility and matched controls.  The results were
similar
to the Women's Health Study.  More cases reported having 5 or more
sexual partners.  More cases were smokers and were married more
often.  The
Dalkon Shield was associated with the highest relative risk for primary tubal
infertility and the duration of use figures
indicated a higher relative risk
for the shortest period of use tabulated.  (<b>P130 <i>pages 939,
940).</i></b>
<P>

The authors also reported that for those women who had only used a copper IUD
the relative risk was 1.3 (0.6 - 3.0). That is not
a statistically significant
result.  The authors reported that women who had used a copper IUD had very
little excess risk and said
that they regarded the result as reassuring.  
<P>

Daling reported that use of any IUD in the past increased the risk of primary
tubal infertility to 2-6 (confidence 95% CL 1.3 -
5.2).  She found that the
risk for women who had only used copper IUDs was 3.1 (95% CL 1.5 - 6.5) when
she reanalysed her data in
1992.
<P>

<b>Westrom 1980</b>
<P>

	This was in the nature of a review article which also incorporated a report of
original data.  Professor Westrom was continuing
his original research which is
referred to in his earlier papers.
<P>

	This paper attempted an analysis of the incidence, prevalence and trends of
acute PID in a range of industrialized countries. 
Professor Westrom stated
that, in the vast majority of cases, salpingitis is caused by STD infections
which ascend from the lower
to the upper genital tract.  He added that, from a
public health perspective, any attempt to decrease the incidence of PID must
start
with attempts to decrease the incidence of STD in general.  
<P>

	The relationship between IUDs and PID was referred to on a number of occasions
within this review.  Professor Westrom referred
to iatrogenic PID and
identified IUD insertion as being one of a number of different procedures which
involve instrumentation of
the uterus with consequent risk of infection.
<P>

	Professor Westrom stated that, as at 1980, epidemiological studies had
revealed that IUDs were used significantly more often by
women with PID than by
control women.  He also noted that age, race, socio-economic status and sexual
activity were of importance
in differences in the risks of PID in IUD users
versus non-users.  
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Westrom 1980</b> also included original data from a study population
of women in Lund [see Table II of the article].  Professor Westrom noted that
this data appeared to show that the use of an IUD increased the risk of acute
salpingitis.  However, as he noted in his 1976 study,
there appeared to be a
protective effect provided by oral contraceptives and barrier methods.  In
Professor Westrom's view, sexually
active women who use no contraceptive method
constitute the correct reference group to be used when studying the
epidemiology of
genital tract infections but he did not perform a further
statistical analysis to take this into account.

<P>

						June 1983
<P>

						June 1985
<P>

		(i)	Mrs Lane		22 August 1980
<P>

	The plaintiffs sought the following finding of facts:
<P>

		"At the time of each of the above insertions Searle was in
<P>

		possession of strong evidence from epidemiological studies
<P>

		which pointed to a causal association between IUD use and 
<P>

		PID."
<P>

	The plaintiffs sought the following finding of fact and law:
<P>

		"The association, as revealed in these studies was under a
<P>

		legal obligation to act on the basis of that causal association."
<P>

With regard to the state-of-knowledge at that time, Dr Eschenbach said during
his oral evidence (T1822, L46-57) that the three studies
namely <b>Wright and
Laemmle 1968</b>, <b>Noonan and Adams 1974</b>, and <b>Targum and Wright
1974</b> were enough to lead to the conclusion that there was an increased risk
of PID from IUD use. 
<P>

	Dr Ory from the Centre for Disease Control said of the six epidemiological
studies he reviewed (viz <b>Wright and Laemmle 1968</b>, <b>Targum and Wright
1974</b>, <b>Lippes 1975</b>, <b>Faulkner and Ory 1976</b>, <b>Westrom et al
1976</b>, and <b>Vessey 1976</b>):
<P>

"In summary, then, I think that these six studies point in the same direction,
that IUD use is associated with the increased risk
of acute PID.  The best
estimate suggests that IUD users have from three to five times the risk of
developing PID compared to non-users,
that teenagers appear as likely to be
affected as older women, that copper IUDs do not offer any protection from
gonococcal PID,
and finally, there is the intriguing but as yet unconfirmed
suggestion that nulliparous IUD users are more likely to develop acute
PID than
are multi-parous users.
<P>

As an epidemiologist, I kind of look at these six studies, you know, done by
five different investigators at three different countries,
all showing the same
results, and that, to me, provides some evidence that the association is one of
cause and effect.  Each study
had its strengths and its weaknesses.  However,
all together, they rule out virtually every major source of bias as a possible
reason
for observing this association.
<P>

In addition, when you couple it with Dick Soderstrom's recent report of the
histologic changes and the possibility that this is
altering tubal defense
mechanisms; also if you couple it with the fact that previously rare syndromes,
or so they are said to be
in the literature, such as unilateral tubo-ovarian
abscess and infective agents like Actinomycoses are now being reported in
association
with IUD use, I think biologic plausibility is added to a causal
interpretation of these six studies"    (Exhibit P228, Tab 13, pp.
72-73).
<P>

	Before the second insertion (Mrs Orders 20 April 1977) there was a documented
recognition of the risk within Searle itself.  On
25 February 1977 Mr Peddie
from Searle Australia sought from Dr Inglis in the US Searle's <i>"official
position"</i> on the risk of PID and ectopic pregnancy associated with IUD use.
Mr Peddie drew attention to then current literature which supported
that causal
association.  
<P>

Before the third insertion (1 August 1977 Mrs Robertson) the FDA Panel
proceedings took place.  Dr O'Brien  was the Searle US employee
who had
answered Mr Peddie's memorandum referred to above.  There is no evidence of any
corrective measures being taken to inform
Mr Peddie of the information from the
FDA Panel proceedings.
<P>

	During the course of the FDA Panel proceedings, there was recognition among
the participants that strong evidence supported a 3-5
fold increased risk of
PID and its sequelae among IUD users.  At several points during these
proceedings, specific reference was
made to copper devices (mainly the Cu-7) as
being implicated.  Dr Tyrer represented the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America
which was described during the proceedings as <i>"undoubtedly the
leader in the United States in family planning"</i> (Exhibit P228, Tab 13, p.
60, line 23 ff) with the largest number of clients.  She said the Cu-7 was by
far the IUD of choice.  She
said there was sufficient data to document a
definite decrease in fecundability after IUD use and the PPFA had prepared a
memorandum
<i>"that there is a 3-5 fold increase risk of infection among IUD
users"</i> (ibid p. 5943, p. 61, L17).  These remarks related to all IUD use
but in context her remarks clearly implicated the Cu-7 because
she wanted the
Drug Panel (which was formally concerned with the copper devices) to issue the
same warning (ibid p. 178, L12-17).
In the period after the FDA Panel
proceedings, all of the plaintiffs except Mrs Lee and Mrs Orders had a Copper 7
inserted.
<P>

In the period between the FDA Panel meeting on 6 June 1977 and Mrs Lane's
insertion on 22 August 1980, Table 1 from <b>Senanayake and Kramer</b> shows
publications by <b>Eschenbach 1977</b>, <b>Thaler 1978</b>, <b>Flesh</b>,
<b>Maqueo and Ryden 1979</b>, and <b>Kaufman, and Osser 1980</b>. 
<P>

	This period of time covers all IUD insertions among those seven remaining
plaintiffs except for Mrs Denzin's fourth, fifth and
sixth insertions in
November 1981, June 1983 and June 1985.  
<P>

The plaintiffs sought a finding that the epidemiological studies showed that an
IUD placed a woman at greater risk of PID.
<P>

The plaintiffs submitted that the studies referred to and the evidence of
Professor Daling lead to the conclusion that the broad
sweep of epidemiological
evidence leads to the conclusion that use of the Cu-7 increases the risk of PID
to the users.
<P>

The epidemiological material relied upon included many studies which do not
include the Cu-7 and which relate to populations which
are significantly
different in a sociological sense to any of the plaintiffs.  
<P>

The plaintiffs seek to draw a conclusion from this disparate material that use
of the Cu-7 by the plaintiffs in these proceedings
increased the risk of their
contracting PID leading to a conclusion of probable causation of the injuries
which they sustained.
<P>

The defendants on the other hand submitted that it was proper to analyse each
study and to ascertain how they fitted into the pattern
of knowledge after
proper allowance was made for weaknesses which appeared in their methodology.
In my view this is the correct approach.
<P>

In particular the defendants criticised studies on the bases that they:
<P>

(a)	include Dalkon Shield users;
<P>

(b)	the duration of use is not obtained so as to indicate iatrogenic
<P>

	risk from any longer term risk;
<P>

(c)	the control group contained women who used a method of 
<P>

	contraception which was protective against PID (e.g. barrier
<P>

	methods, oral contraceptives);
<P>

(d)	compounding factors for PID such as age, number of sexual
<P>

	partners, marital and socio-economic status are not identified
<P>

	and controlled using multivariate analysis;
<P>

(e)	biases are not adequately addressed.
<P>

These factors may, either individually or taken with others, elevate the
relative risks      for IUD users.
<P>

The defendants also submitted that the analyses of the material shows that
women in the category of the plaintiffs do not have any
statistically
significantly higher risk of contracting PID when using copper IUDs.
<P>

In addition to lengthy analysis and criticism of the twenty-five publications
referred to earlier the defendants relied upon extensive
state-of-the-art
literature supporting the use of IUDs.
<P>

I accept the evidence of Professor Roy as to the risk of infection based on his
own experience and on the WHO Report (<b>Farley 1992</b>) that the risk was
greatest for the first twenty days after insertion and that thereafter the rate
of infection closely paralleled
the background rate of sexually transmitted
organisms of the population under study.  (Ex. D.301, para 41).
<P>

Professor Roy also drew attention to the <b>1983 Women's Health Study</b> which
analysed different degrees of risk of PID witih specific types of IUDs (<b>Lee
et al, 1983)</b> and concluded that there were differences. 
<P>

Professor Roy also pointed out that earlier studies had compared IUD users with
women who used contraceptives which protected against
PID and that this
comparison falsely elevated the risk or PID for IUD users.  Also earlier
studies had in many cases included users
of Dalkon Shield IUDs which increased
the rate of infection shown.
<P>

I do not accept Professor Daling's 1992 recalculation of her 1985 report as
displacing the opinions of Professor Roy which I accept.
<P>

It follows that with all its manifest imperfection the epidemiological evidence
does not establish in my view that there is any
statistically significant
increase in risk of contracting PID for users of the Cu-7 although there is an
increased risk in the first
twenty days after insertion which risk is
associated with the insertion procedure.
<P>

In the light of this finding the findings sought by the plaintiffs on pages 181
and 182 are not relevant as the information which
was then available was not in
my view reflective of the true situation.
<P>

<b><u>ECTOPIC PREGNANCY</u></b>
<P>

	There does not appear to be any issue between the parties as to the existence
of a relationship between pelvic inflammatory disease
and ectopic pregnancy.
There is a dispute however between the parties as to the role of the IUD in
this relationship.
<P>

	An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy which occurs at a site outside the uterus.
Although they may occur elsewhere the vast majority
of ectopic pregnancies
occur in the fallopian tubes.
<P>

	The plaintiffs tendered an editorial published by Dr Eschenbach and Dr Daling
in the April 1983 edition of the Journal of the American
Medical Association
(Ex. 209, Tab C) in the following terms:
<P>

"The most widely held mechanism has been a partial failure of the ovum to pass
down the fallopian tube in the carefully timed sequence
that would allow proper
uterine implantation.  Partial tubal obstruction after tubal infection stands
out as one of the most important
known causes of ectopic pregnancy.  Women with
documented acute salpingitis have an ectopic pregnancy rate that is increased 7
fold
over women who have had no known salpingitis.  Seven percent of the first
pregnancies that occur after salpingitis are ectopic. 
Evidence of prior
salpingitis is demonstrated in one third of the women with an ectopic pregnancy
at the time of operation"   (Exhibit
P209, Tab C).
<P>

	Dr Keeping gave the following evidence on behalf of the defendants.  He
said:
<P>

"Q.	I am asking doctor about former IUD use?
<P>

A.	Former now, now moving on to former IUD use and ectopic, whatever the
literature says, there would have to be an increase in
PID in a population that
has had an IUD before.  I have acknowledged that there is an insertion risk of
PID and I think we got down
to a figure that once the IUD is in, there might be
a relative risk ratio of one point something to 1 for people who have an IUD
in...   Having said that, I have acknowledged that there will be some people
that will get PID as a result of their IUD, particularly
around, mainly around
the insertion period.  As such, that population must be more at risk of
ectopics, so there is - there has to
be an increased risk of ectopics in
previous IUD users"   (T6387 L51 - T6388 L9).
<P>

	The plaintiffs submitted that I should conclude that if an IUD use puts a
woman at greater risk of PID, it will put her at greater
risk of an ectopic
pregnancy.  
<P>

	It was put that where an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy occurs among
women who have used an IUD, it follows that they have
been at a greater risk of
contracting PID from IUD use.  Similarly it was put that  the tubal infertility
studies were used as independent
and objective confirmation of past PID, so the
ectopic pregnancy studies operate in the same way.  Dr Daling's evidence was
that
the studies of tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy both avoid referral
bias and diagnostic bias in the studies of clinical PID.
 The <b>WHO Report
1987</b> makes the same point.   
<P>

	There have been a large number of studies referred to relating to the
relationship between IUD use and ectopic pregnancies which
included
<P>

review articles which summarise the results of studies over the years.  
<P>

In 1995, the medical journal Contraception published two such studies, <b>Mol
et al</b> <i>"Contraception and the risk of ectopic pregnancy: a
meta-analysis"</i> (Ex. P426) and <b>Xiong et al</b> <i>"IUD use and the risk
of ectopic pregnancy: A meta-analysis of case control studies"</i>  
<P>

(Ex. P209, Tab 2, Annexure B).
<P>

The first meta-analysis by <b>Mol et al</b> reported the relationship between
past IUD use and the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in Table 1 of that
review an extract from
which is set out below:

	The plaintiffs submitted that these results show that from 1981 five studies
(<b>Ory 1981</b>, data from the Women's Health Study; <b>Chow, Daling &amp; Ors
1986</b>; <b>Chow et al 1990</b>; <b>Hoult</b>,<b> Chu</b>,<b> Daling &amp; Ors
1991</b>;<b> Basuki</b>,<b> Rossing and Daling 1994</b>) demonstrated an
increased risk of ectopic pregnancy among past IUD users using pregnant,
non-pregnant and recently delivered controls.
 Pooling the data, the common
odds ratio was 1.6.  For practical purposes it was submitted this is equivalent
to a relative risk.
<P>

	<b>Mol et al </b>concluded:
<P>

		"......After disontinuance of an ICDU, however, the risk
<P>

		continues to be increased, suggesting a relation between
<P>

		ICDU use and subsequent tubal damage."
<P>

	In the same volume of Contraception in 1995, Xiong and others published their
own meta analysis which reviewed the published literature
from 1977 to 1994.

<P>

	In the Xiong meta analysis, the pooled risk of ectopic pregnancy associated
with past IUD use from 19 studies between 1977 and

<P>

The authors concluded:
<P>

	"Past IUD use could slightly increase the risk of ectopic
<P>

	pregnancy (Pooled O.R.:1.40, 95% C.I..:1.23-1.59).  
<P>

	This result challenges currently held opinions about the 
<P>

	absence of risk associated with past IUD use.  Although this
<P>

	Pooled O.R. is weak, it is firmly confirmed by:
<P>

	1)  consistent results (independent of choice of control group;
<P>

	2)  no indication of compounding (O.R.'s with or without
<P>

	     adjusted studies are similar);
<P>

	3)  no effect of quality of study (Table 5);   and
<P>

	4)  no indication of publication bias (Figure 3).
<P>

	Furthermore, five studies explored the relationship between
<P>

	the duration of past IUD use and the risk of ectopic 
<P>

	pregnancy showing that the risk of ectopic pregnancy 
<P>

	increased with the duration of past IUD use."
<P>

Dr Daling gave evidence that <i>"the overall estimate is significantly
elevated"</i> (third witness statement para 2).  The authors themselves,
referring to the 40% increase in risk, said: <i>"Past IUD use could slightly
increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy."</i>
<P>

	The plaintiffs also submitted that recent studies have shown that the risk of
ectopic pregnancy increases with duration of use
of the IUD<b> Parazzini et
al</b>.  (Ex. P209, Tab 3, para 1 which refers to <b>Parazzini et al</b>
"<i>Past Contraceptive Method Use and Risk of Ectopic Pregnancy"
</i><b>Contraception 1995</b>, and Tab 2, para 29 <b>Rossing et al 1993</b>,
para 32, <b>Basuki et al 1994.)  </b>
<P>

Dr Daling gave evidence of her own findings that amongst long-term users of an
IUD, an elevated risk of tubal pregnancy was apparent
for at least seven years
after discontinuance of use.  ((Ex. P209, Tab 1, para 10.) 
<P>

The defendants criticise reliance upon these studies of the epidemiology of
ectopic pregnancy on the basis that they do not break
out the data for copper
IUD users to permit findings of increased risk associated with Cu- 7 use.  They
also submitted that a paper
by <b>Sivin</b> published in 1983 shows Dalkon
Shield use explains the reported increase risk in studies to that time.
<P>

However, one of the studies Dr Daling relied upon, namely <b>Rossing et al
1993</b>, reported that for women who had used IUDs in the past, compared with
women who had never used IUDs, there was a relative risk of
1.7 of an ectopic
pregnancy after cessation of IUD use. For Copper-T and Cu-7 users, the risk was
2.2.  Moreover, <b>Rossing et al</b> <b>1993</b> stated:
<P>

"Although there was no evidence of increased risk of tubal pregnancy associated
with up to one year of past IUD use, the risk rose
steadily with increasing
duration of use beyond one year.  For women with three or more yeas of past IUD
use, the risk relative to
women who had never used an IUD was 2.5 whether for
IUD use in general or copper IUD use only"   (P247, RHC, first para).
<P>

Second, there was no Dalkon Shield use to affect the results of later research
(<b>Basuki et al 1994</b>).  It was submitted that these support a finding that
the epidemiological evidence suggests past IUD use in general and past Cu-7
use
in particular puts a woman at greater risk of an ectopic pregnancy.  
<P>

<P>

Among these plaintiffs, ectopic pregnancies were experienced by Denzin, Lane,
Orders, Ottaway and Southren, after discontinuing
IUD use.  On behalf of these
five plaintiffs it was submitted that the use of the IUD placed them at greater
risk of ectopic pregnancy
after cessation of IUD use and that they were not
warned of this risk by the defendants.
<P>

The defendants submitted that there were other risk factors involved in the
results for the plaintiffs. 
<P>

Orders, Ottaway and Lane were "<i>maternal smokers</i>". The defendants
submitted that by smoking they were exposed to the risk of tubal pregnancy.
The relative risks for past smokers
was 1.3 (CI 1.0-1.8) and smokers at
conception was 1.4 (CI 1.0 to 2.0).  
<P>

On 25 February 1977 Mr Peddie from Searle Australia wrote a memorandum seeking
advice as to Searle's official position with regard
to the risks of PID and
ectopic pregnancy associated with Cu-7 use.  In that memorandum, Mr Peddie drew
particular attention to the
 publication by Dr Hallatt of 15 July 1976.
<P>

	In that publication Dr Hallatt made the following observations about the
association between IUD use and ectopic pregnancy:
<P>

"This is the crux of the whole question: Does the IUD cause PID?  If it does,
then it increases the incidence of ectopic pregnancy
and I think the message
for us is that PID is actually a contraindication to the use of the
intrauterine device" (p. 758, LHC, last
para).
<P>

It was submitted that this analysis by Dr Hallatt was in accord with the
evidence given by Dr Keeping that IUD use increases the
risk of ectopic
pregnancy. 
<P>

During the 6 June 1977 FDA Panel proceedings Dr Tyrer made a similar warning of
a higher than normal incidence of ectopic pregnancy
among women who became
pregnant following IUD removal (see Reply to Chapter VII p. 53, para 58.9).
Searle's own documents show it
was aware of this:  (see Reply to Chapter VIII,
para 19.3, 19.4).
<P>

It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that I should find that from
February 1977, when the Peddie memorandum was written,
Searle was on notice of
the causal association between past IUD use and ectopic pregnancy.  It was
submitted that the association
between past IUD use and ectopic pregnancy was
related to the proposition that IUD use increases the risk of PID and thus
tubal damage
which inevitably increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy and this
risk continues after IUD use has ceased.  
<P>

		
<P>

	
<P>

	The literature which Professor Daling referred to in support of her
conclusions was in all but two cases published after the distribution
of the
defendants' product ceased in Australia.
<P>

	The defendants reviewed an extensive range of medical literature:
<P>

1.	<b>Hallatt 1976</b>
<P>

	This case series compared 70 patients who had used an IUD and suffered an
ectopic pregnancy against 1,428 consecutive ectopic pregnancy
patients who had
not used an IUD.  (Ex. D477).
<P>

	Dr Hallatt concluded that any causal link between IUD use and ectopic
pregnancy had not been established and was doubtful.
<P>

	The author commented on the then increasing incidence of ectopic pregnancies
as reflecting the increasing incidence of PID.
<P>

<b>2.	Snowden 1977</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>Snowden concluded that there was no certainty that the Progestasert had
a causal role in ectopic pregnancy and a detailed evaluation
was necessary.
<P>

<b>3.	Eschenbach and Daling 1983   </b>(Ex. P.209, Tab C)
<P>

	The defendants summarized the effect of this paper, in my view correctly, as
follows:
<P>

(a)	As at 1983 there had been a dramatic increase in the number of 
<P>

	ectopic pregnancies over the previous 2 decades.
<P>

(b)	The pathological cause of ectopic pregnancy is tubal obstruction most often
the result of previous infection, particularly salpingitis.
<P>

(c)	The mechanics of ectopic pregnancy were then, as now, not properly
understood.
<P>

(d)	There are a myriad of risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, among which the
method of contraception is but one possible factor.
 Prof Daling's extensive
work with the population of the Puget Sound in relation to other risk factors
for ectopic pregnancy is dealt
with elsewhere.
<P>

(e)	These risk factors are inter-related and constantly changing.
<P>

(f)	Among the 4 cited controlled studies published prior to 1983, the authors
note only 1 (<i>Ory et al 1981</i>) which analysed IUD use but yet concluded
that, in aggregate, women who had used an IUD had the same risk of ectopic
pregnancy as
women who had never used one.
<P>

(g)	Clearly, the high prevalence of STDs (gonorrhea and chlamydia) was causing
tubal obstruction (and continues to do so).
<P>

(h)	Oral contraceptives appear to be protective against the risk of ectopic
pregnancy.
<P>

(i)	However, only well designed studies using proper controls and multivariate
techniques would, in Profs Eschenbach's and Daling's
opinions be able to
clarify the cause and risk factors for ectopic pregnancies.
<P>

<b>4.	Sivin 1983    </b>(Ex. D.384, Tab 24)
<P>

	Dr Sivin concluded that when past and present IUD users are 
<P>

compared with women who have never used an IUD the risk was not 
<P>

statistically different from unity.  He also concluded:
<P>

(a)	A large part of the engine driving the ectopic pregnancy rate up was the
increase in PID, although that was not a complete explanation.
<P>

(b)	Oral contraceptives and barrier methods are protective against the risk of
ectopic pregnancy.
<P>

(c)	However, contrary to the tentative queries raised by Beral and Tatum, there
was no indication of a causal relationship between
copper bearing IUDs and
ectopic pregnancies.
<P>

<b>5.	WHO 1985   </b>(Ex. D.437, pages 131-141).
<P>

	The effect of this study of 1,108 cases effectively concluded that 
<P>

there was no increased risk of ectopic pregnancy for past IUD users but 
<P>

that there were other risk factors such as smoking which could affect 
<P>

incidence rates.
<P>

<b>6.	Chow et al 1986   </b>(Ex. D.209, Tab E)
<P>

<b>	</b>Professor Daling was one of the authors.
<P>

	The results of this study showed that once the Dalkon Shield was 
<P>

excluded there was no material association between ectopic pregnancy and 
<P>

use of other IUD's.
<P>

<b>7.	Edelman &amp; Porter 1986</b>   (Ex. D.384, Tab 6, pages 55-62).
<P>

	This report showed that there was no statistically significant 
<P>

result showing any increase in ectopic pregnancies from the use of Cu-7s.
<P>

<b>8.	Chow et al 1987    </b>(Ex. P.209, Tab M, pages 70-88).
<P>

	Again Professor Daling was one of the authors.
<P>

	The effect of that review of the epidemiology of ectopic 
<P>

pregnancy was that no IUCD other than the Dalkon Shield gave 
<P>

statistically significant increase in risk.
<P>

<b>9.	Rossing et al 1993   </b>(Ex. P.132).
<P>

	This study referred to a small number of Cu-7 users and did
<P>

not differentiate between devices.  It produced results at the bottom of the

<P>

statistically significant range indicating some risk.  The degree of risk 
<P>

varied to some extent depending on time.  The study concluded that there 
<P>

may be increased risk.
<P>

These factors have varying degrees of impact on the rates of ectopic
pregnancies.  It is not necessary to deal with the other  
    to indicate that
they may be factors which increase the apparent rate in association with
IUDs.
<P>

Experts called on behalf of the defendants expressed the opinion that past use
of a Cu-7 did not result in an increased risk of
ectopic pregnancy.
<P>

Professor Grimes      T.5884-5
<P>

Professor Roy           T6099-6101
<P>

Dr Keeping               T6389-6390
<P>

Professor Newton     T6643-6645
<P>

Professor Fraser        T6750-6751 and 7691-6794
<P>

<b>10.	Basuki et al 1994    </b>(Ex. P209, Tab 1).
<P>

	This study showed a statistically significant increased risk for 
<P>

women with 36 or more months use.  Any shorter duration of use did not 
<P>

produce a statistically significant result.  The study did not determine the

<P>

type of IUD used.  There was also a very small number of relevant articles 
<P>

which gives an extremely wide confidence interval.
<P>

	In my view the material relied upon by the plaintiffs and the 
<P>

evidence by Professor Daling as to the effect of past use of Cu-7 on 
<P>

ectopic pregnancies does not establish that there was in fact any 
<P>

statistically significant increase in the risk of ectopic pregnancies as a 
<P>

result of past use of a Cu-7.  An analysis of the literature not show any 
<P>

support basis for the proposition propounded by the defendants.
<P>

	I accept the evidence of Grimes, Roy, Keeping, Newton and 
<P>

Fraser referred to above and find that there was no increase in ectopic 
<P>

pregnancies as alleged by the plaintiffs.  
<P>

I found Professor Daling's selective assessments throughout her evidence
unfairly pointing to IUD associated risk unsatisfactory
and her general
approach to the giving of her evidence is not to be ignored in the conclusions
which I arrive at.
<P>

	Further, in my view none of the material referred to led to the
<P>

conclusion that the state-of-the-art while the Cu-7 was sold showed a 
<P>

view that use of a Cu-7 would increase the risk as alleged.  Nor is there 
<P>

any basis for concluding that the defendants were aware of such an 
<P>

increase.  The so-called Peddie Memorandum does not in my view 
<P>

disclose any such knowledge.  
<P>

	The plaintiffs also relied upon three 1995 publications.
<P>

<b>1.	Parazzini</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>This study involved a small number of IUD users and there was 
<P>

no indication of the types of devices used.  The authors concluded that 
<P>

there may be an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy which increased with 
<P>

prolonged direction of use but that the study does not confirm that.
<P>

<b>2.	Mol et al 1995</b>     (Ex. P426, pages 337-340)
<P>

	This paper relied upon the papers referred to above and one other 
<P>

paper.
<P>

<b>3.	Ziong et al 1995    </b>(Ex. P.209, Tab 3, pages 23-32)
<P>

	This paper pooled existing material calculated a relative risk of
<P>

1.4 (1.23 - 1.59) which the authors described as a mild or slight increase.

<P>

The result was obtained without differentiating the Dalkon Shield results.
<P>

	In my view these three recent publications, when properly 
<P>

analysed, do not alter the conclusion which I have expressed above.  The 
<P>

<b>Mol</b> and <b>Xiong </b>papers analyse previous data without what, in my
view is 
<P>

necessary, namely excluding Dalkon Shield results and differentiating 
<P>

between types of IUDs.  Parazzini is a small and inconclusive study.
<P>

	The defendants drew attention to other risk factors for ectopic 
<P>

pregnancies including prior induced abortions, previous abdominal surgery 
<P>

including appendectomy, vaginal douching and maternal smoking.
<P>

<center><b><u>4.2	THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS</u></b></center>
<P>

<b>	</b>This topic was dealt with in detail in Part 3 of the plaintiffs'
submissions.
<P>

	It was an attempt to demonstrate ways in which the IUD could be shown
scientifically to cause the introduction of pathogens.
<P>

	The matters dealt with under this heading are:
<P>

1.	<b>Tailstring</b>
<P>

It was said that bacteria which are pathogenic if introduced into the upper
genital tract are able to adhere to the polymer of which
the Cu-7 tailstring
was made and that as that polymer was prone to fray more bacteria could adhere
to it than would otherwise be
the case so that in the event that the tailstring
retracted into the uterus pathogens were introduced.  Secondly it was said that
bacteria could adhere to the tailstring and colonise it.  The bacteria could
then spread along the tailstring thereby finding a means
of entry into the
upper genital tract.
<P>

In summary it was submitted that the Cu-7 may "<i>cause"</i> the ingress of PID
bacteria by
<P>

(a)	retraction of the tailstring
<P>

(b)	"<i>ascension" </i>of the bacteria up the tailstring
<P>

(c)	carriage upon insertion.
<P>

The defendants submitted that neither (a) nor (b) have been shown to increase
the chance of upper genital tract infection.  The
defendants admitted that (c)
was a possibility but submitted that in relation to Lee, Moylan, Orders,
Ottaway and Robertson whose
cases were opened as cases of insertion infection
they did not suffer PID as a result of the insertion of their Cu-7s.
<P>

They further submitted that insertion infection was a matter of which all
doctors were aware and was not a risk which rendered the
Cu-7 defective so that
there was no causal link rendering Searle liable for insertion infection.  
<P>

Further it was submitted that there was no evidence of facts which elevated
mere possibility to the requisite level of more likely
than not.
<P>

2.	<b>Foreign body effect</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>It was said that the amount of bacteria required to cause infection in
the upper genital tract varies depending upon such things as
the virulence of
the organism, the access it may have to vulnerable tissue liable to be infected
and the immune system of the patient
which may be affected by the woman's
health at the time.
<P>

	It was also said that the presence of a plastic and copper device inside the
uterus causes a reaction called the foreign body effect
which dramatically
reduces the amount of bacteria necessary to cause infection.
<P>

	The defendants submitted that this did not achieve the status of an accepted
hypothesis and should be rejected as inadequate to
show or assist in showing a
causal link.
<P>

<b>Tailstring</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>As indicated in the introductory passage above the plaintiffs allege
that PID bacteria may enter the uterus of a user of a Cu-7 by
<P>

	(a)	retraction of the tailstring
<P>

	(b)	"<i>ascension" </i>up the tailstring
<P>

	(c)	by carriage on insertion
<P>

<b>(a)	Retraction of Tailstring</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>It was said that there was a tendency of polypropylene to resume its
earlier configuration as string memory and when it happened it
would draw the
string up into the uterus introducing the likelihood of contamination by
pathogens.
<P>

	This allegation relates to Denzin, Gentle, Lee and Ottaway.  The plaintiffs
summarised their case on this point as follows:
<P>

		"(i)	string retraction into uterus introduces more potential
<P>

			pathogens than otherwise;
<P>

		(ii)	string retraction requires additional instrumentations
<P>

			of uterus to remove device which uterine
<P>

			instrumentation increases risk of introducing infection;
<P>

		(iii)	the defendants admit that uterine instrumentations
<P>

<b>			</b>increased the risk of introducing infection."
<P>

	The plaintiffs sought to establish the above in the following ways:
<P>

1.	Following the successful insertion of a Cu-7 in the uterus, the tailstring
ran from the bottom of the Cu-7 in the uterus through
the cervix and into the
vagina to provide the user or her doctor with an easy method of checking that
the device was still in place
and to facilitate the removal of the device. 
<P>

2.	The Cu-7 was shaped like a figure 7 with a small rounded cap which fuses the
horizontal arm and the curved vertical stem together.
Copper wire was wound
around the vertical stem. The polypropylene tailstring was attached to the
lower end of the vertical stem.
When the device was packaged, the Cu-7 stem sat
in the inserter tube. The tailstring joined at the base of the stem (inside the
inserter
tube), and turned to pass up the tube beside the device before
emerging from the top of the inserter. It then looped through 180
degrees to
run down the outside of the inserter tube. This can be seen clearly in Exhibit
P3, a box of packaged Copper 7s.
<P>

3.	The plaintiffs alleged in each case that in its packaged configuration "the
tailstring was looped out of the top of the inserter
tube rather than run down
the inside of the inserter tube, such loop resulting in a string
"<i>memory</i>" which caused the tailstring to have a propensity to retract
into the uterus resulting in: 
<P>

	(A) 	the tailstring transferring bacteria and/or other infectious 	organisms
from the vagina into the uterus; 
<P>

	(B) 	the need for instrumentation of the uterus;  and an increased 	risk of
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ("PID")."  
<P>

	The plaintiffs also pleaded, as particulars of the exemplary damages sought,
that Searle was aware that the Cu-7 tailstring had
a tendency to retract into
the uterus increasing the risk but chose not to remedy the defect.
<P>

4.	The defendants do not dispute that retraction of the Cu-7 tailstring into
the uterus occurs.  They say that this retraction phenomenon
is unrelated to
the design of the Cu-7, and, in any event, doers not increase the risk of upper
genital tract infection.
<P>

<b>(a)	Polypropylene Tailstring's Propensity To Retract</b>
<P>

5.	Dr O'Brien, the Associate Director of Clinical Research of Searle between
July 1974 and September 1985, gave evidence for the
defendants. His evidence
was that Searle received reports of retractions during the clinical trial and
following marketing of the
Cu-7 and that he became aware of them shortly after
they were received.  Searle's documents confirm this statement as to receipt
of
reports from August 1974 through to 5 December 1983.  Dr O'Brien said that the
efforts Searle made to find a way to eliminate
the string retraction effect
were not motivated by any concerns that the retraction of the string might
promote infection by the
drawing up of micro-organisms into the uterus but
rather that these efforts were made for marketing purposes.  He said that all
IUD
tailstrings retract and there was no evidence that the Cu-7 retracted at a
rate greater than did the tailstrings of the Lippes Loop.
Finally he stated
that there was no evidence that retraction promoted infection.
<P>

6.	The defendants also called Dr Piziali. He was a consultant with a background
in mechanical engineering who has experience in
the fields of biomechanics and
bioengineering. He disclaimed expertise in polymer chemistry. His evidence was
that while there was
a memory effect with the Cu-7 tailstring, it was not of
sufficient strength or persistence to account for retraction into the uterus.
His evidence included a video of a Copper 7 inside a plastic uterus. While this
video showed movement in the tailstring, he explained
that the forces involved
would not be sufficient to account for the retractions. He explained that
although he had given the matter
considerable thought, he did not have a theory
as to why tailstrings retracted but was confident that it could not be the
memory.
<P>

7.	The plaintiffs tendered more than fifty exhibits which are described at Tab
"<i>Memory" </i>in Part 5 of the plaintiffs' written submissions.<i> </i> Many
are Searle documents containing statements to the effect that the special
characteristic of the polypropylene (the "memory")
used in the tailstring
accounted for the retraction phenomenon. These exhibits document reports
commencing prior to the first Cu-7
insertion of which the plaintiffs complain
and extend over the period in which all insertions in the lead cases occurred.
The defendants
seek to explain these by saying that Searle employees believed
at the time that there was a memory effect inherent in the polypropylene
which
accounted for the retractions, but that they were wrong. Searle claims that its
employees did not have sufficient expertise
to know why the tailstrings
retracted. However the documents include statements to similar effect from
Battelle, expert design engineers
employed by Searle to assist in solving the
retraction problem.  Further, the documents include statements that the
alternative polyethylene
string Searle proposed for use on the Copper (used on
Searle's Tatum T) was a definite improvement in that it had almost no memory,
strongly suggesting that Searle employees were right to ascribe the memory
problem to the particular characteristics of the highly
drawn polypropylene
tailstring. 
<P>

	Doctors using the Cu-7 reported similar experiences to Searle. For example, Dr
Michaelow, described in an internal Searle memo
as a "<i>Gravigard devotee"</i>
reported that up to 80% of Cu-7 tailstrings retracted in his experience of
2,000 insertions and that the phenomenon was definitely
not occurring with
other devices. Mr Edmunds of Searle South Africa asked  "<i>Why does this not
happen with our Tatum-T thread or threads of other devices?</i>"
<P>

8.	The plaintiffs have relied on the Searle documents and the evidence of
Professor Channing Robertson and Professor David Katz
to establish that the
polypropylene used by Searle in the tailstring had a propensity to retract.
Unless these documents are ignored
or proved to be all wrong on the question,
it was submitted that the plaintiffs are entitled to a finding in their
favour.
<P>

9.	This propensity to retract was supported by the evidence of Professor
Robertson who gave evidence for the plaintiffs. He is a
Professor of Chemical
Engineering at Stanford University.  He is the witness in the case with by far
the greatest expertise in polymer
chemistry. Polypropylene is a polymer. It was
common ground that the memory effect was a result of the stresses within the
polypropylene
tailstring deriving from the chemical conformation of
polypropylene processed by drawing. Searle designed the packaging so that the
tailstring looped above the 7 and then ran down along the outside of the
inserter tube. Professor Robertson gave evidence as to the
effect of the
packaging of the tailstring. His evidence was that by using polypropylene and
packaging the Copper 7 with a loop in
the tailstring, the result was that the
tailstring was prone to resume the shape it had within the packaging. The
effect of this
was that the tailstring after insertion of the device would have
a tendency to withdraw into the uterus, playing a role in the introduction
of
infection (para 40, Statement dated 28 July 1995, Tab A, Exhibit P 136).
<P>

10.	Professor Katz is a Professor in both the Department of Biomedical
Engineering and in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology
at Duke
University, North Carolina. He had previously held a position as a Professor in
the Department of Chemical Engineering at
the University of California, Davis.
He has expertise in polymer chemistry. His evidence was that one of
polypropylene's characteristics
was to have a memory, in the sense of a
tendency to resume a position in which the material had previously been placed,
and that
this characteristic can not be removed and cannot be predicted with
certainty.  However Professor Katz had not taken any steps to
ascertain the
degree of memory needed for retraction either by theoretical or observational
means.
<P>

11.	The plaintiffs submit that the evidence of Professors Roberts and Katz
should be accepted and there be a finding that the memory
characteristic of the
polypropylene used in the Cu-7 tailstring caused the tailstring to have a
propensity to retract and that this
characteristic existed to a markedly
greater degree in Cu-7 tailstrings than in the polyethylene alternative which
Searle used on
its Tatum-T and proposed to use on the Cu-7 and Mini. 
<P>

	The defendants do not dispute that retraction occurs but say that it is not
due to any design defect or "<i>memory</i>".  (Dr. Piziali, Ex. D.306 at para
112).  Dr Piziali also demonstrated on a video the deformation of a Cu-7
tailstring.  He expressed
the view that it was impossible for the tailstring to
retract because of memory.
<P>

	I accept the evidence of Dr Piziali.  In my view the plaintiffs have not
established that retraction occurs because of "<i>memory</i>" or any other
design fault in the Cu-7.
<P>

	Retraction does however occur as it does apparently with all tailed IUDs.
<P>

<b>(b)	Increasing The risk of PID</b>
<P>

12.	The second dispute about retraction is whether retraction increases the
risk of PID. 
<P>

	Dr O'Brien gave evidence that there was no study which concluded that string
retraction played any role in the development of PID.
 His evidence was that
the efforts made to resolve the tailstring retraction problem were made for
marketing reasons (i.e. presumably
that doctors were reluctant to insert a
device that might cause problems) rather than out of concerns about safety of
users. It was
submitted that Searle documents make this an unlikely
explanation. For example, the FDA were unlikely to be concerned about Searle's
marketing choices when prompting Searle to fix the problem. 
<P>

13.	Denzin, Gentle, Lee and Ottaway suffered tailstring retractions. It is
common ground between the parties that any instrumentation
of the uterus
increases the risk of contracting, or exacerbating, PID. Each of these
plaintiffs required instrumentation of the uterus
to remove her Cu-7 because
the tailstring had retracted, although in Gentle's case this was associated
with treatment of septic abortion.
 It was submitted that there is no real
dispute that the tailstring retractions increased the risk of injury to the
plaintiffs by
requiring instrumentation. 
<P>

14.	Professor Ellner gave evidence that it was obvious that retraction of the
tailstring was a mechanism for contaminating the uterus
with bacteria, causing
infection.  Professors Eschenbach, Robertson and Katz gave evidence to the same
effect.  In addition, the
defendants' expert medical witness, Professor Fraser,
confirmed that the retraction of the tailstring might introduce bacteria into
the uterus and it would depend upon the type of bacteria and the health of the
woman as to whether this would create an infectious
process.  The plaintiffs
submitted that 
<P>

	(a) 	the evidence of Professors Ellner, Robertson, Katz and Fraser 
<P>

		as to the direct contamination of the uterus by string 
<P>

		retraction combines with 
<P>

	(b) 	the Searle documents, 
<P>

	(c) 	the consensus as to the risk which instrumentation 
<P>

		(necessitated by the retraction in at least three of the lead 
<P>

		cases),    and 
<P>

	(d) 	the concerns as to the potential of the frayed 
<P>

		tailstring to pose a risk of infection independently of fraying 
<P>

	support a finding that the retraction of the tailstring provided a 
<P>

means whereby bacteria could be carried from the vagina into the uterus 
<P>

and thereby increased the risk of PID for users of the Cu-7. 
<P>

	The defendants position is that tailstrings are a common element in IUD design
to aid in location and removal.  The defendants
submitted that irrespective of
the propositions put forward on behalf of the plaintiffs there was no evidence
that users of tailed
IUDs suffered a higher incidence of PID than did users of
tail-less IUDs and relied on the following evidence:
<P>

	Statement of Professor Newton;  Ex. D299 at paras 141-153.
<P>

	Statement of Dr Piziali;  Ex. D306 at paras 24-41.
<P>

	Statement of Professor Grimes;  Ex. D300 at paras 97-103.
<P>

	The plaintiffs did not tender any published literature showing any difference
in the incidence of PID between tailed and tail-less
IUDs.  Indeed the
published science is to the contrary  (e.g.  <b>Rivera</b> <b>1993</b>,  
<P>

Ex. D321 at page 177).
<P>

	Further the defendants submitted that there was no evidence that the
tailstring on the Cu-7 retracted at any greater frequency
than tailstrings on
other IUDs.  A survey of the literature by Drs. Ebi and Piziali (Ex. D362)
showed that the Cu-7 retractions were
less than for the other two makes of IUDs
reported on.
<P>

	In my view the evidence establishes that:
<P>

(1)	Tailstrings of the Cu-7 did retract and assume their pre-insertion 
<P>

	shape.
<P>

(2)	There were many complaints of the retractions to the defendants.
<P>

(3)	The defendants believed that the cause of the retractions was the
<P>

	<i>"memory" </i>of the string.
<P>

(4)	The defendants set about changing the tailstring for what was 
<P>

	described as "<i>safer" </i>polyethylene<i>.</i>
<P>

(5)	The change was not implemented.
<P>

(6)	The non-implementation was most probably because Searle was
<P>

	subject to law suits in the United States and did not wish to provide
<P>

	a "<i>new and improved"</i> product design so as to affect prospects of
<P>

	that litigation.
<P>

(7)	The rate of retraction was not out of the ordinary in relation to
<P>

	other IUDs in respect of which data is available.
<P>

(8)	Retraction theoretically can increase the risk of transferring
<P>

	pathogens from the vagina to the uterus.
<P>

(9)	The evidence does not establish that the fact of retraction and the
<P>

	rate of retraction increases the rate of PID on epidemiological 
<P>

evidence..
<P>

(10)	There is no evidence of any difference in the incidence of PID
<P>

	where the strings of IUDs are made of different materials (except 
<P>

for Dalkon Shield).
<P>

<b>(c)	Fraying:</b>
<P>

	The plaintiffs summarised their case in the following way:
<P>

<b>(</b><b>a)	Fraying As A Property Of Highly Drawn Polypropylene</b>
<P>

1.	It was not disputed that Cu-7 tailstrings frayed or fibrillate and suffered
other morphological (although not chemical) breakdown.
This extended to all
Cu-7 tailstrings over time. The disputes as to fraying related only to how much
and where.
<P>

2.	The plaintiffs have tendered a great many documents dating from 1974
including documents from Searle Australia and from the New
South Wales Family
Planning Association which show that the fraying was readily apparent to the
naked eye and a source of real concern.
Searle's documents state that
"<i>Fraying of some degree exists throughout our production.</i>"  (Ex. P8, Tab
2, page 30).
<P>

3.	The plaintiffs led evidence to show that Cu-7 tailstrings frayed throughout
their length. Professor Fives-Taylor gave evidence
as to research performed by
her group at the University of Vermont which undertook quantitative scoring of
fraying along the length
of the tailstrings. They found frays along the length
of the tailstrings.
<P>

4.	For the defendants, Dr Piziali gave evidence that a number of new and used
tailstrings were examined optically or by scanning
electron microscope. These
observations were that no or few fibrils appeared on polyethylene or nylon
tailstrings whereas polypropylene
tailstrings did exhibit fibrillation. However
the observations reported by Dr Piziali's team were of fraying on the vaginal
portion
only of such strings. In this respect Dr Piziali's observations differ
from those of Professor Fives-Taylor. They also differ from
the observations
made by the Australian National Biological Standards laboratory which in
February 1980 examined a tailstring and
reported to the Commonwealth Department
of Health that "<i>numerous fraying parts were evident along the entire length
of the filament together with some lengths of split ends protruding from
the
filament</i>."  (Document #134 in Part 5, `Documentary Case'.) 
<P>

5.	There is no dispute between the parties as to the fraying being caused by
the way in which the tailstrings were manufactured.
Professor Robertson gave
evidence that application of tension (or drawing) to the Cu-7 tailstring
aligned polymer chains along the
length of the tailstring. This had the effect
of strengthening the tailstring along its length at the cost of weakening
lateral bonds
within the tailstring. The result was that the tailstring would
withstand a greater pull before breaking but became prone to fray.
His evidence
applies to the entirety of the length of the tailstring. It was submitted that
the evidence of Professor Fives-Taylor
and Professor Robertson and the letter
from the National Biological Standards Laboratory support the finding that Cu-7
tailstrings,
being made of highly drawn polypropylene, frayed throughout their
length.
<P>

<b>(b)	Significance Of Fraying</b>
<P>

(i) 	<u>Rougher and Larger Surface</u>
<P>

6.	The defendants argued that fraying by itself was solely an aesthetic problem
without medical consequences. The plaintiffs said
that a frayed tailstring will
have a larger and rougher surface area than a non-fraying tailstring and will
thereby attract bacterial
adhesion and colonisation, increasing the risk of
pelvic inflammatory disease.
<P>

7.	It appears that there is no dispute between the parties as to Professor
Fives-Taylor's evidence that the body's primary defence
against infection by
micro-organisms is desquamation, that is, the defence of flushing out
micro-organisms by shedding cells on the
outer layer of organs. If a
micro-organism has adhered to a surface which does not desquamate, then it is
able to stay in the body.
Professor Fives-Taylor described adhesion as "<i>the
first and most primary virulence factor</i>" for a micro-organism in the
body.
<P>

8.	A Cu-7 or Mini, including its tailstring, can not desquamate. Any biomedical
implant becomes coated with a thin layer of host
proteins immediately upon
being placed into the body. An IUD is no exception. Micro-organisms can attach
to this layer of proteins
through specific adhesion. Specific adhesion involves
the formation of bonds between the micro-organism and the surface layer on
the
tailstring. Professor Ellner gave evidence that the initial attachment is due
to physical and chemical forces but that within
a few hours after attachment
micro-organisms which have adhered to an IUD can exude a substance which forms
a "<i>slime</i>" layer over the IUD.  (Para 16 of Professor Ellner's first
statement, Tab  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Exch%20P282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1, Ex. P282).</a> This, together with material from the host, forms
a biofilm which rapidly covers the whole of the surface of the device.
Professor
Ellner said micro-organisms can and do colonise the surface and
interior of this biofilm.
<P>

9.	The plaintiffs say that because of the fibrillation which causes frayed and
rough surfaces, bacteria are better able to adhere
to the Cu-7 tailstring than
to other tailstrings. 
<P>

10.	Professor Katz gave evidence that bacteria are better able to adhere to a
rough surface than a smooth one and that bacteria
are more likely to colonise
along the frayed areas.  (paragraph 17, Statement of Professor Katz dated 25
August 1995, Tab  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20Exch%20P192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1, Ex. P192).</a>  Professor Kaplan agreed that bacteria might be
able to adhere better to rough surfaces than smooth.  (T.5370/L57-5371/L3).
Professor
Robertson and Professor Fives-Taylor observed that the biofilm
preferentially concentrated in the grooves of the tailstring created
by
fibrillation, frayed areas and areas of pits, crevices and roughness. Professor
Fives-Taylor undertook experiments which indicated
that up to 10 times as many
bacteria adhered to frayed parts of the Copper 7 tailstring as to smooth parts.
The defendants accept
that bacteria can adhere to IUD tailstrings. 
<P>

(ii)	<u>Bacterial Adhesion Greater In Polypropylene Tailstrings</u>
<P>

11.	Professor Fives-Taylor conducted experiments to measure bacterial adhesion
to various tailstrings and polymers. She measured
specific adherence of
radioactively "<i>tagged</i>" bacteria to unprocessed beads of polyethylene,
polypropylene and co-polymer. While some bacterial species adhered better to
one
material and some to another, there was little or no overall preference
shown by various bacterial species for one over another.
Six of ten bacterial
species tested adhered better to polyethylene and four adhered better to
polypropylene. 
<P>

12.	She then measured specific adherence of bacteria to tailstrings of IUDs.
The results demonstrated much greater adhesion to the
polypropylene tailstring
of the Cu-7 over the tailstrings of other devices. This held true across
bacterial species. Twelve of the
thirteen bacterial species tested adhered
better to polypropylene in tailstring form. There was no result for the
thirteenth. 
<P>

13.	Professor Fives-Taylor concluded that it was the processing of the
material, rather than the choice of polypropylene itself,
which accounted for
the greater adherence of bacteria to Copper 7 tailstrings over the tailstrings
of other materials.
<P>

14.	The defendants' witness, Professor Kaplan, an expert in microbiology from
the University of Texas Medical School, criticised
a number of techniques used
in Professor Fives-Taylor's bacterial adherence experiments. His evidence was
that the use of human saliva
rather than oestrus fluid as a medium for coating
the tailstrings deprived the results of significance. He criticised the
application
of the method of counting bacteria and suggested that the
experimental technique was sloppy, pointing to the recording in the laboratory
notebooks of a number of experiments being spoiled by accidents in the
laboratory. Professor Fives-Taylor's group conducted more
than a thousand
experiments, including replicates and gave evidence that some accidents were to
be expected. Professor Kaplan has
not however pointed to any scientific
literature which suggests that Professor Fives-Taylor's experiments should not
be given weight.
<P>

15.	The Cu-7 tailstring has been shown to have certain characteristics
resulting from its manufacturing process. The fibrillation
and morphological
breakdown of the tailstring led to it having a greater surface area and greater
surface roughness than tailstrings
made of other materials. The plaintiffs
submitted that Professor Fives-Taylor's conclusion that the fraying and
degradation of the
Copper 7 tailstring promote the adhesion of bacteria should
be accepted because: 
<P>

*			Professor Fives-Taylor and her group undertook many 
<P>

		experiments and replicates so even though some are 			criticised, the overall
weight is convincing.
<P>

*			there are no contrary experiments.	
<P>

*			the only experimental work of the defendants about which 		there is
evidence is supportive in that it indicates that E. coli,
		a recognised PID
pathogen, can adhere to the Cu-7 tailstring.
<P>

*			Professor Ellner gave evidence to similar effect including 			citations of
the published science which is itself supportive.
		See paragraph 16 of
Professor Ellner's statement of 31 July 		1995 (Exhibit P 282, Tab 1) and
Exhibits P 205 (Wilkins et al 		1989
IJP 57 1-7) and D347 (Wilkins et al
Contraception Vol 		39, No 2, p. 205), being 2 of the footnotes to Professor
Ellner's paragraph
16. 
<P>

*			the defendants concede that bacteria adhere to tailstrings so 		there is
nothing unlikely in her results.
<P>

(iii)	<u>Medical Risks Due To Defects</u>
<P>

16.		The defendants submitted that, even if this is so, it nevertheless has 
<P>

		no clinical implications. Professor Kaplan agreed that microbial 
<P>

		adherence based on biofilm is a fundamental and pivotal factor in 
<P>

		sepsis involving biomaterials. (T.5218/L54-	T5219/L5).  However 	he was not
prepared to extrapolate from this 	position,which
applied 
<P>

		to a wide range of other implanted devices, to the case of IUDs. He 
<P>

		expressed the view that because the epidemiological data cleared 
<P>

		IUDs from involvement in infections, IUDs were necessarily 
<P>

		different from other biomedical devices.
<P>

17.		Professor Kaplan accepted that cells might detach from the biofilm 	of an
IUD in situ and, in a host whose defences are lowered
	sufficiently, might
cause infection. However he suggested that the 	probability would be that the
large numbers of pathogens constantly
	accessing the upper genital tract would
cause PID rather than 	pathogens detaching from the biofilm covered IUD.
(T5266/L9-41).
<P>

18.		Professor Kaplan's opinion that pathogens detaching from the 	biofilm were
not likely to cause PID was not based on his expertise
	in microbiology but
rested on his understanding of the epidemiology 	as exonerating the Cu-7. He
agreed that his opinions were not
	informed by any expertise as an
epidemiologist.  (T5192/L25-32).  	although he has read the literature and
formed opinions. It was
	submitted that if the epidemiological prop to his
argument is 	removed, it would appear that his concession as to the
microbiological
point goes a long way to support the plaintiffs' 
<P>

		case.
<P>

19.		Professor Ellner expressed a quite different view as to the 	importance of
pathogens leaving the biofilm. He expressed the
view 	(as did Professor Katz)
that the biofilm protects bacteria from the 	host immune system and
antibiotics, allowing pathogens
to survive 	in the upper genital tract, an area
of the body where they would 	ordinarily be eliminated by the immune system.
His
evidence was 	that the biofilm on an IUD can concentrate nutrients,
enabling the 	bacteria to multiply within the biofilm. He stated
that the
biofilm 	covered Cu-7 forms a "<i>nidus</i>" or infective reservoir from which
micro-organisms can emerge to infect the host. His evidence was 	that whether
the bacterial colonisation
of the Cu-7 results in 	infection or not depends
upon many factors involving the state of 	host defences and the numbers and
virulence
of the 	micro-organisms. However the role of the fraying as a design
defect 	was to provide a reservoir of pathogens able to infect
the uterus.
<P>

20.		The danger of frayed strings was given support by Dr Stewart who 
<P>

		declared that frayed strings were "<i>medically</i> <i>unacceptable</i>".

<P>

		(Ex. P486).  It submitted that the Searle documents provide further 	support
in that they contain many references to the dangers
of 	infection from frayed
tailstrings. The plaintiffs submitted that the 	evidence of Professor Ellner,
supported by the plaintiffs'
and 	defendants' clinicians, (who agreed that they
would remove the 
<P>

		Cu-7 in the event of infection), over that of Professor Kaplan.
<P>

		The defendants submitted that:
<P>

(1)		No adverse medical conditions has ever been associated with a 
<P>

		frayed or fibrillated tailstring.
<P>

(2)		No medical practitioner, including those who took the matter up
<P>

		with Searle, ever reported an infection associated with a frayed
<P>

		tailstring.
<P>

(3)		No government or regulatory agency ever complained of, or
<P>

		otherwise draw Searle's attention to, an infection, or other adverse 
<P>

		medical outcome, associated with a frayed tailstring, as distinct 
<P>

		from the fact that fraying had been observed.
<P>

		The experts, Professors Coughlin, Fives-Taylor and Robertson speculated that
in their view that there was preferential attachment
to the crevices and
grooves.  Professor Wachtel, an SEM expert retained by Professor Coughlin to
assist him in his research, reported
from actual observation that the bacteria
were not propentially attached to grooves and crevices.  (Ex. P.245, page
2).
<P>

		The essence of the plaintiffs' case on this aspect is that Searle was
negligent in using polypropylene probably rather than polyethylene.
 There was
no evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs that polyethylene was "<i>safer</i>".
The epidemiological evidence established that there is no difference in the
performance of IUDs using either polypropylene or polyethylene.
<P>

		Professor Robertson conducted no comparative studies.
<P>

		Professor Coughlin had obtained data which showed the performance was
similar.  (Ex. D.305 at para 119).  This data was omitted
from <b>Coughlin et
al 1992</b> by Professor Coughlin at a time when he was retained by plaintiffs'
lawyers and was aware that the lawyers thought Searle should
have used
polyethylene.
<P>

		Dr Piziali (Ex. D.396, paras 45-54, 95-99) gave evidence that polypropylene
had certain advantages over polyethylene in
<P>

		(i)	the manner of attachment to the IUD;
<P>

		(ii)	the surface area of the tailstring.
<P>

		Dr Piziali calculated that the overall area of the fibrillated polypropylene
was less than the alternative polyethylene.
<P>

		It is clear from the evidence of Dr Piziali that drawing the tailstring
material to produce higher tensile strength is a trade-off
for fibrillation.

<P>

<b>(b)		"Ascension" up the tailstring</b>
<P>

		The plaintiffs' case is as follows:
<P>

1.	The plaintiffs alleged in their pleadings that the Cu-7 and Mini tailstring
provided a suitable environment for colonisation
by bacteria and/or other
infectious organisms.  (See e.g. Paras 14(A)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the
Amended Statement of Claim)
<P>

2.	There is no issue that the normal uterus is subject to periodic incursions
of bacteria which are almost always effectively eliminated
by the immune
system. There is also no issue that a uterus which has an IUD in it will always
have permanent colonies of micro-organisms
associated with the biofilm on that
IUD. These micro-organisms are protected by the biofilm from the action of the
immune system.
<P>

3.	It is common ground that it is only upon ascension through the cervix into
the upper genital tract that micro-organisms, including
virulent pathogens such
as gonococcus and chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobes can cause PID. An issue
between the parties was the
extent, if any, to which the tailstring of the Cu-7
could assist a potential pathogen to "<i>ascend</i>" . 
<P>

4.	There does not seem to be any dispute that, upon insertion into the body,
the Cu-7 rapidly becomes coated by a biofilm which
is colonised by bacteria and
that some of these bacteria can be pathogenic in the upper genital tract. There
was no dispute as to
the evidence of Professor Ellner and Professor
Fives-Taylor that there are colonies of bacteria in the device biofilm which
have
bypassed the cervical defences and which enjoy a measure of protection
from the immune system whenever an IUD is in situ.  These
colonies of bacteria
are able to exist in the upper genital tract solely by reason of the presence
of the device. In this sense there
was no real argument that the presence of
the device has assisted in the establishment of micro-organisms in the upper
genital tract.
the question is whether they can do any harm.
<P>

5.	There is consensus that all IUDs (and other biomedical implants) rapidly
become covered in biofilm upon insertion into the body.
There is debate as to
how much of the biofilm is produced by adherent bacteria and how much is host
material, an issue which does
not need to be decided. Biofilm is a bacterial
adaptation which has the effect of promoting the survival and proliferation of
bacteria.
Bacteria associated with biofilm can survive in environments where
bacteria in their planktonic form would not be able to survive.
Bacteria are
able to adhere to and leave the biofilm. Professor Ellner gave evidence that
biofilm confers a substantial number of
advantages upon bacteria which permit
them to survive permanently in the upper genital tract.  Professor Katz
supported this evidence
as did Professor Fives-Taylor.  Professor Kaplan
suggested that biofilm might "<i>entomb</i>" bacteria based upon a reference
made by Professor Costerton many years ago. It is submitted that the views of
Professors Ellner,
Katz, Fives-Taylor, Robertson should be preferred to those
of Professor Kaplan.  Their views were said to be supported by supported
by the
published science in the area, including recent work of Professor Costerton.
Professor Kaplan put forward no published work
other than the older work of
Professor Costerton (covered by his disavowal of pre-scanning confocal
microscope work), to support
it and Professor Kaplan said that his use of terms
such as "<i>cement</i>" to describe biofilm and "<i>entombed</i>" to describe
living bacteria was "<i>theatrical</i>."  (T5394/L1-15).
<P>

6.	The parties disagreed as to the mechanisms which allow bacteria to move into
the upper genital tract. Professor Ellner identified
mechanisms by which the
Cu-7 and Mini assisted bacterial ascension including: 
<P>

	(a) 	movement of the perimeter of individual colonies, 
<P>

	(b) 	"<i>pollination</i>" from existing colonies on the string, and 
<P>

	(c) 	the establishment of new colonies by planktonic bacteria 	attaching to
the tailstring, whether or not they had emerged 	from
other colonies on the
tailstring. 
<P>

7.	Professor Robertson identified a number of mechanisms including the
extension of boundaries of a colony by lateral extension
driven by
multiplication of organisms causing growth of the colony. He also identified
"<i>pollination</i>"in which micro-organisms or entire colonies detach from the
string and reattach at different places. 
<P>

8.	Professor Katz, an expert in how micro-organisms move, also identified a
tendency of motile organisms to move along the tailstring
surface towards a
source of nourishment, a process known as chemotaxis. 
<P>

9.		Professor Coughlin demonstrated that micro-organisms can and do grow along
Cu-7 tailstrings in the laboratory in preference
to random growth. The
defendants criticised the laboratory techniques used in the experiments and
indeed the applicability of in
vitro experiments at all but did not call
evidence to the effect that the mechanisms identified by the plaintiffs'
scientific experts
did not operate. 
<P>

10.	The only evidence as to experiments carried out by the defendants was
tendered by the plaintiffs. This related to experiments
carried out in 1986/7
which suggested that at least one micro-organism associated with PID, E. coli,
was able to attach and to move
through mucus in the presence of the tailstring.

<P>

11.	The plaintiffs submitted that the evidence of Professors Ellner, Katz,
Robertson and Coughlin that the Cu-7 and Mini tailstring
can facilitate the
transport of micro-organisms into the upper genital tract should be
accepted.
<P>

		The defendants dispute that there is evidence as demonstrated of movement of
bacteria along the tailstring.  
<P>

		Professor Robertson on behalf of the plaintiffs suggested three mechanisms by
which bacteria might migrate along the tailstring:
<P>

		(a)	direct migration
<P>

		(b)	sheer forces
<P>

		(c)	locomotion of the bacteria guided by chemotaxis.
<P>

		Professors Robertson and Fives-Taylor reported in <b>Warner et al 1991</b> on
the only two cases of bacaterial colonisation they found.  Both were on the
portion of the tailstring which was in the user's
vagina.  Apparently Professor
Robertson did not find any bacteria at the uterus end of the string using
TEM.
<P>

		The only bacteria found on any used IUD tailstrings was found encapsulated in
biofilm.  Professor Kaplan expressed the view that
when bacteria are
encapsulated in biofilm they remain so.  (Ex. D.305, paras. 29, 31 &amp;
34).
<P>

		There is no evidence of continuous or semi-continuous bacteria which casts
considerable doubt on (a) and (b) above.
<P>

		In respect to attraction of bacteria by chemotaxis there was nothing to
suggest that the presence of an IUD played any part in
such movement if it
occurred.
<P>

		In relation to the dispute between the parties Professor Ellner who gave
evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs indicated the importance
of the number of
bacteria entering the uterus in determining the risk of infection.
<P>

		Professor Ellner also gave evidence in relation to a number of in vitro
experiments carried out by Professor Fives-Taylor and
others in relation to the
ascension of bacteria.  He was of the view essentially that they were of
limited value because they did
not mimic the in vivo conditions.  
<P>

		There was a vast amount of evidence given by Professors Fives-Taylor,
Coughlin, Ellner and Katz on behalf of the plaintiffs and
Dr Piziali and
Professor Kaplin on behalf of the defendants relating to tailstrings and their
characteristics.  That evidence encompassed
evidence of experiments and
technical criticisms of those experiments and of opinions and counter
opinions.
<P>

		In my view the extraordinary complexity of these issues may be disposed of by
determining the effect, if any, of the matters alleged
by the 
<P>

plaintiffs on the health of users of Cu-7 device.
<P>

		The matters raised are in my view advanced as possible causes of infection of
users of Cu-7 devices.  As I indicated above in
my view the evidence does not
indicate any statistically significant increase in the rate of infection and in
my view there is no
evidence that these issues had any effect on the health of
users of Cu-7 devices.
<P>

<center><b>4.3	<u>CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

	The plaintiffs sought to establish a causal connection between use of the Cu-7
device and the contracting of PID by the observation
of treating doctors of the
fact of the contracting of PID by users of Cu-7 and other devices.
<P>

	In my view this submission has no substance whatsoever.  There was no basis
put forward for concluding that the mere observation
of a condition which may
occur with or without the use of an IUD in a person who uses an IUD is
probative in any way of any causal
connections between the use of an IUD and
the contracting of PID.
<P>

	The three areas of proof propounded by the plaintiffs, Epidemiology, the
Scientific Analysis and Clinical Observations, do not
either individually or
together establish any causal association between the use of the Cu-7 devices
and the incidence of PID.
<P>

<center><b><u>5.	WARNINGS</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

	In my view the defendants did not fail to warn the plaintiffs of any matter of
which they were required to warn.
<P>

	The evidence does not establish that perhaps, despite the then current views,
the devices increased the risk to users of the devices
except as a result of
the insertion procedure.  
<P>

	Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged that in the absence of an appropriate
increased risk there was no duty to warn and the
defendants had not breached
any such duty.
<P>

The insertion procedure carried with it an element of risk which was known to
all inserting doctors and of which they were all aware
at the time of carrying
out the relevant insertion.
<P>

	In my view there was no requirement to warn medical practitioners of such an
elementary matter nor was there any obligation to
warn users of such a risk
when they could only obtain access to use of the devices with the service of a
doctor.
<P>

<center><b><u>6.      CONCLUSION</u></b></center>
<P>

	In my view the plaintiffs have not established that:
<P>

(1)	Use of the Cu-7 IUD increased the risk of the user contracting PID 
<P>

by any statistically significant degree.
<P>

(2)	There was not any negligence on the part of the defendants in the 
<P>

design and/or manufacture of the Cu-7 or Mini devices.
<P>

It is true that employees of the defendants expressed contrary views in
relation to the tailstring of the device which indicated
that there were
defects in the devices but in the light of the evidence before me I am of the
view that those views did not reflect
correctly the effect of the matters
referred to on the well-being of users of the devices.
<P>

A considerable amount of evidence was given as to the possible causes of the
injuries which the plaintiffs each suffered.  In my
view the cause of the
infection is not relevant to the determination of the liability of the
defendants in the light of my conclusions.
<P>

It is clear that injury of the type sustained by each of the plaintiffs could
have been sustained even if the devices had not been
used and in my view the
evidence does not establish as is required by the law of New South Wales that
on the balance of probability
the injury to the plaintiffs was caused or
materially contributed to by the use of the devices.

<P>

		report stated:
<P>

			"Of the 1,170 removals for medical reasons other than
<P>

			bleeding or pain, 340 or 72 per cent were not followed
<P>

by reinsertion, and 28 per cent were followed by reinsertion of the same or
another type of IUD.  All of the 61 cases of carcinoma
of the cervix were
closed for that reason, as well as 80-90 per cent of the reported cases of
removal for pelvic inflammatory disease

<P>

(PID), perforation of the uterus, and various pathological conditions involving
the pelvic organs.    About one-third of the 840
closures were cases of PID
(277 cases), and an additional one-third involved diagnoses such as vaginitis,
ovarian cyst, fibromyomata,
cystocele, and other genital pathology (268
cases).
<P>

Except for the spirals, PID was the most frequent reason for removal for other
medical reasons.  The event rates for this cause,
ranging from 1.3 per 100
users for the steel ring to 2.5 per 100 with the double coil, were not
significantly different by device.
<P>

In addition to the 329 cases of PID involving removal of the device, there were
437 cases of PID treated with the device remaining
in situ, making a total of
766 cases of PID among women wearing intrauterine devices (see upper panel of
Table 26).  Differences
between the net cumulative rates based on 766 cases of
PID, by type of IUD, were also not significant.
<P>

When PID rates were computed per 100 woman-years of use, according to the date
the diagnosis was made, the rate for the first month
was substantially higher
than the rates for later months.  When the first month was divided into two
equal periods, the rate for
the first half of the month was significantly
higher than rates for any subsequent periods.  Table 27 shows a steady decline
in PID
rates from the first half-month through six years of use."

<P>

<b>1971		</b>with FDA regarding preclinical (animal testing) and clinical 
<P>

		(human testing) studies.  (Ex P297, P.0820) stated:
<P>

			"First of all, as we expected, the decision to classify 
<P>

the Cu-7 as a new drug is a firm decision and not subject to appeal.
<P>

However, having classified the Cu-7 as a new drug, the FDA people are in
considerable discomfort having to regulate an area with
which they have no
experience and being threatened with the prospect of having to choke off all
existing studies if regulations are
to be followed to the letter.  As a result,
both in the preclinical and clinical areas, the FDA seems to be fairly flexible
and interested
in getting themselves (and us) off of a hook.
<P>

Accordingly, we plan to file an IND at the earliest possible date, although
this IND will probably be a fairly skimpy document and
we may not have on hand
all of the data needed for an IND as we normally would file one.  This
submission will be followed by periodic
updating submissions until such time as
we are ready to file a New Drug Application.  Hopefully by this time, most of
the data will
have been submitted to the FDA in the three primary areas of
concern, namely clinical, preclinical and manufacturing and control.
 It is my
hope that if this can be successfully carried out, the NDA could be fairly
rapidly approved.
<P>

However, before we start counting chickens, it will be necessary for us to pay
very close attention to several points.  First, in
order to solidify the FDA
position, we would be wise to provide the FDA with every conceivable piece of
data which we can beg, borrow
or steal.  The published literature should be
freely used.
<P>

Second, any submission which we make must very carefully distinguish as to the
type and size of device to which the data may apply.
 
<P>

Third, our protocols for long-term animal and human studies must be complete
and precise.  The co-operative approach of the FDA
must not be taken as an
excuse to provide the Agency with a second rate submission.
<P>

In summation, it is my impression that the FDA attitude was generally one of
co-operation and at this point in time I do believe
that our prospects for
compiling an approvable New Drug Application are quite good."

market as follows:
<P>

	"1.  To beat the possible competition of the Copper T
<P>

in a market unprotected with our US patent.
<P>

2.  Association of the international introduction with the NDA may cause some
concern in foreign legislation bodies as they would
like to wait for the FDA
decision before acceptance of the Cu-7.  While our present data can support eh
Cu-7 introduction scientifically,
we may face some problems created by the FDA
as far as foreign data are concerned.
<P>

3.  A wide acceptance of the Cu-7 internationally may influence the FDA to look
at it more favorably.
<P>

4.  Last, but not least, it is time to see some profits on our investments in
this project."

<P>

(Ex. P297, P0742).  Searle stated (p.108):  
<P>

"(i)  that pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) seemed to 
<P>

be second only to excessive bleeding and/or cramps as 
<P>

the most common disorder associated with wearing an 
<P>

IUD." 
<P>

Searle further stated (p.108, paragraph 2): 
<P>

"the overall incidence of symptoms suggestive of PID 
<P>

in the Cu-7 Study Population is 1.84%.  The incidence 
<P>

of PID in the Cu-7 Studies is between reported 
<P>

incidences of PID in clinic vs private patients.  This is
<P>

realistic since the Cu-7 population is evenly divided 
<P>

into clinic and patients.  Three of the investigators had 
<P>

extremely high incidences of PID in their studies:  - 
<P>

from Dr. Kohl's Clinic came 41.5% of the PID cases.
<P>

  This clinic supplied on 2.5% of the Cu-7 population. 
<P>

 25 patients came from the clinics of Dr Tricomi and 
<P>

Dr Goldsmith in which 229 Cu-7 were studied.  This 
<P>

suggests that clinic conditions, or living conditions of 
<P>

the patients visiting these clinics, contributed more to 
<P>

the etiology of PID than did C-7."
<P>

Searle stated (p. 109 (ii):
<P>

"a variety of gynaecological changes were reported 
<P>

by Cu-7 patients.  It is not felt that any of these are 
<P>

attributable to the device.  Approximately 1.0% of the 
<P>

Cu-7 wearers complain of backaches, frequently 
<P>

accompanied by pain or cramps in the legs especially 
<P>

the thighs."
<P>

At p. 95:
<P>

"as reported in the New Drug Application for the 
<P>

Cu-7, nulliparous women had significantly more 
<P>

complaints than multiparous women in every category 
<P>

except bleeding where no significant difference 
<P>

occurred."
<P>

At p. 165 under the heading "<i>Continuing Clinical Studies</i>":
<P>

"....(d)  patients who drop from the study to become 	pregnant will be followed
to document the rates of 	fertility after removal
of the Cu-7.  Patients who do
not

become pregnant will be followed in an attempt to 	determine the cause of their

<P>

		In this document there is a discussion of the problems
<P>

		encountered with the Cu 7 Study in relation to the
<P>

		collection of data.  It states:
<P>

			"The follow-up information and the drop-out
<P>

			information is the same physical form.  This is
<P>

creating confusion and I am in the process of re-doing these forms to separate
the two.
<P>

The drop-out form is very crammed in lay-out and contains a considerable number
of redundant questions, this is confusing; this
has generated much conflicting,
missing and invalid data."
<P>

Under "<i>Miscellaneous Problems" </i>it states:
<P>

	"One of the biggest problems is that patients move
<P>

	and change their names.  We have had difficulty
<P>

identifying the patient if she has changed her name or moved.  In addition, we
have seen a number of follow-up forms without the
doctor's name on
it...Follow-up on patients lost TO (sic) follow-ups; two problems are
occurring:
<P>

	patient who is considered lost to follow-up,  -
<P>

	then at some later date reappears and patient
<P>

	who never returns after insertion.
<P>

The former will be rectified during the audit, but the latter can only be
rectified by establishing a rule as to when a patient
is considered LTF.  This
then requires some sort of document should be created to certify that the
patient is actually LTF.  Meanwhile,
the patient is concerned active which does
affect the life table numbers".
<P>

Under the heading "<i>Summary</i>" it states:
<P>

	"Most of these problems have been uncovered in the
<P>

	last month.  The Patients Status Reports gave us a
<P>

	look at the data in a different light but opened the
<P>

proverbial, `<i>can of worms</i>'.  A number of problems have been solved; more
surface all the time and it is taking a considerable amount of time and effort
to
bring the Cu-7 project into good order..."

<P>

		This document provides a useful history to the

		development and marketing of the Gravigard.  The
<P>

		product was sold outside the USA through 
<P>

		pharmaceutical wholesalers to physicians.
<P>

		It stated (p.15) that the promotional material
<P>

		used the <i>"creative" </i>concept to create an image Cu-7
<P>

as a contraceptive device rather than the <i>"usual highly suspect stereotyped
IUD". </i>
<P>

It stated that the nulliparous marketing aspect of Searle's promotion was in
place by at least 1974 (p 16) and that the Cu-7 was
second only to the pill in
its efficacy (p 18).
<P>

		It stated Searle targeted a small group of <i>"IUD </i>
<P>

<i>supporter" </i>physicians (usually gynaecologists) and
<P>

used them as an existing base to key the initial 
<P>

promotion.  Searle advised its sales staff to use this
<P>

<i>"key" </i>concept to overcome any resistance by
<P>

inexperienced physicians to using Cu-7.
<P>

Searle's strategy was to promote Cu-7 for all women
<P>

of child-bearing age including nulliparous (p.23),
<P>

and it decided to <i>"stress nullip use" </i>in its 1975
<P>

tactics (p.24).

and excellent efficacy
rates are strong factors for the growth of the product....  We continue to

			"If and when we proceed with a nulliparous Cu-7,

			we are going to have a difficult enough job overcoming
<P>

resistance to insertion in the nullip due to fears of infection/infertility,
and reports such as the Exeter study:
<P>

The FPA/Exeter trial by emphasising the double infection rate of nullip against
multip, will in no way be helpful particularly....the
difference includes
incidence rates PID between the parous and nulliparous women...the Exeter
report does not even approach statistical
significance."
<P>

Under the heading "<i>Points for Clarification" </i> the author notes:
<P>

	"'Field Trial'  -  the implication here is that this 
<P>

trial is so much more worthwhile than the pharmaceutical company base
trails...in that the admission criteria applied had been much
wider and more
representative of normal clinical practise.  Very largely, the criteria will
have had to be the same, ...and this
leaves out a few such as menorrhagia,
particularly when using other devices, patients who have already rejected an
IUD and the point
they have about not cohabiting at the time of admission to
the study."
<P>

"I am always conscious that we are dealing with a sociologist with medical
aspirations, and not with a doctor.  I'm also conscious
that this trial is
essentially [worked] by FPA doctors and it is only the statistical correlation
and the odd spot of useless guff
about patient types and social class that
justifies a sociologist's interest."

"The subject of PID is a complex one....  Two physicians will make the same

with completely different findings.  For example, one physician might limit the
diagnosis to people with pelvic tenderness, pelvic
masses and fever while
another will label any patient who complains of pain on pelvic examination as
PID.
<P>

Since physicians do not always define what they mean by PID, it is difficult to
collect information.  While Dr Eschenbach's suggestion
is well taken, it would
be hard to implement.  His opinion that all IUDs cause PID is shared by
others..."

"Our marketing group is receiving an increasing
<P>

number of enquiries in relation to the above topics.
<P>

Our response to doctors has usually been to reassure them that there is no
increased incidence of PID with Gravigard and no increased
occurrence of
ectopic pregnancies.  However, we have never supported the statements with any
published data.
<P>

Recent publications have made our response to these enquiries more difficult
and I will appreciate comment from you as to our official
position on this
topic.
<P>

It would seem from the results from Westrom et al (1976) that in general
clinical use, Gravigard may be associated with an increased
incidence of PID.
Taking the argument further and relying on the results of Hallett (1976) we may
also expect a slightly increased
incidence of ectopic pregnancies.  Can we
quote the figures used by Burke (1977) or should we quote results from our own
international
study where ectopic pregnancies occurred at a rate of 3.8% of
total pregnancies.  I have not seen the report by Beral, in British
Journal of
Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology (1975) vol. 82 p.775, but he apparently singles
out the Gravigard IUD as possibly causing
a greater increase in ectopic
pregnancies than other `coils'.  
<P>

We certainly require a carefully prepared response to this type of enquiry in
future and I look forward to any assistance you may
be able to give."

			"I have reached the conclusion that the FDA will

consider the IUD to be a cause of salpingitis with possible adverse effects on
the future fertility of the wearer and I suggest
that we have a meeting of
legal, regulatory, clinical and marketing to determine if we should take any
action now about our labelling.
 We might be at a medico-legal disadvantage if
we do not make a stronger warning.  The group considered highest risk for
infection
and subsequent loss of fertility is that consisting of nulligravida,
under 26, with multiple sex partners.  It seems to be that the
identification
of such a group by the FDA, mishandled by the lay press, might have an impact
on our marketing strategy."
<P>

The committee had substantial evidence that a problem existed and concluded
that 
<P>

1.	It was important that steps be taken to protect users

		by 
<P>

		1.1	warning patients and the medical profession

		1.2	avoiding use of IUDs where possible in women

			most susceptible to PID, the young, the nullipara
<P>

			and those with multiple sexual partners.

<P>

associated with the use of IUDs as well as the higher risk to nulliparous

the Minis to young nulliparous women.

Apart from this, believe problem is not just quality assurance but medical is

signed and development work started.  It stated that the

executive summary statement stated in part:
<P>

	"...The particular characteristics and properties of the

polypropylene have caused several medical 	problems...  It's memory has on
occasions, caused the 	string to retract from the vagina
into the cervix and

a tendency to fray giving 	the
string a low quality appearance and perhaps
increasingly likelihood of uterine infection."

definite relationship between the occurrence
of PID and the use of an
intrauterine device remain quite confusing and often conflicting.  Obviously, a
physician would be ill advised

nulliparous or multiparous, who had a previous history of venereal disease, who
was known
to be sexually promiscuous, or who entertained a multiplicity of

<P>

Dr Hatcher and the Family Planning Federation requested that Searle  review the
insertion mechanism of the Cu-7 in 1980.  Dr Hatcher
was also concerned that
bacteria would enter the uterus from the vagina during insertion because of the
presence of the Cu-7 thread
on the outside of the inserter barrel.  Other
concerns related to retraction and medical problems were also mentioned.

Battelle provided Searle with alternatives to the polypropylene string and
recommended:

	"Design 15"
<P>

It stated that:
<P>

	"Can be adopted by Searle with a minimum of time 
<P>

and effort needed for conversion.  Requires only one moulding change..., a
small hole must be added to the bottom of the barrel.
<P>

Is applicable to both the Cu-7 and the Cu-7(s).
<P>

Should allow stringing an equal or less time than is presently used by Searle
for heat knotting.  
<P>

Would allow the monofilament to be placed inside the insertion tube during
insertion, thereby eliminating the loop which is otherwise
formed when the
monofilament is outside the tube."

"I met with Dr L. Graham of Searle today and discussed the PIs that had been

some descriptive parts the
submitted PIs were essentially `<i>identical'</i>.  I therefore chose one, the
Gravigard one as I happened, to work on with the results below being a
concoction of Searle's original
and the wording used in the Multiload PI.  At
this meeting Dr Graham produced a copy of the 1981 US Searle PI which was very
similar
to what I was proposing and neatly improved over the one submitted for
consideration.  I have given Dr Graham a copy of my concoction
and she will
work on that and resubmit a revised PI.  She will also enquire about the
patient brochure now referred to as the US
PI - the Multiload PI has pre and
post insertion patient booklets which I think are excellent and I strongly
recommend that Searle
introduce a simpler booklet here (approval required by us
of course) especially as it now appears to be a requirement in the US.

"The major problems caused by the polypropylene resin were due to stiffness and
`<i>memory'</i>.  This problem will be addressed in two phases.  Phase 1 of
this plan calls for loading the string down through the <u>inside </u>of the
insertion tube.  This procedure effectively eliminates the current
`<i>loop'</i> configuration created by the polypropylene's resin's stiffness
and inherent and `<i>memory'.</i>"
<P>

It further stated that the finished product would be available
<P>

in mid-April 1982 and that this modification will resolve
<P>

concerns voiced by the US FDA and inserting physicians.  It 
<P>

then noted the following points:
<P>

	"String loss/withdraw into the cervix due to memory 
<P>

and looping the plastic.
<P>

Searle Australia requested the Department of Health to approve a change to the
threading of the Cu-7:
<P>

"The Polypropylene string has a `<i>memory</i>' that causes a `<i>loop' </i>at
the point of exit from the top of the tube that is undesirable.  By removing
the orientation knob...we can run the string down
the inside of the tube and
eliminate this `<i>looping'</i> problem.  It should also provide a more sterile

<P>

	"PID is a severe disease and can be tragic when

occurring in a young, nulliparous patient.  It will be expected to appear more
frequently in young patients upon whom the IUD has
conferred increased sexual
freedom.  Whether the IUD plays a more intimate pathogenic role cannot be
affirmed or refuted, but in
absence in proof to the contrary, it is
conservative to supply appropriate warnings to the individual considering
employing this

contraception, but within that statistic, it is clear that
the greater part of
the increased risk is due to Dalkon Shield users who are between 4-14 x more
likely than non-users to have PID.
 Use of IUDs other than Dalkon Shield is
associated with risks of 2-4 x the risk of PID of non-users.  For Copper-7 the

appears to be 2 x non-users."

In regard to the Issue Statement of P0578 Mr Villers stated:
<P>

	"In taking stock of our present situation it is quite
<P>

apparent that we fall short of the mark in providing any sort of meaningful
disclosure to anyone.  The first step therefore was
to update our current
patient information booklet `<i>Here's What You'll Want to Know About your
Gravigard' </i>which is hopelessly inadequate.  This proved not  a difficult
assignment as I was able to use an American patient booklet as a guide...that
it reads like a horror story is unfortunate but at least it exculpates us from
the charge that we are not making known all the facts."

This memorandum of a meeting between Searle Research
<P>

and Development and the FDA stated:
<P>

"When asked how long patients were included in the study after the date of
their last physician visit, Searle replied that at the
time of the original NDA
submission the date of last visit was used.  However, the next medical monitor
at Searle used the time until
the record was marked lost to follow up, which
varied.  When Dr O'Brien became monitor, he used three months after last
visit."
<P>

"Conclusions: .....Although the agency does believe that IUDs are associated
with an increased incidence of PID, it considers the
incidence to be an
acceptable one for women needing this kind of contraceptive who are informed of
the risk and willing to accept
it."

With regard to tests of new tailstrings to determine the distribution, lengths
and widths of voids it was stated that:
<P>

"While the [sic] are somewhat more voids than we originally thought were
present.  The number and average size of these is such
that there is a
negligible probability of forming a connected path of any significant length.
Of special interest are the results
on the samples treated with acid and
detergent.  It is apparent that there is no significant changes in the
distribution of sizes,
confirming that they are not caused to grow by these
media.
<P>

It is a bit puzzling that there appears to be an appreciably lower number of
voids per string in the strings that were clinically
treated than in the
untreated ones.  It is inconceivable that treatment can cause a decrease in
number of voids."
