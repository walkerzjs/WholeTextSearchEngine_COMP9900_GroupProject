<b>5078/98	SYDNEY OLYMPIC SOCCER FOOTBALL CLUB </b>
<P>

<b>LIMITED   -v-</b>
<P>

<b>		SIMON KONSTANTINIDIS</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>    By summons filed on 21 December 1998 the plaintiff, Sydney
Olympic Soccer Football Club Ltd, seeks an order that the creditor's
statutory
demand served upon the plaintiff by the defendant, Simon Konstantinidis, on
about 1 December 1998 be set aside.  That statutory
demand seeks payment by the
plaintiff to the defendant of the sum of $24,500.  That sum is described in the
schedule to the demand
as:-
<P>

	Moneys lent to the company by the creditor as agreed by the company.
<P>

2	It would appear that in about mid-1996 there was a proposal made by various
members of the plaintiff company - those members being
described in the
evidence and at the time of the proposal as "the Consortium" - that those
members should take over the control of
the plaintiff.  It would appear that
the plaintiff was suffering certain financial problems at the time.  It would
appear that the
members of the Consortium did, in fact, take over the control
of the plaintiff for a period from about mid-1996 until about March
1998 and
that during that period they exercised control over the plaintiff in their
capacity as directors of the plaintiff company.
<P>

3	It is the assertion of the defendant, who was a member of the Consortium,
that he advanced to the plaintiff amounts totalling
$24,500 - I interpolate
that, indeed, in some of the items of correspondence he claims a slightly
higher amount - and that those
amounts so advanced constituted loans by him to
the plaintiff;  which loans he asserts he is entitled to be repaid.  
<P>

4	The plaintiff appears now to be under the management of other directors.  The
plaintiff disputes its liability to repay to the
defendant the amount claimed
by him or any part of that amount.  
<P>

5	The plaintiff does not go so far as to assert that the defendant did not make
advances totalling $24,500. But the plaintiff, through
its Counsel, says that
the affairs of the plaintiff are confused, that advances which may have been
made by the defendant were advances
made not to the plaintiff itself but to the
Consortium, or possibly to a company referred to in some of the documentation
as the
management company (which was a vehicle by which members of the
Consortium were proposing to inject funds into the plaintiff and,
presumably,
to achieve some degree of profit from their involvement with the plaintiff).
<P>

6	The hopes which had been held not only by the members of the Consortium but
also apparently by the generality of the members of
the concerning that the
involvement of the Consortium in controlling the plaintiff were not, however,
fulfilled.
<P>

7	The plaintiff says, through its Counsel, that it may possibly be that the
defendant is entitled to recover these moneys, but not
from the plaintiff;
that the defendant should be looking perhaps to the other members of the
Consortium, or perhaps to the management
company.
<P>

8	The present proceedings are brought pursuant to the provisions of Division 3
of Part 5.4 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  The plaintiff relies upon section
459 H of that statute.  Subsection (1) of that section provides relevantly:-
<P>

	This section applies where, on an application under section 459 G, the Court
is satisfied of either or both of the following:
<P>

	(a)    that there is a genuine dispute between the
<P>

		the company and the respondent about the 
<P>

		existence or amount of a debt to which the
<P>

		demand relates.
<P>

	(b)    that the company has an offsetting claim.
<P>

9	In the instant case the plaintiff relies only on paragraph (a), and submits
that there is a genuine dispute between itself and
the defendant about the
existence of the alleged indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant.
<P>

10	The present proceedings are not an appropriate vehicle in which to resolve
contested litigation between the parties if there
is, in fact, a genuine
dispute as to the indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant.  But it is
submitted on the part of the
defendant that there is, indeed, no genuine
dispute concerning the indebtedness of the plaintiff.
<P>

11	The defendant relies upon documentation created by the plaintiff and
admissions which, says the defendant, have been made by
the plaintiff, in order
to support the defendant's submission that there is, in fact, no genuine
dispute as to the indebtedness of
the plaintiff to the defendant.
<P>

12	On 27 August 1997 there was sent on the letterhead of the plaintiff a
communication by way of facsimile transmission.  That communication
was
addressed to Kerry Polly (who is revealed by other evidence in the proceedings
as having been the chief proponent of and the
facilitator of the proposal that
the Consortium take over the affairs of the plaintiff).  That communication was
from Mr Tony Rallis,
who is disclosed in minutes of various meetings of the
board of the plaintiff (including the board meetings of 2 March 1998 - though
a
misprint shown as 2 March 1988 - and 9 March 1998; the minutes of which board
meetings constitute part of Exhibit 1) to have been
a director of the
plaintiff. In that facsimile transmission, which is headed "Re:  Amount paid by
S.K." Mr. Rallis says:-
<P>

	The following amounts were paid by Simon Konstantinidis in the past eight
weeks:
<P>

	(1)  Canterbury Super League			$12,730.04
<P>

	(2)  Chris Kalantzis				    7,000.00
<P>

	(3)  Geoff Harcombe trip			<u>    5,000.00</u>
<P>

								 $24,730.04
<P>

	If you require any further information, please call me.
<P>

13	That communication is Annexure J to the affidavit of Theophilus Premetis
sworn 21 December 1998, which is the substantive affidavit
in support of the
present claim by the plaintiff to set aside the statutory demand.
<P>

14	On 13 January 1998 there was held a meeting of the board of the plaintiff
the minutes of which are Annexure H to the affidavit
of Mr Premetis.  Under the
heading "Correspondence" there appears the following item:-
<P>

	Letter from Simon Konstantinidis asking that board apply $44.5k loan to assist
in relieving cash flow problems to the Club, that
wage payments earlier in
season be registered as $20k to meet H.K's Consortium contribution.
<P>

15	Shortly after  15 May 1998 the defendant approached one Susie Danias, a
director of the plaintiff, who  was not a member of the
Consortium.  The
defendant's conversation with Miss Danias is set forth in paragraph 4 of the
affidavit of the defendant sworn 17
March 1999.  In that conversation the
defendant said:-
<P>

	What is going to happen about the money which is owed to me by the Club. The
money which I loaned for wages and the like?  It is
about $24,500.00.
<P>

16	Miss Danias said:-
<P>

	Your name appeared on the list of known creditors which Frank Martin prepared
and is classified as a supported claim.  You will
only be paid those moneys
which were loaned by you personally to the Club.  The Board will not pay the
Consortium debt.
<P>

17	The defendant said:-
<P>

	How do I know I will be paid.
<P>

18	Miss Danias replied:-
<P>

	I will send you a copy of a letter from George (Pashalis) which includes a
list of supported and approved creditors.
<P>

19	Subsequently, the defendant received a letter dated that same day, 15 May
1998, on the letterhead of Hooton &amp; Perkins, Solicitors,
signed by George
Pashalis (who is disclosed by that letterhead as being one of the principals of
the firm Hooton &amp; Perkins),
addressed "Miss Susie Danias."  That letter
enclosed a copy of creditors, which is stated in the letter to be "forwarded to
us by
the office for your information."  
<P>

20	That list which is enclosed is headed "Known creditors at 11 May '98."  It
consists of four categories.  Category 3 is described
as "Other supported
claims", and includes as one of the items therein "Simon Konstantinidis - wages
loan $24,500."  
<P>

21	It should here be recorded that not only was Mr George Pashalis the
solicitor acting for the plaintiff in the sale of the football
team of the
plaintiff company but he was at the time of the letter to which I have just
referred also a director of the plaintiff.
 
<P>

22	The defendant's name also appeared on a further list of creditors of the
plaintiff prepared slightly earlier in 1998. At its
meeting of 2 March 1998,
the board of the plaintiff had requested that a list of creditors be prepared.
There is physically annexed
to the minutes of the board meeting of 9 March 1998
a list of creditors headed "Outstanding moneys 16 March "98," which includes
"Simon Konstantinidis - wages loan $24,500."
<P>

23	No evidence has been placed before the Court from Miss Danias disputing the
accuracy of the conversation deposed to by the defendant
with Miss Danias, or
from Mr Pashalis suggesting that the indebtedness of the plaintiff to the
defendant was in any way disputed
at the time of the letter of 15 May 1998.
<P>

24	There has been placed in evidence a list of creditors as at 4 November 1997,
which list does not include the name of the defendant.
But it is clear from
that list and from the documents relevant to the creation of that list that
that list of creditors relates to
creditors which were in existence before
mid-1996, when the Consortium took over control of the plaintiff.
<P>

25	It is apparent from the foregoing admissions contained in the plaintiff's
own documents, without resorting to the documents emanating
from the defendant
himself, that the fact that the plaintiff does not now choose to pay this
amount claimed by the defendant does
not constitute a genuine dispute as to the
indebtedness of the plaintiff.
<P>

26	I am satisfied that there is no such genuine dispute, my conclusion in that
regard being based upon the documents which have
been created by the plaintiff
and the evidence which has been presented on behalf of the plaintiff.
<P>

27	Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the present summons.
<P>

28	(Mr Aldridge sought an order for costs)
<P>

29	I make the following orders:-
<P>

	(1)    I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

	(2)    I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the 	defendant.
<P>

	(3)    The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
