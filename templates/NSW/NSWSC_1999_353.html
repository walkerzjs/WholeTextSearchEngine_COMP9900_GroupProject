<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	By a Notice of Motion filed on 1 March 1999 the defendant, National Australia
Bank Limited, ("NAB"), for which Mr S.M.P. Reeves
of Counsel appeared, sought
an order that the plaintiffs, for whom and which Mr V.R.W. Gray of Counsel
appeared, or, in the alternative,
the second to fifth plaintiffs, provide
security for NAB's costs of the proceedings in the sum of $346,230 or such
other sum as the
Court deems appropriate, and an order that the proceedings be
stayed until such security is provided.  The nature of the plaintiffs'
proceedings are set forth sufficiently in a judgment I delivered on 8 April
1999 by which I granted them leave to amend their Summons.
 I shall not repeat
what I said there, save in so far as is absolutely necessary, and I shall
assume that the reader has access to
that judgment.
<P>

2	NAB's application is based upon s.1335 of the <b>Corporations Law</b>, ("the
Law"), and Part 53 rule 2(1)(e) of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  In his
written submissions Mr Gray stated that the plaintiffs do not dispute the
jurisdiction of the Court to order security as
the corporate plaintiffs are
insolvent, the essential issue being whether it should be ordered in the
exercise of the very wide,
and often stated as "unfettered", discretion of the
Court to make such an order in circumstances where its effect would be to
stultify
the litigation.  That will happen in all probability, because it is
clear that the corporate plaintiffs do not have the financial
wherewithal to
provide the security sought, and the first plaintiff, who is their liquidator,
is not prepared to provide security
personally.  The first plaintiff was
appointed voluntarily as liquidator by the corporate plaintiffs.
<P>

3	The sum of $346,230 was supported by the affidavit of the solicitor for NAB,
Ms Linda Ellen Johnson, sworn 28 February 1999. 
She set forth, in some detail,
how the figure was calculated and, in paragraph 13, stated:-
<P>

	<b>"Having regard to the foregoing, I estimate that the properly recoverable
party party costs for the Bank would be $346,230 (being
65% of the costs of the
Bank).  In calculating this sum, I have excluded the costs of solicitors and
counsel incurred by the Bank
to date in relation to these proceedings."</b>
<P>

4	These proceedings, together with three other proceedings raising related
issues, have been specially fixed for hearing to commence
on 5 October 1999
with a time estimate of eight to ten weeks.  Mr Reeves tendered the Second
Amended Summons in proceedings 50260
of 1995 in which Bernard Laverty Pty
Limited is the plaintiff and NAB is the fifth defendant, and the Amended
Summons in proceedings
50140 of 1997 in which Mr Gordon McNichol Finlay is the
plaintiff and NAB is the first defendant.  These are two of the related
proceedings.
<P>

5	In the first mentioned of those proceedings the plaintiff asserts that NAB is
liable to it because of NAB's role in inducing,
procuring and being knowingly
concerned in Nambucca Investments Pty Limited engaging in misleading and
deceptive conduct in relation
to the solicitation of debenture funds during the
currency of NAB's facilities and, by reason thereof, NAB is allegedly liable to
the plaintiff, Bernard Laverty Pty Limited, in damages.  It is pleaded that NAB
required Nambucca Investments Pty Limited and its
subsidiaries, which include
the corporate plaintiffs in the present case, to provide security for its loans
and other facilities,
which purportedly took priority over the Mortgage
Debenture, except as to a second ranking charge in favour of NAB, in breach of
the terms of the Mortgage Debenture, and:-
<P>

	<b>"By reason of the Bank's security arrangements and priority agreement, and
the fact that subsidiaries held the significant assets
acquired by the use of
the debenture holder's moneys including the plaintiff's and the represented
parties the Bank knew that debenture
holders including the plaintiff and the
represented parties had little or no security for the repayment of moneys lent
to the Company."</b>
<P>

This is essentially the same issue as is raised in these proceedings, although
the relief sought is different.  However, from a
practical point of view, if
the plaintiff is entitled to succeed it may end up with a similar financial
result as if the present
proceedings go forward.
<P>

6	In the second mentioned proceedings Mr Finlay seeks an order that NAB account
to him for all benefits by way of payment of principal,
interest, charges and
fees received by NAB out of the assets of Nambucca Investments Pty Limited and
its subsidiaries during the
currency of the facilities referred to in the
Amended Summons by reason of the realisation of its securities over the assets
of Nambucca
Investments Pty Limited or any of its subsidiaries.  Certain other
relief was sought against NAB including an order that its securities
over the
assets of Nambucca Investments Pty Limited, or any of its securities, be set
aside:-
<P>

	<b>".. so far as they impede, directly or indirectly, the recovery of the debt
of the debenture holders referred to herein or create
any priority equal to or
greater than that of the said debenture holders."</b>
<P>

Thus essentially the same result is sought, so far as Mr Finlay is concerned,
as the plaintiffs seek in these proceedings.
<P>

7	The purpose of tendering those pleadings in this application was to show that
similar issues were raised in the related proceedings
by Bernard Laverty Pty
Limited and Mr Finlay, each of which and whom has an interest in establishing
liability on the part of NAB
in respect of its various transactions, including
its transactions with the present corporate plaintiffs which were subsidiaries
of Nambucca Investments Pty Limited.
<P>

<b> A Tension Exists</b>
<P>

8	There is a clearly a tension between s.1335 of the Law and the various
sections, such as ss.588FE and FF, which allow proceedings
to be brought by the
liquidator to set aside certain transactions in the event of companies being
insolvent.  On the one hand the
Law contemplates a requirement for the giving
of security and, on the other, the bringing of proceedings by or on behalf of
insolvent
companies.  The fact that the latter sections do not excuse an
insolvent company from the provisions of s.1335 show, in my opinion,
that the
legislature did not intend that there should be any dispensation given to those
companies in relation to the application
of s.1335.  The rationale behind this
would seem to be that the parties who would benefit by proceedings under
s.588FF will, generally
speaking, be creditors and others interested in the
insolvent companies recovering moneys and, therefore, sufficiently interested
in the outcome of such proceedings to provide funds to the liquidator to
prosecute them.  It seems to me that unless this is the
reasoning the situation
will exist whereby insolvent companies, notwithstanding the provisions of
s.1335, can rely upon its stultifying
effect to avoid the provision of
security, and thereby defeat the purpose of s.1335.
<P>

9	That this is not the position was made clear by the Full Court of the Federal
Court in <b>Bell Wholesale Co Pty Limited v Gates Export Corporation &amp; Ors
(No 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20ACLR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] ACLR 588.</a>  At p.591 Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ said:-
<P>

	<b>"In our opinion the Court is not justified in declining to order security
on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation
unless a company in
the position of the appellant here establishes that those who stand behind it
and who will benefit from the litigation
if it is successful (whether they be
shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are
also without
means.  It is not for the party seeking security to raise the
matter; it is an essential part of the case of a company seeking to
resist an
order for security on the ground that the granting of security will frustrate
the litigation to raise the issue of the
impecuniosity of those whom the
litigation will benefit and prove the necessary facts.</b>
<P>

<b>	We pause to make it clear that the matters we have considered are by no
means the only relevant ones.  We have concentrated our attention
on them
because they were at the forefront of the appellant's argument.  But the
Court's discretion is unfettered; each case must
depend on its own
circumstances; see generally Patterson, Ednie &amp; Ford<i>, Australian Company
Law</i> Third Edition para 533/1 et seq."</b>
<P>

10	In <b>Yandil Holdings Pty Limited v Insurance Co of North America &amp;
Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20ACLC%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 ACLC 542</a> at p.545, Clarke J said:-
<P>

	<b>"The principles which should guide me in resolving the present dispute are
not in doubt.  The Court is vested with an unfettered discretion
as to whether
an order is made and, if so, upon what terms.  The fact that the ordering of
security will frustrate the plaintiff's
rights to litigate its claim because of
its financial condition does not automatically lead to the refusal of an order.
Nonetheless
it will usually operate as a powerful factor in favour of
exercising the Court's discretion in the plaintiff's favour.</b>
<P>

<b>	It must be observed however in this respect that the mere fact that the
plaintiff is financially unable to provide security does
not lead inevitably to
the conclusion that the making of an order will stultify the plaintiff's claim.
There is a line of authority,
commencing with the unreported decision of
Yeldham J in <i>Tullock v Walker</i> (8 December 1976), standing for the
proposition that if the personnel behind the corporate plaintiff, or other
parties who will benefit
if the plaintiff succeeds, are financially able to
provide adequate security then it is, generally speaking, inappropriate to
refuse
an order."</b>
<P>

11	His Honour then quoted the passage from <b>Bell Wholesale</b> to which I
have referred and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Read literally this statement suggests that a court is bound to order
security unless the evidence referred to is forthcoming.  But
I do not
understand their Honours to be suggesting that the Court's discretion was
fettered in this way.  They were dealing with
a case in which the primary
question was whether the onus lay on the applicant for security to bring forth
evidence of the ability
of the persons likely to benefit to provide the
adequate security.  Their Honours made the statement quoted in decisively
rejecting
the plaintiff's submission that that question should be answered
affirmatively."</b>
<P>

12	Mr Reeves, with typical frankness, referred me to the decision of Sanderson
M in <b>Williamson &amp; Anor v Soil Land Garden Suppliers Pty Limited &amp;
Ors</b> (Supreme Court of Western Australia - 2 June 1998 - unreported).  In
that case the insolvent companies had made applications pursuant,
inter alia,
to s.588FF, and there was an application for security for costs.
<P>

13	Whilst the Master agreed that the discretion to order security is
unfettered, he came to the conclusion that in that case it
was inappropriate to
so order.  He did not consider that the liquidator was under an obligation to
give security, it being noted
in that case, unlike the present, that the
liquidator was appointed by the Court on the application of creditors.  
<P>

14	The Master considered it was "most important to focus upon the position held
by the liquidator" and the duties thereby imposed
on him, and that to impose
upon the liquidator an obligation to provide security "seems to me likely to
frustrate the liquidator
in the exercise of his duty".
<P>

15	The Master noted that not only was the liquidator suing, but so also was the
company in liquidation, and he considered that if
an order for security for
costs was not to be made against the liquidator it also ought not to be made
against the company because
the two causes of action were intertwined, and that
to effectively bring one to a halt and to allow the other to proceed would not
only be inconsistent, but might frustrate the conduct of the litigation as a
whole.  In the result the Master did not consider that
it was appropriate to
grant security and, if I may say so with respect, he does not seem to have
considered the prospect of those
interested in the liquidator recovering assets
for the insolvent companies indemnifying the liquidator.
<P>

<b>The Issues In The Present Case</b>
<P>

16	It was not in issue that the liquidator was not prepared to provide security
personally nor that the corporate plaintiffs are
insolvent and will not be able
to meet any costs' order that may be made against them.   In these
circumstances it was submitted
that to make an order for security would be to
stultify the litigation.  However, it was submitted on behalf of NAB that there
was
no evidence that a significant proportion of the corporate plaintiffs'
creditors could not fund the proceedings.  The evidence disclosed
that those
representing the liquidator had approached, or attempted to approach, a number
of the "external" creditors to ascertain
whether they would provide voluntary
contribution to a fund to meet any order which the Court might make for
security.  These creditors
included National Commercial Finance, Gutteridge
Haskins &amp; Davey, AGC Limited and Caterpillar Financial Pty Limited.  Each
declined
to provide any financial backing, as appears from the affidavit of Mr
Nicholas Malanos, sworn 23 March 1999.  Mr Malanos annexed
to his affidavit the
names of the creditors with which and whom he communicated.  These included not
only external creditors but
also persons who are parties to the proceedings, by
which I mean the ones with which I am directly involved and those to be heard
with them.  The creditors' attitude, generally speaking, was that they had
written off the debts.
<P>

17	Mr Malanos also stated, in paragraph 10 of his affidavit, that he had
examined the liquidator's files and that he became aware
from them that in 1997
and 1998 attempts were made to obtain insurance litigation funding, but that
three named insurers, which had
been approached, had "to date" not agreed to
provide any funding to the liquidator in relation to the proceedings.  This
evidence
was objected to, but I admitted it.  There was no evidence whether any
of the insurers would come to a decision favourable to the
plaintiffs.
<P>

18	There was also evidence that Coffs Harbour City Council is a creditor, but
it has declined to provide any funds.
<P>

19	In these circumstances Mr Reeves submitted that those who had a real
interest in the ultimate success of the litigation and,
therefore, those who
should bear the risk of prosecuting it, were not interested in doing so and,
accordingly, it had not been established
that those who would benefit from the
litigation if it is successful, being entities which it could be inferred would
be financially
able to assist, were prepared to do so.  He submitted that in
these circumstances the decisions in <b>Bell Wholesale</b> and <b>Yandil
Holdings</b> led to the conclusion, notwithstanding the decision in
<b>Williamson</b>, that in the proper exercise of my discretion the application
for security should be granted.
<P>

20	Mr Reeves submitted that <b>Williamson</b> should be distinguished on the
bases that there was a Court appointed liquidator; that he had received legal
advice that the proceedings
were likely to succeed; and that that was not a
case in which the liquidator had taken the approach that he was not liable for
the
costs.
<P>

21	I also think that in coming to a consideration as to whether one should
apply <b>Bell Wholesale</b>, in relevantly appropriate circumstances, regard
must be had to the decision of the High Court in <b>Australian Securities
Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 485</a> at p.492.  I
have quoted this passage in my earlier decision and it seems to me that not
only should it be applied, but the authority
of a longstanding decision of the
Full Court of the Federal Court, as <b>Bell Wholesale</b> is, demands that the
special circumstances be disclosed before the discretionary factors relevantly
referred to therein are not followed.
<P>

22	I should also note that Mr Gray, in addition to not disputing that the
corporate plaintiffs are insolvent and do not have the
means to provide
security for NAB's costs, conceded that the plaintiffs "are not able to procure
other parties to provide funds to
meet an order for security for the Bank's
costs".  He continued that when one considered the amounts of the individual
creditor's
debts; the amount claimed by NAB as security for costs; and the
personal positions of individual creditors this was "hardly surprising".
Whilst one can have some sympathy for a submission such as this it leads, in my
opinion, to the ultimate conclusion that those who
have an interest in the
pursuit of the proceedings are not prepared, for their own specific reasons, to
support them.
<P>

<b>Other Discretionary Considerations</b>
<P>

23	Mr Gray submitted that the liquidator should not be required to provide
security personally.  I am inclined to the view that
this is correct in so far
as it means that the liquidator should not be required to provide security from
his own personal funds.
 However, in my opinion, a liquidator faced with such a
position may be required to provide security provided that he can obtain
an
indemnity from creditors.  This is a well known method by which security is
provided and, in circumstances where the Law requires
the liquidator to bring
the proceedings, the situation seems to me to be that the liquidator cannot be
excused from granting security
in an appropriate case simply for that reason.
On the other hand, in my opinion, the liquidator is not required to provide it
from
his own resources but to ensure that those for the benefit of whom and
which he is conducting the litigation provide him with an
appropriate
indemnity.  In these circumstances I do not have the same difficulties as
Sanderson M had in relation to the provision
by the liquidator of security
although, as I have said, I would not expect the liquidator to meet the claim
for security personally.
<P>

24	Mr Gray submitted nextly that the claim to avoid the securities should be
seen as in substance a defensive rather than an aggressive
proceeding and
therefore not one appropriate for the making of an order for security for
costs.  I disagree with this submission.
 NAB is relying upon security
documents.  The plaintiffs are seeking to have them set aside for reasons
provided by the Law.  The
plaintiffs challenge the validity of the securities.
They are therefore, in my opinion, clearly the moving parties seeking
substantive
relief based on the allegations they put forward.  The proceedings
are not of a defensive nature in the sense to which Mr Gray referred.
<P>

25	Mr Gray submitted nextly that the plaintiffs' case was prima facie
reasonably arguable.  This may be so.  If it were not then,
no doubt, an
application would have been made to dismiss the proceedings.  However, even
allowing for a reasonably arguable case,
I do not consider that this is a
reason to refuse security.  Section 1335, in my view, proceeds on the basis
that there is such a
case the conduct of which will involve costs.  It may be
that an insolvent plaintiff can show a case which is so strong that it would
not be a proper exercise of discretion to preclude its going forward by an
order for security.  But it is not suggested that this
is such a case and, even
though NAB has not filed any evidence to suggest that it has a good or even a
reasonably arguable defence
to the claim, in litigation of this type, where the
onus rests essentially on the plaintiffs, I do not consider that that is
necessary,
nor do I consider that the facts as pleaded are such as to lead to
the conclusion that in the exercise of my discretion it would
be wrong not to
allow the plaintiffs to pursue the remedy in the sense that their chance of
success is so great that they should
not be precluded from litigating the
claim.
<P>

26	Nextly Mr Gray submitted that NAB's conduct underlying the present action is
at least partially materially responsible for the
plaintiffs' present
impecuniosity, because it is the claim of the liquidator that the liabilities
of the corporate plaintiffs under
the third party securities to NAB is a
material factor in their insolvencies.  It is always necessary to have regard,
in considering
how to exercise the discretion, to whether the impecunious
position of the plaintiffs has been contributed to by the conduct of the
defendant.  In the present case NAB took a series of securities to support
third party obligations in relation to the business affairs
of the corporate
plaintiffs and Nambucca Investments Pty Limited.  Other companies within that
general group were also involved.
 On their face the securities were valid and
enforceable.  It is for the corporate plaintiffs to establish they are not.
There is
no evidence, as opposed to the allegations made, to support the view
that NAB's conduct was improper in the manner necessary to weigh
the
discretionary scales in favour of refusing an order for security.
<P>

27	Finally, Mr Gray submitted that in the circumstances of this case NAB will
not suffer "undue hardship" if no order for security
be made; that if an order
for security is made, the effect of making it will deprive the plaintiffs of
the opportunity to bring a
reasonably arguable case; and that, therefore, the
application should be seen as oppressive and a means to stultify the action,
not
on the merits, but in the exploitation of NAB's superior economic
resources.
<P>

28	I do not agree that NAB will not suffer "undue hardship".  Of course in
dealing with a large national bank one has to have regard
to the fact that
everything is relative.  In my view it is not appropriate to refuse an
application for security for costs merely
because the entity seeking it is seen
as one which, if the order was not made, could finance the litigation in any
event.  Section
1335 makes no distinction between financially powerful and
financially weak defendants.  It proceeds on the assumption that if a
party is
successful in litigation it will be entitled to recover its costs irrespective
of its "need" to do so in the overall scheme
of its financial affairs.
Further, those directing the affairs of NAB have duties to it to discharge.
<P>

29	The second submission is merely a repetition, if I may say so with respect,
of the general submission about stultifying litigation.
 As I have sought to
point out  s.1335 does stultify litigation, save in the circumstances to which
I have referred.  In the present
case, as I have said, the plaintiffs have
simply failed to establish that which, if it had been proved, would have
provided a basis
for considering whether, in the exercise of my discretion, it
was appropriate to make an order.
<P>

30	The third submission, if I may say so once again with respect, is an appeal
to the general merits of the situation.  However,
I consider it is an appeal
which is wide of the mark because NAB is not exploiting its "superior economic
resources".  NAB is simply
availing itself of well understood principles of
law, which now find themselves enshrined in s.1335 of the Law.  As I have said
if
it were the intention of the legislature that well-to-do defendants were not
to be entitled to the benefit of that section the legislature
would have said
so.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

31	For all these reasons I have come to the view that NAB has established its
entitlement to security, and that there are no discretionary
reasons why the
basic order it seeks should not be made.
<P>

32	No submission was made that the amount claimed is inappropriate.  It is
interesting to note that in few of these applications
is there much dispute
about that.  However, the amount, as I understand the evidence, relates to the
whole of the litigation into
the future.  As I have said a number of matters
will be heard together and, in these circumstances, it seems to me that
notwithstanding
the absence of any submissions in relation to quantum I should
not allow the full amount claimed.  I have als o come to this view
because the
proceedings are still some little way from hearing and, if need be, NAB can
bring a further application for security
for costs.  It may be that the amount
of the discount from the figure claimed, which I propose to make, will make
little practical
difference to the situation, but, none-the-less, I consider it
appropriate to reduce the amount sought.
<P>

33	In making the order against the liquidator I do so on the basis to which I
have referred in these reasons.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>
