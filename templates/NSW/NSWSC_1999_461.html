<b><u>21262/95  -  JOHN TINGLE &amp; ANOR  v  HARBOUR RADIO PTY LTD &amp; ANOR
[No 4]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT   (Damages)</u></b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR: </b> 
<P>

<b>Background</b>
<P>

1	Mr John Tingle has brought an action for defamation against the company
responsible for Radio 2GB,  and against the broadcaster,
Mr Ron Casey.
<P>

2	The action arises out of a broadcast on 1 November 1997.  On that day Mr
Casey said the following words on air:
<P>

	"I was talking about Shooters' Party ... and the shooters' Party (laughs) is
in debt to the State Government.  Now we hear a lot
about them, you know,
beating their chests and they've got all this political strength and they -
well they've got money coming in
from the United States and the Shooters' Party
in a court case, High Court Judge Sir Harry Gibbs appointed as a mediator on
May 26th,
he said that the Shooters' Party must pay back the principal of the
loan made to them by the State Government and the legal costs
and the interest,
which means the Shooters' Party, John Tingle's crowd, is in debt to the State
Government to the tune of $880,000.00,
that's right, $880,000.00.  Okay fellas,
shut up until you pay your bill, okay, just be quiet until you've paid your
bill."
<P>

3	A statement of claim was issued on 1 December 1995.  Mr Tingle was named as
the first plaintiff, and The Shooters' Party Limited,
the second.  When the
matter was called on for hearing, counsel for Mr Tingle indicated that the
second plaintiff had since been
wound up.  The action, therefore, proceeded
with Mr Tingle alone.
<P>

4	The statement of claim, in its amended form, asserted that the following
imputations, concerning Mr Tingle, arose from the natural
and ordinary meaning
of the words used, and were defamatory:
<P>

	"(a)	The plaintiff had bragged publicly about the political strength and
secure financial position of the Shooters' Party, knowing
that both boasts were
untrue.
<P>

	(b)	The plaintiff was a foolish politician in that he had allied himself to a
political party whose members made unfounded boasts
about its wealth and
influence."
<P>

5	The publication took place after the introduction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act 1974</a>.  A jury was empanelled to determine first, whether the words spoken
by Mr Casey carried the imputations alleged (or either of them),
and whether
they were defamatory <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 7A(3)).</a>  The jury determined that the first imputation
((a))arose, and that it was defamatory of the plaintiff.  It found that the
second
imputation ((b)) did not arise.  The jury was then discharged.
<P>

6	The plaintiff claims damages, included aggravated (compensatory) damages.  No
defence has been raised.  The issue, therefore,
is simply one of quantum.  The
defendants' point to an apology broadcast by Mr Casey on 3 November 1995, that
is two days after the
broadcast, as mitigating the damage to the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>The Principles to be Applied</b>
<P>

7	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 46(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>, provides that the damages
recoverable, where a person has been defamed, shall be "in accordance with the
common law", but limited
to "damage for relevant harm".  The words "relevant
harm" are defined as "harm suffered by the person defamed" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 46(1)).</a>
<P>

8	The three broad purposes to be served by an award of damages in defamation
were restated by the High Court in <b><i>Carson v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20178%20CLR%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 178 CLR 44</a>, per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 60-61
in these words:
<P>

	" ... there are three purposes to be served by damages awarded for defamation.
The three purposes no doubt overlap considerably
in reality and ensure that
`the amount of the verdict is the product of a mixture of inextricable
considerations'.  The three purposes
are consolation for the personal distress
and hurt caused to the appellant by the publication, reparation for the harm
done to the
appellant's personal and, if relevant, business reputation, and
vindication of the appellant's reputation.  The first two purposes
are often
considered together and constitute consolation for the wrong done to the
appellant.  Vindication looks to the attitude
of others to the appellant:  the
sum awarded must be at least the minimum necessary to signal to the public the
vindication of the
appellant's reputation.  `The gravity of the libel, the
social standing of the parties and the availability of alternative remedies'
are all relevant to assessing the quantum of damages necessary to vindicate the
appellant."
<P>

9	Here the plaintiff claims aggravated damages.  The distinction between
compensatory damages and aggravated damages was explained
by Hunt J in
<b><i>Bickel v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 474</a> in these
terms (at 496):
<P>

	"Compensatory damages are given to compensate the plaintiff for the harm done
to him by the publication of the matter complained
of;  aggravated compensatory
damages (which are also known as merely `aggravated damages') are given to
compensate him when that
harm has been aggravated by the defendant's conduct in
publishing that matter or by his subsequent conduct."
<P>

10	Where the defendant's conduct may be characterised as "improper, unjustified
or lacking in bona fides" (<b><i>Triggell v Pheeney</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2082%20CLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 82 CLR 497</a>
at 514), and causes harm to the plaintiff, aggravated damages may be
appropriate.  Harm, in this context, means an increase in the
hurt to feelings
occasioned by the publication.  If, by the presence of matters of aggravation,
the hurt to feelings is exacerbated,
the award of damages should reflect that
fact.
<P>

<b>The Reputation and Standing of the Plaintiff</b>
<P>

11	Mr Tingle is aged 67 years.  He is a member of the Legislative Council of
the New South Wales Parliament.  He entered Parliament
in March 1995 as the
representative of The Shooters' Party.  That party was founded by him and
others in 1992.  It was founded as
a vehicle for protest against the Firearms
Act 1992, which was thought to be unduly restrictive upon the rights of law-
abiding shooters.
<P>

12	Mr Tingle is the sole parliamentary representative of The Shooters' Party.
He was described as its "public face".  The defendant
acknowledged that the
plaintiff was "a person prominently identified" in the public mind with that
party.
<P>

13	Mr Tingle began his career in broadcasting.  In 1949 he commenced working
with Radio 2QN, Deniliquin.  In 1951 he joined the
ABC.  He remained with the
ABC between 1951 and 1968, working in radio and television.  He became the
supervisor of the ABC television
news.  Mr Tingle ultimately held the position
of Chief of Staff of the News Service.
<P>

14	Between 1969 and 1976 Mr Tingle provided a commentary upon current affairs
for a number of radio stations, both in Sydney (Radio
2UE, 2UW and 2SM), and
Melbourne (Radio 3AW).  At the same time he provided a daily news commentary
for Radio Australia, the ABC's
overseas shortwave service.
<P>

15	In 1977 Mr Tingle returned full time to the ABC in Queensland working in
both radio and television.
<P>

16	In 1978 Mr Tingle began work with Radio 2SM, presenting its news, and
providing commentary.  He remained with 2SM until 1982.
 In that year he moved
to Radio 2GB, where he then worked until 1992 on "talk back radio".  Between
1992 and 1995 (by which time
he had been elected to parliament), Mr Tingle
worked with Radio 2CH.
<P>

17	Once in parliament, Mr Tingle was invited to join the Stay Safe Committee,
being a Joint Standing Committee concerned with road
safety.
<P>

18	Mr Tingle, therefore, has pursued a very public career.  Since 1982, through
a three hour segment on radio each day, he became
known to a wide cross section
of people in Sydney.  Mr Nigel Milan, who is presently the Managing Director of
SBS Broadcasting, gave
evidence concerning Mr Tingle's reputation.  It was Mr
Milan, then the Manager of Radio 2GB, who enticed Mr Tingle to leave Radio
2SM
to join Radio 2GB.  Mr Milan moved in the same circles as Mr Tingle.  He gave
the following evidence concerning his reputation:
 (T 111)
<P>

	"I think he had a very fine reputation, both on a personal and on a
professional basis."
<P>

19	Mr Milan added:  (T 111)
<P>

	"I think on a professional basis he was certainly always considered to be very
fair and very balanced in his approach.  Sometimes
he looked too balanced for
the management, but ..."
<P>

20	He thought Mr Tingle had a reputation "of great integrity".
<P>

21	A number of executive members of The Shooters' Party were called to speak of
Mr Tingle's reputation.  Mr Brown, who was also
the State President of The
Australian Deer Association, gave the following evidence:  (T 191)
<P>

	"A.	... By November 1995 John Tingle had been elected into parliament as the
first representative of shooters anywhere in the world
and so I would say he
had a very high profile in the shooting community.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q.	What was his reputation?
<P>

	A.	Oh well, his reputation was of a fairly clever man who had managed to
achieve what we all thought was impossible.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q.	What was that?
<P>

	A.	By being elected to parliament to represent our interests, shooters'
interests I should say."
<P>

	
<P>

22	Mr Borsak described Mr Tingle as honest, trustworthy and "straight
shooting".
<P>

23	I accept this evidence.  Mr Tingle was, at the time of publication, a person
of some prominence, with a reputation for integrity.
<P>

<b>Mr Tingle and Mr Ron Casey</b>
<P>

24	Mr Tingle, before the broadcast, spent much of his time in the relatively
small world of radio journalism.  From time to time
he attended functions with
colleagues who inhabited the same world.  By this means he met Mr Ron Casey in
approximately 1971.  He
claimed to have been especially stung by the broadcast
on 1 November 1995 because he regarded Mr Casey as a friend.
<P>

25	The defendants' strongly challenged that evidence.  It is, therefore,
necessary to examine the relationship between Mr Tingle
and Mr Casey before
November 1995 when the broadcast took place.
<P>

26	Between 1971 and 1995, Mr Tingle said that he saw Mr Casey periodically.
Sometimes he would see him each week at social functions.
 Months would then
pass before he saw him again.  He described his relationship, as at November
1995, in these terms:  (T 121)
<P>

	"I believe it was a warm relationship.  We had certainly never had any
disagreements or fights that I can recall and we always
greeted each other
warmly whenever we met."
<P>

27	Indeed, Mr Tingle, on one occasion, between 1992 and 1995, approached Mr
John Singleton (for whom he then worked) on Mr Casey's
behalf, endeavouring to
secure him a position with Radio 2CH.  He was unsuccessful.
<P>

28	Mr Casey, once back in radio, made comments from time to time which were
perceived by Mr Tingle and his wife as being "anti-gun".
 On Radio 2GB on 17
May 1995, Mr Casey made a comment which opened with these words:  (Ex H)
<P>

	"Have a look also at John Tingle, this relatively obscure, non successful
radio personality, who's now gone into politics with
a ... a splinter party ...
the Shooters' ... the Shooters' Party..."
<P>

29	The comment then dealt with a Private Member's Bill which Mr Tingle was then
promoting.  Mr Casey said this:
<P>

	"... he's struck upon a publicity stunt, whereby he says that anyone who's
home is invaded that he wants ... he wants the State
... New South Wales, to
pay their legal expenses ... if ... if they shoot the person that invades their
home ... in other words,
if a home invader is shot, then the home ... shot by
someone in their own home, then the person protecting their rights, is going
to
have all legal expenses paid by the State.  It opens up a Pandora's box, to say
nothing of ...to say nothing of every home will
be required to have a gun,
which is really what John Tingle is all about, that's right isn't it?  That's
what Tingle and the Shooters'
Party is all about.  He wants publicity for his
obscure little political campaign, and he wants publicity in order to
promulgate
the idea that everyone should have a gun.  If we all have guns we'll
be like the United States, and if we all think like John Tingle,
we should all
go and live in the United States ... think about it, that's another subject
we'll talk about it today ..."
<P>

30	As a political comment it was, according to Mr Tingle, inaccurate.  The harm
to the intruder may be produced by any weapon, not
simply a firearm.  The right
to legal expenses would only follow where the person was acquitted.
<P>

31	Mr Tingle claimed not to have been offended by Mr Casey's opening words.  He
regarded them as "typical Ron Casey".  They were
part of the "cut and thrust"
of radio journalism.
<P>

32	Mr Tingle distinguished this broadcast from the later broadcast of 1
November 1995, about which complaint is now made.  He said
this:  (T 136)
<P>

	"A.	... That broadcast was an attack on my political ideas, the broadcast in
November was an attack on me."
<P>

33	When cross examined, however, Mr Tingle acknowledged that the opening words
of the May 1995 broadcast were a personal attack.
 Yet, he insisted that, on 1
November 1995, he still regarded Mr Casey as a friend, and therefore felt
especially hurt by his comments.
<P>

34	It is convenient not to resolve this issue for the moment.  Its resolution
will be assisted by more fully describing the way
in which the events
unfolded.
<P>

<b>The Day of the Broadcast</b>
<P>

35	The broadcast occurred at some time on the morning of Wednesday 1 November
1995.  Mr Tingle was at home in Port Macquarie with
his wife.  He did not hear
the broadcast.
<P>

36	However, soon after it occurred he received a number of telephone calls.  He
could not remember exactly who rang.  He believed
it was the Office Manager of
The Shooters' Party, and a friend, Alan Wardrop, who listened to 2GB.  At first
he did not take the
matter seriously.  The comments made to him were along the
following lines:  (T 122)
<P>

	"A.	... I remember one person saying, `Casey's done a real job on you on 2GB'
and  somebody else said, `Casey said that you and
the Shooters' Party owe the
government money' and somebody else said, `How come you got all that money out
of the government' and
things of that sort."
<P>

37	He felt somewhat bewildered.  The Shooters' Party owed no money to the
government.  He telephoned the station manager of Radio
2GB, who undertook to
investigate.
<P>

38	Meanwhile, Mr Tingle continued to receive telephone calls from persons who
had heard the broadcast, or heard of it.  He arranged
with his parliamentary
office to obtain a tape of what had been said.  By mid afternoon he was able to
listen to the tape played
over the telephone.  He did so twice.  He described
his reaction in these words:  (T 124)
<P>

	"A.	Well, it's hard to explain how sick in the guts I felt because I couldn't
believe it had happened.  I had always regarded Ron
as a friend and a fair
person.
<P>

	What I felt he had done was describe me publicly as somebody who was bragging
about something that I hadn't bragged about.  I felt
that he virtually made a
liar of me by suggesting that we were getting money from the United States.
<P>

	I felt indignant because nothing that he said was true and I knew it wasn't
true and I felt terribly anxious about what I could
do to mend the
situation.
<P>

	Q.	Were you concerned about people's reactions?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I was because, having been in radio myself for forty-six - or, in
those days, about forty-three years - I knew people hear
things and believe
them on the radio and I was very concerned for my reputation.
<P>

	I felt I had a good reputation up to that date.  I don't think I was known as
a braggart or a liar and I thought that, from what
Mr Casey had said or what I
heard on the tape, people might think I was."
<P>

39	He discussed the matter with his wife.  Mrs Tingle gave evidence.  She
recalled her husband being very agitated.  He was very
upset.  He was also
angry.  Mrs Tingle said this:  (T 197)
<P>

	"Q.	After he had heard the tape, did you ask him about it or did you say
something to him?
<P>

	A.	Yes.  He said he had heard the tape and he was quite surprised because he
didn't believe it at first.  He thought it might have
been an exaggeration
because he and Ron Casey had been mates and he didn't expect Ron would make a
personal attack on him but having
heard the tape he realised it was true.
<P>

	Basically he had said that he and the Shooters' Party owed the Government
money, that he had bragged in the past about getting
money from America and
other things and that Ron Casey had basically said that he was a liar and that
he had a big mouth and he should
shut up and pay up."
<P>

40	The Station Manager for 2GB was slow getting back to Mr Tingle. Mr Tingle
remained agitated that the matter had not been resolved.
 He telephoned his
solicitor in Sydney.  He said this:  (T 124/5)
<P>

	"A.	Yes, later in the afternoon I thought I had better find out what the legal
position was so I rang my solicitor in Sydney. 
I was really concerned with -
more or less with seeing whether we could get a - an apology for it or somehow
straighten it out."
<P>

41	That evening Mr Tingle remained agitated.  He said this:  (T 126)
<P>

	"Q.	Coming back to the day in question.  How did you feel that night?  On the
night of 1 November?
<P>

	A.	Well, I felt dreadful.  I felt that people whose resepct I considered
important to me would probably think less of me because
I had been accused
publicly of, I suppose, telling lies and being a braggart and of owing money
which I wouldn't repay and all the
things I considered important to my
reputation seemed to be under attack.  I felt quite nervous and not a little
physically ill.
<P>

	Q.	How did you sleep that night?
<P>

	A.	Very badly.  In fact, I remember sitting up most of the night talking to my
wife about this and asking what effect it would
have on our lives."
<P>

42	Mrs Tingle gave a similar account.  Her husband complained of chest pains,
and indigestion.  He did not sleep.  They talked for
much of the night.
<P>

<b>The Falsity of the Allegations</b>
<P>

43	To better understand Mr Tingle's reaction, I should interrupt the
description of what occurred, in order to examine the broadcast,
and its
background.
<P>

44	On the morning of 1 November 1995, a small item appeared in the Telegraph
Mirror.  It carried the following heading:
<P>

<center>"Shooters owe State $280,000"</center>
<P>

45	The article was concerned with the New South Wales Shooting Association, not
The Shooters' Party.  It related to events in 1991,
before the formation of The
Shooters' Party in 1992.  The article said this:  (Ex C)
<P>

	"The NSW Police Service is suing a shooters' association to recover an
outstanding debt of $280,000 from a $600,000 loan given
to it by the previous
Coalition government.
<P>

	Police Minister Paul Whelan told a budget estimates committee hearing
yesterday he would take legal action to get the money back
from the NSW
Shooting Association.
<P>

	`I want that money repaid.  It is State money.  It belongs to the people of
NSW and not to the shooters', Mr Whelan said.
<P>

	Mr Whelan revealed that former Liberal police minister Ted Pickering had given
the shooters $600,000 in 1991 to help them promote
responsible gun
ownership.
<P>

	High Court Judge Sir Harry Gibbs - appointed as a mediator - said on May 26
the shooters must pay back the principle loan, interest
and legal costs, which
meant the bill was closer to $880,000."
<P>

46	Mr Casey was not called as a witness.  However, interrogatories were
tendered.  They bore his name and, although unsigned, were
said to have been
completed on his instructions.  According to the interrogatories, Mr Casey
directed that one of his officers check
the amounts referred to in the article
with the Police Minister's Office.  That was done.  The figures in the article
were confirmed.
<P>

47	No check was made with Mr Tingle, or The Shooters' Party.  The defendants
acknowledged (as they did in an apology broadcast on
3 November 1995), that Mr
Casey had made a mistake.  The New South Wales Shooting Association was not The
Shooters' Party.  The Shooters'
Party had not been provided with funds by the
New South Wales government.  It was not in debt to that government.
<P>

<b>The Solicitor's Letter</b>
<P>

48	On 1 November 1995, the solicitors for Mr Tingle wrote a letter to Radio
2GB.  The letter opened with these words:  (Ex E)
<P>

	"We act for John Tingle and The Shooters Party."
<P>

49	Apart from Mr Tingle (who was in Port Macquarie), the solicitors obtained
instructions from someone in The Shooters' Party.
<P>

50	The letter then quoted from the broadcast, and continued as follows:
<P>

	"We are instructed that our clients are extremely distressed and upset by the
above statements which are offensive, defamatory
and totally inaccurate.
<P>

	In particular, the statements contain the following defamatory imputations
about our clients:-
<P>

&#183;	That our clients are unable to pay their debts.
<P>

&#183;	That our clients are in financial difficulties.
<P>

&#183;	That our clients receive funding from associations in the United
States.
<P>

&#183;	That our clients are connected with, associated with/influenced by the
National Rifle Association of America.
<P>

&#183;	That our client is not able to make legitimate political comments
because of its inability to pay its debts.
<P>

	We are instructed that these imputations are false and offensive and will be
likely to be extremely damaging to our client's reputations."
<P>

51	The letter concluded by specifically denying that either John Tingle or The
Shooters' Party was in debt to the State government
for $880,000, or for any
amount.  It denied that the party received funds from the USA, or had any
affiliation with the National
Rifle Association of America.  It then added
these words:
<P>

	"Our client's believe that the statements have had and will have a serious
effect on their reputation and standing.  They require
an on air apology by Ron
Casey in acceptable terms as soon as possible together with an undertaking that
no similar comments will
be made in the future.
<P>

	Our clients reserve their rights for damages."
<P>

52	The solicitors for Radio 2GB recognised at once that a mistake had been
made.  They responded the same day.  Although they denied
that the imputations
were capable of arising, they said this:  (Ex D)
<P>

	"Nevertheless, as our clients acknowledge the error in the broadcast and
further as our clients bear your clients no malice whatsoever,
our clients are
prepared to broadcast the attached apology tomorrow (subject to Mr Casey's
health) or on another mutually convenient
day.
<P>

	Please note that the apology has been drafted in Mr Casey's absence and as
such is subject to his final approval."
<P>

53	The draft apology, which accompanied that letter, was in these terms:
<P>

	"On Wednesday morning I made a reference to the SHOOTERS PARTY being in debt
to the State Government to the tune of 880-thousand
dollars.
<P>

	The basis of my comment was a press article describing a decision by High
Court Judge SIR HARRY GIBBS that the shooters, as they
were described in the
Daily Telegraph-Mirror, must pay back a loan, with interest and legal costs
which would total that amount.
 I was incorrect.  The group referred to was
actually funded by the State Government to perform firearm testing in readiness
for
a licensing scheme which was NOT implemented.
<P>

	I have been informed that this group has NO connection with the SHOOTERS'
PARTY and therefore I withdraw any suggestion that the
SHOOTERS' PARTY owes
money and withdraw my additional comments regarding any outside source of
finance.
<P>

	The party's elected MLC, JOHN TINGLE, has assured us that the party's books
are open for inspection at anytime.  Therefore, I apologise
to JOHN TINGLE and
to THE SHOOTERS' PARTY for making such an error."
<P>

54	Mr Tingle was not happy with the apology.  On 3 November 1995, on Mr
Tingle's instructions, his solicitors wrote back to the
solicitors for Radio
2GB.  They said that the draft apology was rejected.  Their letter continued as
follows:  (Ex F)
<P>

	"We<i> enclose</i> an amended apology that would be acceptable.  In an attempt
to repair the damage already done, our clients require this apology to
be
broadcast on air as a matter of urgency at 10.30 am today in the Ron Casey
programme time slot."
<P>

55	The amended apology proposed by Mr Tingle's solicitors was as follows:
<P>

	"On November 1, 1995, Ron Casey on Radio Station 2GB, broadcast a number of
comments that were critical of John Tingle and the
Shooters Party.  In
particular, he stated that the Shooters Party was in debt to the State
Government in the sum of $880,000.00,
that it was funded from the United
States, and implied that it was connected with the National Rifle Association
of America.
<P>

	Ron Casey and Radio Station 2GB now accept that these statements were totally
untrue, inaccurate, without foundation, and grossly
defamatory of John Tingle
and the Shooters Party.  Ron Casey and Station 2GB wish to publicly retract any
defamatory imputations
which were conveyed by these statements.  Ron Casey and
Station 2GB acknowledge that neither John Tingle nor the Shooters Party owes
any money to the State Government and has never owed such money.  Ron Casey and
Station 2GB wish to apologise unreservedly to John
Tingle and the Shooters
Party for the hurt, embarrassment, and possible electoral damages which the
allegations have caused.
<P>

	Ron Casey acknowledges that these statements were completely false, and that
this had been drawn to the attention of Radio Station
2GB when similar
statements had been made on earlier occasions."
<P>

56	The same morning (3 November 1995), Mr Ron Casey read an apology on Radio
2GB.  It was a shortened version of the apology which
had been proposed by Mr
Tingle's solicitors.  The apology was framed without further reference to Mr
Tingle or his lawyers.  It was
as follows:  (Ex G)
<P>

	"On Wednesday morning I broadcast a number of statements about John Tingle and
the Shooters' Party.  These statements included
that the Shooters' Party was in
debt to the government, the State government in the sum of $880,000 and was
receiving funding from
the United States.
<P>

	Now these statements were incorrect.  The Shooters' Party is not nor ever has
been in debt to the State government and the Shooters'
Party does not receive
funding from the United States.
<P>

	Both 2GB and myself unreservedly, unreservedly apologise to both John Tingle
and the Shooters' Party for any hurt or embarrassment
they may have suffered as
a consequence of these statements."
<P>

57	Mr Tingle was disappointed that the station had not broadcast the apology
submitted by his solicitor.  He thought the apology
actually broadcast was
"sketchy".  However, when cross examined, Mr Tingle made the following
concession:  (T 173)
<P>

	"Q.	It retracted the substance of everything which you have asked to be
retracted;  did it not Mr Tingle?
<P>

	A.	Yes."
<P>

58	The defendants submitted that the apology broadcast was "a handsome
apology".  Whatever the appropriate word, it was not, in
my view, inadequate.
Having regard to the request made, it was a suitable apology, published
promptly.
<P>

<b>After the Broadcast</b>
<P>

59	Mr Tingle remained upset by the broadcast for some time.  The Shooters'
Party held its State Conference in November 1995.  Mr
Tingle said this:  (T
132)
<P>

	"A.	Yes, I had the feeling that everybody or everybody seemed to know what had
been said even if they had not heard the broadcast
and they would be sort of
looking at me and thinking:  Well, that fellow beats his chest and skites a
lot, tells a lot of lies and
doesn't pay his debts.
<P>

	Q.	Did you spend any time explaining to people who spoke to you what had
happened?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I found it embarrassing to have to explain to people continuously that
neither the party nor myself had ever owed the government
any money and that
what had been said was untrue.  I felt, the original statement having  been
made, they may not believe me."
<P>

60	People at the conference asked  Mr Tingle whether the story was true:  Did
The Shooters' Party really owe the State Government
money?  Mr Brown (who gave
evidence of reputation) was, at this time, contemplating standing for an
executive position within the
party.  He asked Mr Tingle for the balance sheet
and the profit and loss account of the company.  He described Mr Tingle's
response
in these words:  (T 193)
<P>

	"Q.	How was his demeanour?
<P>

	A.	I think he was a bit miffed that I insisted on seeing the accounts. ..."
<P>

61	His evidence continued:
<P>

	"Q.	Did you notice something else about his mood or his mood as he was telling
you about this?
<P>

	A.	His response was somewhat agitated and a bit impatient - he appeared to be
agitated that I was actually questioning, you know,
his integrity or his - what
he had said.  He just said there was no problem and yet I wanted to have a look
at the accounts.  I felt
that was my right or obligation to myself to make sure
the facts were right."
<P>

62	Throughout this time Mr Tingle said that he was depressed.  He felt that his
reputation "had been pretty well permanently tainted".
 To some degree he still
felt that.  During this period he did not sleep well.  He gave the following
evidence:  (T 133)
<P>

	"Q.	Did this continue in the New Year, people spoke or approached you about
the Casey broadcast?
<P>

	A.	It started to fizzle out in the New Year but it did go on for some time
after Christmas."
<P>

<b>The Attack Upon Mr Tingle's Evidence</b>
<P>

63	Mr Tingle's evidence was challenged in a number of respects:
<P>

&#183;	First, it was suggested that the imputation upon which he had succeeded
before the jury (in effect, that he was a braggart
and a liar) had not occurred
to him at the time of the broadcast.  Indeed, it did not arise in his mind
until the statement of claim
was drawn by counsel a month later.  The statement
of claim incorporated imputation (a).
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, it was suggested that, by November 1995, Mr Tingle no longer
regarded Mr Casey as a friend.  His evidence that,
by reason of that
friendship, his feelings were especially hurt, should be rejected.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, it was suggested that Mr Tingle's description of his agitation,
his loss of sleep, and the effect upon him, was
exaggerated.  It was put to him
that he was "gilding the lily".
<P>

64	I will deal with each issue in turn.
<P>

<b>Mr Tingle's Appreciation of Imputation (a)</b>
<P>

65	Before examining the evidence, I should say something about imputation (a).
Imputation (a) combined two ideas.  It alleged that
the plaintiff had bragged
publicly.  It also asserted that, when he did so, he knew that what he was
saying was untrue.
<P>

66	Now, Mr Casey did not say, in terms, that Mr Tingle was a braggart, and a
liar.  The case went to the jury upon the basis that
this was the plain
message, reading between the lines.  The words were spoken (so it was said)
with a sneering tone.  The reference
to bragging was said to be unmistakable.
Mr Casey said this:
<P>

	"Now we hear a lot about them, you know, beating their chests and they've got
all this political strength and they - well they've
got money coming in from
the United States ..."
<P>

67	The bragging was then contrasted with the reality.  A High Court Judge had
determined that The Shooters' Party owed the State
Government $880,000.
<P>

68	The broadcast ended with the clear implication, according to the plaintiff,
that the Party could not pay, and, therefore, those
who had bragged had been
caught out in a lie:
<P>

	"Okay fellas, shut up until you pay your bill, okay, just be quiet until
you've paid your bill."
<P>

69	It appeared to me that the imputation arguably arose.  I, therefore, left
the issue to the jury, which determined that it did
arise, and that it was
defamatory.
<P>

70	Mr Tingle gave evidence (which was corroborated by his wife) that, upon
hearing the broadcast, he believed that he had been called
a braggart and
"virtually a liar".  His wife used the term "big mouth".  The challenge to
their evidence by the defendants rested
upon two matters.  First, the letter
from the plaintiff's solicitors did not suggest any such imputation.  Secondly,
the apology
which was sought by those solicitors, which Mr Tingle found
acceptable, did not seek the retraction of any suggestion that Mr Tingle
had
lied (or said things knowing them to be untrue), or even that he had boasted.
Had Mr Tingle thought the broadcast publicly branded
him a liar, it is
inconceivable (so it is argued) that he would not have sought a retraction of
that imputation.
<P>

71	Mr Tingle acknowledged that the letter of 1 November 1995 from his
solicitors to the defendants was sent on his instructions.
 It was not
submitted to him before its despatch.  He saw it some days later.  Although he
gave instructions (as did an officer from
The Shooters' Party), he did not
identify, in his conversation with the solicitors, the imputations which he
thought arose.  He said
nothing, at this point, about his belief that the
broadcast had "virtually called him a liar".  The imputations which appeared in
the solicitors' letter of 1 November 1995, therefore, did not derive from
him.
<P>

72	Counsel for the defendants strongly challenged that testimony.  Mr Tingle
acknowledged that the first time that he raised his
concerns about "virtually
being called a liar" was after 3 November 1995, that is after the apology had
been broadcast by Radio 2GB.
 Why had it not been raised earlier?  Why had he
not raised the issue, for instance, once he had seen the letter of 1 November
1995
(setting out certain imputations), or after he had been provided with the
draft apology (which he found acceptable)?  Mr Tingle said
this:  (T 167)
<P>

	"A.	I saw the broadcast as breaking into two parts, opinions which Mr Casey
expressed about me, and statements of fact which he
made, or before the
statements of fact he had made about me.  I felt it was more likely I would get
an apology for the so called
statements of fact than I would for an expression
of opinion."
<P>

73	Counsel for the defendant then accused Mr Tingle of not giving truthful
evidence.  The following question was put:  (T 167)
<P>

	"Q.	Mr Tingle, you are just making this up as you go along?
<P>

	A.	No, I'm not, Mr McClintock."
<P>

74	The cross examination then included the following:  (T 167)
<P>

	"Q.	And you say that it was not something that you were sufficiently concerned
about to seek an apology from Mr Casey and 2GB?
<P>

	A.	I didn't say (it) I wasn't sufficiently concerned about it.  I said I
didn't think I would get an apology for what I saw as
an expression of opinion,
not a statement of fact."
<P>

75	Mr Tingle continued:  (T 169)
<P>

	"Q.	Don't you think it would have been appropriate there, if you thought it
was an expression of opinion to include a reference
to the fact that you had
been called, so you say, a liar?
<P>

	A.	It may have been but given the circumstances and the speed with which the
apology was sought I suspected at the time we were
concentrating on what I
regarded as purported statements of fact by Mr Casey and they seem, things that
were most readily rebutted."
<P>

76	I accept the plaintiff's evidence.  I found Mr Tingle to be an impressive
witness.  His evidence, as to his reaction upon hearing
the broadcast, was
supported by that of his wife.  Mrs Tingle appeared to me straight-forward, and
truthful.  However, leaving aside
these impressions, and as a matter of
analysis, the version of Mr Tingle appears to me more probable.
<P>

77	First, the broadcast was built upon a central idea, namely the statement
that The Shooters' Party owed the State Government $880,000.
 That statement
was wrong.  One can readily appreciate the desperate urgency felt by Mr Tingle,
and The Shooters' Party, to secure
an acknowledgment of error.  Such an
acknowledgment would go some way towards stemming the electoral damage that may
otherwise ensue.
<P>

78	Secondly, I do not find it implausible that Mr Tingle should choose,
selflessly, to put to one side, for the time being, his
own interests, in order
to deal with those of the Party.  He was, after all, the parliamentary
representative of that Party, and
the person identified as the public face of
The Shooters' Party.  Contradicting the central mistake in the broadcast would
also go
some way towards rehabilitating his own image.
<P>

79	Thirdly, nor do I find it implausible that Mr Tingle should choose to
concentrate upon the explicit rather than implications
arising from the
broadcast.  There was, as mentioned, a need for an urgent retraction and
apology.  The matter was complicated by
the need to negotiate that apology
through lawyers.  I accept that his motivation was "the art of the possible",
as he saw it.  By
concentrating upon the explicit, there could be no argument.
Delay, therefore, was the less likely.  The message about him personally
depended upon implications.  It was necessary to read between the lines.  It
was, therefore, more argumentative, as this trial has
demonstrated.  It was not
unreasonable that he should fear that the inclusion of such material may bring
about delay.
<P>

80	Fourthly, I do not believe, as a matter of construction, that the letter
from Mr Tingle's solicitors of 1 November 1995 identified
him as the source of
the imputations which appeared in that letter.  Rather, the imputations appear
to be the solicitors' encapsulation
of the disparaging message which the
broadcast conveyed.  Putting the matter at its highest, from the viewpoint of
the defendants,
the imputations may have been put to Mr Tingle for his
comment.
<P>

81	Fifthly, as mentioned, imputation (a) combines two ideas, bragging and
telling untruths.  Mr Tingle must surely have gained the
impression from the
broadcast that the Party and he, as its public spokesman, were being accused of
bragging.  After all, Mr Casey
had used the expression "beating their chests".
Yet, there is nothing in the solicitors' letter, or the draft apology, which
identified
that issue.  The solicitors' letter is plainly not an exhaustive
statement of the imputations which arose.  It would also be surprising
if it
had not occurred to Mr Tingle that the broadcast had suggested that he was
lying.  Mr Tingle had publicly stated (as was the
fact) that The Shooters'
Party received no funding from the National Rifle Association of America.  He
said this:  (T 125)
<P>

	"A.	There had been a suggestion by the Coalition for Gun Control and others
that we were funded by the National Rifle Association
of America - not true.
And, because of those assertions, I had stated publicly several times that we
were not receiving assistance
from them and wouldn't accept it if they offered
it."
<P>

82	It is plain from Mr Tingle's evidence that the contrast between these
statements, and the words in the broadcast, was a matter
of concern.  Now, the
finding of the jury was not based upon that concern.  Rather, it was based upon
the more subtle message, arising
from the words in the broadcast itself, that
Mr Tingle was not telling the truth (the sneering tone of the delivery, and the
contrast
between the public utterances of financial strength, and the reality
of massive debt).  It was, no doubt, open to counsel to suggest
that any
concerns of Mr Tingle about an imputation of lying could only arise, in effect,
as a true innuendo to those persons (such
as the plaintiff himself) familiar
with his public utterances on funding from the United States.  However, the
matter was not put
on that basis.  Rather, Mr Tingle was cross examined upon
the basis that he was giving false testimony when suggesting that he
immediately
though that the broadcast accused him of lying.  Such a cross
examination was not, in my view, justifiable on this material.
<P>

83	Finally, it will be noticed that Mr Tingle's solicitors, when framing the
imputations in the letter of 1 November 1995, included
the following, as one of
the imputations arising from the broadcast:
<P>

	"That our clients are unable to pay their debts."
<P>

84	That, I infer, is the message the solicitors got, reading between the lines.
Since the broadcast expressly speaks of bragging
("beating their chests") about
money flowing to them (and impliedly financial strength), the imputation
identified by the solicitors
presupposes that the bragging is false.  It
presupposes, in other words, that untruths have been told about the financial
strength
of the party.  Accordingly, the difference between imputation (a), and
the imputation in the solicitors' letter is not as great as
it may at first
appear.
<P>

<b>Mr Tingle's View of Mr Casey</b>
<P>

85	There was no challenge to Mr Tingle's evidence that, before 17 May 1995, he
regarded Mr Casey as a friend, or at least an acquaintance
of long standing,
whom he was pleased to see from time to time.  His seeking a job for Mr Casey
was consistent with the goodwill
that Mr Tingle claimed to have for Mr Casey.
The issue is whether the insulting reference to Mr Tingle by Mr Casey in his
opening
remarks on 17 May 1995 is likely to have changed Mr Tingle's view?
Alternatively, is it likely that the insult, combined with Mr
Casey's anti-gun
views, altered Mr Tingle's regard for Mr Casey?
<P>

86	The remark by Mr Casey ("an obscure non-successful broadcaster") was hardly
flattering.  Many would terminate their relationship
upon the basis of such a
remark, uttered in public.  I believe it likely that such a remark had some
effect upon Mr Tingle's view
of Mr Casey.  However, I accept Mr Tingle's
assertion that, on 1 November 1995, he still regarded Mr Casey as a friend.
One remark
(in May 1995), although it was insulting, and although it may have
made him wary, was not enough to cancel almost twenty five years
of knowing Mr
Casey, and feeling well disposed towards him.  I also believe that there is a
qualitative difference between the broadcast
on 17 May 1995, and that on 1
November 1995.  Apart from the opening remarks, the attack on 17 May 1995 was
an attack upon the policy
of The Shooters' Party.  It was an opinion.  Mr Casey
was entitled to his opinion.  The opening remark was, no doubt, surprising.
However, Mr Casey's style was to be provocative by being insulting.  The words
he used did not necessarily reflect Mr Casey's view
of Mr Tingle.  I believe
that is what Mr Tingle meant when he described the opening remark as "typical
Ron Casey".  Mr Casey responded
to the following interrogatory in respect of Mr
Tingle.  (Ex K)
<P>

	"10A.	State all matters of past experience and background or of contemporary
history or notoriety and anything else relating to
the matter complained of
that occurred to the mind of the Second Defendant.
<P>

	10B.	The Second Defendant had known John Tingle for some time as a broadcaster
and radio commentator.  He had always had a high
professional regard for Mr
Tingle.  He had known him personally and regarded him as a person of good
character."
<P>

87	The broadcast on 1 November 1995, however, was different.  It was an attack
upon The Shooters' Party, and upon John Tingle. 
It purported to be based upon
certain facts.  The facts stated were wrong.  It was damaging to the Party, as
well as Mr Tingle. 
It could not be dismissed simply as Mr Casey's opinion.
<P>

88	I accept that the sting of this misinformation concerning the Party (of
which he was the leader), and himself, was the greater
because its source was
Mr Casey, whom he regarded benignly, as an acquaintance of long standing
<P>

<b>Did Mr Tingle Exaggerate the Impact Upon Him?</b>
<P>

89	The following was put to the plaintiff by counsel for the defendants:  (T
176)
<P>

	"Q.	I want to suggest to you that in describing your reactions to the
programme you have engaged in a considerable amount of gilding
the lily.  What
do you say about that?
<P>

	A.	I am not sure what you mean by gilding the lily Mr McClintock.  I have told
what I felt."
<P>

90	The examination continued:
<P>

	"Q.	Exaggeration?
<P>

	A.	I am sorry. I don't accept that.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q.	You wouldn't regard yourself as a sook;  would you?
<P>

	A.	I hope not."
<P>

	
<P>

91	I do not believe that Mr Tingle was exaggerating the impact upon him.  I
accept that, as a consequence of the broadcast, he was
highly agitated and
distressed.  I accept that he lost sleep.  I accept that his feelings of hurt
and distress were rekindled in
the months that followed, as people reminded him
of the broadcast by asking him questions about what had been said.
<P>

92	The more complex question is the issue of causation.  It is not enough that
Mr Tingle should have experienced this hurt following
the broadcast.  The cause
of action in respect of which he has succeeded before the jury relates to
imputation (a), and only imputation
(a).  Insofar as his distress was the
consequence of the misinformation concerning the finances of The Shooters'
Party, and the electoral
impact that was likely to have, that is not
compensible in this action.
<P>

93	Disentangling the emotions felt by Mr Tingle, and attributing some to
imputation (a) is, in a sense, impossible.  However, I
do not doubt that the
assault upon Mr Tingle's personal integrity by the broadcast, through
suggesting that he was bragging and not
telling the truth (imputation (a)),
caused Mr Tingle some pain, and was, in part, responsible for the distress that
he described
(the agitation, the loss of sleep, the continuing hurt, etc).
<P>

94	I accept Mr Tingle's evidence that, in relative terms, imputation (b)
(suggesting that he was a foolish politician) was the minor
aspect of the
attack upon him personally.  Being accused of bragging, knowing that what he
said was untrue, appears to me rather
more serious than being called a foolish
politician.
<P>

95	How, then, should the question of causation be approached?  Obviously
emotions are not compartmentalised.  Analysis will not
usually identify those
emotions properly to be attributed to a particular imputation.  Nonetheless,
the Court must form a view as
to that part of the damage (in this case, hurt
feelings) caused by imputation (a).  One may, perhaps, choose simply to
describe the
contribution to the overall hurt as "major", "minor", or by some
other appropriate adjective.  It may be more helpful, however, to
identify that
proportion of the hurt which can fairly be attributed to the imputation.  Such
an approach is really no different from
the apportionment which must be
undertaken when determining issues of contribution between joint tortfeasors,
or by the plaintiff,
through contributory negligence.
<P>

96	Doing the best I can, I would attribute 40 percent of the hurt suffered by
Mr Tingle to the message conveyed by imputation (a),
and 60 percent of the hurt
to other aspects of the broadcast.  The major part of the hurt, in my view,
arose out of the misinformation
concerning the finances of The Shooters' Party,
and the electoral damage that could be expected as a consequence.
<P>

<b>Aggravated Damages</b>
<P>

97	The plaintiff identified a number of matters of aggravation.  They were:
<P>

&#183;	First, the falsity of the imputation.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, the sneering tone which, with the words said, signalled an
intention to injure the plaintiff, as he immediately
recognised.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, the apology which was offered which was said to be
insulting.
<P>

&#183;	Fourthly, the May 1995 broadcast, and the realisation that this was part
of a campaign by Mr Casey.
<P>

&#183;	Finally, the conduct of the defendant in cross examination of the
plaintiff repeatedly accusing him of lying (T 167, line
9:  T 176, line 35)
<P>

98	Dealing with the first matter, I have accepted that the plaintiff recognised
that the broadcast accused him of bragging, and
speaking untruths.  Such
suggestions were false.  They were recognised as such by Mr Tingle.  I accept
that the falsity exacerbated
the hurt to Mr Tingle.
<P>

99	Moving to the second matter, I believe the broadcast was delivered with a
sneering tone.  The intention of Mr Casey to wound
Mr Tingle (and The Shooters'
Party) was unmistakable, and  recognised by Mr Tingle.  That, too, was a matter
of aggravation.
<P>

100	The third matter concerns the apology.  The draft apology was said to be
quite unsatisfactory.  Indeed it was insulting.  Whereas
the original
Telegraph-Mirror article, which was the source of the broadcast, had correctly
identified the party which was indebted
to the State Government (the New South
Wales Shooting Association), the draft apology did not do so.  It wrongly
suggested that the
article had simply referred to "the Shooters".  Mr Tingle
felt, therefore, that the apology was an attempt to evade responsibility,
and
to maintain a level of ambiguity which was not there.  He felt the apology did
not make it clear that the New South Wales Shooting
Association owed the money,
and not The Shooters' Party.
<P>

101	However, I do not believe that the apology was insulting.  There is no
evidence as to who drafted the apology.  It was said
to have been drafted in Mr
Casey's absence.  One infers that it was the work of the defendants' lawyers,
putting the best complexion
they could upon the mistake which had been made.
The draft made it clear, in my view, that the monies were not owed by The
Shooters'
Party.  It included the following:
<P>

	"The group referred to was actually funded by the State Government to perform
firearm testing in readiness for a licensing scheme
which was NOT
implemented.
<P>

	I have been informed that this group has NO connection with the SHOOTERS'
PARTY and therefore I withdraw any suggestion that the
SHOOTERS' PARTY owes
money and withdraw my additional comments regarding any outside source of
finance."
<P>

102	The third matter, therefore, is not a matter of aggravation.
<P>

103	The fourth matter, said to be a matter of aggravation, concerns the 17 May
1995 broadcast.  The broadcast on 1 November 1995
occurred in the context of
the earlier broadcast.  The plaintiff asserted that it was part of a campaign,
and was unjustifiable,
and lacking in bona fides.  It was said that it
increased Mr Tingle's sense of hurt.
<P>

104	However, the earlier broadcast does not appear to have been in the
forefront of Mr Tingle's mind.  His wife gave the following
evidence, from
which it emerges that Mr Tingle needed to be reminded of the earlier episode.
She said this:  (T 197)
<P>

	"A ... He had been surprised that Ron would do it, make an attack on him.
<P>

	I reminded him that several broadcasts that Ron Casey had made were very
anti-gun, he had taken an anti-gun stand in the past and
that he had once,
about John and the Shooters' Party, he once suggested that John was a failed
broadcaster.  He said, `That is fine
but I can't let this one go through, I
have got to do something about it.'"
<P>

105	I am not persuaded that the fourth matter is a matter of aggravation.
<P>

106	The fifth matter concerns the way in which the defendants conducted their
case.  At the point where Mr Tingle was cross examined,
a number of matters
were clear.  First, it was clear that Mr Casey had made a mistake.  He had
confused the New South Wales Shooting
Association with The Shooters' Party.
Further, the jury had determined that what was said by Mr Casey in the
broadcast carried imputation
(a), which was defamatory of Mr Tingle.
Imputation (a) included the suggestion that Mr Tingle had knowingly told
untruths.  The plaintiff,
to vindicate his reputation, had brought the present
action.
<P>

107	Mr Tingle asserted that each of the ideas in imputation (a) (namely, that
he was a braggart and had told untruths) occurred
to him from the outset.  He
gave reasons for not seeking to repudiate the suggestion that he was a liar and
a braggart in the apology
that was broadcast.  In that context, Mr Tingle was
twice accused of giving false testimony to this Court.  He was accused of
"making
it up" as he went along (T 167).
<P>

108	Counsel returned to the issue shortly thereafter, and put the following:
(T 176)
<P>

	"Q.	Just to make it absolutely clear Mr Tingle, I want to suggest to you, if I
haven't done it already, that your evidence that
you thought that Casey's words
had conveyed the first imputation about bragging publicly is untrue?
<P>

	A.	That my evidence is untrue?
<P>

	
<P>

	Q.	Yes?
<P>

	A.	No I am sorry.  It is not."
<P>

	
<P>

109	The plaintiff  identified this conduct as a matter of aggravation.  It was
said to be unjustifiable, and lacking in bona fides.
 I should infer that Mr
Tingle's feelings were hurt the more by reason of that conduct.
<P>

110	The defendants responded in two ways.  First, the cross examination was
legitimate.  There was ample justification for the suggestion
which was made,
in the light of the implausibility of the plaintiff's assertion, given the
letter of 1 November 1995 from his solicitors,
and the terms of the draft
apology.  Neither suggested an imputation which, in any way, resembled
imputation (a).  The plaintiff's
attempt to explain these omissions was
sophistry.
<P>

111	Secondly, the defendants asserted that the plaintiff was not in fact hurt.
He did not appear hurt when giving evidence.  He
would readily understand that
counsel was required to do a job, and was simply doing that job.
<P>

112	I have, earlier in this judgment (supra p 25, para 82), dealt with the
first issue.  The blanket suggestion that Mr Tingle was
lying to the Court in
stating that he recognised that the broadcast made him out as a liar was, in my
view, unjustifiable.
<P>

113	I have no doubt that the cross examination increased Mr Tingle's sense of
hurt.  That hurt was not visible when he gave evidence.
 However, I do not
doubt that it was there.
<P>

114	I therefore believe that the fifth matter of aggravation has been
established by the plaintiff.
<P>

115	Having described what happened, and the plaintiff's reaction, I am now in a
position to consider more closely the major ingredients
of the award, namely;
harm to reputation, hurt to feelings, and vindication of the plaintiff's
reputation.
<P>

<b>What Harm Was There to Mr Tingle's Reputation?</b>
<P>

116	A number of matters are relevant.  First, it is necessary to look at the
circumstances of publication.  The imputation was,
of course, conveyed in a
radio broadcast.  A broadcast is evanescent.  Listeners are not able to return
to the text, to check the
message.  
<P>

117	The broadcast itself was short.  It was something less than thirty seconds.
The message was not explicit.  The listener had
to read between the lines.
Some listeners would have missed the point.
<P>

118	The listening audience of Radio 2GB at that time was said to be twenty
thousand people.  Some, no doubt, were listening closely.
 Others were,
perhaps, concentrating on other things, with the radio in the background.
Still others may have heard only part of
the broadcast.  Something less than
twenty thousand people, therefore, would have received the message.
<P>

119	The plaintiff points out, and I accept, that of those who heard the
broadcast many, if not most, would have recognised Mr Tingle's
name, and his
association with The Shooters' Party.  He is a public figure.
<P>

120	Secondly, it is relevant to have regard to the seriousness of the
imputation.  The plaintiff asserts that to call a Member of
Parliament, and the
head of a political party, a braggart, and a person who deliberately speaks
untruths, is a very serious matter.
 The defendants responded by saying that
"there are lies and lies".  To suggest that someone told untruths for financial
gain is
serious.  To suggest, on the other hand, that a politician bragged
about the strength of his political party is not serious, and
indeed trivial.
More than that, each one of us, each day, bends the truth, in one way or
another.  These are the "white" lies that
are understood, and are commonplace.
No-one thinks the less of someone because of them.
<P>

121	The defendants adopted an expression used by counsel for the plaintiff,
when addressing the jury.  The broadcast suggested the
plaintiff was "a bull
artist".  In the context of a politician, such a suggestion was not likely to
seriously damage his reputation.
<P>

122	There is force in the arguments put by each party.  The truth lies
somewhere in between.  In may not be serious to suggest that
politicians brag,
and are given to telling deliberate untruths, any more than to say that all
lawyers are thieves.  However, to name
a particular politician, and suggest
that he has publicly bragged about something which he knew to be untrue, is
serious.  It is
likely, at least for a time, to harm his reputation and
standing.
<P>

123	Having said that, the imputation is not of such character as to brand the
person for life, permanently damaging his reputation
(as, for instance, an
imputation of paedophilia or financial dishonesty).
<P>

124	Mr Tingle, in the comments he could recall after the broadcast, did not
suggest that anyone questioned his truthfulness, or
accused him of bragging.
The comments, by and large, were to the effect:  "Why do you (or The Shooters'
Party) owe the Government
money?"  "Why haven't you paid your debts?"  "How did
you get so much money out of the Government?"  One thought that Mr Tingle had
been identified as a welcher.  No witness gave evidence that they thought the
less of Mr Tingle by reason of what had been said.
 Indeed, it was plain that
those called still held Mr Tingle in high regard.
<P>

125	It was suggested by the defendants that Mr Tingle's reputation today was as
high as it ever had been.  That this is so was demonstrated
by the decision of
The Shooters' Party to rename that Party, for the purposes of the 1999 ballot
paper, as "John Tingle's Shooters'
Party".
<P>

126	I believe there would have been some damage to Mr Tingle's reputation by
reason of the broadcast.  I believe, however, that
most of the damage was
likely to have been relatively short lived because the central mistake made by
Mr Casey was quickly recognised,
and admitted.  The story then died.  No doubt
it lingered for a time, and was embarrassing and irritating to Mr Tingle.
However,
without republication and repetition, through the media, it was
quickly spent.
<P>

127	The damage, to some degree, although not completely, would have been
stemmed by the apology, which was prompt.  Although the
apology did not correct
(and was not asked to correct) imputation (a), it withdrew the suggestion of
indebtedness to the State Government,
and funds being received by the Party
from the USA.  These matters provided the context for imputation (a).  Their
removal took away
the superstructure which gave rise to imputation (a).
<P>

128	Some damage, with some individuals, no doubt, endured.  For some
individuals the broadcast may have created their impression
of Mr Tingle.  The
award of damages should reflect these matters.
<P>

<b>Hurt Feelings</b>
<P>

129	I have, earlier in this judgment, dealt with two issues relevant to hurt
feelings, that being a component of the award.
<P>

&#183;	First, I accepted that this episode was the more painful because the
broadcast was that of Mr Casey, who was regarded as
a friend.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, I accepted Mr Tingle's description of the turmoil and anguish
in his life following the publication.  However,
not all that pain can be
attributed to imputation (a).  I have determined that it is fair to attribute
40 percent of this pain to
the cause of action upon which the plaintiff
sues.
<P>

130	The apology is also relevant to the plaintiff's hurt.  It was prompt, and
directed towards the facts which gave rise to imputation
(a).  It was an
emollient which, no doubt, eased in part the plaintiff's anguish.  I accept
that the publication, even to this day,
is still a source of hurt to the
plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Vindication</b>
<P>

131	The amount awarded must be sufficient "to convince a bystander of the
baselessness of the charge"  (<b><i>Broome v Cassell</i></b> <b><i>&amp; Co
Ltd</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) AC 1027</a>, per Lord Hailsham LC at 1071).  Having fixed upon
an appropriate sum for injury to reputation and hurt to feelings, it is
necessary
to ask whether that sum itself provides the plaintiff with a complete
vindication.  If it does, then all three purposes of an award
of damages in
defamation will have been satisfied (<b><i>Carson v John Fairfax &amp; Sons
Ltd</i></b> (supra) p 60-61).  If it is not, an adjustment may be necessary so
that the final award represents a sufficient vindication. 
<P>

<b>The Quantum of Damages</b>
<P>

132	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a> identifies certain factors as relevant to the
assessment of damages.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 46A</a> is in these terms:
<P>

	"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46a.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.46A</a>
<P>

	(1)	In determining the amount of damages to be awarded in any proceedings for
defamation, the court is to ensure that there is
an appropriate and rational
relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of damages awarded.
<P>

	(2)	In determining the amount of damages for non-economic loss to be awarded
in any proceedings for defamation, the court is to
take into consideration the
general range of damages for non-economic loss in personal injury awards in the
State (including awards
made under, or in accordance with, any statute
regulating the award of any such damages)."
<P>

133	The background to this legislation furnishes some insight into its meaning.
In <b><i>Coyne v Citizen Finance Ltd </i></b>((1990-1991) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=172%20CLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">172 CLR 211)</a>, Mason
CJ and Deane J (who were in the minority), adopted the approach of Diplock LJ
in <b><i>McCarey v Associated Newspapers [No 2]</i></b> ([1965] 2 QB 86), and
said this, at 221:
<P>

	"... it seems to us that it would be quite wrong for an appellate court,
entrusted with hearing appeals in both defamation and
personal injury cases, to
be indifferent to the need to ensure that there was a rational relationship
between the scale of values
applied in the two classes of case."
<P>

134	In <b><i>John Fairfax Limited v Carson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 259</a>, an
award of damages in favour of a prominent solicitor, totalling $600,000, was
set aside, by majority, as excessive.  Kirby P,
who with Priestley JA formed
the majority, said this at 274:
<P>

	"It is also perhaps worth recalling that, more recently, this Court held that
(by the standards of jury verdicts of this State)
a jury verdict of $250,000
for general damages for effective total blindness caused by negligent hospital
care, was outside `current
general ideas of fairness and moderation':  see
<i>Canterbury Hospital v Cappelletto </i>(Court of Appeal, 17 May 1991,
unreported).  In that case Mahoney JA and I both considered $250,000 was
appealably excessive.  In
so far as one may compare that verdict to this, it
seems difficult to say that the damage to Mr Carson was greater than to Mrs
Cappelletto,
in aggregate, and by a magnitude of 2.4..."
<P>

135	On appeal, the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) said
this:  (at 57/58):
<P>

	"In <i>Coyne</i>, Mason CJ and Deane J considered that it is legitimate for an
appellate court considering an appeal against the quantum of damages
in a
defamation case to bear in mind `the scale of values' applied in dealing with
appeals in cases of serious physical injury ((1991)
172 CLR at 219-221).  There
is no occasion here to repeat the reasoning advanced in support of that
conclusion.  That conclusion
does not deny that the harm suffered in defamation
cases differs from the `tearing of flesh and bone and the pain of body'
(<i>Carson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 273</a>, per Kirby P) suffered in personal injury
cases nor that `<i>precise</i> comparisons' (ibid (emphasis added)) should not
be drawn between the different types of cases.  But for an appellate court
which
must test the quantum of a defamation award against some criteria to be
prohibited from considering awards of general damages in
personal injury cases
would exclude reference to a potentially relevant criterion."
<P>

136	There was a need for a rational relationship between the scale of values
applied in the two classes of case.  The Court added:
 (at 58/59)
<P>

	"And the foundation of that relationship must be the scale of awards for
general damages in cases of serious physical injuries
which, in their severity
and disabling consequences, transcend injury to reputation."
<P>

137	In <b><i>Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Ettingshausen</i></b>
(unreported, C of A, 13 October 1993), the appellant published a photograph of
Mr Ettingshausen naked in a shower in a football dressing
room.  The plaintiff
sued upon an imputation that he had deliberately permitted a photograph to be
taken with his genitals shown,
for publication in a magazine with a wide
readership.  There was a further imputation that he was unfit to engage in
promotional
work with young people.  Mr Ettingshausen was awarded $350,000 by a
jury.  Kirby P, in this context, said this:  (at 39)
<P>

	"The High Court, in Carson (at 591), specifically took into account two recent
awards for general damages for quadriplegia, being
$275,000 and $250,000
respectively.  Using the same criteria, and approaching the matter in the same
necessarily general way, I reach
the identical conclusion in this case.  It is
simply impossible to suggest that compensation for the harm done to the
reputation
of Mr Ettingshausen required or permitted general damages greater in
magnitude than those awarded to persons suffering profound quadriplegia."
<P>

138	The principle was restated by the High Court in <b><i>Theophanous v Herald
&amp; Weekly Times Ltd &amp; Anor</i></b> ((1994) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=124%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">124 ALR 1)</a> at 20:
<P>

	"... an appellate court hearing appeals in both defamation and personal injury
cases needs to ensure that there is an appropriate
or rational relationship
between the scale of awards in the two classes of case.  That relationship
stands on the foundation represented
by the scale of awards for general damages
in cases of serious physical injuries which, in their severity and disabling
consequences,
may transcend injury to reputation."
<P>

139	It was against this background that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 46A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> was
introduced.  The Second Reading Speech by the Attorney General included the
following:
<P>

	"Honourable members need have no concern that the legislation now before the
House will fetter the proper exercise of judicial
discretion.  On the contrary,
the Bill envisages that such a discretion will be retained.  All it requires is
that, in assessing
non-economic damages, the judge will take into consideration
awards made in other types of cases.  Such awards are an important factor,
but
they are by no means the only factor legitimately to exercise a judge's
mind."
<P>

140	The alignment of defamation verdicts (for non economic loss) with those in
personal injury matters is a reminder of the need
for moderation.  The amount
awarded must not be extravagant (or miserly) when compared to the amounts
awarded for painful and disabling
injuries.
<P>

141	Weighing all these matters, including the three aspects of aggravated
damages which I have identified, it appears to me that
the appropriate award is
a verdict for the plaintiff of $75,000.
<P>

142	In terms of costs, I believe that the plaintiff had a sufficient reason for
commencing and continuing the proceedings in this
Court.  He should, therefore,
have his costs.  An important part of the action by the plaintiff was the
vindication of his reputation
(<b><i>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v
Palmer</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 297).</a>
<P>

143	Accordingly, the orders of the Court are as follows:
<P>

1.	Verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $75,000 against both defendants,
jointly and severally.
<P>

	2.	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52</a> r 24(4), the plaintiff should have his costs on a party
and party basis.
<P>

3.	I reserve the question of interest, and the costs payable in respect of the
companion action by The Shooters' Party Limited against
the defendants.
