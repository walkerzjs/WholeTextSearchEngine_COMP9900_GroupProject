70046/96	<b>REGINA   v   ANNE YVONNE HORTON</b>
<P>

SENTENCE
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner, Anne Yvonne Horton, upon arraignment
before Mr Justice Barr on 19 March 1999 on an indictment charging
her with
murder, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Michael O'Hara Fitzgerald at
Sandy Beach on 18 December 1995.  The Crown accepted
the prisoner's plea in
satisfaction of the indictment and a conviction was then recorded.  The
prisoner came before this Court at
Lismore on 17 August 1999 when evidence on
sentence was received.  On the following day submissions on sentence were made
and the
prisoner is now before this Court for sentencing.
<P>

2  	The prisoner earlier stood trial in the Supreme Court at Coffs
Harbour in November 1997 charged with the murder of the deceased.
The prisoner
was convicted of murder on 24 November 1997 but a subsequent appeal to the
Court of Criminal Appeal was successful.
 The prisoner's conviction was quashed
and a new trial was ordered on 20 December 1998:  <i>R v Horton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45
NSWLR 426.</a>  There then followed the plea of guilty to manslaughter in the
circumstances I have outlined.
<P>

3  	No oral evidence was presented before me.  The Crown tendered:
<P>

(i)	the summing up by Newman J at the earlier trial;
<P>

(ii)	the transcript of evidence taken at that trial;
<P>

(iii)	the transcript of evidence taken on the earlier proceedings on
sentence;
<P>

(iv)	the statement of Det. Senior Constable Wellings of 6 March 1999 relating
to his investigations into the death of the deceased,
together with the
photographs of the deceased, the knife used, various items of clothing and the
scene of the crime.
<P>

4  	Mr Bruce, who appeared for the prisoner, tendered certain
extracts of the evidence at the earlier trial, which duplicate in
part the
Crown's tender earlier identified, but which marshal in a convenient form those
passages of the earlier evidence of the
witness Cheryl Douglas upon which Mr
Bruce wished to focus in his submissions.  Mr Bruce also tendered certain
certificates and references
on behalf of the prisoner.
<P>

5  	The crime was committed at premises at 14 Wattle Place, Sandy
Beach.  The deceased sustained a stab wound to the left side of
the chest
puncturing the heart.  I will consider the nature of this injury more closely
later.  This wound was inflicted by the prisoner
using a knife, and the
deceased died in hospital some three hours later after attempts to save his
life had proved unsuccessful.
<P>

6  	The prisoner had known the deceased for many years, having been
introduced to him by the deceased's father.  The prisoner used
to meet the
deceased's father, the deceased and others on a regular basis to drink together
at the Burton Hotel at Glebe.  For some
two months before the date of the death
of the deceased, the deceased, the prisoner and Cheryl Douglas lived together
at the premises
in Wattle Place, Sandy Beach.  Those premises were originally
leased by the deceased and the prisoner and it was later that Cheryl
Douglas
came to join them there.  Cheryl Douglas and the prisoner had a sexual
relationship which began in 1993 and which was, it
would seem, a stormy one.
<P>

7  	On 18 December 1995 a great deal of alcohol was consumed by the
members of the household I have described.  The evidence satisfies
me that the
prisoner was a chronic alcoholic and on the day in question she started
drinking in the morning with several glasses
of wine and water.  The prisoner
later consumed a number of schooners at a tavern, more schooners at a bowling
club, then some bottled
beer back at the house.  During the afternoon the
prisoner had a number of stubbies of beer, followed by several glasses of wine
before drinking a further quantity of beer at Wattle Place.  At 7.00 am on the
morning of 19 December 1995 a blood test was taken
and that produced a blood
alcohol reading of .133 grams per 100 millilitres of blood.  Varying estimates
were given as to what the
reading would have been if taken at 9.00 pm on 18
December when the deceased was stabbed, but the estimates ranged from .153 to
.399,
a very high concentration on any view of the matter.
<P>

8  	In the course of 18 December the prisoner was hostile towards Ms
Douglas and considered herself aggrieved by the lack of support
Ms Douglas had
given her following the death of the prisoner's mother on 16 December 1995.
The prisoner was upset that Ms Douglas
was not sleeping with her.  There was,
during the afternoon, a confrontation when the prisoner pushed Ms Douglas
against a glass
door.  Then shortly before the deceased was stabbed, there was
a further confrontation when the prisoner entered the toilet where
Ms Douglas
then was and accused her of being "a dog".  This was prompted by the discovery
that Ms Douglas had informed the police
about the prisoner driving a motor
vehicle whilst affected by alcohol earlier that day.
<P>

9  	After Ms Douglas left the toilet she returned to the living area
which the photos and the sketch disclose as being an open plan
area with the
dining area and kitchen adjacent and towards the rear of the house and the
lounge room at the front of the house.
<P>

10  	I have heard no oral evidence and I have been dependent upon the
transcript of the evidence given at the trial in 1997 to ascertain
the facts.
Ms Douglas gave evidence at that trial and so too did the prisoner.  The
prisoner gave evidence that she had no memory
of holding the knife at all that
night and that indeed she had no memory of the relevant events.  I observe that
when interviewed
by police the following morning, the prisoner claimed to have
seen Ms Douglas stab the deceased.  
<P>

11  	I accept in the main the account given by Ms Douglas in her
evidence as to what happened.  I do not find that the prisoner's
evidence
assists me in determining the circumstances in which the crime was
committed.
<P>

12  	Summarising the evidence of Ms Douglas, this witness said that
she walked down the hallway from the toilet and saw the prisoner
standing near
a chair at the end of the dining table.  At that time the prisoner had the
knife in her hand and when the witness approached
the prisoner held the knife
up towards the face of Ms Douglas and touched it, mainly on the left side.  Ms
Douglas' response was
to say:  <i>"if you are going to do it, make a good job
of it."</i>  Ms Douglas then moved away. 
<P>

13  	While that confrontation occurred the deceased had been sitting
at the table shown in photos 2 and 4 in Exhibit D, but within
a short period of
Ms Douglas moving away from the prisoner as she held the knife, the deceased
stood up and crossed to the sink in
the kitchen.  Before he stood up the
deceased said, and it would appear that this remark was addressed to the
prisoner after she
had said she was going to kill Ms Douglas:  <i>"Just wake up
to your fucking self"</i>.  He crossed to the sink where he made a further
comment to the effect that he  <i>"had had enough of this shit."</i>  Then,
according to Ms Douglas, the deceased who had passed between the two women to
go to the sink started to move back towards
the table, drawing closer to the
prisoner as he did so.  Ms Douglas said that she saw the prisoner lean her hand
out with the knife
and put the knife to the chest of the deceased with the arm
bent at the elbow.  Subsequently Ms Douglas observed the deceased holding
his
chest with both his hands.  I find that by then he had sustained the fatal
knife wound and that that wound was inflicted by the
prisoner.
<P>

14  	The knife was a folding clasp knife with a black finger grip
handle and a blade measuring 9.5 cm.  It is depicted in photographs
forming
part of Exhibit D.  According to the prisoner she normally kept the knife in
her handbag for protection.
<P>

15  	It follows from the prisoner's plea that the prisoner
acknowledges that the act which caused the death of the deceased was
an
unlawful and dangerous one.  Mr Bruce submitted that I should find that such
act was the continued holding of the knife by the
prisoner in circumstances in
which the deceased inadvertently encountered it.  That submission calls for
close analysis of the evidence.
<P>

16  	I refer firstly in closer detail to what Ms Douglas said in her
evidence:
<P>

<i>"Q.	And when he got there, what did he do, what did he say?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He was standing at the sink and then he turned around and said that he
had enough of the shit.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How did he say that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	When he first turned around he had his hands in the air.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You just indicated - put your hands up?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So his hands were up and he said what?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	`I've had enough of this shit'.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What happened then?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Then he went to walk back towards the table.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And now as he walked back towards the table, what about his hands, did he
keep those raised or what happened as far they were concerned?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No he put them back down.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	As he walked back towards the table, what did you see happen?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As he was getting near the table, Anne was standing there and I was
standing behind her, and I see Anne put the knife to his chest.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you use the expression `put the knife to his chest', what do you
mean by that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	She just went forward like that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you see what happened as far as the knife was concerned?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The only thing that I seen was Mick had a hold of his chest, and there
was blood coming out of it."</i>
<P>

17  	Then, later at p 65:
<P>

<i>"Q.	What was the position, can you describe the position of Anne's arm at
the time you saw her put the knife to Michael's chest?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The position of her hand?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was like that.</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  This witness indicates arm extended, thumb upper most.</i>
<P>

<i>BELL:  Q.	Did you also indicate that the arm was bent at the elbow?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So the arm was bent at the elbow, the direction of the knife was an
upward one, is that so?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	What I remember, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And at the time you say you saw Anne put the knife to his chest, that was
the position of her arm and the knife as you recall it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	What I recall, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Michael was a bit taller than Anne?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes."</i>
<P>

18  	The evidence of Ms Douglas is to be considered with the medical
evidence.  Whilst I accept that Ms Douglas saw the prisoner
hold the knife and
put it to the chest of the deceased, I do not accept that the direction of the
knife was upwards immediately before
it penetrated the body of the deceased.
The evidence of Dr Duflou convinces me to the contrary beyond reasonable doubt.

<P>

19  	The post mortem examination of the body of the deceased was
conducted by Dr Bradhurst.  He was not available to give evidence
at the
prisoner's trial but his report was tendered and Dr Duflou was called to give
evidence.  The doctor described the stab wound
inflicted upon the deceased as
having gone downwards and backwards.  The doctor said that the knife penetrated
the skin with the
sharp side of the blade facing downwards.  The wound
penetrated between the third and fourth ribs on the left side of the deceased's
body severing cartilage at the fourth rib level.  It proceeded to penetrate the
pericardium or fibrous sac around the heart.  The
wound having passed through
part of the heart and through the bottom of the pericardium then penetrated the
left lobe of the liver.
 I accept the medical evidence just summarised.
<P>

20  	Dr Duflou considered, and I accept, that a reasonably
significant force would have been required to penetrate the cartilage
with the
knife the prisoner was holding.  The estimated length of the track followed by
the stab wound was 130 mm, which was 35 mm
longer than the blade of the
prisoner's knife.
<P>

21  	Dr Duflou was asked the following questions as to the
significance of the knife wound and gave the following answers:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Now taking that into account [the length of the wound compared with the
length of the blade], and taking into account also the
evidence related to the
severing of the rib structure, in terms of the force that was required to cause
that stab wound track to
go 130 millimetres, of the two factors, the way in
which the rib process was severed and the track of the wound, either of those
matters have significance to you in terms of the force required to cause the
wound?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have previously spoken about the significance of passing through a rib
bone or any other tissue.  The length of a wound track
can be used to estimate
the - to give an opinion as to the weapon that was used to cause that wound.
In some circumstances you can
have a shorter wound track and in others you can
have a longer wound track.  A shorter wound track, which is a lot easier I
suppose,
is with a knife just isn't inserted to its full length.  That is by
far the most common cause for that.  You can have longer wound
tracks than the
weapon which was used.  And the most common cause for that in my experience is
where the weapon has been pushed in
with a certain degree of force, thereby
compressing the body.  So in that way the fact that the weapon blade is shorter
than the
track of the wound gives a fairly good indication that a considerable
amount of force was used.</i>
<P>

<i>I would like to temper that remark though with some caution, and that is
that again it assumes the person was in the anatomical position
whereas the
person could have been possibly bent over as an example of thereby compressing
the distance.  And for that matter by
the very nature of the way you make the
measurement it turns out to be an estimate.  And you can in fact have a range
of measurements.
 So it is not an absolute foolproof technique of estimating
force by any means.  But it gives a reasonable estimate of the amount
of force
used.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If one adds to the length of the stab track wound, in terms of what you
have just told us, if one adds to that the finding that
there was a severance
of part of the rib process, does that add to your theory at all or detract from
it at all?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I think the two taken together, give an indication that a significant
amount of force was used."</i>
<P>

22  	I accept that expression of opinion by Dr Duflou.
<P>

23  	As I read his evidence (in particular the cross examination at
T300-301), Dr Duflou did not consider that the post mortem findings
were really
consistent with the wound having been sustained by the deceased simply walking
into the knife.
<P>

24  	Having considered the evidence of Dr Duflou in conjunction with
the evidence of Ms Douglas, I am satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that the
deceased sustained his fatal injury when the prisoner stabbed him with her
clasp knife causing the injuries described.
 I bear in mind that the Crown
acknowledges by the acceptance of the prisoner's plea of guilty to manslaughter
that there was no
intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, but I do
find that the prisoner did intend to stab the deceased, albeit without
the
intent required for murder.
<P>

25  	Expert evidence at the trial concerning the prisoner's state of
intoxication was given by Dr Perl and by Prof Starmer.  There
was some
divergence of opinion between the two experts as to the extent to which the
prisoner's excessive alcohol consumption would
have affected her, but I am
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner's judgment and her physical
co-ordination must have
been impaired to a significant degree when she stabbed
the deceased, and this could well explain why the knife penetrated the body
of
the deceased far more than the prisoner intended.  The prisoner's intoxication
does not excuse what she did but it has the relevance
I have identified and I
take it into account as a relevant consideration in assessing the degree of
deliberation involved in her
crime.
<P>

26  	I do not find that the crime was premeditated.  It is not
suggested that the deceased was moving towards the prisoner in a
threatening
way and I am unable to make a positive finding as to why the prisoner stabbed
the deceased.  Following as it did so closely
upon the deceased's utterances
directed at the prisoner, one possible explanation for the prisoner's conduct
is that she was unduly
upset by what the deceased had said to her.
<P>

27  	Whatever be the explanation the unlawful use of a knife to
inflict injury resulting as it has here in death must be regarded
very
seriously.  The employment of a knife as an instrument of crime is to be
abhorred, and the Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly
stressed this.
<P>

28  	Objectively I assess the offence as being a very serious one.
<P>

29  	I now turn to a consideration of the subjective features of this
case.
<P>

30  	The prisoner was born on 24 May 1946.  The prisoner has some
criminal record.  With the exception of an offence for which she
was placed on
a bond to be of good behaviour for tampering with a witness, and that happened
in 1983, the prisoner's convictions
are in the scale of things relatively
minor.  The prisoner has never before experienced a custodial sentence.  Her
most recent offence
was one of offensive behaviour for which the prisoner was
placed on a bond to be of good behaviour in October 1992.
<P>

31  	The prisoner gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings before
Newman J in November 1997 and in addition to that evidence
a psychiatric
assessment was made by Dr Carne in October 1997 and his report dated 3 November
1997 has been placed before me.  That
report supplements what the prisoner told
Newman J about her personal history.
<P>

32  	I am satisfied that the prisoner had a very unfortunate
childhood after her father left her mother.  Her mother formed a relationship
with a man who was violent.  On one occasion the prisoner found her mother
attempting suicide by putting her head in the gas oven.
 The household was a
poor one and the prisoner started working as a machine operator at the early
age of fifteen.
<P>

33  	The prisoner's adult life has not been a happy one either.  The
prisoner had a child at the age of eighteen and married, at
the age of
twenty-one, a person who was violent towards her.  The family group migrated
from England to Australia in 1971, but the
prisoner separated from her husband
within a few years and then in 1974 was seriously injured in a motor vehicle
accident which prevented
her from pursuing her employment as a nurse's aid.
The prisoner was attracted to alcohol even before that motor vehicle accident
and became chronically addicted to it over a period of many years up to the
date of the commission of the subject offence.
<P>

34  	The prisoner in that period of chronic alcoholism formed a de
facto relationship with another man who was also violent towards
her but by
whom she had a son in 1980.
<P>

35  	Dr Carne diagnosed the prisoner in November 1997 as suffering
from a dependent personality disorder.  He also concluded that
the prisoner was
alcohol dependent although at the time of that assessment the prisoner had been
in custody for nearly two years
and was in remission for that condition.
<P>

36  	The prisoner has now been in custody continuously since the date
of her arrest on 18 December 1995 and I propose to backdate
the sentence to the
date of arrest.  
<P>

37  	Since being in custody the prisoner has undergone activities
directed at her rehabilitation.  A number of documents evidence
the work the
prisoner has done in this regard.  She has undertaken activities in pottery and
ceramics, a course in horticultural
skills, and some leatherwork training, to
mention several of the activities undertaken.
<P>

38  	A letter was tendered from John Wilson who is the father of the
deceased.  In the letter Mr Wilson refers to his close relationship
with the
prisoner over some fifteen to sixteen years and says that relationship
continues.  Mr Wilson has been visiting the prisoner
in prison and is in
regular communication with her by telephone.  He is now seventy-eight years of
age.  He is ill and he expresses
a willingness to have the prisoner live with
him and assist him after her release from custody.
<P>

39  	Whilst the maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter
provided for in the <i>Crimes Act</i> is penal servitude for twenty-five years,
there is probably no crime where the range of sentences that have been imposed
is as broad
as with the crime of manslaughter.  I have considered many
decisions, both reported and unreported, including those to which Mr Bruce
specifically drew my attention, but I have not found this exercise particularly
helpful in arriving at an appropriate sentence in
the present case.  What a
study of the cases emphasises is the importance of the consideration of the
particular circumstances of
each case.  See <i>R v Troja</i> (unreported,
NSWCCA, 16 July 1991 and the dicta of Kirby P at p 3) and <i>R v Blacklidge</i>
(unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995 and the dicta of Gleeson CJ at 4).
<P>

40  	Accordingly it would not be a useful exercise to review in these
reasons the facts and sentences imposed in the many cases
I have considered
prior to determining what I regard as the appropriate sentence in the present
case.
<P>

41  	What I must do is to impose a sentence that reflects the gravity
of the crime, and I must heed, inter alia, considerations
of the denunciatory
role of sentencing, retribution, and deterrence both general and specific.  I
must take as a starting point the
need to recognise that this crime for which
the prisoner is to be punished involved the felonious taking of a human life.
In <i>Blacklidge</i> (supra) the Chief Justice said:
<P>

<i>"...the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case
of manslaughter is the felonious taking of human life.
 That is the starting
point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the
assessment of the gravity of
the objective circumstances of the case."  </i>
<P>

42  	The prisoner must be given credit for her plea upon arraignment
last March.  Whilst the Crown case against her in respect of
the crime to which
she has pleaded guilty was a very strong one, nevertheless considerable court
time has been saved by the plea
and also significant inconvenience to those
witnesses who would have had to have been called at the trial.  The plea is a
factor
I take into account, and of course I must take into account all the
relevant subjective features of this case.  Ultimately however
my task, whilst
making due allowance for those subjective circumstances, requires that I arrive
at a sentence which is appropriate
to the prisoner's crime and which pays due
regard to its objective gravity (see <i>R v Dodd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A Crim R 349</a> at
354).
<P>

43  	Mr Bruce has submitted that there are special circumstances in
this case  having regard to the prisoner's background and her
past chronic
alcoholism.  The prisoner has not experienced a prison sentence before and the
progress towards her rehabilitation thus
far made in custody is to be nurtured.
The prisoner will require an extended period of supervision upon her release in
the interests
of her rehabilitation and to assist her so far as possible in
avoiding return to alcohol abuse.  I am satisfied that there are special
circumstances in this case for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing
Act</a></i>.
<P>

44  	I have decided the appropriate sentence in this case is a total
sentence of eight years penal servitude.  Having regard to
the special
circumstances, I propose to fix a minimum term of five years and an additional
term of three years.  The sentence is
to be backdated to 18 December 1995 when
the prisoner was taken into custody.  Accordingly I fix a minimum term
commencing on 18
December 1995 and to expire on 17 December 2000.  I fix an
additional term commencing on 18 December 2000 and expiring on 17 December
2003.  I specify 18 December 2000 as the first date upon which the prisoner is
to be eligible for release on parole.
