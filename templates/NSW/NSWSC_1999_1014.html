<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	The First Plaintiff, which was prior to 3 September 1992
known as Edmunds-Jones Sports Marketing Pty Limited, carries on business
as a
marketing consultant.   The Second Plaintiff, Helen Jones, who is also known as
Helen Edmunds-Jones, is a director and the principal
shareholder of the First
Plaintiff.
<P>

2   	The Defendant, Australian Women's Hockey Association
Incorporated ("AWHA"), is a non-profit organisation incorporated pursuant
to
the Australian Capital Territory's <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/aia1991307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act </i>1991</a>
(ACT).  The Defendant is the national body responsible for women's hockey in
Australia.  Its activities therefore include organising
national hockey
tournaments and competitions and the involvement therein of Australian women's
hockey teams including in the World
cup and the Olympic Games.
<P>

3   	This dispute arises out of a sports marketing consultancy
relationship governed by a series of five annual contracts in similar
form from
1989 to the end of 1994.  That relationship and those contracts were between
the Australian Women's Hockey Association
Incorporated and Edmunds-Jones Pty
Limited.  The final contract in the series and the principal subject of this
dispute ("the 1994
Consultancy Agreement") was entered into on 1 January 1994.
It was not renewed when it came to an end on 31 December 1994.  The 1994
Consultancy Agreement, like its predecessor, was a contract for the provision
of consulting services by the Plaintiffs in return
for certain fees and
commissions payable by the Defendant.  The dispute between the parties centres
round the First Plaintiff's claim
for commission based on sponsorship payments
to the Defendant in cash or kind involving Telstra and Qantas.
<P>

<b>PRINCIPAL MATTERS IN DISPUTE</b>
<P>

4   	The Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Defendant pay
certain fees and commissions said to be due and payable principally
under the
1994 Consultancy Agreement between the parties.  There is an earlier dispute in
point of time but only for about $12,000
arising under the 1993 Consultancy
Agreement.  This was for commission of fifteen per cent on $80,000 received
from Telstra Corporation
Ltd ("Telstra", or "Telecom" its previous name)
pursuant to what is described as the 1993 Telstra Stix Series.  That
involvement
of Telstra followed it entering a sponsorship agreement in February
1993 ("the 1993 Telstra Agreement") which by its terms expired
on 31 December
1994.  
<P>

5   	However the dispute principally centres around the First
Plaintiff's claim for commission in respect of sponsorship by Telstra
both in
1995 and to the present day.  It is claimed pursuant to the 1994 Consultancy
Agreement.  The parties have however joined
issue on whether:
<P>

(a)	the 1994 Consultancy Agreement as a matter of construction entitles the
First Plaintiff in the circumstances to such commission
either under clause
4(b) at fifteen per cent as a "subsequent year of [Telstra] sponsorship" or
under Clause 4(c) at twelve per cent
as a "renewal" of [Telstra]
sponsorship;
<P>

(b)	Mrs Jones did what she needed to do under the Agreement including
compliance with her duties so as to earn that commission and
was not
disentitled by any breach or non-fulfilment of any condition, express or
implied, if such there were;
<P>

(c)	clauses 4(b) and 4(c) or the agreements as a whole are void for
uncertainty, and, if so
<P>

(d)	the Plaintiffs were nonetheless entitled to reasonable remuneration based
on quantum meruit, with the further question, in what
sum and how
calculated.
<P>

6   	The same issues arise in relation to the claim for
commission based on Qantas payments.  There is however an anterior issue
going
to eligibility for commission.  Was any agreement for Qantas' sponsorship the
result of Qantas, as required by clause 4(b),
"having been approached or
introduced or negotiations commenced on or subsequent to the 1st January 1989"
having regard to the issue
in para 7 below?
<P>

7   	The parties join issue on whether, if any Qantas
sponsorship predated 1 January 1989, this precludes any fee to the Plaintiffs;
see clause 4(a) of the 12 December 1989 Consultancy Agreement (and note clause
3(a) of the 17 July 1989 Consultancy Agreement).
<P>

8   	Essentially, the Plaintiffs contend that
<P>

(i)	notwithstanding the 1994 Telstra Agreement's termination, in reality a
continuing sponsorship <i>relationship</i> subsisted between Telstra and the
Defendant continuing between 31 December 1994 and 5 May 1995, thereafter
continuing under the 1995
Telstra Agreement and subsequent agreements;  and
<P>

(ii)	this, with or without the 1995 Telstra Agreement referred to below,
constituted "subsequent year[s] of sponsorship", and entitled
the First
Plaintiff to a fifteen per cent commission under clause 4(b) of the 1994 (or
1993) Consultancy Agreement on any Telstra
sponsorship payments (or equivalent
goods and services).
<P>

Alternatively, the Plaintiffs rely upon a further written sponsorship agreement
with Telstra and the Defendant entered into for
a period of two years from 5
May 1995 ("the 1995 Telstra Agreement") as constituting a "renewal" of
sponsorship within the meaning
of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement so as to
entitle it to twelve per cent commission under clause 4(c) thereof.
<P>

9   	Thus in contention is whether the 1995 Telstra Agreement
and what preceded it from 1 January 1995 constituted:
<P>

(i)	a "subsequent year of sponsorship" to which a fifteen per cent commission
applies under clause 4(b) of the 1994 (or 1993) Consultancy
Agreement, or
<P>

(ii)	a renewal of the 1993 Telstra sponsorship to which twelve per cent
commission applies under clause 4(c) of the 1994 (or 1993)
 Consultancy
Agreement.
<P>

10   	It was contended in relation to Qantas that in 1994,
culminating in the agreement with Qantas of 7 November 1994, the Plaintiffs
negotiated with Qantas for Qantas to provide sponsorship to the Defendant
whereby Qantas provided domestic and international air
carriage in return for
the supply of specified revenue and publicity benefits by the Defendant for the
period 1995 until 1998.  
<P>

11   	The Qantas Agreement further provided for Qantas to
sponsor the Telstra Stix for the sum of $5,000 for the 1994 Series, 1995
Series
and each Series thereafter.  Based upon the alleged monetary benefits received
by the Defendant from Qantas under that Qantas
Agreement between 1994 and 1998
(or the monetary benefit of services provided and sponsorship payments paid by
Qantas), the First
Plaintiff claims commission of fifteen per cent under clause
4(b) of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement.  Alternatively the First Plaintiff
claims twelve per cent under clause 4(c) of the relevant Consultancy Agreement
in respect of any renewal by Qantas of its sponsorship
arrangement with the
Defendant 
<P>

12   	Both in respect of Telstra and Qantas into the future, the
First Plaintiff similarly claims in respect of each year of sponsorship
or
renewal.
<P>

13   	The Defendant denies any liability, disputes the relevant
amounts, claims the Plaintiffs were in breach of the contractual
obligations or
of an implied condition so as to disentitle them to any commission and contends
that in any event the relevant Consultancy
Agreements are void for uncertainty.
The Plaintiffs respond by claiming in the alternative on a quantum meruit
basis, similarly calculated,
should the relevant contract be void for
uncertainty.
<P>

14   	The Plaintiffs provide a detailed quantification of their
claim as at 26 August 1999 (including interest) referenced to the
relevant
invoices and other records in respect of both Telstra and Qantas.  It is
expressed in the alternative (twelve per cent or
fifteen per cent), totalling
respectively $962,154.29 or $810,516.50 plus interest;  see PX7.  The Defendant
has not at this stage
agreed with the relevant calculations.  But it has been
accepted that any dispute on that could be dealt with if it arises, after
I
have given judgment on liability.
<P>

<b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

15   	What follows is a statement of facts a substantial portion
of which is uncontroversial;  however there are areas of significant
difference
upon which I make findings where necessary.

<P>

17   	The relationship between Mrs Jones and the Defendant
evolved from contacts beginning in 1988.  In that year, Mrs Jones as
an
employee then of Grant Kearney and Associates acted on behalf of the Defendant
in negotiations with what was then the Australian
Overseas Telecommunications
Corporation Limited (later Telstra Corporation), for the purpose of securing
sponsorship of the 1990
Women's Hockey World Cup [Helen Jones ("HEJ") 21/5/96
para 8].  Mrs Jones was at the time successful in obtaining sponsorship for
the
Hockey World Cup in the sum of $350,000 [HEJ 21/5/96 para 8], though still as
an employee of Grant Kearney and Associates. 
<P>

18   	During 1989, Mrs Jones on behalf of herself and her
company (the First Plaintiff) engaged in negotiations with the Defendant
regarding the drafting of a consultancy agreement.  
<P>

19   	In a letter dated 17 August 1989 Lane &amp; Lane (AWHA's
solicitors) reported to AWHA, that a proposed new sub-clause 4(e)
in the
following term was requested by Edmunds-Jones to be inserted in the consultancy
agreement:
<P>

"(e)	Fees payable pursuant to sub-clause (c) of this clause shall be payable
upon any renewal of any sponsorship for years commencing
on or after1 January
1990 whether or not this Agreement has otherwise terminated through effluxion
of time or by the act of either
party to the intent that this clause shall
enure for the benefit of the Company until such time as all fees payable
pursuant hereto
have been received by the Company" (PTB 5)
<P>

20   	In the same letter to AWHA, Lane &amp; Lane said:
<P>

"As you will appreciate the result of a clause of this type would mean that the
15% fee payable to Mrs Jones would not just apply
during the term of the actual
agreement which was entered into on or prior to 31 December 1989, no matter how
long the term of the
Agreement, but on any further agreement entered into with
that party on or subsequent to 1 January 1990".
<P>

21   	In a letter dated 27 September 1989 Lane &amp; Lane said
to AWHA:
<P>

"Further, we confirm your instructions that a fee of 12% will be paid to Ms
Edmunds-Jones on agreements which are entered into subsequent
to the 1st
January 1990, the sponsor of which was previously approached to introduce, or
negotiations commenced or or [sic] subsequent
to the 1st January 1989" (PTB
6).
<P>

22   	On 12 December 1989, the Plaintiffs entered into the first
of a number of consultancy agreements with the Defendant.  The
Defendant
entered into that agreement with "Helen Edmunds-Jones carrying on business as
Edmunds-Jones Sports Marketing Pty Limited"
[BEC 2, 25].  Speaking generally,
the Plaintiffs agreed to provide advice and assistance in marketing,
sponsorship and communications
in return for certain fees and commissions
payable by the Defendant.
<P>

23   	Consultancy agreements in similar terms were entered into
between the plaintiffs and AWHA for periods up to December 1994
as follows:
<P>

&#183;	an agreement in 1991 for a period of 18 months commencing on 1 July
1991.  The monthly retainer increased to $1,200.  Commission
on new sponsorship
remained at 15%, and 12% upon the renewal of these contracts [BEC 60];
<P>

&#183;	In 1993 an agreement for one year commencing on 1 January 1993 in which
the retainer increased to $1,500 per month [BEC 75];
<P>

&#183;	A final agreement for a period of one year commencing on 1 January 1994
[BEC 89].
<P>

to 31 December
1994, relevantly included the following provisions:

<P>

25   	The consultancy agreement between the Plaintiffs and the
Defendant expired on 31 December 1994 and was not renewed.  From
about mid
1993, the Second Plaintiff was also paid costs and expenses for promotional
activities.  From 1 July 1991 the Plaintiffs
were paid $450,121 by AWHA
pursuant to the consultancy agreements but excluding any amounts paid in
respect of the 1990 World Cup.
 [BEC 16]
<P>

26   	On 14 and 15 May 1994, at a meeting the board of the
Defendant it was agreed to review the roles and responsibilities of the
marketing consultant "to determine her effectiveness in the areas of
sponsorship and raising the profile of women's hockey".  The
desirability of
retaining the Plaintiffs as marketing consultants came under further
examination in a 12 September 1994 meeting between
Ms Cawood who was the
Executive Director of the Defendant, and another member of the board of the
Defendant.  During that meeting,
reference was made to the fact that the
Plaintiffs had not secured sponsors for 1995.
<P>

27   	The Board of the Defendant subsequently agreed with a
Marketing and Promotions Committee report not to renew the 1994 Consultancy
agreement with the Plaintiffs.  Minutes of that meeting, dated 21 and 22
October 1994 record the resolution to seek expressions of
interest from other
consultants in the marketplace.  
<P>

28   	Minutes of the annual council meeting of the Defendant
held on 19 and 20 November 1994, under the heading "Marketing and Promotions",
quote the following as having been resolved:
<P>

6.1.5.2  The Meeting was advised the WHA Marketing Consultant's role and
effectiveness had been reviewed.  Legal advice was also
sought regarding the
Marketing Consultant's contractual arrangements.
<P>

The Board has supported the Marketing and Promotions Committee's recommendation
the Marketing Consultant's contract be terminated
at the end of 1994.
<P>

WHA is to prepare a brief to submit to selected marketing companies with a view
to seeking expressions of interest.
<P>

29   	Ms Cawood knew, before seeking that legal advice, that is,
before 19 October 1994, that the contract between the Plaintiffs
and the
Defendant would not be renewed at the end of 1994 [Cawood T, 357 .15].
<P>

30   	There is no evidence to suggest that the Defendant took
any steps to seek expressions of interest from marketing agents during
late
1994.  While the Defendant was aware that the Consultancy Agreement with the
Plaintiffs was not going to be renewed, no alternative
marketing agents were
approached.  Ms Cawood could not assert otherwise when questioned about this
issue [Cawood T, 392].  I comment
further on her evidence below, in relation to
Telstra.
<P>

31   	On 31 December 1994 the fourth Consultancy Agreement
between the First Plaintiff and the Defendant expired and was not renewed.
 
<P>

32   	This was confirmed by minutes of a Board Meeting of the
Defendant held on 4 and 5 February 1995.  Further, at that meeting,
it was
resolved that no replacement Marketing Consultant be engaged and that the needs
of the Defendant with regard to such a consultant
be reviewed "on an event by
event basis" [PTB, 81 at 4.4.2]
<P>

33   	On 30 January 1995 the First Plaintiff invoiced the
Defendant for certain fees outstanding, amounting to $13,001.94.  For
the
earlier period from 1 July 1991 the Plaintiffs were paid $450,121 by AWHA
pursuant to the Consultancy Agreements but excluding
any amounts paid in
respect of the 1990 World Cub [BEC, 16].  From about mid-1993, the Second
Plaintiff was paid costs and expenses
for promotional activities.
<P>

<b>The Telecom/Telstra Agreements</b>
<P>

34   	The Defendant entered into a sponsorship agreement with
Australian Telecommunications Corporation trading as Telecom Australia
in
respect of the 1990 Hockey World Cup, on 21 August 1989.  The sponsorship was
to provide promotion and exposure for Telecom which
agreed to pay $152,000 in
sponsorship;  that is $80,000 to the Australian Women's Hockey team to be known
as "the Australian Women's
Hockey Team sponsored by Telecom Australia" and the
balance of $72,000 towards video and the awards.  AWHA retained that the right
to negotiate minor sponsorship agreements for the national teams which did not
conflict with Telecom, excluding agreements in place
with companies including
Australian Airlines and Qantas.  It appears that the negotiations for that
agreement began at the end of
1988, most probably around 22 or 23 December 1988
[Jones T, 94 .20; 164 .45].
<P>

35   	The 1989 Consultancy Agreement specifically referred to
sponsorship arrangements with Telecom, differentiating them from other
sponsorship arrangements, commission on which would not be payable if the
negotiations leading to their execution commenced before
1 January 1989.
<P>

36   	On the same date, that is, 21 August 1989, Telecom
Australia and the Defendant also entered into a general sponsorship agreement
(the "1989 Telecom Agreement").  It can be accepted that the 1989 Telecom
agreement was a result of the Plaintiffs' efforts to obtain
sponsorship for the
Defendant and in relation to which the Plaintiffs were entitled to 15% of the
sponsorship monies paid in respect
of its terms.
<P>

37   	On 8 May 1991, the Defendant entered into a further
sponsorship agreement with Telecom Australia (the "1991 Telecom Agreement").
Under the provisions of the 1991 Telecom Agreement, Telecom Australia agreed to
provide sponsorship for the years 1991 and 1992 in
the sums of $100,000 and
$150,000 respectively [BEC, 132].  The 1991 Telecom Agreement was entered into
at a time when the Plaintiffs
were employed pursuant to a consultancy agreement
with the Defendant.
<P>

38   	The sponsorship relationship was extended when on 15
February 1993, through the marketing efforts of the First Plaintiff,
a further
agreement was reached between Telecom Australia and the Defendant (the "1993
Telecom Agreement").  The 1993 Telecom Agreement
provided for sponsorship for
1993 and 1994 of $200,000 per year [BEC, 140].  The 1993 Telecom Agreement
provided in clause 8:
<P>

8.1	In the event that the Sponsor wishes to extend its sponsorship (and for the
purposes of this clause, `sponsorship' will refer
to and include both the Team
Sponsorship and the "Let's Play Hockey" sponsorship) for a further period of
twelve (12) months for
the calendar year 1995; it must notify AWHA in writing
by 30 June 1994 whereupon AWHA will advise Telecom of the terms and conditions
to apply to the sponsorship and a decision will be made by the parties as to
the continuation of the sponsorship by 30 August 1994.
<P>

39   	It is not disputed that the Plaintiffs were paid the
requisite commission on the amounts specified in the three agreements
between
AWHA and Telecom, the last of which, being the 1993 Telecom Agreement expired
in 1994.
<P>

40   	The first three Telecom agreements, namely those entered
into in 1989, 1990 and 1993 were all the result of relevant activity
on the
part of the First Plaintiff rendering the Defendant liable to pay commission in
respect of the amounts accruing to it under
those agreements, a commission in
fact paid.  One can reasonably conclude that there was thus no complaint about
the performance
of the First Plaintiff under those sponsorship agreements to
that point at least.  [T, 28 .50]
<P>

<b>The Telecom Stix Series</b>
<P>

41   	In 1993 the Defendant held the first national league
competition which was played in different locations over a period of
about one
month and which, known as the "Stix Series" or "Telecom Stix Series", replaced
the national championships.
<P>

42   	An agreement was reached between the Australian
Broadcasting Commission and the Defendant (brokered by the Plaintiffs [Jones
T,
116 .30]) in September 1993 for the ABC to record the hockey games played in
Brisbane, Perth and Sydney and to broadcast eight
programs, each of
approximately 75 minutes duration.
<P>

43   	The Defendant was to contribute $70,000 towards the
production costs and a further sum of up to $10,000 for travel costs of
ABC
personnel.  Telecom agreed to meet the contribution of $80,000  [BEC, 152].
This sum was in addition to sponsorship moneys otherwise
payable under the
existing sponsorship agreements between Telecom and the Defendant and was, I am
satisfied, so negotiated by Mrs
Jones for AWHA with Telecom in the way she
describes in cross-examination  [Jones T, 117 .20-25 and earlier from 116.15].
ABC had
agreed to reduce its costs from $120,000 to the $80,000.
<P>

44   	Thus the amount of $80,000 was paid by Telecom to the
Defendant;  see Mrs Jones T, 117 .35.  The Defendant then paid the production
costs of televising the Stix Series, as required by the ABC.
<P>

45   	By letter dated 13 May 1994, some months later, the Second
Plaintiff first claimed commission on behalf of the First Plaintiff
on the sum
of $80,000 paid by Telecom for the broadcasting expenses associated with the
Telecom Stix Series.  No mention of or request
for commission was made by the
Plaintiff before 13 May 1994.  Her letter said:
<P>

"It may be worth noting that the commission from Telecom sponsorship ($80,000)
for 1993 is still outstanding to Edmunds Jones as
well and needs to be
addressed from the Stix income this year as well."
<P>

In early June 1994 Ms Cawood, the Executive Director of AWHA since 1987,
telephoned the Second Plaintiff in relation to the letter
of 13 May 1994
requesting payment of the commission.  Ms Cawood suggested that the two parties
needed to meet to discuss the commission
issue.
<P>

46   	At a meeting between Mrs Jones and the Marketing Committee
of the Defendant in June 1994, this issue of commission on the
Telecom Stix
Series sponsorship was discussed.  Rosemary Scott of AWHA said to Mrs Jones at
that meeting that the Defendant had not
budgeted for commission on the sum of
$80,000 paid by Telecom for broadcasting expenses.  She said to Mrs Jones that
if she wanted
to be paid commission "you will have to negotiate an amount for
Telecom to cover both production costs and your commission.  We will
not pay
commission out of production costs".  Mrs Jones did not agree to the proposal
put by Rosemary Scott -- not surprisingly as
there was no basis for it in the
relevant Sponsorship Agreement.  AWHA produced a document entitled "National
Budget", which did
set aside $130,000 for "Telecom sponsorship including TV
coverage" [Jones T, 122 .24].   
<P>

47   	During that meeting the AWHA suggested that if the
Plaintiffs generated in excess of $45,000 additional or secondary sponsorship
for the 1994 Telecom Stix Series, commission on the 1993 production costs would
be paid out of any excess of that figure of $45,000.
 Although a memorandum
written by the Defendant with regard to the meeting refers to the arrangement
so stated as "agreed", Mrs Jones
denied that the Plaintiffs consented to the
course of action.  Mrs Jones rather asserts that it was a resolution of the
Defendant
and was not agreed to by the Plaintiff [Jones T, 124 .55], However,
the Second Plaintiff cannot point to any communication of her
dissatisfaction
with the arrangement to the Defendant.  The Second Plaintiff indicated that the
reason for her apparent acquiescence
at first was to ensure the smooth running
of the consultancy relationship at that time.
<P>

48   	It was further `agreed' that any money negotiated by the
Plaintiffs for the 1994 television production costs must incorporate
any
commission that was to be paid to the Plaintiffs.
<P>

49   	The Plaintiffs did not, as it turns out, manage to
generate in excess of $45,000 in secondary sponsorship income for televising
the 1994 Telecom Stix Series.  Accordingly no commission was ever paid in
respect of the 1993 television productions costs paid by
Telecom Australia.
<P>

50   	Finally, on 4 November 1994, the First Plaintiff, by
invoice, sought payment of the sum of $461.63 as commission on a payment
by
Telecom of the sum of $3,770.50 for the design and printing of a brochure for
the Stix Series.  Thus in respect of the 1994 Telstra
Agreement for the Telecom
Stix Series from 1993, there was $12,000 claimed.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

51   	Based on the terms of the 1993 Sponsorship Agreement, but
on the assumption to be considered later, that it was not void for
uncertainty,
there is no proper basis for denying the Plaintiffs either amount, namely
$461.63 or $12,000.  In particular there is
no suggestion of non-performance by
the First Plaintiff of its part of the Sponsorship Agreement to that point.  In
particular I
am satisfied Mrs Jones secured the contribution of $80,000 from
Telecom.
<P>

<b>The 1995 Telstra Agreement</b>
<P>

52   	The 1993 Telecom Agreement was scheduled to expire at the
end of 1994.  Materially, the 1993 Telecom Agreement contained provision,
at
clause 8.1 (quoted above), for certain communications to be made if Telecom
wished to renew its sponsorship with the Defendant.
<P>

53   	The first requirement of clause 8.1 was that, if it were
wishing to extend the sponsorship relationship, Telecom was to notify
the
Defendant "in writing" by 30 June 1994.  Although no letter was sent to this
effect, the Plaintiffs were satisfied that Telecom
had communicated a desire to
extend the sponsorship relationship by way of various meetings and other oral
communications [Jones
T, 139 .39] including discussions with Annamaree Pinner
of Telecom in May of 1994 [Jones T, 148 .35].  Further discussions to a similar
effect were alleged by the Second Plaintiff to have occurred in July or August
1994 between Mr O'Neill, the national sponsorship
manager of Telecom, and the
Second Plaintiff [Jones T,  149 .6].  The precise content and force of those
conversations is unascertainable.
 They were not referred to by Ms Cawood in
further correspondence with O'Neill or other Telecom representatives [Jones T,
152 .45].
 I am nonetheless satisfied that the parties and in particular
Telecom acted on the common assumption that Telecom wished to renew.
<P>

54   	Thus it appears from the evidence of Mrs Wilson, President
of AWHA, that despite not receiving <i>written</i> confirmation of a
willingness to proceed with sponsorship on behalf of Telecom, it appears that
the budget for the 1994-95 year of
the Defendant included contributions from
Telecom running into 1995 [Wilson T, 289 .5].  It seems even if there was some
doubt as
to the precise amount that would be forthcoming from Telecom, that the
expectation certainly of the Board of the Defendant at the
time the 1994-95
budget was drawn up was that the Telecom sponsorship would continue into
1995:
<P>

Q.	And the usual practices, to your knowledge, were, in 1994, that if something
was known to the committee, which cast significant
doubt upon whether
sponsorships would be renewed, that information would be passed on to the
person preparing budgets, isn't that
right?
<P>

A.	They would be based on the fact that the Telecom sponsorship ended in that
year and the amount from the sponsorship therefore,
from when the sponsorship
would be renewed, was not known. 
<P>

[Wilson T, 289 .30]
<P>

55   	Despite the 1994-95 budget containing allowances for
continued Telecom sponsorship and despite there being a process for the
budget
to be modified if the first expectations as to sponsorship income were proven
to be incorrect, and further despite that it
was usual practice for reports to
be made to the Board by various committees about important matters such as the
Telecom sponsorship,
at the Board meeting of 21 and 22 October 1994 the matter
of budget readjustment did not arise at board level within the First Plaintiff.
[Wilson T, 290-1]
<P>

<b><i>The 1994 Proposal</i></b>
<P>

56   	A sponsorship proposal was formulated by the Plaintiffs
for submission to Telecom aiming to secure further Telecom sponsorship.
 This
proposal was presented to Telecom by the Plaintiffs in late August 1994, some
four days before the deadline for the submission
of such a proposal as required
by clause 8.1 of the 1993 Telecom Agreement.   It appears that the late
submission of the proposal
was due to practical matters.  The proposal had to
be approved by a committee of the Defendant, members of which were overseas for
the Hockey World Cup.  Furthermore, a video was prepared that took some time to
produce [Jones T, 158 .5-.30], though her evidence
was that she personally felt
that the proposed annual fee of $650,000 was "a bit high" and claims to have
told Mrs Jones of that
view (T, 323 .55 to 324.5), but relied on the
Plaintiffs' professed expertise in allowing the proposal to go forward.
<P>

57   	Before submission of the 1994 proposal, I am satisfied
that the proposal was approved by the Defendant.  Ms Cawood admits,
in
particular, to approving the fee structure provided for in the 1994 Sponsorship
Proposal [Cawood T, 323 .30].
<P>

58   	The proposal envisaged the sponsorship in 1995 of the
national women's hockey team (known as the Telecom Hockeyroos), the
Stix
Series, the Buchannan Cup and the Players' Fund by Telecom.  The total amount
of sponsorship sought in the proposal for 1995
was $650,000 followed by another
$650,000 for 1996.  Alternatively, the amount would be $600,000 in 1995 if
Telecom made a commitment
for four years.  Both these figures represented a
very significant increase in sponsorship -- from $200,000 to almost treble.
<P>

59   	The August 1994 proposal submitted by the Plaintiffs to
Telecom was rejected by Telecom.  Mr O'Neill, as the responsible officer
at
Telecom, stated by way of affidavit that:
<P>

"Under no circumstances would I have recommended a proposal that was based on
an amount of $650,000 or any amount of a similar magnitude.
 Further I was not
prepared to consider taking less than the entire rights for an amount which was
comparable to what we had paid
for the entire sponsorship rights." [AEO 9/6/98
para 8]
<P>

60   	On the 13 October 1994, a letter was sent by O'Neill from
Telecom to the Plaintiffs and was copied to Ms Cawood.  This letter
explained
the rejection of the 1994 proposal by Telecom.  Materially, the letter read:
<P>

"Your proposal clearly demonstrates the success, but as you will appreciate, we
have to make difficult decisions on how we spend
our limited sponsorship funds.
The proposal has been carefully considered in line with our current strategy,
and unfortunately based
on its current content and funding requirements,
Telecom Australia must decline the proposal."
<P>

61   	Between the initial rejection of the proposal in August
and the letter of 13 October 1994, the Plaintiffs did not approach
any sponsor
as a replacement for Telecom Australia.  The Second Plaintiff maintains that
during that period she continued to attempt
to negotiate with Telecom through a
Ms Passmore [Jones T, 146 .55].   Ms Passmore was a representative of Telecom
dealing with the
sponsorship.  During those negotiations it appears that Ms
Cawood did not directly take up with Mr O'Neill (as the representative
of
Telstra) any alleged change of heart with respect to the sponsorship of the
Defendant that occurred between conversations had
in May and July (or August)
between the Plaintiffs and Telstra, and the later refusal of the 1994 Proposal
at the end of August 1994.
<P>

62   	The Defendant maintains that there was no such change of
heart.  There is contradictory evidence.  The Plaintiff maintains
that
conversations with Annemaree Pinner of Telecom in June/July of 1994 gave the
indication that Telecom was going to continue the
sponsorship arrangement.
This is referred to in a letter from the Second Plaintiff to Telecom of 4
November 1994 (received 14 November
1994):
<P>

"I did ask Annemaree Pinner at the end of June if she could indicate to us your
strategies in regard to renewing the sponsorship
and she advised that she had
referred the matter to you".
<P>

63   	On the other hand, the Defendant maintain that there was
no such representation.  This is reflected in a letter from O'Neill
of Telecom
to Ms Cawood of 17 November 1994:
<P>

"Discussions with Annemaree Pinner in June/July of this year advised Edmunds
Jones to submit a new proposal to Telecom to ensure
timeframe for negotiation
was satisfactory to both parties";  see also Mr O'Neill's evidence in T, 216
.35.
<P>

64   	Furthermore, in the period between 30 August 1994 and 13
October 1994, Telecom Australia did not make any decision as to where
the money
that might have been given to the Defendant might have otherwise been spent
[O'Neill T, 234 .11].  Rather, during that
period it was Telecom's position
that there might be some reconsideration of the sponsorship proposal [Passmore
T, 267 .30].  I place
considerable importance on the fact that Ms Passmore of
Telecom communicated to her superior, Mr O'Neill, the desire to "save" the
sponsorship arrangement [Passmore T, 267 .50].  It was her opinion that the 13
October 1994 letter had not severed the sponsorship
relationship [Passmore T,
273 .10].
<P>

65   	Although the rejection of the 1994 Proposal should have
been of acute significance to the Defendant, significantly there appears
no
reference whatsoever to that refusal in the minutes of a meeting of 21 and 22
October 1994 [PTB, 47].
<P>

<b><i>Reasons for Refusal</i></b>
<P>

66   	The August 1994 proposal submitted by the Plaintiffs to
Telecom was rejected by Telecom.  The responsible officer at Telecom
Mr O'Neill
stated that:
<P>

"Under no circumstances would I have recommended a proposal that was based on
an amount of $650,000 or any amount of a similar magnitude.
 Further I was not
prepared to consider taking less than the entire rights for an amount which was
comparable to what we had paid
for the entire sponsorship rights." [AEO 9/6/98
para 8]
<P>

He of course would have known that rejection of the proposal for renewal of the
sponsorship was by no means the end of the sponsorship,
for Telecom could still
exercise its right of last refusal and renew the sponsorship at that point,
presupposing its prior continuance;
 see clause 8.2 of the Telstra Sponsorship
Agreement.
<P>

67   	Some time in October Ms Passmore said <i>after</i> the
initial rejection by Mr O'Neill i.e. <i>after</i> 13 October [Passmore T, 268
.41] -- but later contradicted [Passmore T, 271 .35-45]), a conversation took
place between Ms Cawood
and Ms Passmore, dealing with the sponsorship of the
AWHA [Passmore T, 268 .5].  The effect of this conversation was that Ms Cawood
was made aware of the fact that the amount of money being sought in the
submission made by the Plaintiffs was too great.  It appears
that information
was not passed on to Mrs Jones.  The implied contradiction of the date of the
conversation being after Mr O'Neill's
initial rejection comes in this exchange
about the form of the rejection letter which Ms Passmore had drafted for Mr
O'Neill, when
she was pressed about whether the words "funding requirements"
would have conveyed that the price (of sponsorship) was too high.
<P>

Q.	That is something you inferred Mrs Cawood would understand as a result of
your conversations with her?
<P>

A.	My conversation with ?
<P>

Q.	Mrs Cawood
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Ms Cawood could only be confidently anticipated by Ms Passmore as understanding
the words in their ambiguous state, if when drafted
Ms Passmore had
<i>already</i> given Ms Cawood their intended message -- that the price was too
high.
<P>

68   	On 13 October 1994, O'Neill of Telecom wrote a letter to
the Second Plaintiff and copied to Ms Cawood.  Ms Cawood was thus
aware, as of
the arrival of that letter that the Second Plaintiff had been told that the
reasons for refusal of the 1994 proposal
was that it did not fit into Telecom's
"current strategy" [PTB, 44].  The nearest the letter gets to price is in the
very general
words which follow:  "... based on its current content and funding
requirements, Telecom Australia must decline the proposal."
<P>

69   	On 14 October 1994, a meeting of the Marketing Committee
of the Defendant was convened before Mrs Jones' arrival to discuss
the
rejection of the 1994 Telecom proposal chaired by one of its board members Ms
Tye.  Mrs Jones attended the meeting and says in
her affidavit [HEJ, 41] "the
mood of the Marketing Committee was jovial" -- hardly congruous with a genuine
expectation on the Committee's
part that Telstra's sponsorship was really lost.
At this point, Mrs Jones raised her concern that someone from the Defendant had
been in contact directly with a representative of Telecom.  She reproduces the
conversation (HEJ, 41) in terms whose accuracy was
not doubted by Ms Cawood (T,
353.4)
<P>

Jones:	I'm surprised that you are taking this news so calmly.'
<P>

Cawood:	`What else can we do?'
<P>

Jones:	`I have read and re-read O'Neill's letter and it doesn't add up.
Reading between the lines, I suspect that there is more
to this letter than he
wants me to know.  Have you or anyone from WHA had any direct contact from
anyone at Telecom whatsoever about
this.'
<P>

Cawood:	`No.'
<P>

Jones:	`I would be very upset if anyone from WHA was dealing directly with
Telecom.'
<P>

Tye:	`What do you (Jones) suggest should happen now?'
<P>

Jones:	`I will ring O'Neill and discuss this rejection but from the tone of the
letter I suspect that he won't want to speak to
me.'
<P>

Tye:	`What if he won't?'
<P>

Jones:	`I will write to him requesting a meeting to discuss ways to reach a
compromise.  If I get no response from the letter then
I will make contact with
Diedre Mason.'
<P>

Cawood:	`I must insist that you give me a draft of the letter to Alan O'Neill
for comment by the Marketing Committee before you
send it.'
<P>

Jones:	`I always do this so why would I not on this occasion?  It seems to me
that you want to monitor my words and actions very
closely.  Is there something
that you are not telling me.'
<P>

Cawood:	`No.'
<P>

Jones:	`Maybe that Telecom want to deal with WHA and not through an agent.  Do
you think this could be the case?'
<P>

Tye:	`If it were?'
<P>

Jones:	`We would have to find a way around the problem.  My prime objective is
to have Telecom renew with you because it is going
to be a lot easier at this
stage than finding a new sponsor and obviously I have an ongoing vested
interest in Telecom sponsorship
continuing.  I believe that it will continue
until the Sydney 2000 Olympics.'
<P>

Tye:	`I understand.'
<P>

70   	Ms Cawood certainly did not raise the issues of concern
made known to her by O'Neill or Ms Passmore in the conversation referred
to
above nor had she told Mrs Jones.  If, indeed, as I conclude as more likely,
that conversation between Ms Passmore and Ms Cawood
had occurred <i>before</i>
the Marketing Committee meeting of the 14 October 1994, it is significant that
this information was not revealed to the Plaintiffs
before or at that meeting.
Ms Cawood, firstly, would not have been truthful in denying that she had had
direct contact with Telecom,
as I conclude she did.  Second, such a denial and
omission supports the inference that Ms Cawood desired the Plaintiff's efforts
to secure Telecom sponsorship to fail through ignorance of the true position.
The Plaintiffs contend that the only reason such a
course of action would be
embarked upon is that Ms Cawood had in her mind the idea that if the Plaintiffs
failed to continue the
sponsorship arrangement, the Defendant could do so `in
house' -- as later occurred -- and, by so doing, could avoid the commission
payable otherwise.  I return later to that contention.
<P>

71   	In a telephone conversation on 19 October 1994 between Mr
O'Neill of Telecom and Mrs Jones (reproduced HEJ, para 42), Mr O'Neill
confirmed the refusal of the 1994 Proposal by Telecom and that "I am not
prepared to negotiate the proposal as I can't afford the
package".  He was not
prepared to negotiate individual parts of the package:  "if I can't have
everything, then I don't want it at
all".  Telecom would not negotiate the
price with the Plaintiffs nor meet "to discuss options".  Rather, Mr O'Neill
suggested that
the Plaintiffs should offer the sponsorship proposal in the
wider market place saying:  "But I said I won't break the package up
so get out
there and flog it -- it's worth the money and the women deserve it".  Note,
contrary to the attack by the Defendant on
Mrs Jones' credit Mr O'Neill was
here confirming that $600,000 was not too expensive in the market -- just too
expensive for Telecom.
 While he does not say it is "too cheap", he comes close
to it.
<P>

72   	In the same conversation, Mr O'Neill asserted Telecom's
last right of refusal as contained in the 1993 Telecom agreement stating
"you
have to come back to me and I will make up my mind then".  He thus reflected
clause 8 of the 1993 Telecom Agreement which reads
(in part):
<P>

8.2	In the event that the parties fail to agree on new terms and conditions by
30 August 1994, AWHA will be free to negotiate with
any other prospective
sponsor PROVIDED HOWEVER that before committing itself to the prospective
sponsor, AWHA must afford the Sponsor
the opportunity to renew its sponsorship
upon the same terms and conditions that have been negotiated between AWHA and
the prospective
sponsor.  The Sponsor's election to renew must be exercised no
later than seven (7) days after notification by AWHA of the terms
and
conditions that the prospective sponsor has agreed to accept.
<P>

Nor did he express any concern at Mrs Jones foreshadowing she had to seek to
sell it to someone else or the effect on "imagery that
has cost Telecom so much
to establish".  That was understandable -- he was in a strong bargaining
position with a last right of refusal.
 This was quite apart from whether he
had reason to expect that AWHA would do nothing to risk losing Telecom as a
sponsor, there
already having been direct contact without Mrs Jones between Ms
Cawood and Ms Passmore.
<P>

73   	I should add that Mrs Jones making direct contact with Mr
O'Neill was wholly understandable in the circumstances.  Indeed
far from being
a breach of any obligation to act in a professional and businesslike manner,
her conversation was wholly justified
by that obligation.  Significantly, Mr
O'Neill refused to engage in any negotiation on price, by pushing Mrs Jones to
offer the sponsorship
in the market place.  Mr O'Neill's own affidavit evidence
does not deny Mrs Jones' version of events.
<P>

74   	The refusal of Telecom to negotiate was referred to in a
letter of 21 October 1994 from Mrs Jones to Meg Wilson, the then
President of
the Defendant:
<P>

"I have tried without success, to meet and discuss this decision with Alan
[O'Neill of Telecom Australia] in an attempt to renegotiate
terms more in line
with Telecom's "current strategy".
<P>

75   	Despite being aware of the fact that Telecom had refused
the 1994 proposal on the grounds of cost (a point communicated to
her by Ms
Cawood who, at that time, seems to have been in contact with Telecom in regards
to the reasons for the refusal [Wilson
T, 300 .20 and following]),  Ms Wilson
did not advise the Second Plaintiff on that matter [Wilson T, 302 .10].
<P>

76   	Significantly, a board meeting of the Defendant took place
on 21 and 22 October 1994 (PTB, 47) and on a matter so critically
important to
the prospective financial well-being of the Defendant no reference appears in
the minutes of any difficulty with her
Telstra sponsorship for 1995.
<P>

77   	Furthermore, even though the letter of 21 October 1994 to
Meg Wilson was subsequently faxed to Ms Cawood, Ms Cawood made no
apparent
attempt to communicate to the Plaintiff the reasons for the rejection as known
to Ms Cawood at that time.  Yet Ms Cawood
at that time believed that the reason
for the rejection of the 1994 Proposal was the ground of cost.
<P>

78   	Mr O'Neill explained the "current strategy" as being the
establishment of four portfolios namely, sport, charity, the arts
and the
environment.[O'Neill T, 229 .25]  However, when questioned whether there was
something about the 1994 Proposal that was inconsistent
with the current
strategy as so described Mr O'Neill's response was simply that:
<P>

"our strategy allowed us to spend a limited amount of funds and it didn't fit."
[O'Neill T, 229 .55]
<P>

79   	In a letter of 14 November 1994, the First Plaintiff
inquired of Mr O'Neill of Telecom for an explanation of the reasons given
for
refusal.  The relevant paragraph reads:
<P>

`Your letter...advising us to seek a new sponsor for WHA came as a surprise and
your subsequent refusal to elaborate on Telecom's
"current strategy"
prohibiting the continuation of this sponsorship or to discuss how we might
break up the total package to accommodate
Telecom's budget, is most
bewildering.  The reluctance to work together to find a solution is
uncharacteristic of the way we have
observed the procedures of your department
in the past.'
<P>

80   	O'Neill gave further evidence under cross-examination to
the effect that the only basis upon which the 1994 Sponsorship Proposal
was
rejected was that of price [O'Neill T, 218 .30].  Although questioned about the
increased profile of the Australian Women's Hockey
Team, Mr O'Neill indicated
that he was not convinced that the success of the team added enough extra to
the proposal to make it attractive
to Telecom Australia [O'Neill T, 220 .1].
<P>

81   	Apart from the dissatisfaction with the amount of monetary
consideration requested by the Plaintiffs in the 1994 Proposal,
Mr O'Neill was
of the opinion that the sponsorship of the Defendant by Telecom should continue
[T, 221 .1].  Yet Telecom was reluctant
to negotiate the fee with the
Plaintiffs [O'Neill T, 221 .30] a fact which bears some significance in light
of later events. 
<P>

82   	In a letter of 18 November 1994, the Second Plaintiff
wrote to Ms Cawood in relation to the refusal by the Defendant to provide
monies requested by the Plaintiffs for the purposes of a media campaign.  In
the body of that letter is found the words:
<P>

"In presenting to prospective sponsors and listening to the opinions of others,
including Alan O'Neill (who said that $600,000 a
year was too cheap for what
WHA is offering), I have reviewed the asking price." [PTB, 59]
<P>

Though Ms Cawood's evidence was that she realised that Telecom thought the
price in the 1994 Proposal was too high, Ms Cawood maintained
her silence
towards the Plaintiffs on that issue.
<P>

<b>Legal Advice</b>
<P>

83   	On the 19 October 1994 (PX6) a facsimile was sent by Lane
&amp; Lane Solicitors to Ms Cawood.  The document was allowed to
be adduced on
the grounds that any privilege attaching to its contents had been waived by the
production of the document.  The first
paragraph of the document reads:
<P>

We refer to your instructions to advise on the obligations of Australian
Women's Hockey Association Inc ("the Association") with
respect to the  payment
of a fee to Edmunds-Jones Pty Limited ("the Company") pursuant to the
provisions of Clause 4 of Annexure
C of the Agreement.
<P>

The letter makes it clear that what AWHA was seeking to ascertain were the
obligations to which AWHA might be exposed if the Telecom
sponsorship were
renewed during 1994 and how those obligations might differ if no renewal took
place on or prior to 31 December 1994
(being the date of expiry of the 1994
consultancy Agreement if itself not renewed).  It is clear (see PX6) that so
far as any new
sponsorship agreement with Telstra was concerned, the advice of
Lane &amp; Lane was there be a new agreement "which has been wholly
and
separately negotiated on new terms".
<P>

84   	Under cross-examination, Ms Cawood, being the recipient of
the facsimile, was unable to give any reason, other than that referred
to in
the document, as to why the advice had been sought [Cawood T, 328].  Nor could
she give any clear evidence as to whom it was
shown when received, and what
discussion there was about it.  The inference sought to be made by the
Plaintiffs is that Ms Cawood
was contemplating ways in which the Defendant
could avoid the payment of commission to the Plaintiffs on any sponsorship
agreement
with Telecom Australia entered into after the termination of fourth
Consultancy Agreement with the Plaintiffs.
<P>

85   	Significantly in support of that inference, Ms Cawood
admitted that it was her belief, on receiving the advice from the solicitors
of
the Defendant, that a Telecom Sponsorship agreement, if not entered into in
1994 could well be entered into in 1995. [Cawood T,
329 .40]  That is, Ms
Cawood could not have entertained the view that the sponsorship relationship
between the Defendant and Telecom
had permanently come to an end as she claimed
to have done [Cawood T, 362 .25].  So far as credit is concerned, I did not
find Ms
Cawood at all a satisfactory or candid witness.  Thus she frequently
said she did not recall, rather than concede what would harm
or be awkward for
her case (see among many examples T, 364 .6).  She would positively deny other
matters with a confidence hardly
congruent with her otherwise lacking recall.
In contrast, I found Ms Jones a reliable witness, precise and forthcoming and
where
her recollection differs from Ms Cawood, I prefer the evidence of Mrs
Jones.  I deal later with the attacks on her credit which as
I explain were
without proper foundation and unfair.
<P>

<b>The Media Campaign</b>
<P>

86   	By letter dated 21 October 1994, the Plaintiffs informed
the Defendant of Telecom Australia's continued refusal to renegotiate
the 1994
Proposal.  
<P>

87   	The Plaintiffs indicated that they would need $3,000 to
fund a campaign to find a new sponsor (in replacement of Telecom Australia).
The Plaintiffs were aware of clause 8.3 of the 1993 Telecom Agreement and
recommended to the Defendant to contain their disappointment
lest clause 8.3 be
breached.  Clause 8.3 of the 1993 Telecom Agreement reads:
<P>

8.3	In the event that there is no extension of the period of sponsorship by the
Sponsor, AWHA agrees that it shall not, at any time
in the future, say
anything, or cause anything to be said or published that in any way denigrates
the Sponsor or its officers or
calls into question any decisions of the Sponsor
in relation to this matter.   The rights and obligations of the parties under
this
clause 8.3 are continuing rights and obligations, separate and independent
from the other rights and obligations of the parties and
survive termination of
this Agreement.
<P>

88   	Despite the importance of a major sponsor such as Telecom
to the Defendant, Ms Cawood refused to authorise the payment of
$3,000 to the
Plaintiff.  Mrs Jones maintained in her affidavit, that part of the reason
given by Ms Cawood for the refusal was that
"Telecom may renew" [HEJ 21/5/96,
para 16-28].  Meg Wilson, the President of the Defendant at that time further
suggested that the
reason for the refusal to provide $3,000 was that:
<P>

"We thought it was too high to do what she needed to do at that moment in the
light of the fact that there was already a sponsorship
proposal
prepared".[Wilson T, 304 .15]
<P>

89   	However, when questioned further by the Plaintiffs about
the refusal of the Defendant to provide the $3,000 necessary to launch
a
campaign (by letter 18.11.94 PTB, 59),  AWHA maintained that provision of only
$1,000 was all that could be justified under budget
restrictions present at
that time (by letter from Meg Wilson 1.12.94 PTB, 62).  Earlier on 1 November
1994, Ms Cawood telephoned
Mrs Jones in relation to the funds requested for the
media campaign.  According to Mrs Jones, the conversation was to the following
effect [HEJ, para 47]:
<P>

Jones:	`This campaign is going to cost $5,000-$,6000.  All I am asking is for
WHA to pay $3,000 towards it and Edmunds-Jones will
meet the rest.  Our input
of money and effort makes sense given that we believe our contract with WHA
will be renewed beyond this
year.  Has the Marketing Committee recommended to
the Board that the contract be renewed yet?'
<P>

Cawood:	`I am not at liberty to disclose whether they have or not.'
<P>

Jones:	`Why?'
<P>

Cawood:	`You are not going to force any statements of this from me.  This is a
Board decision and that is all I can say.'
<P>

Jones:	`The question that I'm asking is `has the Marketing Committee made its
usual recommendation to the Board?'  This all sounds
ominous.  Are you saying
that there is some doubt because if you are, I would be mad to spend money on a
sponsorship campaign which
may not bear results until after our contract
expires?'
<P>

Cawood:	`I hate to be bearer of doom and gloom but WHA has decided to seek
expressions of interest from a number of interested agencies
for sponsorship
management.'
<P>

Jones:	`This is a ridiculous situation.  I thought that we are a team but it
seems I may no longer be on the team but no one is
telling me.  Are you happy
for me to spend thousands of dollars on a sponsorship campaign when you may
already know that we will
not be around any more?  Do you think this is fair?
Regardless of your comments, we need to do the campaign for the team's sake so
I want you to contribute $3,000 out of the marketing budget that I haven't
fully spent."
<P>

Cawood:	`No we can't afford it.'
<P>

Jones:	`But we have just saved you that amount from your budgeted allocation to
buy the team awards for each member of the team.
 The sponsorship of Gold Mark
Jewellery saved you that money.  If we don't do the campaign, what are you
going to do in January when
your team has no sponsor?'
<P>

Cawood:	"Telecom may renew and because of this we shouldn't be going to the
media with stories about WHA needing a sponsor at this
time.'
<P>

Jones:	`So you are prepared to run the risk.  This is very much out of
character and I am at a loss to understand the logic.'
<P>

Cawood:	`We will give you $1,000 and that's all.'
<P>

90   	Ms Cawood understood from speaking to Mr O'Neill or Ms
Passmore of Telecom that whilst no assurance could be given, Telecom
were
willing to discuss the question of sponsorship with the Defendant in 1995 if
the Defendant pursued sponsorship at that time
[Cawood T, 369 .45].  This was a
matter that Ms Cawood regarded as a matter of particular significance at the
time [Cawood T, 370
.35].
<P>

91   	The conversation is echoed by a letter of 20 December 1995
from Mrs Jones to Meg Wilson [PTB,  69].  In the course of that
letter, Mrs
Jones mentioned that the Plaintiffs had saved the Defendant some $2,500 out of
its budget allocated to the work of the
Plaintiffs.  There was never any
response to that assertion [Cawood T, 385 .47].  It appears, then, that strict
budgetary considerations
were not behind the refusal of the Defendant to afford
$3,000 towards the media campaign which further strengthens the inference
that
AWHA had reason to be confident that Telecom intended to renew its sponsorship
and had no wish to allow the Plaintiffs to be
involved in that anticipated
outcome.
<P>

92   	Despite not receiving the $3,000 fee, the Plaintiffs
formulated a media campaign strategy design to raise awareness of the
sponsorship opportunity available in the absence of Telecom.  The media
campaign was sent as an enclosure to a letter dated 4 November
1994 from the
Plaintiffs to Telecom.  Copies of the letter were sent to Mr O'Neill and to two
other officers of Telecom in higher
level positions than Mr O'Neill.
<P>

93   	Ms Cawood objected to the fact that the letter was copied
to Messrs Hinchcliffe and Denton, the two officers of Telecom Australia
senior
to Mr O'Neill [Cawood T, 379 .45]
<P>

94   	The possibility of a media strategy had already once been
raised with Mr O'Neill by the Second Plaintiff.  In a telephone
conversation of
19 October, Mrs Jones suggested that a campaign to find an alternative sponsor
in replacement of Telecom might reflect
badly upon Telecom [Jones para 59].
Although O'Neill maintains that such negative "fall out" was a source of
concern for himself
and Telecom [O'Neill T, 237 .15] it appears not to have
been sufficient to elicit a compromise proposal from Mr O'Neill with respect
to
the sponsorship proposal of 1994 [O'Neill T, 237-8].  During that conversation,
the Second Plaintiff said words to the effect:
<P>

"If you don't agree to the proposal we will have to go out into the marketplace
and find a new sponsor and, of course, tell the
media that Telstra won't renew
the sponsorship."
<P>

95   	The letter was not first submitted to the Defendant for
consideration.  On 10 November 1994 Ms Cawood telephoned the Second
Plaintiff
and remonstrated with her for sending the letter to Telecom without first
obtaining the approval of the Defendant.  Ms
Cawood, during that conversation
said words to the effect:
<P>

"I want to tell you that you are completely out of line in sending that letter
without first sending a copy to me"
<P>

In reply, Mrs Jones claimed, with I consider proper justification, that the
Defendant was preventing her from carrying out her contractual
obligations.
<P>

96   	The telephone conversation was followed by a facsimile of
14 November 1994 in which the President of the Defendant Meg Wilson
expressed
her disapproval of the behaviour of Mrs Jones and further communicated that the
Plaintiffs not pursue the planned media
strategy.  The facsimile read in
part:
<P>

"I refer to your letter addressed to Alan O'Neill, National Sponsorship
Manager, Telecom Australia dated 4 November 1994.  I must
express dismay at the
inappropriate action taken by you in submitting the letter to Alan O'Neill
worded in such a manner which is
unacceptable to Women's Hockey Australia.
<P>

... WHA does not wish you to pursue the media strategy."
<P>

97   	The letter of 14 November 1994 was signed by Meg Wilson.
Despite being disappointed with the fact that the 4 November letter
of the
Plaintiffs to Telecom was copied to Messrs Denton and Hinchcliffe, that
disappointment was itself not mentioned in the l4
November 1994 letter.
<P>

98   	The President of the Defendant, Ms Meg Wilson, explained
that facsimile in the following manner:
<P>

"I would not authorise a proposed media campaign as I believed that it created
a risk of adverse publicity in the media and the
possibility of a dispute with
Telecom with whom the [Defendant] still had a contract.  I believed that if the
Association was seen
to disparage its existing sponsor, no other sponsor was
likely to have anything to do with us."
<P>

99   	On receiving a further facsimile of 16 November 1994 from
the Plaintiffs asking for approval of the media release, Ms Cawood
testified
[BEC, para 45] that she was:
<P>

"very concerned that a media release in these terms would initiate press
speculation and comment on the relationship between AWHA
and Telecom.  I
thought that would be contrary to the best interests of AWHA and possible
contrary to the provisions of the existing
[1993 Telecom] agreement.
<P>

100   	Ms Cawood admitted, in cross-examination, that the press
release of 16 November contained nothing that invited unfavourable
speculation
on behalf of the press as to the good faith of either the Defendant or Telecom
[Cawood T, 373 .35].  Ms Cawood's reticence
with respect to the media release
strengthens the inference that she maintained the belief all along that the
sponsorship arrangement
with Telecom would be renewed.  She explained her
reluctance as arising from an apprehension that the media release might breach
provisions of the Telecom sponsorship agreement in existence at that time (that
is, the 1993 Telecom Agreement) [Cawood T, 374 .30].
<P>

101   	Ms Cawood admitted, however, that she believed that
Clause 8.3 of the Telecom agreement in force until late in 1994 did not
necessitate a total media ban.  Ms Cawood understood that the only prohibitions
existing under the 1994 agreement were that certain
material was not to be
published in a particular way.  Clause 8.3 reads:
<P>

8.3	In the event that there is no extension of the period of sponsorship by the
Sponsor, AWHA agrees that it shall not, at any time
in the future, say
anything, or cause anything to be said or published that in any way denigrates
the Sponsor or its officers or
calls into question any decisions of the Sponsor
in relation to this matter.   The rights and obligations of the parties under
this
clause 8.3 are continuing rights and obligations, separate and independent
from the other rights and obligations of the parties and
survive termination of
this Agreement.
<P>

102   	On reading the media release, Ms Cawood further admitted
that there was nothing within the media release proposed by the
Second
Plaintiff that denigrated Telecom nor that called into question any decision
made by Telecom or its officers [Cawood T, 375
.5].
<P>

103   	The motives behind opposition to the media ban are the
subject of a number of questions asked by Counsel for the Plaintiffs:
<P>

Q.	Didn't you speak to Mr O'Neill or Ms Passmore to find out if the media
release was distributed there as a problem with clause
8.3?
<P>

Cawood:	I can't recall
<P>

Q.	Wasn't that the occasion upon which you had the discussion that you have set
out in paragraph 46 of your affidavit?
<P>

Cawood:	No [Cawood T, 37 .20]
<P>

104   	Telecom, too, it seems was dissatisfied with the media
campaign proposed by the Second Plaintiff.  In a letter sent by fax
dated 17
November 1994 to Mrs Jones, Mr O'Neill wrote:
<P>

"Furthermore, I strongly suggest careful consideration of the ramifications of
releasing a media campaign strategy as I believe
the objectives and avenues you
have chosen do not meet with the standard Telecom Australia, but particularly
Women's Hockey Australia
deserves."
<P>

105   	Telecom's complaint with the media strategy was not in
relation to the description of the media campaign sent to Telecom
by letter of
4 November 1994.  Rather, Telecom was concerned that Mrs Jones would unduly
compromise the interests of Telecom.  In
particular, Mr O'Neill was concerned
about words said to him by Mrs Jones in an earlier conversation to the effect
of:
<P>

"You don't agree to the proposal, we will have to go out to the market place
and find a new sponsor and of course tell the media
that Telstra won't renew
the sponsorship" [O'Neill T, 251 .23]
<P>

106   	Mr O'Neill was concerned that Mrs Jones was going to
employ:
<P>

"A loaded gun approach.  In other words, if you don't do this then we will have
to go and tell the media how bad Telstra is and
who left Women's Hockey in the
lurch" [O'Neill T, 252 .1]
<P>

107   	This was despite the assurances of Mrs Jones, as
contained in a letter dated 4 November 1994 from Mrs Jones to Mr O'Neill,
that:
<P>

"Because Telecom remains the major sponsor of WHA until the end of December and
because we want to minimise any negative PR that
may emerge (you and I have
already discussed this and I confirm your sentiments that this is an inevitable
consequence of terminating
sponsorships), I want you to be fully informed as to
our sponsorship campaign strategy". [PTB, 51]
<P>

Attached to that letter was a copy of the media release as formulated by Mrs
Jones in an attempt to find a replacement major sponsor,
which was entirely
innocuous and perfectly justified, given Mrs Jones' understanding of the
Telecom sponsorship position.
<P>

<b>Representations by Telecom that the Door was Still Open</b>
<P>

108   	On 16 November 1994 [BEC, para 46] in the midst of the
Plaintiffs' seeking to find an alternative sponsor and acting on the
belief
that Telstra was uninterested at that stage, a conversation between Mr O'Neill
or Ms Passmore of Telecom and Ms Cawood took
place to the following effect:
<P>

"If [the Second Plaintiff] is unsuccessful in finding you a sponsor and you
don't have a sponsor by the end of the year you are
free to come back to us in
1995 and talk.  We can't give you any assurance but we would be happy to
discuss the matter with you again."
<P>

Ms Cawood was unable to explain the context in which this conversation took
place.  The timing of it, however, is at about the time
that Ms Jones was
proposing a media release and it ought to be inferred that that was most likely
the occasion for the conversation,
and that whatever was said between Ms Cawood
and Ms Passmore concerned that matter as well.  The result of the communication
must
have been:
<P>

(i)	on the part of Telecom, an expectation
<P>

(aa)	that Mrs Jones (who by denying her $3,000 to prepare an effective media
strategy) would be unlikely to find an alternative
sponsor, and
<P>

(bb)	that the Defendant would submit a proposal to Telecom in 1995;  and
<P>

(ii)	on the part of the Defendant, an expectation that if a proposal were
submitted in 1995 there would be an ability to consult
with Telstra regarding
the proposal, and to reach an agreement thereby on price.
<P>

109   	Mr O'Neill denied ever having such a conversation.  Ms
Passmore was uncertain whether she would have had that conversation
[Passmore
T, 274].  On the other hand, Ms Passmore admitted that she was, as of November
1994, willing to give consideration to a
proposal lodged by the Defendant in
1995 [Passmore T, 275 .1]. 
<P>

110   	While maintaining that the conversation quoted above did
take place, there is no evidence that Ms Cawood communicated that
knowledge to
Mrs Jones despite being of the opinion that it was information that was
important and should have been passed on to
the Plaintiffs as exclusive
marketing agents at that time [Cawood T, 378 .1].
<P>

111   	In December 1994 Ms Cawood appears to have had a second
relevant conversation.  Ms Cawood talked to Ms Passmore of Telecom
and
communicated to her a concern on the part of the Defendant that they did not
have a major sponsor lined up for 1995.  Ms Cawood
was concerned to ensure that
the prospect of Telecom Sponsorship in 1995 remained a viable one [Cawood T,
397 .45].  Ms Cawood understood
the effect of the conversation to be an
invitation on behalf of Telecom to recommence correspondence with a view to a
future sponsorship
arrangement [Cawood T, 397 .50].
<P>

112   	A letter to Mrs Jones of 17 November 1994 expressed a
belief on the part of Telecom that its first right of refusal continued
into
1995.  That letter read, relevantly:
<P>

"Discussions with Annamaree Pinner in June/July of this year advised Edmunds
Jones to submit a new proposal to Telecom to ensure
timeframe for negotiation
was satisfactory to both parties.  The proposal was received on 26 August
allowing us only four days for
review as our contract states a decision must be
made by 30 August.  As you are aware, Telecom's current contract with Women's
Hockey
Australia offers Telecom the opportunity to renew its sponsorship under
the same terms and conditions being offered to a prospective
sponsor.  The
timeframe that Edmunds Jones are now left with to seek prospective sponsors for
WHA cannot therefore, be attributed
to Telecom's decision not to further
elaborate on our sponsorship strategy."
<P>

113   	Furthermore, when asked whether he remained prepared to
consider further sponsorship of the Defendant after 17 November 1994
provided
the conditions of the sponsorship were appropriate, Mr O'Neill replied:
<P>

"Our contract had not expired, we were still able to review the situation along
two lines; if the funding was correct, or if they
had brought back a potential
sponsor who had paid whatever dollars, we would have first right of refusal.
We were still in negotiations
if you want to use that word." [O'Neill T, 252
.20]
<P>

114   	The Defendant held a further meeting on 19 and 20
November 1994 (PTB, 61).  Although only a few weeks remained before the
end of
the year and the end of Telecom sponsorship, not one word of report was,
apparently, made and, apparently, not one word of
discussion about that
ostensibly critical matter occurred.
<P>

115   	On 2 December 1994, Mrs Jones spoke to Ms Tye, and when
she asked whether there was any point in reporting on the sponsorship
campaign,
was told by Ms Tye:  "I prefer not to comment" [HEJ, para 55].  Although Mrs
Wilson comments on this conversation (in para
8 of her affidavit), she does not
challenge this account of it.  Ms Tye's response is only consistent with a lack
of any genuine
interest on the part of the Defendant of securing an alternative
sponsor prior to 31 December 1994.  This was hardly surprising,
given the
advice of Messrs Lane &amp; Lane to which reference has been made, and the
direct communication that had been taking place
between Ms Cawood and Telstra
but I infer, deliberately not reported by Ms Cawood to Mrs Jones.
<P>

116   	According to Ms Passmore, as the end of 1994 approached
she had a further conversation with Ms Cawood to the following effect:
<P>

Ms Cawood:	"We've got no sponsor for 1995 -- what are we going to do?  I am
very worried.  What sort of proposal would be acceptable
to Alan?"
<P>

Ms Passmore:	"I am trying to keep Alan on side.  He won't tell me what he's
looking for or what you should do.  If you're getting
desperate, he could try
another proposal but ask for less money."
<P>

See Ms Passmore's affidavit at para 13.  By no later than early January 1995,
this suggestion had been taken on board and Ms Cawood
had asked Ms Passmore to
assist in the formulation of an appropriate proposal:  see Ms Nixon's
affidavit, para 8.
<P>

117   	Mr O'Neill contended there was no sponsorship arrangement
between the end of 1994 and the commencement of the 1995 Telstra
agreement:
<P>

"By the end of 1994 as far as I was concerned the existing sponsorship
arrangement had come to an end and there was no further sponsorship
by Telecom
for AWHA.... Any further consideration of sponsorship by Telecom for AWHA
depended upon a new proposal which was commercially
realistic" [AEO, para
12]
<P>

"Between the expiry of the previous sponsorship agreement in 1994, and just
before I finished as the Sponsorship Project Manager,
there were no sponsorship
activities by Telecom in respect of Australian Women's Hockey Association which
I can recall.  My recollection
is that January and February were months during
which there were no events or functions for which Telecom provided assistance,
or
at which we displayed promotional material and sent representatives"
[Passmore 16/6/98 para 16]
<P>

No new logos (with "Telstra" on them rather than "Telecom") were made for new
uniforms nor was any organisation for  the 1995 hockey
season done by Telecom
during 1994 [Passmore 16/6/98 para 17-9].
<P>

On the other hand, revealingly in my opinion, Ms Passmore admitted that the
sponsorship file pertaining to Telecom's sponsorship
of the Defendant was never
filed in the offices of Telecom as a lapsed sponsorship arrangement [Passmore
T, 285 .35].
<P>

118   	No less significantly, Ms Cawood could not remember any
occasion during late 1994 at which she met with other members of
the Defendant
to discuss a plan of action should the Plaintiffs be unable to secure
sponsorship before the end of the 1994 Consultancy
Agreement [Cawood T, 396
.50]
<P>

119   	But if Telecom sponsorship had ceased, there is no
reference to the sponsorship being other than continuous in recent publicity
for what were termed "Tenth Anniversary Documents" (PX10).
<P>

<b>1995 Sponsorship Proposal</b>
<P>

120   	In early January 1995, swiftly after the expiration of
the First Plaintiff's consultancy arrangements, Ms Cawood told Ms
Nixon of the
Defendant that Ms Passmore of Telecom had offered to advise the Defendant on
what to put in a proposal to Telecom with
regard to sponsorship in 1995 [Cawood
T, 398 .40].  Ms Cawood spoke to Ms Passmore at that time to discuss what
assistance she might
provide in submitting a further proposal for sponsorship
to Telecom [Cawood T, 400 .55].
<P>

121   	By 23 January 1995, the Defendant and Telecom had
arranged a meeting to discuss further Telecom sponsorship. Notes made in
preparation for the meeting describe the purpose of the meeting as "sponsorship
renewal" and refer to the "Re-launch of Telecom sponsorship".
 
<P>

122   	The purpose of the meeting was said to be to assist the
Defendant in formulating a proposal that would be acceptable to Telecom
and, in
particular to Mr O'Neill [Passmore T, 276].  A similar meeting was not convened
in relation to the 1994 proposal [Passmore
T, 277 .25].  Ms Passmore, at the
meeting of 23 January 1995 suggested that the Defendant should incorporate
certain messages, the
content of which Telecom wished to convey to the media as
part of its corporate image.
<P>

123   	A new proposal was submitted to Telecom by the Defendant
on or about 3 February 1995 [ECN, 3].  It is certainly not an outline
of a
contract, but mainly consists of the lengthy calendar of future hockey events
with identification of advertising opportunity.
 The only "contractual" aspect
of the proposal was that it envisaged a total sponsorship of $570,000 broken up
into a sum of $270,000
for 1995 and $300,000 for 1996.  The date of the
proposal is uncertain.  But certainly by early February a draft sponsorship
agreement
had been brought into existence between the Defendant and Telstra
Corporation Limited (Telstra) dated 1 February 1995 and contained
these figures
for year 1 and year 2; PTB, 75.  It is my conclusion that though the agreement
was not finalised till later, commercial
agreement on its essential terms had
been reached.
<P>

124   	Significantly, no proposal was submitted by the Defendant
to any potential sponsor other than Telecom then, earlier, or later.
[Wilson T,
312]
<P>

125   	In about February 1995 Telstra produced a post evaluation
document of the WHA and Telstra sponsorship:
<P>

"December 1994 saw the departure of WHA's marketing promotions agency, which
now provides for easier channels of communication between
the sponsor and WHA.
Hence, WHA have prepared their proposal and wish to deal directly with Telecom
Australia in the hope of securing
a new partnership". (PTB, 79)
<P>

126   	On 4 and 5 February 1995 AWHA held its board meeting and
the following was resolved:
<P>

"4.4.2	The Board agreed not to appoint a Marketing Consultant at this stage but
review the actual needs of WHA on an event by event
basis.
<P>

4.4.3	After consultation with the NED and PL Tye, Ellie Nixon has prepared a
submission for future sponsorship of WHA".  (PTB, 81).
<P>

127   	In a letter dated 10 February 1995 AWHA advised Helen
Jones that her application to act as marketing consultant for WHA had
been
rejected (PTB, 83).
<P>

128   	In a facsimile dated 21 February 1995 from Ellie Nixon of
AWHA to Maria Buchland of Telecom providing information on players
and results,
AWHA stated that: 
<P>

"Can't stress enough that he cannot mention anything about the future".  (PTB,
85)
<P>

129   	By facsimile dated 21 February 1995 from Maria Buckland
of Telecom to Ted Taylor, CEO representative for Telecom at the Four
Nations
Tournament in Tasmania the following directive is given:
<P>

"As we have not yet signed a new sponsorship agreement with Australian Women's
Hockey Association, I must stress it is important
not mention anything
regarding any future sponsorship plans.  Something to the effect that Telecom
Australia has sponsored the Telecom
Hockeyroos since 1989 and is proud of their
many achievements which are ....(info sheet) attached.  We're looking forward
to the
series _best of luck, Telecom Hockeyroos (PTB, 86).
<P>

130   	In the process of drafting the final agreement, a
facsimile was sent by Ms Cawood to Telecom as a result of legal advice
from the
Defendant's solicitors [Cawood T, 408 .6].  The facsimile of 8 March 1995
contained the following revealing words:
<P>

"The proposed contract is generic and it is suggested that it should be
re-jigged so that it does not look like any previous contract
- change the form
of the agreement - one of the suggested changes is:
<P>

`Negotiations were carried out in 1994 with respect to a new agreement from
which Telecom determined not to enter into a new agreement.
 Subsequently a new
proposal a copy of which is annexed, was submitted by WHA and after
<i>extensive negotiations a new agreement</i> was concluded on the terms and
conditions contained in this agreement."   [my emphasis]
<P>

The above suggested change related to recital C.
<P>

By `re-jig', Ms Cawood says she intended to convey that the contract should be
reworded according to the legal advice she had earlier
received [Cawood T, 408
.38].  A further change was suggested in a facsimile of 8 March 1995.  Recital
D would be changed to read:
<P>

"The <i>Sponsor</i> and the <i>Sponsored Party</i> have agreed to the
<i>new</i> proposal and as a consequence the Sponsor shall become the principal
sponsor, etc. etc..."   [my emphasis]
<P>

131   	Ms Cawood reluctantly admitted that she was, in
requesting the rewording of the proposed contract, in receipt of advice from
Michelle Wearn of Lane &amp; Lane about the form of the contract (T, 408
.6-.10).  She admitted again only after many questions that
she wanted to avoid
the 1995 Telecom agreement having the appearance of being a renewal within the
meaning of the 1994 Consultancy
Agreement [Cawood T, 409 .45-150].  Her
evidence is revealing:
<P>

Q.	Was one of the things you were wanting to avoid in the drafting of the new
agreement with Telecom the appearance of the agreement
being a renewal?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

She then acknowledged that "It was on the advice of the legal people" (T, 409
.57), having earlier been referred also to the letter
of advice from Lane &amp;
Lane of 19 October 1994 (PX6).  She admitted to having read that advice as to
"what might happen in terms
of an obligation to pay a fee to Mrs Jones if there
was a renewal" (T, 409 .40-.45).
<P>

132   	Telecom Australia, (Maria Backlund) consented to the
re-wording of the contract in a facsimile also dated 8 March 1995:
<P>

"It is acceptable that [the Defendant's solicitors] draw up a suitable
Sponsorship Agreement whilst keeping in mind the essence
of Telecom's generic
Sponsorship Agreement document, or, alternatively, work with ... our legal
counsel, to do same.
<P>

I have spoken to [our legal counsel] and briefed him on the situation, both
past and present.  He is expecting a call from [your
solicitor] to determine
the best course of action." [PTB, 94]
<P>

133   	Mr O'Neill, in cross-examination asserted that some
negotiation did take place with regard to the 1995 proposal [O'Neill
T, 257
.5].  This was the normal practice at that time [O'Neill T, 258 .20].  However,
Mr O'Neill was not part of the `build-up exercise'
and could not agree or
disagree with the proposition that there were no extensive negotiations at that
time [O'Neill T, 259 .15].
 Mr O'Neill was "definitely not aware of any
extensive negotiations" [O'Neill T, 259 .25]. Mr O'Neill testified that the
negotiations
with the Plaintiffs did extend from June until December and that
as such, they were `extensive'. [O'Neill T, 261 .35]  That assertion
is not
consistent with the evidence.
<P>

134   	Recital "C" of the 1995 Telstra Agreement states:
<P>

"C.	As part of the extensive negotiations mentioned in Recital B, AWHA agreed
to comply with the reasonable requirements of Telecom
concerning its proposed
new corporate identity implementation plan."
<P>

135   	It appears, in fact that the negotiations were far from
`extensive'.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs, in cross-examination of
Ms Cawood put
it thus:
<P>

Q.	So far as the 1995 sponsorship was concerned is all that happened this:
First you spoke to Miss Passmore and she agreed to come
and have a meeting,
that was the first thing that happened, is that right?
<P>

A.	To the best of my recollection
<P>

Q.	Secondly, there was a discussion at the meeting about what could usefully be
put in a sponsorship proposal?
<P>

A.	To the best of my recollection.
<P>

Q.	The third thing that happened was that that information was taken and used
to put in a  new proposal for sponsorship to be presented
to Telecom?
<P>

A.	As far as I can recall.
<P>

Q.	Shortly after the receipt of the proposal by Telecom you learned that
Telecom approved the further sponsorship?
<P>

A.	I can't recall.
<P>

Q.	I suggest to you the next thing that happened after the submission of the
proposal was you learned that it was accepted?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	There wasn't any extensive negotiation was there in 1995 about getting that
sponsorship from Telecom for 1995?
<P>

A.	I can't recall. [Cawood T, 406 .25]
<P>

136   	After considerable further questioning on the matter, Ms
Cawood belatedly admitted that it was not proper to refer to the
1995 Telecom
Agreement as being the result of `extensive negotiations' [Cawood T, 411 .55].
Ms Cawood could not then proffer any
reason why the recitals to the 1995
Telecom agreement referred to extensive negotiations [Cawood T, 412].  None of
this evidence
did anything to assist her credibility as a witness.
<P>

137   	A further draft of the Telecom Sponsorship agreement was
then faxed on 21 March 1995 by Simon Tan of Telecom to the solicitors
of the
Defendant.  Obligingly the accompanying letter pointed out that "I have
structured the agreement as "a new agreement between
the parties".  He
reiterated the notion of a renegotiated agreement arising from a "new" proposal
when he then adds;  "The draft
contemplates a proposal prepared by AWHA.
Please send me a copy of the proposal for inclusion in the final agreement"
(PTB, 102).
 
<P>

138   	That this was really a facade is evident from the fact
that the draft agreement was successfully drafted with <i>no such prior
proposal</i>.  All of this supports the inference that both sides were
co-operating to "dress-up" the agreement as a new agreement based on a
supposedly "new" AWHA proposal, rather than what it really was, that is a
renewal of the past sponsorship on "generic" Telecom terms
with a relatively
modest increase in sponsorship amounts.  Thus comparing the 1993 Telstra
Agreement entered 15 February 1993 (BEC,
139), to this draft they are not
markedly different.  There are updating changes, a self-serving recital B,
quoted below and the
amounts for 30 June 1993 and 1994 were $200,000 each, as
against $270,000 on signing and then $300,000 paid on the Agreement's first
anniversary.  Recital B provides:
<P>

"B.	The parties entered into a sponsorship agreement dated 15 February 1993
under which, inter alia, Telecom reserved the right
to extend or renew its
sponsorship of AWHA.  After extensive negotiations did not result in a renewal
or extension of the earlier
sponsorship, AWHA submitted a proposal to Telecom
(a copy of which is attached) which forms the basis of this agreement."
<P>

139   	In reality the negotiations were not at all extensive and
the proposal does little more, so far as the substance of the new
contract is
concerned, than stipulate the two annual money amounts.
<P>

140   	In anticipation of the soon to be executed Telecom
sponsorship, an AWHA press release of 22 March 1995 referred to the "Telstra"
Hockeyroos and "Telstra Four Nations Tournament".
<P>

141   	The Telecom sponsorship of the Defendant was officially
launched on 27 March 1995.  That launch was not recalled by Ms Tye,
Chair of
the Marketing and Promotions Policies Committee of the Defendant in 1994 [Tye
T, 175 .1].
<P>

142   	Shortly afterward, on 6 April 1995, a Marketing and
Promotion Committee report to the Council of the Defendant read in what
I again
consider a self-serving fashion:
<P>

"success was due to the preparation of the proposal and its presentation to
Telstra.  This was the result of in-house preparation
totally.  The sponsorship
is an entirely new negotiation"
<P>

Minutes of a later meeting of the Board of the Defendant (21 May 1995) further
refer to "in-house preparation":
<P>

"Sponsorship - Given Edmunds-Jones' unsuccessful approach for sponsorship from
Telecom, the new Telstra sponsorship was achieved
through in-house preparation.
Any future minor sponsorship to be determined on an individual basis."  (PTB,
128)
<P>

143   	Ms Cawood believed that the sponsorship proposal
submitted to Telstra in early 1995 was what was meant by "in-house" preparation
[Cawood T, 436 .50]
<P>

144   	The 1995 Telstra agreement was executed on 5 May 1995.
The agreement was for the term of the years 1995 and 1996.  Recital
B of the
1995 Agreement which I have quoted above  repeats the earlier draft.
<P>

<b>Mrs Jones' Credit</b>
<P>

145   	Before dealing with certain factual findings which should
be made, I need to deal briefly with the attacks on her credit.
<P>

146   	First, it is asserted in para 4.4 of the Defendant's
written submissions that Mrs Jones "did not herself believe the sponsorship
to
be worth anything more than $300,000 per annum".  Reliance is placed upon the
letters of 18 November 1994 and 20 December 1994
(PTB, 59 and 69).  The letter
of 18 November 1994 states (in the third paragraph relied upon by the
Defendant) that:
<P>

"It was important to my plans in seeking a sponsor for WHA to have the
expenditure of $3,000 approved.  However, your later advice
to me that the
request is refused and I must make do with $1,000 hardly seems indicative of an
organisation seriously seeking a sponsorship
in the vicinity of $2M over the
next six years."
<P>

147   	The Defendant did not cross-examine Mrs Jones on how the
figure of $2MK to be inserted in the paragraph. In particular it
was never put
to Mrs Jones that her subjective belief was that that was all the Defendant was
worth by way of sponsorship.  In any
event, it is apparent from other parts of
the letter that Mrs Jones entertained a subjective belief that much more should
be asked
for.  On the second page of the letter dated 18 November 1994 Mrs
Jones wrote:  
<P>

"In presenting to prospective sponsors and listening to the opinions of others,
including Alan O'Neill (who said that $600,000 a
year was too cheap for what
WHA is offering), I have reviewed the asking price.  Unless WHA has any
objections, I'll be seeking an
increased figure of $800,000 per year for a
period of six years.  This is still (I believe) $200,000 a year less than Optus
is paying
for athletics, so I think the Womens Hockey package is worthy of this
amount, even if on the conservative side.  Should you have
any objection to the
seeking a total figure of $4.8M for WHA, you may want to revise before any
meeting which are anticipated for
next week."
<P>

148   	The letter of 20 November 1994 stated in para 2 (the
paragraph relied upon by the Defendant) that:
<P>

"We sought $3,000 which you say that WHA could not afford.  Are you aware that
at the same time of this refusal, we had by means
of a similar sponsorship
arrangement, saved WHA $2,500 out of its approved expenditure budget allocated
to purchase presentation
gifts for the World Cup Team?  This saving was
generated by "marketing" through a Prouds' sponsorship.  Surely it would be
reasonable
to use these savings to assist "marketing" to generate major
sponsorship, which realistically could mean close to $2M to your organisation
over the next six years!"
<P>

149   	Again, how the figure of $2M referred to in that
paragraph was derived was not explored in cross-examination.  It was never
put
to Mr &amp; Mrs Jones that her subjective belief was that $2M was all that the
Defendant was worth. For all one knows, the $2M
could have represented the net
benefit after various expenses had been defrayed out of sponsorship funds.  Or
it could be that this
more closely represented the Defendant's own estimate of
what they thought they could get by way of sponsorship, though Mrs Jones
thought the figure of $800,000 per year should be sought.  It is hardly to be
thought that if Mrs Jones truly believed that the Defendant
was only worth
about $300,000 per year sponsorship, and that was all she could realistically
ask, that, given her own commercial
interests, she would not have communicated
such a view to Mr O'Neill in an attempt to renew the Telstra sponsorship,
though it was
evident Mr O'Neill was not encouraging negotiations.
<P>

150   	The Defendant's submissions also assert that the
statement made by Mrs Jones in the letter of 18 November 1994 to the effect
that Mr O'Neill had "said that $600,000 a year was too cheap for what WHA is
offering" was clearly false;  see para 4.5 of the Defendant's
written
submissions.  Mrs Jones gave evidence of this conversation;  see HEJ, para 42
in particular page 13.8.  She was not cross-examined
about it.  Mr O'Neill put
on an affidavit subsequently to Mrs Jones first affidavit.  It is clear from
the quoted conversation that
Mrs Jones was led to believe by Mr O'Neill that
"you must have plenty of sponsors who would take it for $600,000 -- haven't
you"
and "it's worth the money and the women deserve it".  That comes close to
saying that if anything $600,000 was too cheap if there
were plenty of sponsors
willing to offer that amount.  Certainly it is not in any substantive sense
markedly different from Mr O'Neill
was saying.
<P>

151   	Next it is asserted (in para 4.9 of the Defendant's
written submissions) that Mrs Jones employed "the tactic of veiled threat"
by
making a reference to the negative publicity that would undoubtedly follow the
Defendant seeking a new sponsor.  The implication
from the word "veiled" is
that while the words may have been innocuous, they would reasonably have been
understood in quite a different
sense as a threat.  But no such proposition was
ever put to Mrs Jones in cross-examination.  Although Mr O'Neill made reference
to
this aspect of the conversation in his affidavit (AEO, para 10) he did not
suggest that the words were to be understood other than
in their ordinary
sense.
<P>

152   	Then it was suggested that in the conversation Mrs Jones
"resorted to the ploy of deceit";  a proposition again not put to
Mrs Jones in
cross-examination as elementary fairness would have required.  She was said to
have so resorted the ploy of deceit by
using these words:  "I realise this is a
big jump, but I've been under a lot of pressure from the coaching staff saying
that I am
selling the sport off too cheap.  You know, WHA can't really afford
this sponsorship at $200,000 as it's costing them too much".
<P>

153   	The bases upon which it is said that this statement was
deceitful seemed to be:
<P>

(a)	The absence of any evidence being adduced by the Plaintiffs of the factual
foundation for it, and
<P>

(b)	Ms Cawood's view that the $650,000 was "a bit high".
<P>

154   	As to the former, there was no issue raised in the
proceedings and has been none since which required Mrs Jones to justify
the
statement.  The Defendant could have adduced evidence of contrary facts,
subject to an argument about the width of the pleadings,
if the facts were
thought to be relevant.  It chose not to do so. Mrs Jones was not
cross-examined on the proposition that she lacked
any adequate factual
foundation for the statement.  Ms Cawood's reservation about the price being "a
bit high" is not inconsistent
with the statement that the coaching staff
thought that the sport was being sold off too cheap.  Clearly, the ultimate
level of sponsorship
must be a matter of opinion, in which there is room for
legitimate difference.  Certainly there was no basis for the Defendant to
have
asserted that the statement about pressure from coaching staff was deliberately
false.
<P>

155   	It is next alleged (in para 4.11 of the Defendant's
written submissions) that Mrs Jones repeated "her veiled threat" to Mr
O'Neill
by writing to him on 3 November 1994.  That letter enclosed the planned media
campaign.  Mr O'Neill was asked about the detail
of that media campaign (T, 244
.10 - 246 .22).  Mr O'Neill's only complaint seemed to be that the statement
that Telstra doubled
its return on investment was untrue because the return on
investment was unquantifiable (T, 245 .25 - .41).  The letter did no more
than
the conversation that preceded it between Mrs Jones and Mr O'Neill.  Mrs Jones
was again not cross-examined to suggest that
she had made any veiled threat in
the letter, and Mr O'Neill gave no evidence that he understood what was in the
letter to be a veiled
threat.
<P>

156   	Next the Defendant (para 4.12 of its written submissions)
deals with Mrs Jones' statement (made to Ms Cawood) that she knew
what Mr
O'Neill's agenda was.  The Defendant called that "dissembling", because the
reference to "our current strategy" was not understood.
 Once again this is a
matter upon which Mrs Jones was not cross-examined.  Moreover it overlooks
entirely the context of the conversation.
 Mrs Jones' account of the
conversation is given in her affidavit;  HEJ, 50.  Mrs Jones said, in the very
same conversation, to Ms
Cawood: 
<P>

"I think that you all (WHA and Telecom) know exactly what's going on and I'm
the only one doing the guess work."
<P>

157   	In other words, the agenda that Mrs Jones was referring
to in the conversation of 10 November 1994 was rather an agenda involving
co-operation between Telstra and the Defendant to the exclusion of the
Plaintiffs.  I agree with the Plaintiffs that it is quite
wrong to read into
Mrs Jones' reference to "Alan O'Neill's agenda" any actual knowledge exclusive
to Mrs Jones and unknown to the
Defendant, which she was bound, as a fiduciary,
to impart.  The conversation suggests that Mrs Jones was drawing on inference.
Indeed,
if anyone was in the dark, it was she, not the Defendant.  Indeed, she
referred subsequently, in the same conversation, to a demand
by Ms Cawood that
she "disclose (her) assumptions regarding O'Neill's agenda".  She declined to
do this on the basis that she had
"no hard facts to back it up".
<P>

158   	Finally, it is alleged (at para 4.15 of the Defendant's
written submissions) that the statement in the letter of 18 November
1994 that
Mr O'Neill had said "$600,000 was too cheap" was "obviously fictitious".  I
have dealt with that aspect already, but I
need to deal with the further
assertion that this statement was "not related by her in her evidence".  It was
indeed related in para
42 of Mrs Jones' affidavit of 21 May 1996 at page 13.8.
It is also falsely asserted that Mr O'Neill was not challenged in
cross-examination
about it.  Indeed he was;  see Mr O'Neill's cross-examination
at T, 235 .10.  Mr O'Neill's only response was that he could not remember.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

159   	It will be apparent that the Defendant chose in written
submissions to attack Mrs Jones' credit on grounds which were never
put to her
in cross-examination and which on examination of the evidence had no proper
foundation.  One could hardly find a clearer
contravention of the rule in
<i>Browne v Dunn</i> (1894) 6 R 67 (HL), grounded as it is in requirements of
fairness, as Hunt J explains:  <i>Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 1</a> at 22-3.  The Defendant did not
assist its case in its written reply by ignoring the Plaintiffs' detailed
response, and simply observing
"gallantry may be laudable but cannot disguise
untruths".  In my judgment the attack on Mrs Jones' credit was both unfair and
ill-founded.
 It provided no basis for the claim, dealt with below, of breach
by Mrs Jones of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement.
<P>

<b>The alleged failure to act in a professional and businesslike fashion and to
"maintain and enhance the image of the Defendant and
women's hockey
generally".</b>
<P>

160   	The earlier question of Mrs Jones' credit is not
unconnected to what is here said about Mrs Jones being allegedly in
contravention
of clause 3, requiring that she "implement in a professional and
businesslike fashion all the duties specified in the Consultancy
Brief annexed
hereto ...." and which in turn in para C requires Mrs Jones to "maintain and
enhance the image of the Association and
women's hockey generally...".
<P>

161   	I deal here only with the factual issues concerning the
conduct of Mrs Jones relied upon by the Defendant and not with whether
non-compliance with these obligations could be such as to disentitle the First
Plaintiff to commission or fees by reason of such
compliance being a condition
precedent to any entitlement.
<P>

162   	The particulars relied upon in relation to either
complaint are identical and are first set out in the Defendant's particulars
at
para 37 of the Defence to Amended Statement of Claim.  Essentially, the
Defendant's contention is that the Plaintiffs in communications
with Telstra
foreshadowed a publicity campaign which would be adverse to the interests and
reputation of Telstra, doing so by a communication
made orally, namely the
conversation between Mrs Jones and Mr O'Neill on 19 October 1994 (HEJ, para 42)
and in writing by letter
dated 3 November 1994 (Annexure "BB" to this
affidavit).
<P>

163   	Then at para 40 of the Defence, it is pleaded that the
letter of 3 November 1994, the references to a publicity campaign
and/or the
media campaign strategy sent to Telstra under cover of the letter of 3 November
1994 were calculated to and/or were likely
to 
<P>

(i)	cause embarrassment to Telstra and its national sponsorship manager, 
<P>

(ii)	create the impression that the Defendant was threatening Telstra with a
publicity campaign and/or adverse publicity,
<P>

(iii)	prejudice the Defendant in obtaining a national sponsor, 
<P>

(iv)	adversely affect the reputation of the Defendant with Telstra, major
companies and prospective sponsors, 
<P>

(v)	cause the Defendant to be regarded as an unworthy beneficiary of
sponsorship, 
<P>

(vi)	create the impression that the Defendant was an organisation that would
criticise or bring adverse publicity upon its sponsor,

<P>

(vii)	lead to the speculation over the reasons why Telstra no longer supported
the Defendant which would reflect adversely upon
the Defendant and/or Telstra,

<P>

(viii)	be contrary to the best interests of the Defendant, 
<P>

(ix)	imply, wrongly, that Telstra had acted unfairly or dishonourably in
failing to enter into a further sponsorship agreement and,
finally, 
<P>

(x)	imply, wrongly, that Telstra had refused to provide any further or any
reasonable level of sponsorship to the Defendant.
<P>

164   	The letter of 3 November 1994 (PTB, 51) was the subject
of some cross-examination.  A copy of the letter was sent by Mrs
Jones to Ms
Cawood, Ms Wilson and Ms Tye.  Ms Cawood and Ms Wilson were cross-examined
about the letter;  T, 367 to 383.  Ms Cawood
stated that:
<P>

(a)	the words in the letter of 3 November which were unacceptable were the
words: "We would urge you to consider all the ramifications
of this decision on
Telecom's impressive image in sport and particularly among the Olympic
fraternity and not overlooking the disappointment
of the players and the
coaching staff" (T, 379 .40);
<P>

(b)	she was concerned that the letter had been copied to Rod Hinchcliffe and
David Denton (T, 379 .46) at Telstra;
<P>

(c)	the only thing which was unacceptable to the Association about the copying
of the letter to Mr Hinchcliffe and Mr Denton was
that there was no need for
them to be notified (T, 381-2 .5), although they were persons who had had
previous association with the
Defendant (T, 381-2 .15);
<P>

(d)	she signed a letter on 14 November 1994 to Mrs Jones (PTB, 55) which covers
all matters which she thought it appropriate to
complain about in respect of
the letter of 3 November (T, 381 .26);
<P>

(e)	yet the letter signed by Ms Cawood made no complaint in respect of the
letter of 3 November being copied either to Mr Hinchcliffe
or Mr Denton (T, 383
.35);
<P>

(f)	she was unable to suggest any ramification which might have been being
alluded to by Mrs Jones in the letter (T, 380 .40) other
than those conveyed by
the following words:
<P>

"Because Telecom remains the major sponsor of WHA until the end of December and
because we want to minimise any negative PR that
may emerge (you and I have
already discussed this and I confirm your sentiments that this is an inevitable
consequence of terminating
sponsorships).  I want you to be fully informed as
to our sponsorship campaign strategy."
<P>

(g)	the word "ramification" which had been used by Mrs Jones was unacceptable
because it "led to an unknown situation, I suppose"
(T, 380 .1), but she was
unable to say what was unacceptable about that to the Defendant (T, 380 .8).
<P>

Ms Wilson was cross-examined about the letter (T, 305-308).  When asked what
was unacceptable about the letter, she answered (T,
307 .22):
<P>

"I didn't view this letter in the light of a word unacceptable, I viewed this
letter telling us what Mrs Jones was doing in connection
with that reply."
<P>

Ms Tye gave no evidence of having any concern about the letter.
<P>

165   	Mrs Jones was cross-examined about the letter of 3
November (T, 150-161).  It was not put to her directly that the letter
was
unprofessional or unbusinesslike or one which failed to maintain and enhance
the image of the Defendant.  Mrs Jones was, however,
asked about her reason for
copying the letter to Mr Hinchcliffe and Mr Denton.  She said (T, 155 .5):
<P>

"I did it because I believed, and still do believe, that it was Mr Rod
Hinchcliffe that was responsible for approving the original
sponsorship and
that as Edmunds-Jones did work separately for Telecom and not always on behalf
of women's hockey, that, as I said
in my letter, it was a courtesy to let him
know that we had to adopt my immediate strategy as part of our search for new
sponsorship,
and to let him know it would be handled sensitively to avoid any
negative PR for Telstra, whom I valued as a client."
<P>

166   	Even if the copying may have been intended also to put
some pressure on Mr O'Neill, that could be considered a commercial
leverage
that Mrs Jones reasonably might bring to bear in the Defendant's interests.
The evidence manifestly fails to demonstrate
that in writing the letter of 3
November the Plaintiffs acted otherwise than in a professional and businesslike
fashion.
<P>

167   	The conversation between Mrs Jones and Mr O'Neill which
is complained of is set out in para 42 of Mrs Jones affidavit of
21 May 1996.
The particulars do not identify of which particular aspect of this conversation
complaint is made.  Neither Ms Cawood,
Ms Wilson nor Ms Tye sought, in their
affidavits or otherwise, to explain why, from the Defendant's perspective, the
conversation
between Mrs Jones and Mr O'Neill contained any communication which
was unprofessional or unbusinesslike.  The conversation preceded
the letter of
3 November 1994.  It contained similar sentiments to those expressed in the
letter.  Mrs Jones, for example, said:
<P>

"I see, you want us to test the market for you -- but what about the negative
PR that campaign for a new sponsor will create for
Telecom?  I can hear
companies (some being your business partners) saying -- Telecom has dumped its
Hockeyroo team -- why?"
<P>

168   	Mr O'Neill's account of what appears to be the same
conversation (see para 9 of his affidavit) contained similar words:
<P>

"If you don't agree to the proposal we will have to go out into the market
place and find a new sponsor and, of course, tell the
media that Telstra won't
renew the sponsorship."
<P>

169   	Mr O'Neill agreed that there was nothing remarkable about
the Defendant going to the market place to find a new sponsor (T,
251 .35),
that it would be obvious from such a course to anyone with knowledge of the
sport that Telstra had not renewed the sponsorship
(T, 251 .40), and that if
all that Mrs Jones said was to the effect that Telstra would not renew the
sponsorship, such conduct was
unremarkable and unobjectionable (T, 252 .15).
In other words, what both Mrs Jones and Mr O'Neill recalled in their affidavits
as
to this conversation were statements by Mrs Jones which were perfectly
appropriate.
<P>

170   	That Telstra later only increased the sponsorship amount,
to a little under half what was sought -- though still substantially
up from
$200,000 to $270,000 and then $300,000 -- may have been the result of the
Defendant's fear of losing Telstra and thus choosing
not to test the market and
thus Telstra.  It does not follow that Mrs Jones' tactics were wrong.  Nor does
it follow that, even if
they were wrong, she was thereby in breach of her
obligations in what was essentially a judgment call where reasonable minds
might
differ.  That Telstra regarded Women's Hockey as a minor sponsorship
compared say to swimming or the Olympic Games (T, 237 .51-.57
and T, 263
.55-264 .5) does not mean that the market if invited would not have paid
substantially more -- with Telstra having strong
incentive then to exercise its
right of last refusal to meet the market.  This is particularly in light of
enhanced successes in
international competition of women's hockey and its clear
Olympic potential.  Finally, who is to say that asking for more was not
a
rational strategy, even an obligation on the Plaintiffs in doing their job, on
the basis that if you don't ask, you don't get.
 Even if less than the $600,000
was ultimately achieved, certainly a substantial increase <i>was</i> achieved
even without testing the market. 
<P>

<b><i>Summing Up</i></b>
<P>

171   	Accordingly, even if it were a condition precedent to any
relevant entitlement to commission that the Plaintiffs act in a
professional
and businesslike fashion, the evidence does not demonstrate that the Plaintiffs
acted otherwise.  Likewise, there was
no failure to "maintain and enhance the
image of the Defendant and women's hockey generally".  The assertions to the
contrary, insofar
as they go beyond the pleaded particulars, are not open for
the Defendant to rely upon;  see the Defendant's written submissions,
paras
5.1.1 to 5.1.10.  But in any event, they were in the main unsubstantiated and
unfair.  Thus that "she lied to the defendant"
(para 5.1.9) refers to the
earlier matters going to credit where the Defendant has failed to substantiate
its attack.  Or else the
Defendant merely repeats what is in the particulars in
more florid language (para 5.1.6) ("she employed negotiating tactics of (at
least) doubtful respectability namely threats and falsehood") but with no
proper basis made out for allegations of such seriousness.
 Or else indulges in
argumentative assertion (e.g. 5.1.2) ("she formulated a proposal that the
sponsorship fee be increased to $650,000
per annum which was inherently and
obviously unrealistic and altogether lacked any commercial justification").
Use of the word "obviously"
does not convert assertion to self-evident fact.

<P>

172   	I turn now to whether there was a common expectation that
Telstra would provide sponsorship for 1995 to the Defendant.  This
is a
question anterior to characterising the outcome for the purposes of the 1994
Sponsorship Agreement as either a subsequent year
of sponsorship (clause 4(b))
or a renewal of sponsorship (clause 4(c)).
<P>

<b><i>Expectation of 1995 Telstra agreement -- Evidence</i></b>
<P>

173   	The cumulative effect of the foregoing evidence, assessed
below, is to justify the findings which follow concerning the joint
expectation
of Telstra and the Defendant as to renewal of the 1994 Telstra agreement.
First, the evidence:
<P>

(a)	the Defendant and Telstra both understood that communications about
sponsorship for 1995 (to the extent that they were engaged
in in 1994) were
primarily communications between Telstra on the one hand and the Plaintiffs on
the other hand;  Mrs Jones was the
primary point of contact but was not kept
fully informed of direct contact between Defendant and Telstra.
<P>

(b)	Ms Cawood spoke directly -- probably to Ms Passmore -- and was informed
prior to or contemporaneously with the receipt of the
letter of rejection dated
13 October 1994 by Mrs Jones that:
<P>

"The amounts being sought in the submission are too high" 
<P>

but did not inform Mrs Jones (BEC, para 40).
<P>

(c)	According to both Ms Passmore and Mr O'Neill the submission prepared by the
Plaintiffs was seen by Mr O'Neill in or about August
1994, and he immediately
conveyed his view about the level of sponsorship being sought to Ms Passmore.
It seems, in those circumstances,
inherently likely that Ms Cawood learned in
advance of the letter of 13 October 1994 that the proposal was likely to be
rejected
because the level of sponsorship being sought was viewed by Telstra as
too high.
<P>

(d)	In October 1994 the Defendant sought advice from Messrs Lane &amp; Lane as
to the obligations that the Defendant might be exposed
to if the Telecom
sponsorship was renewed during 1994, and how those obligations might differ if
no renewal took place on or prior
to 31 December 1994.  Ms Cawood was unable to
explain the circumstances in which such advice was sought, and could give no
clear
evidence as to whom it was shown when received, and what any discussion
was about it.
<P>

(e)	The letter of rejection from Telstra was dated 13 October 1994 -- that is,
several weeks after the submission by Mrs Jones of
the sponsorship proposal to
Telstra.  No explanation is provided in the evidence for this period of delay.
Mr O'Neill had made his
view clear to the Defendant directly that it was simply
a matter of price but much less informatively in his letter of 13 October
1994
with its generalised reference to "current content and funding requirements".
That view was not communicated prior to dispatch
of the letter by either Mr
O'Neill or Ms Passmore to Ms Jones.  It appears that Mr O'Neill did not say
anything to Ms Passmore at
the time that could reasonably have led her to think
that the matter might be favourably considered by him in the absence of some
change in the level of sponsorship being sought.
<P>

(f)	Although Mr O'Neill gave evidence that the letter dated 13 October 1994 was
in a standard form (T, 233 .30), Ms Passmore's evidence
was to the contrary --
according to her, the words:
<P>

"The proposal has been carefully considered in line with our current strategy
and, unfortunately, based on its current content and
funding requirements,
Telecom Australia must decline the proposal."
<P>

were words chosen by Mr O'Neill specifically and deliberately for refusal of
Mrs Jones' sponsorship proposal on behalf of the Defendant
(T, 270 .30).  It
should be concluded that Mr O'Neill's evidence on this point (the use of a
"standard" letter) was at least lacking
in candour.  It would have been simple
enough for Mr O'Neill at the time to state to Mrs Jones that the level of
sponsorship being
sought was too high and to communicate that view to Mrs Jones
very shortly after the proposal was assessed in August 1994.  The unexplained
delay and the failure to identify the true reason for rejection with any
clarity is more consistent with a preference on Mr O'Neill's
part, encouraged
by the Defendant, to deal in due course with the Defendant itself without Mrs
Jones.  Indeed, Mr O'Neill's inferred
knowledge of the difficulties in locating
major sponsors, combined with his knowledge of Telstra's right of first refusal
must, when
combined with the date of the rejection letter (13 October 1994)
have meant that it was obvious to Mr O'Neill that the course of
conduct that he
was engaged in was highly likely to promote the prospect of Telstra being able
to deal directly with the Defendant
in 1995 free of the Plaintiffs.  The
Defendant had a commercial interest in achieving that outcome in the perceived
scope for avoiding
paying a commission to the Plaintiffs having regard to the
legal advice it had received from Lane &amp; Lane on 19 October 1994 (PX6).
 In
particular, a replacement sponsorship agreement could be altered to look like a
new sponsorship in accordance with the advice
received from Messrs Lane &amp;
Lane.  It was suggested by Messrs Lane &amp; Lane (at page 3 of the letter)
that there be a new agreement
"at some future time" "which has been wholly and
separately negotiated on new terms".  Telstra's objective is less clear.  It
seems
clear, however, that at or about the time that Mrs Jones was submitting
her sponsorship proposal, Telstra had become critical of
some aspects of her
performance;  see, for example BEC, para 39.
<P>

(g)	A meeting of the Defendant was held to discuss the Telecom rejection.
According to Mrs Jones, the mood of that meeting was,
on the part of the
Defendant's participants, jovial (HEJ, para 41).  At that meeting Ms Cawood
gave what appears to be an at least
inaccurate response to Mrs Jones about the
existence of any direct communication between Telstra on the one hand and the
Association
on the other hand.  According to Mrs Jones, Ms Cawood said that no
one from the Association had had any direct contact with anyone
at Telecom.
According to Ms Cawood, she was asked specifically about the letter and said
that no one had been in touch with Telecom
about the letter.  Mrs Jones'
recollection should be preferred over Ms Cawood for the reasons I have
mentioned.  Even according to
Ms Cawood's account, however, it was appropriate
for her to respond by disclosure of her earlier conversation with Telecom in
which
she was told that the amount was too high.  This was something which was
not included in the letter of rejection.  It was something
which was material.
It was something which she chose not to communicate, even on the occasion of
this meeting, or on any other occasion
prior to the expiration of the
Consultancy Agreement.
<P>

(h)	Mrs Jones then, quite understandably, communicated orally with Mr O'Neill
in an endeavour to discuss the rejection.  Mr O'Neill
refused to engage in any
negotiation.  Mr O'Neill insisted upon his right of first refusal.  Mr O'Neill,
with what can only have
been the obvious intent of deflecting Mrs Jones from
any negotiation on price, told her (according to Mrs Jones' first affidavit,
page 13.8)
<P>

"But I said I won't break the package up so get out there and flog it -- it's
worth the money and the women deserve it."
<P>

When Mr O'Neill came to swear his affidavit, he chose not to deny this aspect
of Mrs Jones' account.  Mrs Jones' recollection is
corroborated by the letter
that she sent to the Defendant on 18 November 1994 (PTB, 59, page 2.1).  Mrs
Jones had no motivation at
the time of writing that letter for distorting what
Mr O'Neill had said to her.
<P>

(i)	The unsuccessful approach by Mrs Jones to Mr O'Neill was reported back to
the Association on 21 October 1994 (PTB, 48).  On
the surface, the Defendant's
major sponsor had rejected the proposal for sponsorship for 1995, a matter
critically important to the
prospective financial well-being of the Defendant.
It was the practice of the Defendant to discuss significant matters bearing
upon
sponsorship at its board meetings.  A board meeting of the Defendant took
place on 21 and 22 October 1994 (PTB, 47).  No reference
was made to any
difficulty with the Telstra sponsorship for 1995.  Likewise at the further
meeting on 19 and 20 November 1994.
<P>

(j)	The Defendant rejected reasonable requests by the Plaintiffs for funds to
assist in locating an alternative sponsor and for
an ability to publicise the
availability of the sponsorship.  In so far as the publicity was concerned, not
one witness called on
behalf of the Defendant was able to provide any
satisfactory explanation for the refusal on the part of the Defendant to
approve
any publicity whatsoever of the availability of the sponsorship.
<P>

(k)	I have earlier referred to the conversation between Ms Cawood and Ms
Passmore in mid-November 1994 and its context.  Also to
the evident lack of
interest of Ms Tye (in her conversation with Mrs Jones on 2 December 1994
showing no genuine interest in any
project to seek an alternative sponsor than
Telecom.
<P>

(l)	A proposal was submitted by the Defendant to Telstra and commercial
agreement swiftly reached in early February 1995 about the
terms of a new
sponsorship.  At no time prior to such commercial agreement being reached did
Telstra seek any replacement team. 
At no time prior to such commercial being
reached did Telstra remove the Defendant's file into the lapsed sponsorships
area.  At
no time prior to the commercial agreement being reached did the
Defendant seek or propose to seek sponsorship from any alternative
sponsor.
<P>

(m)	When the formal sponsorship agreement was being negotiated an attempt was
made to clothe it with the appearance of a new agreement
and, accordingly,
references were made to "extensive negotiations" in the recitals which were
completely at odds with the true facts
(PTB, 93 and 94 as well as the
sponsorship agreement, document 125).  Ms Cawood was unable to offer any
legitimate explanation for
the "re-jigging" of what otherwise would have been a
standard or generic Telstra sponsorship agreement.  She conceded eventually
that there had been no "extensive negotiations" (T, 411 .9).  The drafting of
the sponsorship agreement is only consistent with an
endeavour to further
implement the advice from Messrs Lane &amp; Lane that what was required in
order to avoid the payment of commission
to the Plaintiffs was an agreement
which had been "wholly and separately negotiated on new terms".  Ms Cawood
agreed as much (T,
409 .7-.9).  The attempt to "re-jig" the sponsorship
agreement is only consistent with a conscious appreciation that without that
re-jigging there would not appear to have been a sponsorship agreement which
had been "wholly and separately negotiated on new terms",
 which is what the
advice from Messrs Lane &amp; Lane had suggested was necessary.
<P>

<b>Findings</b>
<P>

174   	This leads to the following findings.
<P>

175   	As a result of their communications during the course of
1994, I am satisfied that the Defendant and Telstra had a joint
expectation, to
the knowledge of each other, that:
<P>

(a)	the Plaintiffs would not be successful in locating an alternative sponsor
on or before 31 December 1994;
<P>

(b)	the Defendant intended to approach Telstra in its own right after 31
December 1994, and to make application for a renewed sponsorship
agreement;
<P>

(c)	this direct approach would be to the exclusion of the Plaintiffs and by
means, effective or not, calculated to avoid paying
any commission to the
Plaintiffs, with Telstra co-operating in that approach including by use of
legal window dressing, evinced by
the 1995 Telstra Agreement, to falsely
suggest an agreement that was not generic and was the result of "extensive"
negotiations;
<P>

(d)	when the Defendant approached Telstra in 1995 there would be a need to
resolve the only difficulty that Mr O'Neill had perceived
with Mrs Jones'
proposal, namely price (in the sense of the monetary level of sponsorship);
<P>

(e)	agreement would be reached on price;
<P>

(f)	there would, accordingly, be a new sponsorship agreement which would be
available from Telstra to the Defendant for 1995.
<P>

Whether that state of affairs culminating in the 1995 Telstra agreement
constituted, within the meaning of clause 4(b) of the 1994
Consultancy
Agreement a "subsequent year of sponsorship", or within the meaning of clause
4(c) of the 1994 Consulting Agreement,
a <i>renewal</i> of the Telstra
sponsorship arrangement, notwithstanding that price was not agreed till shortly
after 31 December 1994, is both a
legal and factual question.  It is answered
with related questions under Legal Questions below.
<P>

<b>The Qantas Agreements</b>
<P>

176   	The Defendant have had an ongoing relationship with
Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas) since 1986.  
<P>

177   	In the Annual Reports of AWHA from 1986 until at least
1989, Australian Airlines is acknowledged as providing sponsorship
to the
Defendant to the extent following.  
<P>

178   	In the 1986 Annual Report for AWHA, the report by the
Director of Finance for the year 1985-86, states:
<P>

New sponsors this year include QANTAS and the Shell Co. who will provide
$10,000 a year for the next three years for the Under 18
squad.   [DX9 Tab 18
page 36]
<P>

In the section of the report headed "Sponsorship", thanks are expressed to the
"subsidiary sponsors", including QANTAS.  [DX9 Tab
18 page 7]
<P>

179   	In the 1987 Annual Report Qantas is acknowledged at the
commencement, and in the Finance Committee Report it is stated:
<P>

Fares of delegates to F.I.H. were under budget because of the use of F.O.C.
fares on QANTAS where possible, as this was part of
their sponsorship package.
[DX9 Tab 19 page 20]
<P>

Qantas and Australian Airlines were thanked, along with other companies, in the
section on sponsorship and government grants<i>.</i>
<P>

180   	In the 1988 Annual Report Qantas is acknowledged at the
commencement, [DX9 Tab 20 page 1] and thanked in the sponsorship
and government
grant section of the Finance Committee Report.  [DX9 Tab 20 page 16]   In the
notes to the accounts, under the heading,
Qantas Sponsorship, it is noted:
<P>

A sponsorship is given by discount on tickets and supply of some F.O.C. tickets
for officials travelling overseas.   [DX  9 Tab
20 page 109]
<P>

181   	In the 1989 Annual Report Qantas is again acknowledged at
the commencement, and thanked in the sponsorship and government
grant section
of the Finance Committee Report.  In a marketing report by H. Edmunds-Jones,
[T, 30 .55] it is reported:
<P>

The sponsorship contract with Australian Airlines was re-negotiated doubling
the amount of contra travel and on an international
aspect, we made exhaustive
investigations as to the most profitable way of handling overseas travel.  Our
recommendation was not
to enter a new agreement with QANTAS and in doing so
appoint Gullivers Sports Travel to handle AWHA future bookings as well as going
direct to the appropriate international carriers operating the same routes as
QANTAS.  [DX9 Tab 21 page 119]
<P>

In the notes to the accounts under the heading, Qantas Sponsorship, it is
noted:
<P>

The sponsorship is given by discount on tickets, and not in cash.  [DX9 Tab 21
page 14]
<P>

182   	Thus the `contra-travel' arrangement between the
Defendant and Australian Airlines existed before the 1 January 1989
commencement
date of the fee structure provided for in the first Consultancy
Agreement between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant.
<P>

183   	In relation to international travel there was in
existence before 1 January 1989, an <i>arrangement</i> whereby Qantas provided
for a group travel discount and a waiver of excess baggage penalties.
<P>

184   	On the other hand, no specific <i>agreement</i> between
Qantas and the Defendant before 1 January 1989 with regard to such benefits
could be identified.  The Second Plaintiff gave
evidence in cross-examination
to the effect that at that time the Defendant would use a number of airlines
and make their decision
largely on the basis of ticket price [Jones T, 108 .1].
The Defendant appears to have made ad hoc agreements with a number of other
carriers for one-off discounted travel [Jones T, 113-4]
<P>

185   	In the agreement of 21 August 1989 between the Defendant
and Telecom, there appears these words forming part of clause 2:
<P>

"AWHA retains the rights to negotiate other minor sponsorship agreements for
the Team during the said period, which will not conflict
with the Sponsor.
This excludes minor sponsorship agreements already in place at the time of the
signing of this contract, in respect
of the following companies and/or
products:
<P>

(1)	Adidas
<P>

(2)	A G Thompson
<P>

(3)	Australian Airlines
<P>

(4)	Qantas
<P>

(5)	Triumph"
<P>

The Second Plaintiff admits to being aware that Qantas was described as a minor
sponsor in the sponsorship agreement.  However,
Ms Cawood was not aware, or did
not admit to being aware, of any agreements being in existence at that time.
<P>

186   	In 1992, an agreement was entered into for sponsorship by
Australian Airlines Limited of the Defendant and thus prior to
any consultancy
agreement with the Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, no commission was payable on
sponsorship monies provided by Australian
Airlines Limited [clause 4(a) BEC,
100].
<P>

187   	By letter dated 15 April 1992 Australian Airlines Limited
agreed to provide further sponsorship for a period of three years
commencing on
1 January 1992 and concluding on 31 December 1994 [BEC, 166].  In 1993, the
merger of Australian Airlines Limited with
Qantas resulted in the replacement
of Australian Airlines with Qantas as sponsor as the Australian Airlines brand
name was phased
out.  On 27 May 1993, a letter from Qantas to the Defendant
confirmed that the agreement that then existed between the Defendant
and
Australian Airlines Limited would, from that time on, be administered by
Qantas.
<P>

188   	In the program for the 1993 Telecom Stix Series, Qantas
was acknowledged as a sponsor and the "official airline of Telecom
Stix
Series".  [BEC, 174]   The Qantas name and logo appeared on banners displayed
at matches during the 1993 Telecom Stix Series
alongside banners for other
sponsors.   [BEC, 9, 176]   Sponsorship payments in 1994 pursuant to the letter
of agreement dated 15
April 1992 with Australian Airlines Limited were made by
Qantas Airways Limited.  [BEC, 9].
<P>

189   	In the 1993 Annual Report, under the acknowledgments at
the commencement, Qantas Australian Airlines is mentioned in respect
of
"continuing financial assistance and provision of contra travel" and Mrs Jones
reported in her marketing report that:
<P>

Support sponsorships also important to WHA which have been maintained
throughout the year are Qantas Australian Airlines and Kookaburra
Sport.
[BEC, 179]
<P>

190   	In the 1994 Annual Report Qantas is acknowledged at the
commencement for "continuing financial assistance and provision of
contra
travel" and in the report by the marketing and promotions consultants it is
indicated under the heading Australian Airlines
(Qantas):
<P>

Australian Airlines has been the official carrier of WHA for the past eight
years and the contract expires in December this year.
 The contract has been
re-negotiated with QANTAS to cover international as well as domestic travel for
the period 1995-2000.  [DX9
Tab 23 page 14]
<P>

191   	It appears that much of the `sponsorship' provided by
Qantas to the Defendant was therefore in the form of "contra travel"
up to 7
November 1994.  However, on 18 March 1994, the Defendant did receive a cheque
from Qantas for $5,000, being a sponsorship
payment for the period 1 July 1993
to December 1993.
<P>

192   	On 11 August 1994 a representative of the First Plaintiff
met with Steve Loader, a representative of Qantas (Mr Steve Loader
was the
person responsible for making all sponsorship decisions for Qantas with
sporting bodies) to discuss the possibility of Qantas
sponsorship of the
Defendant.  In September, a marketing report of the Plaintiffs referred to
further meetings with Qantas.
<P>

193   	On 21 September 1994 a proposal was presented by the
Plaintiffs to Qantas.  A further meeting was then held between the Plaintiffs
and Qantas about the terms of a sponsorship agreement.  Qantas represented that
they would sponsor the 1994 Stix Series with respect
to airfares.  A draft
agreement incorporating that and other representations was faxed to the
Defendant by Qantas on 18 October 1994.
<P>

194   	By a letter of agreement dated 7 November 1994 between
Qantas and AWHA, Qantas agreed to provide sponsorship for four years
commencing
on 1 January 1995.
<P>

195   	The sponsorship consisted air carriage in annual
instalments of $50,000, $52,500, $55,000 and $57,500 [Annexure J to HEJ,
76] .
Tickets issued as sponsorship were to be used by employees or members of the
Defendant or persons designated by the Defendant.
 The agreement also involved
a minimum 9% discount off international air fares and a waiver of excess
baggage requirements on such
international flights.
<P>

196   	Furthermore Qantas agreed to provide to the Defendant a
40% discount on airfares on certain (domestic - above QF400) flights
for a
period of three years from the commencement of the agreement.
<P>

197   	Finally, Qantas agreed to provide $5,000 cash per year to
the Defendant for the naming rights and sponsorship of the Player
of the Match
and Player of the Series Awards pertaining to the Stix Series.
<P>

198   	On 31 December 1994 the Plaintiffs forwarded to the
Defendant an invoice for the amount of $8,550.00.  This represented commissions
on both the 1994 Stix Series and on the domestic and international travel
arrangements.
<P>

199   	In a letter dated 6 February 1995 to Mrs Jones, Ms Cawood
states:
<P>

2.	Re commission on Qantas sponsorship
<P>

"As you know Australian Airlines has been a sponsor of AWHA for over 8 years
and the fact that Qantas and Australian Airlines merged
the legal technicality
which you highlighted of Australian Airlines no longer being a separate entity
should not result in increased
costs for WHA or a bonus for Edmunds-Jones.
<P>

Given this, my opinion is that $25,000 of the Qantas funding should be applied
to the previous Australian Airlines arrangement being
for domestic airfares
which would, had not the merger occurred being under that long standing
arrangement.  The remaining $25,000
of the Qantas arrangement, being for
overseas flights would then legitimately apply a claim by Edmunds-Jones of 15%
being $3,750.
<P>

<b>LEGAL QUESTIONS</b>
<P>

200   	The pleadings as ultimately amended expose the following
questions for determination:
<P>

201   	<b>Question 1 -- uncertainty:</b>   In the events which
have happened are clauses 3 and 4 of Annexure C to the 1993 or 1994 consultancy
agreement, capable of enabling
the Plaintiffs or either of them to recover any
commission from the Defendant (but for any essential breaches on their part and
subject
to their proper construction) or are those clauses void for uncertainty
and in consequence the relevant agreement?
<P>

202   	<b>Question 2 -- fulfilment of conditions for entitlement
to commission:</b>  If the answer to the first limb of question 1 is "yes", did
the Plaintiffs perform and discharge each and every of their obligations
under
the consultancy agreements so as not to be disentitled to any commission and,
in particular
<P>

(i)	did Mrs Jones during the term of the 1994 agreement "implement in a
professional and businesslike fashion all of the duties
specified in the
consultancy brief...." as required by clause 3;  and/or
<P>

(ii)	did the Plaintiffs maintain and enhance the image of the Defendant and
women's hockey generally (as required by clause C of
Annexure A)?
<P>

203   	<b>Question 3 -- disentitling breach:</b>  If the answer
to question 2 is "no", were the Plaintiffs' contractual breaches of such
materiality as to disentitle them to any
of the commissions claimed?
<P>

204   	<b>Question 4 -- commission on $80,000 in relation to
1993 Telstra Stix Series:</b>  If the relevant Consultancy Agreements are not
void and any relevant condition precedent has been satisfied, whether the
Plaintiffs
are disentitled to commission on the sum of $80,000 paid for the
production costs of the 1993 Telstra Stix Series by reason of:
<P>

(i)	an alleged inability to be able to properly characterise such payments as
"sponsorship";
<P>

(ii)	an alleged entry into an agreement to waive made on or about 21 May
1996;
<P>

(iii)	an alleged estoppel;  and
<P>

(iv)	an alleged failure to submit an itemised account?
<P>

205   	<b>Question 5 -- "renewal" or "subsequent year of
sponsorship":</b>  If the relevant Consultancy Agreements are not void and any
relevant condition precedent satisfied, did the sponsorship agreement
between
Telecom and the Defendant of 5 May 1995 constitute:
<P>

(a)	a subsequent year of sponsorship within clause 4(b),  or
<P>

(b)	a renewal of a sponsorship agreement or arrangement on or after 1 January
1995 within clause 4(c),
<P>

so as to entitle the Plaintiffs to a fee of fifteen per cent or twelve per cent
respectively on sponsorship payments, or on the
monetary equivalent of goods
and services provided by Telecom?
<P>

206   	<b>Question 6 -- Qantas commission:</b>  
<P>

(a)	If the relevant Consultancy Agreements were not void for uncertainty and
any relevant condition precedent was satisfied, was
any sponsorship agreement
of the Defendant by Qantas, the result of Qantas "having been approached or
introduced" or were negotiations
in relation to the agreement commenced "prior
to 1 January 1989", so as to disentitle the Plaintiffs from commission?
<P>

(b)	On the same basis, did Qantas become a party by novation to the Australian
Airlines Sponsorship Agreement and, if so, whether
such circumstance precluded
commission on Qantas sponsorship?
<P>

207   	<b>Question 7 -- <i>Quantum Meruit</i> entitlement:</b>
If clauses 3 and 4 of Annexure C to the consultancy agreement(s) are void for
uncertainty are the Plaintiffs or either of them entitled
to any reasonable
remuneration based on <i>quantum meruit</i> and if so, in what sum?
<P>

<b>Question 1 -- uncertainty:   </b>
<P>

208   	<i>In the events which have happened are clauses 3 and 4
of Annexure C to the 1993 or 1994 consultancy agreement, capable of enabling
the Plaintiffs or either of them to recover any commission from the Defendant
(but for any essential breaches on their part and subject
to their proper
construction) or are those clauses void for uncertainty and in consequence the
relevant agreement?</i>
<P>

209   	The Defendant contends that the Consultancy Agreements
and in particularly that for 1993 and 1994 were void for uncertainty.
 The
basis for that contention is set out in para 7-7.9 of the Defendants' written
submissions, starting with the use of the phrase
"and/or" in the introductory
clause 3 of Annexure "C" dealing with fees, where what Mrs Jones must do to
earn a fee is laid down.
 Clause 4 then defines the temporal requirements
applicable to eligible agreements giving rise to a fee entitlement,
differentiating
between the fifteen per cent fee in clause 4(b) and the twelve
per cent fee applicable to a renewal of "the sponsorship arrangement
in any
concluded agreement of the kind referred to in sub-clause (b) of this
clause".
<P>

<b>Principles</b>
<P>

210   	Before dealing with the elaboration of that basis for
alleging uncertainty and the others that follow, I set out below what
can be
taken to be common ground as to the principles applicable to dealing with
allegations of uncertainty and the differentiation
between uncertainty and
ambiguity.  These are usefully summarised by Mackenzie J of the Queensland
Supreme Court in <i>Coomera Resort Pty Ltd v Kolback Securities Ltd &amp;
Ors</i> (Mackenzie J, BC9800289, 20 February 1998, unreported) at 97:
<P>

"A contract is only void for uncertainty if an essential term is uncertain
(<i>Thorby v Goldberg</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 597</a>;  <i>Godecke v Kirwin</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%20629" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973)
129 CLR 629</a>, 646).  Because of the great inconvenience otherwise resulting,
Courts nowadays strive to uphold the existence of a contract if possible
(<i>York Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration (A'asia) Pty Ltd v The
Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2080%20CLR%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 80 CLR 11</a>;  <i>Meehan v Jones</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20571" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 571.</a>
The notion that it would be a reproach upon the law if the parties had intended
to agree and believed they had agreed were told that
for legal reasons the
contract had never come into existence is uppermost in the Court's mind
(<i>Hillas &amp; Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%20147%20LT%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 147 LT 503</a>;  <i>Prints for
Pleasure Limited v Oswald-Sealy (Overseas) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%203%20NSWLR%20761" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 3 NSWLR 761.</a>  But
such belief is not decisive of the existence of a certain contract.  It is
important to avoid a `narrow or pedantic' approach
(<i>Upper Hunter District
Council v Australian Chilling &amp; Freezing Co Ltd</i>  (1968)<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1968/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=118%20CLR%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">118 CLR
429</a>, 437).  If the parties have acted on the basis that there is agreement, the
readiness to uphold it may be reinforced (<i>F &amp; g Sykes (Wessex) Ltd v
Fine Fare Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 1 Lloyds Rep 53</a>;  <i>Brown v Gould</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20Ch%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] Ch
53.</a>  Where the parties have shown by conduct that they can understand and apply
the terms of the contract, a Court should be reluctant
to find the contract is
uncertain (<i>Hillas &amp; Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd</i>;  <i>York Air Conditioning
&amp; Refrigeration (A'asia) Pty Ltd v Commonwealth</i>).  But if an
uncertainty cannot be resolved there is no room for upholding the agreement.
It is, however not uncommon that parties
may clarify what was previously
uncertain... ."
<P>

<b>"and/or"</b>
<P>

211   	Before dealing with the other bases for alleging
uncertainty, I deal with the use of "and/or" in clause 3 which is the
Defendant's
first basis for alleging uncertainty.  "And/or" has long been in
use in business documents.  Its meaning was discussed in <i>Cuthbert v
Cumming</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1855/206.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1855] EngR 206</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281855%29%2010%20Exch%20809" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1855) 10 Exch 809</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=156%20ER%20668" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">156 ER 668.</a>  Criticism of it has included
Bennett J in Practice Note  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1940%20WN%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1940 WN 155</a> who stated that it should not be used in
an affidavit and threatened to order costs against anyone who did so.  In
<i>Bonitto v Fuerst Bros</i> [1944] EC 75 at 82 Viscount Simon, in discussing
the confusion in the pleadings, spoke of "the repeated use of that bastard
conjunction
"and/or" which has, I fear, become the Commercial Court's
contribution to basic English.";  see generally the discussion in Piesse
"The
Elements of Drafting" ninth edition (LBC, 1995) by J K Aitken at 61-85.
<P>

212   	Nonetheless, despite the constant refrain of criticism,
courts have tended not to strike down contracts as void for uncertainty
merely
because they have shown what Gavin Duffy J described as "the common and
deplorable affection for the form and/or" in <i>Millen v Grove</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1945/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] VicLawRp 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1945%5d%20VLR%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1945] VLR
259.</a>  Thus Scrutton LJ considered the ordinary business meaning of "and/or" in
<i>Gurney v Grimer</i> [1932] 38 Comm Cas 7 at 13 and had no difficulty in
determining its effect in that context:
<P>

"There is really a clear understanding of what the words "and/or" mean.  To
take one of the simplest cases and an obvious case,
where there is a charter
party by which a ship is to proceed to Rotterdam an/or Antwerp at charterer's
option it means one of three
things:  the charterer may either send the vessel
to Rotterdam alone or he may send her to Antwerp alone, or he may send her to
Rotterdam
and Antwerp."
<P>

213   	His interpretation of the expression accords with
Fowler's "Modern English Usage" third edition (Oxford, 1996) where the
expression is defined as a "formula denoting that the items joined by it can be
taken either together or as alternatives".  Fowler
describes the expression as
verging on the inelegant when used in general writing and as having been first
recorded in the mid nineteenth
century in legal contexts.
<P>

214   	Michelle Asprey in her book "Plain Language for Lawyers"
second edition (Federation Press, 1996) at 175 agrees with Fowler
that the
better way of expressing the same idea is to use the expression "x or y or
both".
<P>

215   	Indeed that is the meaning which the Plaintiffs, in my
view correctly, contend should be accorded to that expression "and/or"
in
clause 3, which for convenience I quote below with emphasis added:
<P>

"A Fee is payable in accordance with the provision of Clause 4 only on
agreements entered into as a result of the other party (sponsor
and/or donor or
otherwise) being located <b>and/or</b> introduced by Ms Jones <b>and/or</b> the
agreement being negotiated <b>and/or</b> concluded by Ms Jones and all
negotiations and other actions by Ms Jones being in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement."
<P>

216   	Thus while it is argued on behalf of the Defendant that
the use of the phrase "and/or" makes it impossible to say whether
it was
sufficient for Mrs Jones to locate, introduce, negotiate or conclude, or
whether she had to locate, introduce, negotiate and
conclude in order to be
entitled to commission, the Plaintiffs contend that the phrase plainly
indicates that it suffices to satisfy
clause 3 that the Plaintiffs do some one
or more of these things:
<P>

"(a)	locate;
<P>

 (b)	introduce;
<P>

 (c)	negotiate;
<P>

 (d)	conclude."
<P>

That seems reasonable enough in the context of an agent or consultant earning a
commission for efforts made.  It would be most unfair
if the agreement
permitted no fee where Mrs Jones located a sponsor, but AWHA chose to take over
the negotiation or to carry matters
to conclusion.
<P>

217   	Indeed when reference is made to clause 4, where the
draftsperson maintains continued enthusiasm for the inelegant expression
"and/or", the any or all preferred interpretation is borne out by the
expression "any and/or all agreements" in clause 4(a).  Again
in clause 4(b) in
the first proviso the reference is made to "concluded agreements, the other
party having been approached or introduced
or negotiations commenced on or
subsequent to the 1st January 1989...".
<P>

218   	Thus, awkward though the expression may be, as Lord
Wright said in <i>Hillas &amp; Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=147%20LT%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">147 LT 503</a> at 514, the
court should construe commercial contracts "fairly and broadly without being
too astute or subtle in finding defect".
<P>

219   	Thus I am satisfied first that clauses 3 and 4 do not
fail for uncertainty on the ground of the use of the expression "and/or"
and
second, that the expression does have the meaning contended for by the
Plaintiffs in that context.
<P>

220   	The remaining grounds of attack on the basis of alleged
uncertainty can be summarised as follows:
<P>

(a)	The concluding proviso to clause 4 is uncertain (see paras 7.4 and 7.9 of
the Defendant's written submissions).  It is said
that the proviso is uncertain
in that:
<P>

(i)	in distinguishing between monetary sponsorship and sponsorship by way of
the provision of goods and services, where the sponsorship
is by way of goods
and services, the final proviso to clause 4 stipulates that "the fee payable to
the Company relating to agreements
for supply of goods and services shall be
calculated upon the actual monetary amount received by the Association when
utilising the
goods and/or services and not the actual value of the goods
and/or services.  Payment shall be made to the Company within thirty
days of
such date."  It is then said that such proviso produces an absurd result where,
for example, a sponsor provides hockey uniforms
and the uniforms are worn by
players in a match promoted by the Defendant to which members of the public
attend on paying an entrance
or gate fee.  It is then suggested that if "the
actual monetary amount received by the [Defendant] when utilising goods" is the
amount
of that gate or entry fee, the Plaintiffs have provided no evidence to
support any claim for commission based on such a mode of calculation
but
equally, if the proviso does not mean that, there is no other ascertainable
meaning.
<P>

(ii)	In a case of "agreements for the provision of goods or services" as
referred in the words immediately preceding the final proviso
to clause 4, the
fees payable to the Plaintiffs are required to be paid "at such time as the
Association receives a monetary benefit
from the supply of the goods and
services".  If such goods and services were thus provided in kind rather than
by way of direct monetary
payment, how does one calculate "a monetary benefit"
from their supply and, more particularly, how does one do so in accordance with
the final proviso which requires that the calculation be "upon the actual
monetary amount received by the Association when utilising
the goods and/or
services and not the actual value of the goods and/or services".  <i>Ex
hypothesi</i> the actual monetary amount was never received and the concluding
proviso eliminates as a possible answer to that question "the actual
value of
the goods and/or services".
<P>

(b)	It cannot be said whether, for the purposes of clause 4(b), any agreement
entered into with Telecom Australia is required to
be one which was entered
into on or prior to 31 December of the relevant year (para 7.6 of the
Defendants' written submissions);
<P>

(c)	It cannot be said how clauses 4(b) and 4(a) are to be reconciled (para 7.6
of the Defendants' written submissions);
<P>

(d)	It cannot be said, for the purposes of clause 4(b), what the words "where
the original sponsorship was negotiated by the Consultant
and such sponsorship
was for a period in excess of one (1) year up to the date of expiry of that
actual Agreement and no further"
mean (para 7.7 of the Defendants' written
submissions);
<P>

(e)	It cannot be said whether the third proviso to clause 4(b) is operative
where a fee has been paid which related to a whole period
of sponsorship
extending beyond the relevant date, but which was further extended (para 7.7 of
the Defendants' written submissions);
<P>

(f)	It cannot be said how clause 4(c) is to be reconciled with clause 4(b)
(para 7.7 of the Defendants' written submissions).
<P>

221   	I deal with each of these grounds on alleged uncertainty
as follows:
<P>

<b><i>(a)	Relationship between opening part of clause 4 and concluding proviso
in the case of sponsorship by the provision of goods and
services</i></b>
<P>

222   	Essentially the Defendant's contention is that the
concluding proviso to clause 4 is uncertain and that uncertainty relates
to
sponsorship by way of the provision of goods and services, whether effected by
the sponsor providing goods and services direct,
or by the sponsor making a
payment to a third party where the third party in turn provides the goods and
services to the Defendant.
 The alleged uncertainty relates to the method of
calculating the sum by reference to which commission is payable and the time
from
which commission is payable.
<P>

223   	The starting point in attempting to construe a contract
potentially ambiguous, is to determine whether a meaning can be attributed
objectively to the words used, from the evident commercial purpose of the
parties' overall arrangements; compare Lord Steyne "Contract
Law:  Expectations
of Honest Men"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20130%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 130 LQR 431</a> at 441.  That in turn requires a
determination of what Lord Steyne calls "the objective contextual scene",
though the extent of extrinsic
evidence which may be called upon to resolve
ambiguity is a matter of debate as is the scope for finding ambiguity;
<i>Allstate Explorations NL v Beaconsfield Gold NL</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/832.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 832</a> at
paras 39-44 (Santow J, 25 August 1999, unreported).  In <i>Mannai Investment Co
Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] UKHL 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20WLR%20945" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 WLR 945</a> Lord Steyn at 961
explains:
<P>

"First, in respect of contracts .... the contextual scene is always relevant.
Secondly, what is <i>admissible</i> as a matter of the rules of evidence under
this heading is what is arguably relevant. But admissibility is not the
decisive matter.
The real question is what evidence of surrounding
circumstances might ultimately be allowed to influence the question of
interpretation.
That depends on what meanings the language read against the
objective contextual scene will let in. Thirdly the inquiry is objective:
the
question is what reasonable persons, circumstanced as the actual parties were,
would have had in mind."
<P>

224   	Here there can be no rational basis for distinguishing
between the situation where the sponsor pays a monetary amount direct
to the
Defendant, for example to buy hockey uniforms, and where the sponsor pays that
same monetary amount to a third party supplier
to provide the hockey uniforms
to the Defendant.  In either case, the payment has the same purpose, namely to
provide a benefit to
the Defendant readily ascertainable by reference to the
money amount actually paid by the sponsor.  In my judgment, clause 4 treats
both payments in the same way, such that the expression "receipt by the
Association of the monetary payments owing pursuant to the
terms of the
relevant agreement" where it appears in the last sentence of clause 4 before
the final proviso is intended to embrace
monetary payments directly received or
indirectly received.  The obvious example would be where the sponsor is
directed by the Association
to make a payment direct to a supplier which
otherwise the Association would have had to pay itself.  While literally the
Association
has not received the monetary payment, it has in a practical sense
done so and both a direct receipt or such an indirect or constructive
receipt
are embraced by the earlier quoted words.
<P>

225   	In contrast to that situation, is the situation where the
sponsor never makes a monetary payment but simply provides goods
and services
to the Association.  In that circumstance, clearly enough there is a commercial
purpose in having a mechanism for calculating
a monetary value to be attributed
to the goods and services.  The opening part of clause 4 and the lead in to its
final proviso are
directed to providing a basis for determining, but in that
situation only, both how such a value is to be attributed and the time
from
whence commission is to be calculated.  It does so, admittedly in clumsy and
imprecise language.  The question is whether any
sense can be made of it which
accords with a discernible commercial purpose of the parties derived from the
objective contextual
scene.
<P>

226   	Clearly enough the possibilities for different values to
be attributed ranging from the value of the goods and services to
the sponsor,
their market value, or their peculiar value to the Association, render it
necessary for there to be some objective means
of ascertainment of which if any
of these possibilities was the parties' objective intent when attributing a
mode of calculating
a value.
<P>

227   	I am satisfied that the words "the actual monetary amount
received by the Association when utilising the goods and/or services"
applies
to notional receipts, as if the Defendant had disposed of such goods and/or
services, and means ordinarily the proceeds that
would be received upon such a
notional disposal.  The outcome is ordinarily to attribute market sale value to
the relevant goods
and services.  However, the qualifying word "actual" enables
the Defendant, in the less usual case where this is so, to demonstrate
that the
benefit that would be received from such a notional sale should not be treated
as the actual market value, in the event
that the same goods or services could
be acquired from some other source at lower than the market sale price.  An
example might be
a standard discount available from several sources for the
particular service, such as air travel for a community sporting group,
which
Qantas and other airlines might provide.
<P>

228   	Support for this interpretation is gleaned from the words
immediately preceding the last proviso.  There reference is made,
in the case
of an agreement for the provision of goods or services, to the time when the
Association "received a monetary benefit"
from supply thereof.  
<P>

229   	Although as I have said the language is imprecise and
clumsy, I am satisfied that this interpretation avoids consequences
which would
otherwise be "capricious, unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust" (to use the
words from earlier authorities cited in <i>Locke v Dunlop</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=39%20ChD%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">39 ChD 387</a> at 393
in turn referred to by Gibbs J in <i>Australian Broadcasting Commission v
Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a> at 109-10).
What would clearly be capricious in the present circumstance would be to have a
gap in respect of sponsorship in kind
as would be the case were there no method
for calculating its attributable value for commission purposes.  But I am
satisfied there
is no such gap.  Rather, the relevant provisions clearly
contemplate that such sponsorship in kind should be taken into account no
less
than monetary sponsorship in the conventional sense.  Indeed, were it necessary
to do so, if that were a source of ambiguity
for which no content could be
provided, there would be adequate basis for severing that part of the relevant
clause;  see <i>Mcfarlane v Daniell</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1938/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] NSWStRp 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%2038%20SR%28NSW%29%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] 38 SR(NSW) 337</a> at 345.  However,
I do not consider that that course is necessary.
<P>

<b><i>(b)	When must any agreement for the purpose of clause 4(b) with Telecom
Australia be entered into -- meaning of first proviso.</i></b>
<P>

230   	The Defendant's submissions ask (in para 7.6) what the
first proviso to clause 4(b) means, where it says 
<P>

"PROVIDED HOWEVER that this shall only apply to concluded agreements, the other
party having been approached or introduced or negotiations
commenced on or
subsequent to 1st January 1989 and on any agreement entered into with Telecom
Australia".
<P>

231   	I consider that the first purpose of the proviso is to
confer an entitlement to commission or fee on telecom sponsorship
without the
Plaintiffs having to establish that the Plaintiffs had any role with respect to
approaching, introducing or negotiating
with Telecom Australia after the
relevant date (1st January 1989).  That provision finds its origin in the
sequence of Consultancy
Agreements starting with 1989.  Clause 3(a) of the
first one, entered on 17 July 1989 excepts Telecom Australia from the
preclusion
of any fee on any agreements "entered into by the World Cup with a
person or company with whom the Australian Women's Hockey Association
Inc have
previously had an agreement <i>except in relation to Telecom Australia</i>".
[emphasis added]  This is similarly provided in clause 4(b) of the 1991
Consultancy Agreement;  see first proviso quoted earlier.
 In addition, by the
preceding words of clause 4(b) of the 1991 and following Consultancy
Agreements, this sponsorship agreement
must have been entered into on or prior
to the end of the relevant December year in which the relevant Consultancy
Agreement expires.
<P>

232   	It will be recalled that according to Ms Cawood's
evidence (BEC, para 10) she was approached by an employee of Telecom as
early
as 1988 and, in consequence, asked Mrs Jones to speak to that employee.  There
were negotiations in 1988 in which Mrs Jones
thus played a part, in respect of
the 1990 Womens Hockey World Cup (HEJ, 8).  At the same time that Mrs Jones was
speaking to Telecom
about 1990 Womens Hockey World Cup, she was speaking to
Telecom generally about sponsorship (T, 83 .20).  I should add that the
reference
to "any agreement entered into with Telecom Australia" was not
intended to apply to any agreement ever entered into with Telecom
Australia but
rather any Telecom Australia agreement which existed at the time of the
relevant Consultancy Agreements.  Other parts
of the consultancy Agreements, in
particular the second proviso to clause 4(b) and clause 4(c) dealt with the
position of the Plaintiffs
in relation to renewals of, inter alia, the Telecom
sponsorship after the termination of any consultancy.
<P>

233   	I therefore conclude that there is no sufficient basis
for uncertainty on this ground either.
<P>

<b><i>(c)	Reconciliation of clauses 4(b) and 4(a)</i></b>
<P>

234   	I have already dealt with the supposed difficulty of
reconciliation in relation to the reference to Telecom Australia.  Otherwise,
there is no real difficulty in reconciling the two clauses as I explain.
Clause 4(a) of the 1991 Consultancy Agreement (and mutatis
mutandis with each
subsequent Consultancy Agreement) make clear that if a concluded sponsorship
<i>agreement</i> has been entered into "on or prior to the 1st July 1991", that
precludes from any fee that sponsorship agreement and likewise is
precluded any
subsequent agreement with the same person or company with whom the Association
previously had (such) an agreement.
 The preclusion is from any fee under that
Sponsorship Agreement;  the proviso to clause 4(a) permits a fee under any
preceding Consultancy
Agreement.  Clause 4(b) then provides for a fee to be
payable on any concluded agreement (not so precluded) entered prior to 31
December
1992 in the case of the 1991 Consultancy Agreement (or the relevant
Consultancy Agreement's expiry date).
<P>

235   	Thus there is no sufficient basis for uncertainty on this
ground either.
<P>

<b><i>(d)	Uncertainty of second proviso to clause 4(b)</i></b>
<P>

236   	The Defendant's contention is that the second proviso to
clause 4(b) is uncertain because it is not plain whether the proviso
applies to
all agreements or only to Telecom Australia agreements.  Secondly, it is said
that it is not plain what content the words
"and no further" have.  For the
reasons below, I do not accept either contention.
<P>

237   	I am satisfied that the second proviso to clause 4(b)
relates to all agreements, including Telecom Australia agreements.
 The Telecom
Australia agreements entered into during the terms of the Consultancy
Agreements were:
<P>

(a)	on 8 May 1991 (for years 1991 and 1992) (see annexure "J" to Ms Cawood's
first affidavit);  and
<P>

(b)	on 15 February 1993 (for years 1993 and 1994) (see annexure "K" to the same
affidavit).
<P>

The Telecom sponsorship was earlier entered into on 21 August 1989 (for years
1989 and 1990) (see annexure "I" to the same affidavit).
 Since the period of
the Telecom sponsorship was known and was in excess of one year, it is
inherently unlikely that the parties
would have chosen to adopt such general
words if the second proviso was intended to relate only to the Telecom
Australia agreement.
 There is no commercial objective that can be conceived
of, moreover, for limiting the entitlement to commission "on subsequent years
of sponsorship" only to subsequent years of a Telecom Australia sponsorship.
It is plain that the second proviso relates to all agreements,
including
Telecom Australia agreements.
<P>

238   	The concluding words of the second proviso to clause 4(b)
("and no further") mean that there is no fifteen per cent entitlement
for any
period exceeding the term of the "concluded agreement" (within the first
proviso).  However, subject to that override, the
fifteen per cent continues
for so long as there is a concluded agreement embodying a continuing
sponsorship "for a period in excess
of one year".  I do not agree that a
continuing sponsorship suffices without a matching concluded agreement;  indeed
both are necessary.
<P>

<b><i>(e)	Uncertainty of third proviso to clause 4(b)</i></b>
<P>

239   	It is argued by the Defendant (in para 7.7) that the
third proviso to clause 4(b) is uncertain because it is not plain whether
a fee
would be payable in respect of the receipt of sponsorship benefits by reason of
an extension.  The hypothetical problem posed
in the Defendant's submissions is
put this way:
<P>

"Suppose a sponsorship was arranged before 1 January 1994 but extended well
beyond that date (e.g. until, say, 1996);  suppose the
Defendant paid the First
Plaintiff a fee in relation to that sponsorship for the whole of its period;
would any further fee become
payable in the event that the sponsorship was
extended beyond its fixed term (in the example given, to, say, 1997-1998)?  If
so,
why?"
<P>

The third proviso refers to a date which (in each case) is the commencement
date of the consultancy.  The effect of the proviso
is that no fee is payable
under the current Consultancy Agreement in respect of a sponsorship which had
an earlier commencement date
if the fee paid under an earlier Consultancy
Agreement relates to the <i>whole</i> of that period of sponsorship.  The
hypothetical posed takes the date 1 January 1994 and, therefore, presumably is
posed in respect
of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement.  That hypothetical
sponsorship is stated to extend beyond 31 December 1994.  A fee is then said
to
have been paid "in relation to that sponsorship for the whole of its period"
(that is, for the whole of its original period).
 It is then stated that there
is an extension ("to, say, 1997-1998").  But there is a simple answer.  The
effect of the extension
is that it is no longer true to say that a fee has been
paid which relates to the whole period of sponsorship.  The further sponsorship
provided (under the extension) would attract an obligation to pay a fee,
accordingly, under the new Consultancy Agreement.  That
answer to the problem
posed is plain.  It does not give rise to uncertainty.
<P>

<b><i>(f)	Clause 4(c) not reconcilable with clause 4(b)</i></b>
<P>

240   	The Plaintiffs' contend that to the extent there may be
an overlap between clauses 4(b) and 4(c), the Plaintiffs are entitled
to elect.
However, I do not consider there is any such overlap.  Clause 4(b) always
presupposes a concluded agreement, embodying
a sponsorship.  That sponsorship
<i>so embodied</i> may extend to in excess of one year.  If it does, this
entitles the Plaintiffs to fifteen per cent commission for each subsequent
year
of sponsorship until the underlying original agreement ceases along with the
sponsorship.  Whereas renewal under clause 4(c),
though also presupposing a
contractual agreement embodying the sponsorship, does not require that the
<i>original</i> agreement extend into later years.  What it requires is that
the sponsorship relationship be renewed, but continue to be embodied
in a
subsequent contractual agreement or series of agreements;  see further under
question 5.  
<P>

241   	For these reasons, I do not consider that clauses 4(b)
and 4(c) cannot be reconciled or that they give rise to any basis
for
uncertainty.
<P>

<b>Uncertainty generally</b>
<P>

242   	In any event, uncertainty is only recently raised in
these various respects well after the parties fell into substantial
dispute.
The contracts which are alleged in the present proceedings to be uncertain were
entered into in 1993 and 1994.  They mirrored
earlier agreements, the first of
which was in 1989.  Whilst the Plaintiffs were actively engaged in performing
the task contemplated
by the Consultancy Agreements, there was never any
suggestion that the agreements proved incapable of application and certainly
the
evidence does not indicate otherwise.  It was only after termination of the
consultancy (at the end of 1994) that the parties clearly
fell into substantial
dispute.  
<P>

243   	The present proceedings were commenced in 1996.  It was
not for some years later that the Defence was amended to raise (for
the first
time in the context of the dispute) an issue concerning an alleged uncertainty.
Consistently with the authorities, this
strongly suggests that this Court
should be astute to consider whether any difficulties which have been properly
identified are in
truth difficulties of construction which reflect ambiguity
still capable of resolution, rather than of such a level of uncertainty
as to
render the contract devoid of meaning in an essential respect.  It is to be
remembered what Latham CJ in <i>York Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration
(A'asia) Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2080%20CLR%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 80 CLR 11</a> at 53 said:
<P>

"When the parties have shown by their conduct that they understand and can
apply the terms of a contract without difficulty, the
court should be very
reluctant indeed to pay no attention to such conduct by holding that the terms
of the contract are unintelligible
by reason of uncertainty."
<P>

244   	As Gibbs CJ said in <i>Meehan v Jones</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20571" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR
571</a> at 578:
<P>

"The fact that opinions may differ as to which of these two meanings is given
to the words of the clause does not mean that the
clause is uncertain.  If the
court, in construing the contract, can decide which of the two possible
meanings is that which the parties
intended, there will be no uncertainty."
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

245   	I am satisfied that the contract is not void for
uncertainty and that the proper construction of those provisions of it which
are capable of more than one interpretation is as I have set out above.
<P>

246   	The matters raised by the Defendant are rather properly
characterised as questions of potential ambiguity, capable of being
resolved as
matters of construction in accordance with the well-settled approach of
avoiding constructions which make commercial
nonsense or fail to accord with
the parties' evident commercial purposes in an objective sense;  see <i>Hyde
&amp; Skin Trading Pty Ltd v Oceanic Meat Traders Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 310</a>
at 313.  Thus taking each of those questions of construction in turn, they are
resolved as follows:
<P>

(a)	clause 3 is satisfied if the Plaintiffs do any one or more of the
following:  locate, introduce, negotiate and conclude;
<P>

(b)	the first proviso to clause 4(b) excludes Telecom Australia Agreements from
the requirement that the relevant conduct on the
part of the plaintiffs
commence only on or after 1 July 1989 or require the Plaintiffs to show they
have done any of the matters
in (a) above, vis a vis Telecom;
<P>

(c)	clause 4(b) can be reconciled with clause 4(a) in the way earlier
described;
<P>

(d)	the second proviso to clause 4(b) relates to all agreements, including
Telecom Australia agreements;
<P>

(e)	the words "and no further" in the second proviso to clause 4(b) emphasise
that the duration of the sponsorship is to be determined
by having regard only
to the original term of the negotiated agreement and not any extension by way
of subsequent agreement;
<P>

(f)	the third proviso to clause 4(b) would not be satisfied where there is an
extension of a term for which a fee has previously
been paid but which is
subject to the receipt of a further fee;
<P>

(g)	there is no real overlap between clauses 4(b) and 4(c), but are reconciled
as I have described;
<P>

(h)	the words "agreements for the supply of goods and services" in the
concluding portion of clause 4 relate only to agreements
for the direct supply
by a sponsor of goods and services and not to payments by the sponsor to a
third party on the basis that the
third party is to supply goods and services
of equivalent value to the Association  --  such payments to a third party are
to be
treated the same as payments direct to the Association;
<P>

(i)	the words "the actual monetary amount received by the Association when
utilising the goods and/or services" applies to a notional
receipt of market
value derived from a notional disposal, but so that if the Defendant could have
acquired the relevant goods or
services elsewhere at a lower price, then that
lower amount is the basis for calculating the fee.
<P>

247   	It follows that the relevant provisions of the applicable
Consultancy Agreement are not void for uncertainty.  Thus, subject
to the
answers to Questions 2 and 5 being in the Plaintiffs' favour, the First
Plaintiff is entitled to recover any commission from
the Defendant under
whichever be the applicable provision of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement, that
is either clause 4(b) or clause
4(c).  
<P>

<b>Question 2 -- fulfilment of conditions for entitlement to commission:
</b>
<P>

248   	<i>If the answer to the first limb of question 1 is
"yes", did the Plaintiffs perform and discharge each and every of their
obligations
under the consultancy agreements so as not to be disentitled to any
commission and, in particular</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	did Mrs Jones during the term of the 1994 agreement "implement in a
professional and businesslike fashion all of the duties specified
in the
consultancy brief...." as required by clause 3;  and/or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	did the Plaintiffs maintain and enhance the image of the Defendant and
women's hockey generally (as required by clause C of Annexure
A)?</i>
<P>

249   	Earlier, at para 170 I concluded that even if it were a
condition precedent to any relevant entitlement to commission, that
the
Plaintiffs act in a professional and businesslike fashion, the evidence does
not demonstrate that the Plaintiffs acted otherwise.
 Likewise, I concluded
that there was no failure to "maintain and enhance the image of the Defendant
and women's hockey generally".
<P>

250   	Thus, even if, prima facie, a breach of clause 3 would
disentitle the Plaintiffs to their commission or at any rate a breach
of
sufficient magnitude, no such breach is made out.  In those circumstances, I do
not need to determine whether, as a matter of
construction, the entitlement to
commission under clause 4 depends upon "other actions by Ms Jones being in
accordance with the provisions
of this agreement", as provided in clause 3.
The Plaintiffs argue that there is a presumption of independence (rather than
interdependence),
citing, for example, <i>Ryan v Ferguson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1909/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1909] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281909%29%208%20CLR%20731" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1909) 8 CLR 731</a>;

<P>

251   	I would agree that any failure by Mrs Jones in
performance of the provisions of this agreement must be a failure connected
to
the manner in which the sponsorship agreement has been negotiated or concluded,
and probably also as to the way in which the relevant
sponsor has been "located
and/or introduced", as those expressions are used in clause 3.
<P>

252   	Taking that as the relevant interdependence, and in
circumstances where there was no repudiation of the agreement on the
grounds of
breach or alleged breach by the Plaintiffs, none of the allegations of breach
by the Plaintiffs of the 1994 Sponsorship
Agreement could of themselves relate
to the negotiation and/or conclusion "by Ms Jones" of the 1995 Telstra
Agreement;  she was simply
not involved in that process after 31 December 1994
on the Defendant's own case.  That she may have laid the groundwork for that
later agreement, though excluded from its negotiation, yet somehow contravened
the provisions of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement,
would be to stretch
interdependence further than the clause warrants.  And, in any event, I have
already concluded that that assumption
of contravention is not made out.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusions</i></b>
<P>

253   	The Plaintiffs did perform and discharge each and every
of their obligations under the Consultancy Agreements so as to become
entitled
to any commission payable thereunder, it remaining to be determined whether
commission is payable and if so on what basis.
 Even if I were wrong in the
conclusion that there was no contravention, any contravention by the Plaintiffs
could not have been
in connection with the 1995 Telstra Agreement.  Thus
interdependence could not be made out to disqualify the Plaintiffs from fee
or
commission, if otherwise entitled.
<P>

<b>Question 3 -- disentitling breach:  </b>
<P>

254   	<i>If the answer to question 2 is "no", were the
Plaintiffs' contractual breaches of such materiality as to disentitle them to
any of
the commissions claimed?</i>
<P>

255   	This question is already answered;  there were no
contractual breaches by the Plaintiffs.
<P>

<b>Question 4 -- commission on $80,000 in relation to 1993 Telstra Stix Series:
</b>
<P>

256   	<i>If the relevant Consultancy Agreements are not void
and any relevant condition precedent has been satisfied, whether the Plaintiffs
are disentitled to commission on the sum of $80,000 paid for the production
costs of the 1993 Telstra Stix Series by reason of:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	an alleged inability to be able to properly characterise such payments
as "sponsorship";</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	an alleged entry into an agreement to waive made on or about 21 May
1996;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	an alleged estoppel;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	an alleged failure to submit an itemised account?</i>
<P>

257   	In light of my earlier factual findings under the heading
"The Telecom Stix Series", at paras 41-51, there is no proper basis
for denying
the Plaintiffs commission at the rate of fifteen per cent on $80,000 paid by
Telecom in relation to the 1993 Telstra
Stix Series for the ABC's broadcasting
costs.  Clearly enough this payment was properly characterised as "sponsorship"
connected
as it was with that sporting event in which the Defendant
participated.  There was no agreement to waive made out nor any estoppel
and
the letter of 13 May 1994 sufficiently claimed commission;  see para 45.
Likewise commission is payable in the amount of $461.63;
 see para 50 above.
<P>

<b>Question 5 -- "renewal" or "subsequent year of sponsorship":  </b>
<P>

258   	<i>If the relevant Consultancy Agreements are not void
and any relevant condition precedent satisfied, did the sponsorship agreement
between Telecom and the Defendant of 5 May 1995 constitute:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a subsequent year of sponsorship within clause 4(b),  or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a renewal of a sponsorship agreement or arrangement on or after 1
January 1995 within clause 4(c),</i>
<P>

<i>so as to entitle the Plaintiffs to a fee of fifteen per cent or twelve per
cent respectively on sponsorship payments, or on the monetary
equivalent of
goods and services provided by Telecom?</i>
<P>

<b>Subsequent year of sponsorship  --  fifteen per cent fee under clause
4(b)</b>
<P>

259   	The starting point is to consider clause 4(b) of Annexure
"C" in order to determine whether the conditions laid down by that
sub-clause
are satisfied for the fifteen per cent commission to be payable.  In my
judgment they are not.
<P>

260   	The fundamental requirement for commission to be payable
under clause 4(b) is contained in its first two lines prior to the
provisos
which follow.  That requires "any concluded agreement entered into on or prior
to the 31st December 1994".  That clearly
enough means a <i>contractual</i>
agreement for sponsorship of the Association, as the opening words of clause 4
indicate.  Thus ad hoc sponsorship without such an
agreement does not suffice;
indeed its value to the sponsee must be less as it is ad hoc and not
contractual.  Unless clause 4(b)
read in the context of the clause as a whole
including the following provisos, leads to any different interpretation of what
appears
to be the evident meaning of its opening requirement, on no view could
it be said that the agreement entered into with Telstra for
1995 had been
entered into on or prior to 31 December 1994.  This is so, even if the gap
thereafter was not as great as 5 May 1995
when the 1995 Telstra Agreement was
in fact executed;  contractual agreement appears to have been reached in
commercial terms as
early as February 1995, though the precise date is unclear
(paras 120-144).  In particular it could not be said that the 1995 Telstra
Agreement was simply an extension of the 1994 Telstra Agreement;  it differed
in one essential respect, namely that the price or
level of sponsorship was
increased.
<P>

261   	Turning to the provisos, it is clear enough from the
first proviso that what is required is a "concluded agreement" where
(unless
Telecom Australia) the other party was approached or introduced or negotiations
commenced on or subsequent to 1 January 1989.
 There simply was no "concluded
agreement" with Telecom on or prior to 31 December 1994 which extended beyond
that date.  The words
"on any agreement entered into with Telecom Australia"
could not on any rational interpretation override the requirement of a
concluded
agreement entered into on or prior to the 31st December 1994 in the
opening words of clause 4(b).
<P>

262   	The Plaintiffs however rely on the second proviso which
is in these terms:  
<P>

"PROVIDED THAT a fee of fifteen per cent (15%) shall be paid on subsequent
years of the sponsorship where the original sponsorship
was negotiated by the
Consultant and such sponsorship was for a period in excess of one (1) year up
to the date of expiry of that
actual Agreement and no further."
<P>

263   	The Plaintiffs' argument is that this proviso in effect
expands the opening words to embrace any situation where first, the
"original
sponsorship" was negotiated by the Plaintiffs, assuming that that requirement
applies also to an agreement entered into
with Telecom Australia, and second,
the "original sponsorship" was for a period in excess of one year so as to give
rise to "subsequent
years of sponsorship", even though this be under a later
and differing agreement rather than a continuation of the original one.
 The
Plaintiffs' argument is that the original sponsorship of Telstra was entered
into on 28 August 1989 (see Annexure "I", BEC,
at 112).  Furthermore, there is
no dispute that first the Plaintiffs negotiated it and second that the
sponsorship was one for a
period in excess of one year (see Recital B and
clause 2).
<P>

264   	The fallacy in the Plaintiffs' reasoning is that it
relies upon a proviso not to qualify what precedes but to expand what
precedes.
But when one looks at the words of the second proviso, it would be drawing a
long bow indeed to treat the reference to
fifteen per cent as applicable to a
subsequent year of sponsorship where there has been a break in the underlying
agreement such
that it expired on 31 December 1994 and was replaced by a
different one;  meantime the parties proceeded thereafter under an arrangement
of continuing sponsorship whose terms so far as price was concerned remained to
be negotiated.  Indeed that is how I would so characterise
the arrangements as
my earlier findings indicate.  But so characterising them does not assist the
Plaintiffs.
<P>

265   	I have earlier said that I do not consider the words "any
agreement entered into with Telecom Australia", coupled with the
reference to
sponsorship in the second proviso, justify an interpretation that gives Telstra
sponsorship payments any special treatment
in this particular context beyond
that they do not need to be shown to have been the result of Telstra having
been approached or
introduced by the Plaintiffs.  That is reinforced by the
second proviso with its reference to "and no further", clearly directed
to a
sponsorship <i>agreement</i> whose term was in excess of one year, being a
sponsorship agreement entered into on or prior to 31 December 1994.  Clause
4(b) was
not intended to embrace a subsequent differing sponsorship agreement
even if that subsequent agreement extended the actual sponsorship.
<P>

266   	Finally, that fundamentality of finding a
<i>contractual</i> agreement is reinforced by the concluding paragraph to
clause 4 (quoted in para 272 below).  It makes clear the fees are only payable
on contracts, not on ad hoc sponsorship payments.  A "subsequent year of
sponsorship" means in this context a subsequent year of
<i>contractual</i>
sponsorship by way of extension of that same contract.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

267   	The sponsorship agreement between Telecom and the
Defendant of 5 May 1995 did not constitute "a subsequent year of sponsorship"
within the meaning of clause 4(b) of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement and there
is no other basis for applying that provision as a
basis for fifteen per cent
commission on sponsorship payments by Telstra after 31 December 1994.  
<P>

<b>Renewal -- twelve per cent fee under clause 4(c)</b>
<P>

268   	It remains to consider whether clause 4(c) of Annexure
"C" applies to Telstra sponsorship payments after 31 December 1994
so as to
apply the lower fee of twelve per cent on renewal.  This is on the basis that
the sponsorship agreement between Telecom
and the Defendant of 5 May 1995, with
or without such agreement or arrangement as preceded it, comes within the
notion of renewal
as embodied in the opening words of clause 4(c):  "If the
sponsorship arrangement in any concluded agreement of the kind referred
to in
sub-clause (b) of this Clause is <i>renewed</i> for periods commencing on or
after 1st January 1995..."
<P>

269   	I should add that the remainder of clause 4(c) provides
for a rate of twelve per cent commission "whether or not this Agreement
(meaning this Consultancy Agreement) has otherwise terminated through effluxion
of time or by the act of either party to the intent
that this Clause shall
enure for the benefit of the Company until such time as all fees payable
pursuant hereto have been received
by the Company."  Those words as I explain
clearly point to a continuing right to twelve per cent, notwithstanding expiry
or termination
of the Consultancy Agreement, provided there has occurred what
clause 4(c) requires as regards the original sponsorship arrangement
in any
concluded agreement being later renewed.
<P>

270   	The Plaintiffs' argument for contending that clause 4(c)
is applicable to the Telstra sponsorship payments made pursuant
to the 1995
Telstra Agreement is that a distinction is here drawn between the "sponsorship
arrangement" in clause 4(c) and the "concluded
agreement" in that same
sub-clause.  Indeed, based on the interpretation of clause 4(b) which I
consider correct, the two sub-clauses
4(b) and 4(c) do have independent
operation.  They recognise the relatively greater worth to the Association of a
sponsorship agreement
which continues for a longer term (clause 4(b)) and an
agreement which is renewed, earning the lesser percentage of twelve per cent.
However, as I explain below, I do not consider that a mere sponsorship
<i>arrangement</i>, absent any concluded contractual agreement, does suffice
for the twelve per cent commission to be payable.  There is simply no mechanism
for payment of a fee without a sponsorship contract;  see para 272 below.  But
that, as I explain, does not mean the phrase "sponsorship
arrangement" has no
part to play.  Rather it bears upon the degree of permitted difference between
successive sponsorship contracts
denoted by the term "renewed" in clause 4(c).
What I conclude is that the original sponsorship arrangement in a concluded
contract
"entered into on or prior to 31 December 1994" is renewed, for
purposes of clause 4(c), on the basis that the later sponsorship contract
still
gives effect to a continuing sponsorship arrangement, though essential terms of
sponsorship such as price differ as between
contracts and there was a brief
interval between them.  Such an interpretation recognises that a sponsorship
relationship will necessarily
evolve over time, including as to the level of
sponsorship and the opportunities it gives sponsor and sponsee.  The word
"arrangement"
is broad enough to accommodate such an evolution and sensibly
does so.  
<P>

271   	To explain, were the position simply that there was a
subsequent sponsorship <i>arrangement</i> never embodied in a "concluded
agreement" used in the contractual sense, that would disqualify the arrangement
from any commission
under clause 4(c) or at all.  That introduces at least one
rational limitation consonant with the parties evident commercial purpose
on
the Plaintiffs' entitlement to a continuing commission after "this Agreement
[meaning the Consultancy Agreement] has otherwise
terminated through effluxion
of time or by the act of either party...";  see clause 4(c).  The clear intent
of clause 4(c) is that
it should have a continuing operation notwithstanding
the termination of the relevant consultancy agreement, as borne out by the
concluding words "to the intent that this Clause shall enure for the benefit of
the Company until such time as all fees payable pursuant
hereto have been
received by the Company.".
<P>

272   	I should add that the requirement for there being a
concluded agreement of the contractual sense is reinforced by the whole
of the
last paragraph to clause 4, and is clear from the highlighted words quoted
below:
<P>

"The above stated fees are payable on all <b>contracts</b> entered into in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  All fees shall become
payable to the Company <b>upon performance of the Agreement by the other
contracting party</b> (or from time to time if the Agreement provides for
payment from time to time to the Association of lump sums) and receipt by the
Association <b>of the monetary payments owing pursuant to the terms of the
relevant agreement and in the case of agreements for the provision of
goods and
services</b>..." [emphasis added]
<P>

273   	To elaborate, I am satisfied that that clause 4(c)
requires the following elements:
<P>

(i)	An original concluded agreement of a contractual nature ("original
agreement") has been entered into between the sponsor and
the Defendant on or
prior to the 31st December 1994 for sponsorship, such to include any agreement
entered into with Telecom Australia;
<P>

(ii)	A subsequent concluded agreement of a contractual nature ("subsequent
agreement"), is entered into between the sponsor and
the Defendant which may be
one or more of a related series;
<P>

(iii)	Such contract may have a brief gap between it and its predecessor, so
long as it continues broadly contemporaneously with
the sponsorship
arrangement,  and
<P>

(iv)	A continuing sponsorship arrangement subsists, requiring no more than:
<P>

(a)	the same entity or organisation stands behind the relevant activity in
providing financial assistance or assistance in goods
and services to the same
sponsee, with the sponsor seeking to obtain for its product the endorsement,
express or implied, of (here)
admired sportswomen by their continued
association with the sponsor and its logo;  see the definition of "sponsorship"
in <i>10th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shoshana Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2018%20FCR%20285" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 18 FCR 285</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=79%20ALR%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">79 ALR
299</a>,  and
<P>

(b)	a substantial equivalence between the activity sponsored in the original
agreement and the activity sponsored in the subsequent
agreement.
<P>

274   	But such a renewal within clause 4(c) does not require
any identity in dollar amount (or its equivalent in goods and services)
between
the original sponsorship agreement and the subsequent agreements.  Nor need the
two agreements (or subsequent agreements
in the series) follow each other with
no break, so long as the broad character of the sponsorship arrangement
continues.  By the
contract being "broadly" contemporaneous with the
sponsorship arrangement, I mean that the contract need not subsist without
break,
such as where, as here, the sponsorship was briefly in a kind of
temporary holding pattern though never terminated, in the period
after 31
December 1994, or where time is needed to negotiate new commercial terms,
though the sponsorship arrangement continues meantime.
 However, no fee or
commission can be recovered until there is a concluded agreement.
<P>

275   	Likewise for such renewal to come within clause 4(c),
there is no need for the Plaintiffs or either of them to be involved
in the
negotiation of the subsequent agreement or any requirement for the Plaintiffs
to maintain a continuing consultancy relationship
with the Defendant.
<P>

276   	Such an interpretation comes closest to accommodating the
phraseology used by the parties in the relevant consultancy agreement
with its
reference in clause 4(c) to a sponsorship <i>arrangement</i> in a concluded
<i>agreement</i> being <i>renewed</i>.  It respects the necessity to find both
a contractual agreement, and continuity in an overarching sponsorship
arrangement.  The
latter gives some elasticity to what divergence can be
accommodated by the word "renewed", though limited by the requirement of a
continuing sponsorship arrangement.  It thus accords with the parties' evident
commercial purpose in reducing the commission to twelve
per cent where there
has been a renewal by successive agreements, rather than an original long term
of (say) three years.  It is
perfectly understandable that a party introducing
a sponsor or having had sufficient involvement in the original introduction of
the sponsor should have a continuing commission based on the renewal of the
sponsorship arrangement.  The Defendant has the safeguard
of requiring a fresh
concluded contract for sponsorship before any commission is payable.  That is
not to be characterised, as the
Defendant sought to do, as a monopoly right.
Rather it is a reasonable safeguard for the party originally involved in
obtaining the
sponsorship to be rewarded, though at a lesser percentage rate,
for continuation by renewal of that sponsorship, even if that party's
consultancy be not renewed.  Thus, for example, an estate agent is often
protected for commission if a tenant the agent originally
introduced renews the
lease, whether the agent still retains the agency or not.  This recognises that
renewal may have been only
possible because of the agent's original
introduction.  That is hardly a "monopoly right" especially as the agency can
be terminated.
<P>

277   	Much reference was made in both parties' written
submissions to the meaning of the term "renewed", in the context of leases
or
franchises.  That comparison is of limited use.  What is to be renewed is not
the agreement itself but the sponsorship arrangement
embodied in the agreement
(though a new agreement will also be necessary).  Hence the word "renewed"
arises in the more general context
of an overall <i>arrangement</i> rather than
the more precise context of a particular contract.  Thus arrangement has the
sense of a plan arranged between two or
more parties;  see, for example, <i>Top
Performance Motors Pty Ltd v Ira Berk (Qld) Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%205%20ALR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 5 ALR 465.</a>  That
points to a broader interpretation to the term "renew" than if the requirement
were simply a comparison between the original
concluded agreement and any
subsequent agreement.  The comparison is rather to renewal for purposes of a
continuing overarching sponsorship
arrangement as it evolves between
agreements.  That precludes the necessity for each agreement to follow
immediately upon the other
without break.  That said, the absence of any break
in the sponsorship <i>arrangement</i> points to renewal, though it would not be
essential if the arrangement were simply suspended for a brief time with no
substitute
sponsorship. 
<P>

278   	Indeed, a renewed lease can vary in its terms from the
original lease, whether as to rent, term or otherwise;  <i>Trade Practices
Commission v Tooth &amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20142%20CLR%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 142 CLR 307.</a>  The position is even
clearer as to a franchise.
<P>

279   	Thus <i>Esso Australia Ltd v R T &amp; M R Abella Pty
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/523.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 523</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2091%20ALR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 91 ALR 476</a> was decided in relation to the <i>Petroleum Retail
Marketing Franchise Act</i> (1980) (Cth).  At issue was whether a franchise
agreement with followed either a consensual determination of an earlier
franchise
agreement or a holding over from an earlier franchise agreement could
be treated as a "renewal".  The Full Federal Court gave an
affirmative response
in relation to both.  In relation to the consensual termination circumstances
it was said (at 486) that:  
<P>

"The respondent referred to <i>Associated Minerals Pty Ltd v NSW Rutile Mining
Co Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2035%20ALJR%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 35 ALJR 296</a> at 298, as indicating that in ordinary usage
the word `renewal' used in relation to a lease, identifies a lease which is
granted
during, and which follows immediately upon, the term of a lease which
has expired by effluxion of time.  But the 1980 Act, as is
indicated by s3(2)
and (4), is so drawn that a franchise agreement may be a renewal of a franchise
agreement which preceded it and
came to an end before the renewal was
granted."
<P>

280   	Section 3(2) of that Act provided that a reference to an
agreement included a reference to a "terminated or expired" agreement.
 Section
3(4) provided that the terms of the new franchise agreement (in order for there
to be renewal) should not be substantially
different from the provisions of the
original franchise agreement, except in certain identified respects.
<P>

281   	As was pointed out by the Plaintiffs in their written
submissions, clause 4(c) of Annexure "C" similarly applies "whether
or not this
Agreement has otherwise terminated through effluxion of time or by the act of
either party".  Clause 4(c) contemplates
that any renewal might be on <i>or
after</i> 1 January 1995;  thus the renewed term does not have to commence on
the day following the expired term.  Clause 4(c) was clearly
intended to
provide an ongoing benefit.  It is specifically stated that the provision
"shall enure for the benefit of the Company
until such time as all fees payable
... have been received".  Were on the other hand the Defendant's construction
correct, the contractual
benefit conferred on the Plaintiffs by clause 4(c)
would be illusory.  It could be done away with in a moment simply by the device
of arranging a day's break between the expiration of one sponsorship
arrangement and the commencement date of the next.  That would
not accord with
the evident commercial purpose of clause 4(c) to which I have referred.
<P>

282   	The commercial position contemplated by clause 4(c) is
significantly different from the relationship which exists between
a lessor and
lessee, where (only by reason of the rights conferred by the original lease)
the party entitled to the benefit (the
lessee) is empowered to compel the
renewal, if necessary, starting on the day after the expiration of the term.
Here renewal is a
matter of consensual choice by both sponsor and sponsee.
Each has an ongoing and increasing investment in the continuance of the
sponsorship relationship but equally a commercial motivation over time to
squeeze out the original introducing party if possible
-- hence the need for
protection under a clause such as clause 4(c) while the Plaintiffs' leverage
and contribution remain fresh
in the Defendant's mind.
<P>

283   	The Full Federal Court in <i>Esso Australia Ltd</i>
(supra) went on to consider the circumstance of the holding over under the
original franchise agreement, and concluded that, in the
context of the
legislation, the expression "term" did not bear its technical meaning but,
rather, included the whole of the period
of occupation, including that under
any holding over.  In that respect only, their Honours departed from the
reasoning of Hill J
(the trial judge) who dealt with the matter on the footing
that the expression "term" bore its technical meaning.  Hill J's analysis,
however, is relevantly quoted in the Full Court's decision (at 487 .7).  Hill J
said:
<P>

"Nevertheless the wording of s13 of the 1980 Act does rather imply that the
concept of the term of an agreement on the one hand
and the time when the
agreement would expire on the other are both the same.  However, it seems to me
that whether it can be said
that the franchise agreement expired when its term
came to an end, or whether it continued in existence during the holding over
period
notwithstanding that its term had come to an end, <b>I think that where
there has been a franchise agreement which has expired and no new franchise
agreement has been entered into either
with the franchisee or any other person,
a subsequent franchise agreement entered into with the franchisee is properly
to be seen
as a renewal of the franchise agreement, notwithstanding that the
term of the franchise agreement had expired and in respect of the
holding over
period</b>."   [emphasis added]
<P>

On the present facts, the sponsorship agreement with Telstra expired.
Immediately after its expiry no new sponsorship agreement
was entered into,
either with Telstra or any other person.  A subsequent sponsorship agreement
was entered into with Telstra.  Hill
J's analysis supports the conclusion that
that subsequent sponsorship agreement is properly to be seen as a renewal of
the original
sponsorship agreement, notwithstanding that the term of the
original sponsorship agreement had expired.
<P>

284   	Turning again to the present circumstances, it follows
from the interpretation which I consider correct of clause 4(c) that
the fact
that the 1995 Telstra Agreement increased the sponsorship payment or made other
changes, does not alter the essential character
of the sponsorship arrangement,
which I am therefore satisfied was thus renewed in that concluded agreement.
Nor does it matter that
the 1995 Telstra Agreement had a brief gap from the
expiry of its predecessor on 31 December 1994, whether that gap was simply to
mid-February 1995 or till 5 May 1995.  There is ample evidence as set out in my
findings at para 175 that as of 31st December 1994
and in the ensuing period
till commercial and then formal agreement was reached, Telstra and the
Defendant were proceeding on the
basis that they were maintaining no other
sponsorship arrangement than with Telstra and there was every confidence that a
concluded
contractual agreement would be reached.  I have referred earlier to
the numerous "Tenth Anniversary documents" (PX10) which leave
no suggestion
that there was otherwise than a continuing sponsorship arrangement and
relationship.  Even in that intervening period,
on 23 January 1995 a meeting
took place between AWHA and Telecom which discussed "sponsorship renewal" and
"re-launch of Telecom
sponsorship" with the object, inter alia, of obtaining
from Telecom a statement of the form of sponsorship proposal that would need
to
be submitted by AWHA to Telecom for the years 1995 to 1996 in order to obtain a
favourable consideration of it.  Thus there is
the evidence of Ms Ellie Nixon's
affidavit of 1 December 1996 at paras 8-11.  The heading to Ms Nixon's notes of
the meeting -- Annexure
"B" -- plainly indicate that what was regarded as being
discussed was "sponsorship renewal".  
<P>

285   	Apart from Ms Passmore's affidavit at para 14 and Ms
Cawood's first affidavit at para 48, Ms Nixon conceded in cross-examination
that the basis of the proposal by the Association were the suggestions
emanating from Telstra via Ms Passmore;  see T, 313 .42-322
.27 and note also
the cross-examination of Ms Passmore at T, 277 .1-288 .36 and of Ms Cawood at
T, 398 .15.  Whilst the sponsorship
proposal which was submitted in consequence
of the meeting held on 23 January 1995 sought a sponsorship amount which was
significantly
less than that sought by Ms Jones in August 1994, the commercial
content of the proposal was otherwise the same.  Mr O'Neill gave
this evidence
(T, 254):
<P>

"Q.	Was your only real focus (in assessing the 1995 proposal) to make sure the
money was right?
<P>

A.	To make sure that what we had was commercially viable.
<P>

Q.	Does that mean that your only focus was to make sure the money was right?
<P>

A.	No, it was not.
<P>

Q.	What other matters did you say you considered in 1995?
<P>

A.	What was actually part of the proposal was in place before 1994, if we had
the <b>same dozen eggs</b> we would pay the same freight, same money for
anything else that we could do to actually vamp up the proposal and make it
better
for Telstra."  [emphasis added]
<P>

286   	When reference is made to the substance of the proposal,
clearly enough there was, to use Mr O'Neill's words, "the same dozen
eggs",
though with some "vamping up" of the proposal making it better for Telstra in
terms of the relevant opportunities.
<P>

287   	That the Defendant and Telstra engaged in a course of
conduct designed to deliberately cloak the new sponsorship agreement
with the
character of a "new" agreement the result of "extensive negotiations", rather
than a renewal, clearly supports the Plaintiffs'
case that this was mere
window-dressing, legal camouflage.  That, as I have already pointed out,
reflected the optimistic legal advice
originally obtained on 19 October 1994
from Lane &amp; Lane (as to how a renewal might be avoided) and who remained
involved in the
drafting of the relevant agreement.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

288   	It thus follows that such break as occurred in the
binding contractual position as between Telstra and AWHA did not preclude
clause 4(c) applying and in particular did not interrupt the ongoing
sponsorship arrangement.  Contract and sponsorship arrangements
were broadly
contemporaneous, in the sense I have used earlier.  That ongoing sponsorship
arrangement, coupled with the 1994 and
1995 Telstra Agreements, did therefore
satisfy the requirement under clause 4(c) for renewal.  The consequence of that
is that commission
at twelve per cent is payable under clause 4(c) on all
sponsorship payments by Telstra and on the provision of any goods and services
of a sponsorship nature by Telstra, during such period as a concluded agreement
subsisted as well as the sponsorship arrangement.
 No submissions have been
made to the effect that any subsequent sponsorship agreement with Telstra
concluding with the sponsorship
agreement of 30 June 1998 (see Plaintiffs'
Quantum Bundle at 7) is in any different position from the 1995 Telstra
Agreement.  It
follows that clause 4(c) of the agreement continues to apply
with respect to any Telstra sponsorship payments or provision of goods
and
services by way of sponsorship to or for the benefit of the Association.  The
quantification of total fees plus interest that
follows from that conclusion
can readily be done, based on the work to date;  see Plaintiffs' quantum
bundle.
<P>

<b>Question 6 -- Qantas commission:  </b>
<P>

289   	<i>(a)	If the relevant Consultancy Agreements were not
void for uncertainty and any relevant condition precedent was satisfied, was
any
sponsorship agreement of the Defendant by Qantas, the result of Qantas
"having been approached or introduced or were negotiations
in relation to the
agreement commenced "prior to 1 January 1989", so as to disentitle the
Plaintiffs from commission?</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	On the same basis, did Qantas become a party by novation to the
Australian Airlines Sponsorship Agreement and, if so, whether
such circumstance
precluded the agreement being one for which Qantas was approached or
introduced, or for which negotiations were
commenced, by the Plaintiffs?</i>
<P>

290   	It is important that the manner in which the question is
posed should fairly reflect the operation of the relevant consultancy
agreement, properly construed.  In particular, were the circumstances such that
the Qantas arrangements fell outside any eligibility
for commission to the
Plaintiffs under the relevant Consultancy Agreement or agreements?
<P>

291   	Essentially, the Plaintiffs rely on the contention that
there was no agreement of a sponsorship nature with Qantas, but at
most merely
ad hoc benefits arguably generally available to community groups, until Mrs
Jones successfully negotiated a sponsorship
agreement for the first time on 7
November 1994;  see Annexure "J" of HEJ.  On the evidence, reviewed below, I am
satisfied the Plaintiffs
are right in that contention.
<P>

292   	The Defendant contends that starting from 1986, it is
clear that Qantas was one of the sponsors of the Defendant well before
1
January 1989, citing the following material in support of that contention:
<P>

&#183;	"1986 report (tab 18) at pages 7 and 36;
<P>

&#183;	1987 report (tab 19) at pages 1 and 21;
<P>

&#183;	1988 report (tab 20) at pages 1, 16 and 109;
<P>

&#183;	1989 report (tab 21) at pages 1, and 17 and 3 and 14 of the financial
statements) -- see also page 119 and transcript pages
97 line 30, 108 line 15,
110 line 30 and page 3 of annexure "I" to Mrs Cawood's affidavit of 5 September
1996;
<P>

&#183;	1993 report (tab 22) at pages 2 and 19;
<P>

&#183;	1994 report (tab 23) at pages 2 and 14;
<P>

&#183;	documents evidencing the sponsorship agreement to 1988 (tabs 25-30);"
<P>

293   	To this the Plaintiffs respond that even if it were
correct to describe Qantas as a sponsor, none of the various annual or
other
reports so cited prove any agreement.  As indeed the Defendant contended in the
context of Telstra, it is only upon a contractual
agreement for sponsorship
that a commission or fee is payable, as I have already concluded in relation to
question 5.  Each of the
Consultancy Agreements emphasise the primacy of
contractual sponsorship rather than ad hoc sponsorship.
<P>

294   	Dealing with each of the documents relied upon by the
Plaintiffs as "evidencing the sponsorship agreement to 1988" it is
clear that
none of the arrangements referred to by the Defendant (being the documents from
tab 18 to tab 23 and then tabs 25 to 30
of DX9) constitutes or evidences a
sponsorship agreement.
<P>

295   	Thus, for example, there is a letter from Qantas to the
Defendant dated 20 March 1986 indicating a preparedness on the part
of Qantas
to provide discount travel, a contra of $10,000 and a baggage allowance
(document 26) then there is a letter from the Defendant
to Qantas dated 3 April
1986 accepting the proposal (document 27).  That is not a contractual
sponsorship agreement properly enforceable
as a contract.
<P>

296   	Then on 27 January 1987 there is a letter from the
Defendant to Qantas seeking confirmation that the proposal put forward
in
February 1986 (presumably that in document 25) would be operative for 1987
(document 28).  There is a letter in response from
Qantas to the Defendant
dated 13 February 1987 confirming the availability for 1987 of a nine per cent
discount and a $10,000 contra
(document 29).  Finally, there is a letter from
Qantas to the Defendant dated 8 June 1988 offering only a nine per cent
discount
on the best available fare types for overseas travel undertaken by
officials (document 30).
<P>

297   	I agree with the Plaintiffs' contention that the
documents identified in the Defendant's tender bundle do not prove any
sponsorship
"agreement".  Nothing was promised on the part of the Defendant in
the terms of the provision of either the nine per cent discount,
the $10,000
contra or the baggage allowance.  If Qantas had unilaterally decided to
withdraw these privileges, no claim could have
been successfully brought by the
Defendant alleging any breach of contract.
<P>

298   	The transcript references to the evidence of Ms Jones
take the matter no further.  Ms Jones did, however, give relevant evidence.
She denied (at T, 90. 52) that she was aware of any previous "sponsorship
agreement" with Qantas.  In her professional opinion a
sponsorship only existed
if the Association gave benefits in return (T, 98 .20).  Contra travel was only
a form of sponsorship if
the Association gave benefits (T, 98 .40).  The group
travel discount arrangement was not sponsorship (T, 99 .1).  Sponsorship
required
"a very detailed agreement with tenure that lists benefits for both
parties and is much more involved than simply a marketing deal"
(T, 105 .42).
A group discount was something that virtually any community group could get (T,
106 .15), and the same was true of
a baggage allowance (T, 106 .20).  Ms Jones
did not regard Qantas as a sponsor prior to her negotiation of the agreement of
7 November
1994 (T, 110 .35).  The reference in the annual reports to Qantas
being a sponsor represented the loose public use of the term "sponsorship"
(T,
111 .20);  it was not an agreement for sponsorship contemplated by the
Sponsorship Agreements.
<P>

299   	Ms Cawood's first affidavit annexes, as annexure "I", the
sponsorship agreement between the Association and Telstra.  That
agreement
referred in clause 2 (page 117 .2 of the affidavit) to Qantas' minor
sponsorship.  Ms Jones was not, however, a party to
that agreement.  Even if
she had been, the statement contained within it would be no more than an
admission.  The evidence manifestly
fails to demonstrate any sponsorship
agreement with Qantas prior to the Consultancy Agreements.
<P>

300   	In determining what meaning is to be given to the
sponsorship referred to in clause 4(a) of the Consultancy Agreements, in
resolving any ambiguity regard can properly be had to the conduct of the
parties where probative, as here, of a mutual subjective
intention at the time
of contracting;  see <i>Spunwill Pty Ltd v BAB Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2036%20NSWLR%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 36 NSWLR 290.</a>
In this regard, if is highly significant that when the Plaintiffs made a claim
for commission in respect of the Qantas agreement,
the discount travel
arrangement was not relied upon by the Defendant at any time prior to the
commencement of these proceedings as
a basis for denying the Plaintiffs'
commission.  The sole basis of denial, now apparently abandoned was the pleaded
assertion that
there had been effective novation from Australian Airlines to
Qantas.  For example, on 5 December 1994 the Defendant wrote to the
Plaintiffs
(HEJ  Annexure "O") stating:
<P>

"It is noted you have requested payment of 15% of the agreement entered into
with Australian Airlines (now known as Qantas) and
hereby draw your attention
to annexure "C" -- Fees -- Clause 4(a) of the Association's Agreement with
you.
<P>

I confirm that the Association has previously had agreements with Australian
Airlines (now known as Qantas) and accordingly, no
fee is payable."
<P>

And by 6 February 1995 the Defendant had accepted that a commission was
properly payable to the Plaintiffs on, at least, the overseas
component for the
Qantas sponsorship (as overseas travel was not part of any Australian Airlines
sponsorship) (PTB, 82).
<P>

301   	Accordingly, I conclude that there was no agreement and
in particular no agreement for sponsorship with Qantas prior to the
agreement
for sponsorship of 7 November 1994 and it is undisputed that that agreement was
negotiated by Mrs Jones.
<P>

302   	Turning to the specific provisions of the relevant
Consultancy Agreements, from the very first sponsorship agreement in 1989,
commission is payable if an agreement for sponsorship is "negotiated and/or
concluded by First or Second Plaintiff";  see clause
2 of the 1989 Agreement
and clause 3 of each succeeding agreement.
<P>

303   	Then clause 3(a) of the 1989 Agreements precludes any fee
being payable on any agreements "entered into by the World Cup
with a person or
company with whom the Australian Women's Hockey Association Inc have previously
had <i>an agreement</i> except in relation to Telecom Australia".  [emphasis
added]  That preclusion is thus not for prior ad hoc <i>arrangements</i>.
<P>

304   	The later agreements in clause 4(a) similarly preclude
any fee on any "agreements entered into by the Association on or prior
to the 1
July 1991 (see the 1991 Consultancy Agreement).  In subsequent agreements later
dates were substituted, with 31st December
1994 and 1st January 1989 appearing
in clause 4(b) of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement.  Naturally, in the agreements
after 1989 there
is a proviso to ensure that the Association is not relieved
from the payment of any fee payable in relation to any such agreement
payable
under any previous Consultancy Agreement whilst clause 4(b) in the concluding
proviso only precludes a fee being payable
where a fee has already been paid
relating to the <i>whole</i> period of sponsorship.  No fee has been paid to
Mrs Jones relating to the whole period of the Qantas sponsorship.
<P>

305   	It must follow that there being no prior <i>agreement</i>
with Qantas in the nature of a sponsorship agreement, the relevant 1994
Consultancy Agreement is not precluded from application.
 
<P>

306   	Thus insofar as the agreement of 7 November 1994 has
continued application, clause 4(b) would apply at the rate of fifteen
per cent
on the monetary amount of any Qantas cash payment sponsorship and, so far as
the provision of goods and services, in particular
air travel, that is applied
to "the monetary benefit" for the supply of the relevant goods and services.
That means comparing the
discounted price to the ordinary market value or price
of the relevant tickets, available to the Defendant elsewhere.
<P>

307   	No detailed submissions have been made in relation to
payments other than pursuant to the agreement of 7 November 1994 and
thus I
make no determination in relation to that issue.
<P>

308   	I accept the Plaintiff's contention as to quantum, that
absent any contradictory explanation from the Defendant, the only
available
inference is that fares which were paid for by the Defendant for the period of
the Qantas sponsorship agreement were fares
which were discounted in accordance
with the Qantas sponsorship agreement.  I note that an updated schedule will be
provided when
the case on quantum is closed so as to precisely calculate the
relevant sponsorship payment.
<P>

309   	I should add, for completeness, that I do not consider
that the novation argument has been substantiated and indeed it was
not pressed
in the Defendant's written submissions.  Essentially the contention is that in
1993 Australian Airlines Limited and Qantas
Airways Limited merged and that
prior to that date, namely for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994,
Australian Airlines
entered into a sponsorship agreement with the Defendant;
see letter dated 15 April 1992 from Australian Airlines Limited.  Insofar
as
Qantas became a sponsor of the Defendant by novation of the Australian Airlines
agreement or by implied agreement, that can bear
only upon commission with
respect to the Australian Airlines agreement and not upon commission payable
pursuant to the Qantas agreement
of 7 November 1994.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

310   	The Plaintiffs are entitled to commission or fees in
respect of all monetary payments or for (relevantly) the provision of
services
by Qantas pursuant to the sponsorship agreement of 7 November 1994, in such
amount as to be quantified, upon the basis set
out in this judgment.
<P>

<b>Question 7  --  <i>Quantum Meruit</i> entitlement:  </b>
<P>

311   	<i>If clauses 3 and 4 of Annexure C to the consultancy
agreement(s) are void for uncertainty are the Plaintiffs or either of them
entitled
to any reasonable remuneration based on quantum meruit and if so, in
what sum?</i>
<P>

312   	These questions do not arise, as I have earlier concluded
that the relevant Consultancy Agreements are not void for uncertainty.
<P>

<b>OVERALL CONCLUSIONS</b>
<P>

(1)	The relevant Consultancy Agreements are not void for uncertainty and the
Plaintiffs were not in breach of them even if, contrary
to my conclusion, the
alleged breaches could have precluded payment.  The attack on Mrs Jones' credit
fails and should not have been
made without properly putting to her in
cross-examination the serious allegations made.
<P>

(2)	The commissions or fees with respect to the Telstra sponsorship arrangement
as embodied in the 1995 Telstra Agreement and any
subsequent sponsorship
agreement are payable at twelve per cent on payments made directly or to a
third party for the Defendant's
benefit, or upon the market value of goods and
services provided calculated as I have earlier set out;  such fee is paid
pursuant
to clause 4(c) of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement (and not at fifteen
per cent pursuant to clause 4(b)).
<P>

(3)	The Qantas sponsorship as embodied in the Qantas sponsorship agreement of 7
November 1994 gives rise to a fee of fifteen per
cent on the monetary amount of
any Qantas cash payment sponsorship and so far as discounted tickets are
concerned, by comparing the
discounted price to the ordinary market value or
price of the relevant tickets, as available to the Defendant elsewhere.  This
is
pursuant to clause 4(b) of the 1994 Consultancy Agreement, there being no
prior Qantas sponsorship agreement, but merely ad hoc benefits.
<P>

(4)	There is no proper basis for denying the First Plaintiff the sums of
$461.63 and $12,000 payable pursuant to clause 4(b) of
the 1993 Consultancy
Agreement in relation to Telecom payments associated with the Telecom Stix
series in 1993.
<P>

(5)	Quantification of the relevant amounts payable to the Plaintiffs, including
interest, should now be completed, based on the
Plaintiffs' quantum bundle and
in accordance with my determinations in this judgment.
<P>

<b>COSTS AND ORDERS</b>
<P>

313   	The Plaintiffs have been successful in relation to their
claims both with respect to Telstra and Qantas sponsorship and thus
costs
ordinarily should follow the event.  However, I give leave to the parties to
address me on costs if they desire.
<P>

314   	Subject to any quantification that may be required in
relation to final calculation of amounts payable and interest thereon
at the
relevant rates, in respect of which it would be desirable for the parties to
co-operate, I direct that the parties within
twenty-one days of the date of
this judgment provide draft orders giving effect to this judgment.
