<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   By summons dated 25 May 1999 the
plaintiffs, Pasquale Barbaro, Guiseppe Barbaro and Franceco Catanzariti sought
orders against
the Director of Public Prosecutions that two warrants issued
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/" class="autolink_findacts">Listening Devices Act, 1984</a> (the Act) were void and, in the
alternative, that the evidence obtained pursuant to each of such warrants was
inadmissible in criminal
proceedings against the plaintiffs currently pending
in the Local Court at Griffith.  The warrants in question were styled ST
97/263(b)
and ST 97/286(a) and were dated 24 November 1997 and 15 December 1997
respectively.
<P>

2   	On 23 August 1999 the plaintiffs filed an Amended Summons
in which relief identical to that sought in the original summons
was claimed
but in which the Commissioner of Police was joined as an additional defendant.
When the matter was called on for hearing
the plaintiffs sought to file a
Further Amended Summons and to discontinue the proceedings as against the
Director of Public Prosecutions.
 This was consented to, subject to later
argument as to certain costs.
<P>

3   	The Further Amended Summons claimed:
<P>

<i>"1.  A declaration that the warrant styled ST 97/286(a) and issued by Dowd J
on 15 December 1997 is void.</i>
<P>

<i>2.  An Order quashing warrant styled ST 97/286(a).</i>
<P>

<i>3.  A declaration that the use of a listening device by Michael Nanai on or
after 15 December 1997 was not authorised by warrant styled
ST 97/286(a), a
warrant issued by Dowd J on 15 December 1997."</i>
<P>

and other consequential relief.
<P>

4   	During the course of argument senior counsel for the
plaintiffs by way of alternative relief sought a declaration that warrant
ST
97/286(a) did not authorise the use of a listening device at any time after 15
December 1997.  The warrant, the subject of the
proceedings, was obtained for
the purposes of gathering evidence against the plaintiffs each of whom stands
charged with an offence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s319.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 319</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, namely that between
2 November 1997 and 21 December 1997 they did an act to pervert the course of
justice.  Guiseppe Barbaro also
stands charged with an offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s323.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 323(a)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, namely influencing a witness on or about 13 December
1997.
<P>

<b>THE FACTS</b>
<P>

5   	On 15 December 1997 warrant ST 97/286(a) was issued by Dowd
J on an application made by Detective Senior Constable Jobson on
behalf of
Detective Senior Constable Littame.  The warrant was in the following form:
<P>

<i>"WARRANT</i>
<P>

<P>

<i>Dated:  15 December 1997</i>
<P>

<i>			............................</i>
<P>

<i>			The Honourable Justice DOWD"</i>
<P>

6   	Later on the same day Sergeant O'Hearn of the Special
Technical Investigations Branch of the New South Wales Police Service
fitted
two listening devices (the devices) to Michael Nanai (Nanai) at the Griffith
Detective Office.  One of the devices was a transmitter,
the other a recorder.
Later on that evening Sergeant O'Hearn operated the devices and they were used
to transmit, listen to and record
a private conversation between Nanai and
another person.  Later on the same evening the devices were removed from Nanai
by Sergeant
O'Hearn.
<P>

7   	At about 5.45pm on 19 December 1997 Senior Constable
Kerman, also of the Special Investigation Branch of the New South Wales
Police
Service, fitted two devices to Nanai at the Griffith Detective Office, one a
transmitter, the other a tape recorder.  Shortly
thereafter he activated both
devices and they were later used to transmit, listen to and record private
conversations.  Later that
same evening Senior Constable Kerman removed the
devices from Nanai.
<P>

8   	At about 5.30pm on 20 December 1997 Senior Constable
Stylianou, another officer of the Special Technical Investigation Branch
of the
New South Wales Police Service, fitted two devices to Nanai at the Detectives
Office at Griffith police station.  Again, one
of the devices was a
transmitter, the other was a tape recorder.  The devices were activated by
Senior Constable Stylianou shortly
after 6.30pm and de-activated by him shortly
after 8pm.  They were re-activated by him shortly before 10.45pm and then used
to transmit,
listen to and record a private conversation.  A littler later
Senior Constable Stylianou de-activated the devices and they were removed
from
Nanai by him.
<P>

9   	The police wish to use the evidentiary material gathered in
the manner set out above in the prosecution of the plaintiffs.
 The plaintiffs
resist this on what ultimately became two bases, namely:
<P>

1.	That Nanai used the devices although not authorised to do so by warrant ST
97/286(a) of 15 December 1997 because Nanai was not
named in the warrant as an
authorised user of the devices.
<P>

2.	The use of the devices by Nanai was outside the terms of the relevant
warrant since no period was specified in the warrant during
which it was to
remain in force.
<P>

<b>THE LEGISLATION</b>
<P>

10   	The Act imposes a prohibition on a person using a
listening device to record or listen to a private conversation (s 5(1)).
 This
is subject to certain exceptions, the relevant one being that set out in s 5(2)
of the Act which provides:
<P>

<i>"(2) Sub-section (1) does not apply to:</i>
<P>

<i>(a) the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant granted under Pt
4."</i>
<P>

11   	A listening device is defined as:
<P>

<i>"Any instrument, apparatus, equipment or device capable of being used to
record or listen to a private conversation simultaneously
with it taking
place."  (s 3)</i>
<P>

12   	Part 4 (ss 15-21) of the Act deals with warrants.  Section
16 provides that:
<P>

<i>"(1) Upon application made by a person that the person suspects or
believes:</i>
<P>

<i>(a) that a prescribed offence has been or is about to be or is likely to be
committed, and</i>
<P>

<i>(b) that for the purpose of an investigation into that offence or of
enabling evidence to be obtained of the commission of the offence
or the
identity of the offender, the use of a listening device is necessary, </i>
<P>

<i>an eligible Judge may, if satisfied there are reasonable grounds for that
suspicion or belief, authorise by warrant, the use of the
listening
device."</i>
<P>

13   	Section 16(2) specifies five criteria to which the
eligible Judge shall have regard in determining whether a warrant should
be
granted.  Provision is then made in s 16(3) in relation to the authorisation of
entry onto premises for the purposes of installing
and retrieving a listening
device.
<P>

14   	Section 16(4) prescribes those matters which are to be
specified in the warrant:
<P>

<i>"(4)  A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall
specify:</i>
<P>

<i>(a) the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is
granted,</i>
<P>

<i>(b) where practical the name of any person whose private conversation may be
recorded or listened to by the use of a listening device
pursuant to the
warrant, </i>
<P>

<i>(c) the period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the
warrant is in force,</i>
<P>

<i>(d) the name of any person who may use a listening device pursuant to the
warrant and the persons who may use the device on behalf
of that person,
</i>
<P>

<i>(e) where practicable, the premises on which a listening device is to be
installed, or the place at which a listening device is to
be used, pursuant to
the warrant,</i>
<P>

<i>(f) any conditions subject to which premises may be entered or a listening
device may be used pursuant to the warrant, and </i>
<P>

<i>(g) the time within which the person authorised to use the listening device
pursuant to the warrant is required to report pursuant
to s 19 to an eligible
Judge and the Attorney General."</i>
<P>

15   	Whilst no form of warrant is prescribed, s 16(6A) provides
that a warrant may be in or to the effect of the form set out in
Schedule 2.
<P>

<b>RELIEF SOUGHT</b>
<P>

16   	A warrant under the Act is issued under the hand of an
eligible Judge (s 16(1)).  An eligible Judge is one who has consented
to be
nominated by the Attorney General under s 3A(3) of the Act as an eligible
Judge.  Such a person has, in relation to any function
conferred by the Act,
the same protection and immunity as a judge of the Supreme Court has in
relation to proceedings in the Supreme
Court (s 3A(4)).  Thus the person who
issues a warrant under the Act does so as a designated person authorised as
such to do so.
<P>

17   	This statutory regime and the very nature of the warrant
mark out its issue as different from an exercise of conventional
judicial
power.  This was recognised in <i>Ousley v The Queen</i> (1997) 192 CLR 69 at
100 per McHugh J where it was said that the issue of a warrant under the
Victorian equivalent Act was far removed
from the exercise of the judicial
power of the Supreme Court and an administrative not a judicial act.  Once so
classified the person
affected by the warrant may seek judicial review of it
and have it declared void or set aside.
<P>

18   	The relief sought by the plaintiffs in the Further Amended
Summons and in the course of argument is therefore within jurisdiction
and
properly framed.
<P>

<b>CONSTRUCTION OF THE ACT</b>
<P>

19   	The right to integrity of property is axiomatic in our
law.  The claim to privacy of conversations is of more recent origin
and
recognition (see for example <i>Ousley v The Queen</i> (1997) 192 CLR 69 at
141).  The Act authorises intrusion into private property and permits an
impingement on the privacy of the conversations
of particular individuals.
<P>

20   	A statute which has such an effect should be strictly
construed (<i>Ousley v The Queen</i> (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 141; <i>Inland
Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Limited</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1979/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20952" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 952</a> at 997, 1008,
1017; <i>Haynes v Attorney General (NSW)</i>, Supreme Court of NSW (unreported,
9 February 1996, James J)).  However, it is important to bear in mind that "a
practical rather
than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants
permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those the subject of
them" should be taken (<i>Ousley v The Queen</i>, supra, at 141 per Kirby J),
and that courts should "not be over zealous to search for ambiguities or
obscurities in words which
on the face of them are plain" (<i>Inland Revenue
Commissioners v Rossminster</i>, supra, at 1008).
<P>

21   	It behoves those who wish to rely on warrants that permit
intrusion into private property or impingement on private conversations
to
exercise a high degree of care in the preparation of the warrants they seek, so
that on or from their faces they correctly and
clearly specify those matters
required by the relevant legislation.
<P>

<b>ATTACKS ON THE WARRANT</b>
<P>

22   	The first provision of the Act relied on by the plaintiffs
in their attack on the warrant is s 16(4)(d).  It provides that:
<P>

<i>"(4) A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall
specify</i>
<P>

<i>(d) the name of any person who may use a listening device pursuant to the
warrant and the persons who may use the device on behalf
of that
person."</i>
<P>

23   	The word "shall" should be given its ordinary mandatory or
obligatory meaning, that is, it is the equivalent of "must".  The
section is in
a form almost identical to s 4A(c) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/lda1969181/" class="autolink_findacts">Listening Devices Act 1969</a> (Vic), in
which the word "must" is used instead of the word "shall".  The effect of the
two words in the corresponding sections is
however in my opinion the same.
<P>

24   	Senior counsel for the plaintiffs argued that unless the
warrant in the present case expressly stated on its face that Nanai
was either
the user or a person who may use the device on behalf of the user of the
device, the requirements of s 16(4)(d) of the
Act were not complied with.  He
argued that the warrant had to include Nanai's name in the list of persons that
follows the words
"and on her behalf" in par 2 of the warrant, if Nanai was to
be authorised to use the devices.
<P>

25   	Even if it be assumed that merely being the carrier of the
devices, as Nanai was, constitutes use of such devices, in my opinion
the
warrant as issued was not in breach of s16(4)(d).  If having the devices
attached to his person for the purposes of recording
or listening to certain
private conversations constitutes use of the devices, then par 2 of the warrant
makes it clear that Nanai
was to use the devices.  Not only is his name
specified in the warrant but the actual nature of the activity to be undertaken
by
him, which on the assumption made above constitutes use, is also
specified.
<P>

26   	This is to be contrasted with the situation of those
police officers whose names are referred to in the long list of names
set out
in par 2 of the warrant.  Whether such officers would be activating, adjusting
or monitoring the output from the listening
device and tape recorder in
question is not specified in the warrant, nor need it be.
<P>

27   	The warrant in my opinion not only specifies Nanai's name
but also specifies the nature of the role he is to undertake in
elation to the
devices.  That conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the first argument
advanced by the plaintiffs in the attack
upon the warrant.  However, in my
opinion, the attack upon the warrant based upon s 16(4)(d) fails for an
additional reason, namely
that Nanai did not within the meaning of that
sub-section use the devices.
<P>

28   	The word "use" is not defined in the statute.  It must
therefore bear its ordinary English meaning in the context in which
it occurs.
It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that a number of steps were
involved in gathering evidentiary material by
means of a listening device.
These were placement, activation, operation and consequent recording of private
conversations.  Senior
counsel for the plaintiffs contended that each of these
steps involved its "use" within the meaning of s 16(4)(d) as did its servicing,
that is adjusting and ensuring that it operated effectively.
<P>

29   	In s 16(4)(d) the word "use" is a verb.  As a verb its
ordinary meaning is to cause to act, put into operation, serve for
a purpose or
put to some purpose.  The purpose to which the listening devices were to be put
or which they were to serve was to record
or listen to certain private
conversations simultaneously with their taking place. Their use involved them
being put into operation,
that is their activation and the recording by them
of a conversation or conversations.  Before activation and recording occurred,
a placement of the devices in particular premises, place or places, or on a
particular person is required.  However, the premises
or places in which a
listening device is installed are not part of its use, rather they are the
circumstances in which the use is
to take place.
<P>

30   	The terms of s 16(4)(e), which speak of the premises "on
which" and the place "at which" a device "is to be used", make a
distinction
between the premises and place on the one hand and the use of the device on the
other.
<P>

31   	I see no distinction in principle between premises, a
place and a person in this regard.  The premises or place is <i>where</i> the
device is to be used.  Each is the depository for the device.  So too may a
person be. In such a case he or she is where or on
whom the device is
installed, that is the depository for the device, the place or situation at or
in which the device is to be used.
 That the person is capable of movement is
not to the point.  A car in which a listening device may be fitted is also
movable, but
the car in question does not use the device.
<P>

32   	Nanai did not fit the devices to himself nor did he
activate the devices, nor did he operate them.  All of these things were
done
by police officers whose names were included as persons who may use the device
on behalf of Constable Littame.  Likewise Nanai
did not record the
conversations in which he took part nor did he cause them to be recorded on the
tape recorder affixed to him or
listened to or recorded at the listening post
to which the transmitter was directed.  In relation to the devices he was a
mere carrier
and in the circumstances I am of the opinion that this does not
constitute use by him of the devices within the meaning of s 16(4)(d)
of the
Act.
<P>

<b>AS TO SECTION 16(4)(c)</b>
<P>

33   	The second ground on which the plaintiffs seek to avoid
the warrant styled ST 97/286(a) is that no period was specified in
it during
which it was to remain in force.  This attack is based upon s 16(4)(c) of the
Act:
<P>

<i>"(c) The period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the
warrant is in force."</i>
<P>

34   	For present purposes the critical word in s 16(4)(c) is
"period".  The ordinary meaning of "period" connotes an interval of
time.  In
order to determine what that interval is, it is necessary to know the event or
circumstance which constitutes the beginning
and the event or circumstance
which constitutes the end.  The interval between the two is properly described
as a period.  It is
this which must be specified in the warrant.
<P>

35   	That such a meaning was intended by the Legislature is to
some extent supported by the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Act.
 Although the
form set out in that schedule does not have to be used, the Act provides that a
warrant under s 16 may be in or to
the effect of the form set out in the
schedule.  That form provides for a number of matters including the period
during which the
warrant is to be in force and the period within which a report
is to be made pursuant to s 19 of the Act to the Attorney General
and to an
eligible Judge.  The relevant parts of the form of warrant set out in Schedule
2 of the Act are:
<P>

<i>"6.  Fix the period ___ am on _________ 19__ until  __ pm on 19__ (or as the
case may be) as the period during which this warrant
is to be in force.</i>
<P>

<i>7.  Fix (period after event) as the period within which the person
authorised to use the listening device pursuant to this warrant
is required to
report pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/" class="autolink_findacts">Listening Devices Act 1984</a> to an eligible Judge
and to the Attorney General."</i>
<P>

36   	The period that the warrant is to remain in force is
relevant not merely to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)(a)</a> of the Act, which permits
the recording of private conversations in specified circumstances, but also to
the reporting provisions
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19</a> of the Act.  In the instant case the time for
reporting under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19</a> of the Act was fixed as "the period of 28 days after the
expiry of this warrant."
<P>

37   	It was argued on behalf of the defendant that the date 4
January 1997 was clearly an error and was undoubtedly intended to
be 4 January
1998.  No argument to the contrary was advanced by senior counsel for the
plaintiffs, indeed in the course of his submissions
he conceded that the typing
of the year 1997 "was probably intended to read 1998".  Thus it is common
ground that there was an error
on the part of the person preparing the warrant
and an oversight on the part of the designated person, that is the eligible
Judge,
who granted it.  According to the argument of counsel for the defendant,
his intention must have been to have the warrant cease to
be in force on 4
January, 1998.
<P>

38   	In this context it is relevant to recall what was said by
Kirby J in <i>Ousley v The Queen</i> (supra at 144):
<P>

<i>"...the approach of strictness requires, for the protection of the
fundamental rights involved, that a court should not be overly
astute to
sustain a warrant which, on its face, reveals relevant defects...But when a
real defect can be demonstrated, courts err,
rightly in my view, on the side
defensive of the fundamental rights of the individual affected."</i>
<P>

39   	However, senior counsel for the plaintiffs further
submitted, correctly in my opinion, that the intention of the eligible
Judge
who issued the warrant is not relevant.  He further submitted that the warrant
must be good on its face in order to be valid.
<P>

40   	Counsel for the defendant sought to meet this attack on
the warrant by submitting that the words and figures "until 4.30pm
on 4 January
1997" in par 3 of the warrant should be severed from the warrant.  If this were
done, so the argument ran, the warrant
would have in it a definite starting
point nominated and, by inference, a fixed end point, namely 12 midnight on 15
December 1997.
 However, if the words referred to above were deleted then par 3
of the warrant would read as follows:
<P>

<i>"Fix the period 4.30pm on 15 December 1997 as the period during which this
warrant is to be in force".</i>
<P>

41   	Such a construction of the warrant would involve it
applying only at one instant in time.  This is not a period and would
not
comply with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16(4)(c).</a>  Even if the deletions from par 3
of the warrant merely extended to the words and figures "4.30pm on 4 January
1997" (leaving the
word "until" in place) there would still be a problem,
because there is no specified end point on the face of the warrant and having
regard to its nature I do not think that it is appropriate or open for the
court to infer 12 midnight on 15 December 1997 into par
3 of the warrant as the
time when it ceased to be in force.
<P>

42   	In any event the argument on behalf of the defendant on
this aspect of the case assumes that it is appropriate for the court
to amend
the warrant by deleting something which is included in it and by substituting
for the portion deleted something that is
not in the warrant.  I do not think
that the jurisdiction of the court extends to this.  In this regard I agree
with what was said
by James J in <i>Haynes v Attorney General for New South
Wales</i> (Supreme Court of New South Wales, unreported, 9 February 1996).
<P>

43   	For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the
warrant styled ST 97/286(a) does not comply with the requirements of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lda1984181/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16(4)(c)</a>
of the Act, and that as these provisions are mandatory the warrant is void as a
consequence.
<P>

44   	In my opinion a declaration should be made in accordance
with par 1 of the plaintiffs' Further Amended Summons and an order
should be
made in accordance with par 2 of such Further Amended Summons.  I make a
declaration and order accordingly.
<P>

45   	I order the defendant to pay half of the plaintiffs'
costs.
