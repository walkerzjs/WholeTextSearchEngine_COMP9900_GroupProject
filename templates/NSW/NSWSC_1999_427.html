<i>Thursday, 6 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4057/98	DANBECKIM PTY LIMITED   -v-   MMI WORKERS COMPENSATION (NSW)
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:  </b> By summons filed on 25 September 1998 the
plaintiff, Danbeckim Pty Limited, seeks an order that the creditors' statutory
demand for
payment of debt dated 27 August 1998 by the defendant, MMI Workers'
Compensation (NSW) Limited be set aside. 
<P>

2   	Although the summons refers to a demand dated 27 August
1998 the statutory demand the subject of the present proceedings is,
in fact,
dated 15 June 1998.  That demand seeks payment by the plaintiff to the
defendant of the amount of $16,797.14.  That amount
is described in the
schedule to the demand as follows:
<P>

Outstanding Workers' Compensation Insurance premium pursuant to policy No.
MWL0033067 for the period 25 November 1996 to 25 November
1997 (inclusive) for
$13,903.50 plus interest which, at 31 May 1998, amounts to $2,893.64 and
continues at the rate of 1.2 per cent
per month compound, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s172.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.172</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act 1987</a>, total amount $16,797.14.
<P>

3   	Although the demand makes reference in the schedule to a
certain policy, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has seen fit
to place
before the Court a copy of that policy.  It would appear, however, that that
policy relates to Workers' Compensation insurance
taken out in respect to a
business conducted under the name, Deadlock Security Service.  A Business Names
extract which has been
tendered in evidence as part of Exhibit 1 discloses that
for a period of five days during the period in respect to which the statutory
demand relates (being the period from 25 November 1996 to 30 November 1996)
that business was conducted by the plaintiff company.
<P>

4   	Although the demand claims a premium in an amount of
$13,903.50, it appears that after the issue of the demand and after the
institution of the present proceedings, the amount of that premium was reduced
to $110 and that that amount has been paid.
<P>

5   	The balance of the demand relates to interest upon the
premium in the amount of almost $3,000.  It has been submitted on behalf
of the
defendant that whilst the amount of the premium for which the plaintiff is
liable has been reduced from almost $14,000 to
$110, that fact does not, of
itself, have the consequence of reducing the liability of the plaintiff to pay
interest in the amount
claimed.  
<P>

6   	The evidence includes a communication dated 15 March 1999
from the Operations Review Branch of WorkCover Authority, which is
a statutory
entity. That communication refers to the statutory obligations of WorkCover to
administer the requirements of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act </i>1987</a>, in
particular, the provisions of that Act concerning the responsibility of an
employer to supply an insurer with a return relating
to wages, and the
regulations under that Act.  
<P>

7   	That communication from the WorkCover Authority states the
decision of that entity that there is no compelling reason for it
to waive the
interest charge up to the date when the plaintiff's actual wage declaration was
received.
<P>

8   	It is appropriate here to record that the statutory demand
which has been treated by the parties as the subject of the present
proceedings
was not the first such demand made by the present defendant against the present
plaintiff in respect to the insurance
premiums under the policy to which I have
already made reference.  There was an earlier demand dated 11 June 1997, which
claimed
the identical amount of $13,903.50 for outstanding premiums, but a
smaller amount, $653.84 in respect to interest.
<P>

9   	There were communications between the directors of the
plaintiff and the defendant concerning that earlier statutory demand.
 Those
communications essentially related to the assertion on the part of the
plaintiff that it was not and never had been insured
with the defendant and
that another company with a similar name (of which the directors of the
plaintiff were also directors,  but
with which the plaintiff company had no
other relationship), had been insured for workers' compensation with the
defendant.
<P>

10   	In the light of the communications between the plaintiff
with the defendant concerning the earlier statutory demand, it is
somewhat
difficult to understand how the affidavit verifying the demand of 15 June 1998,
being the affidavit of Barry Gordon Lampard
sworn 15 June 1998, could
truthfully say, as that deponent does in paragraph 6 thereof, "I believe there
is no genuine dispute about
the existence of or the amount of the debt to which
the demand relates".
<P>

11   	The present proceedings are brought pursuant to the
provisions of Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.4</a> of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  The
plaintiff relies upon section 459H of that Statute and, in particular,
subsection (1) of that section which provides that the
section has application
where the Court is satisfied, relevantly, that there is a genuine dispute
between the company and the respondent
about the existence or amount of the
debt to which the demand relates.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff submits that there is a genuine dispute as
to the amount of the debt, being the entirety of the amount claimed
in the
demand, other than the sum of $110 (which sum the plaintiff has already paid,
that payment being acknowledged by the defendant).
<P>

13   	Whilst it is possible that at the time when the demand was
served the plaintiff may have been liable for the premium in the
amount claimed
in the demand, nevertheless that amount is no longer owing.   Despite the
submissions on behalf of the defendant to
the contrary, it seems to me that
where an amount is admitted not to be owing at the present time, it would be
quite wrong to allow
the demand in that amount to remain on foot.
<P>

14   	As to the component for interest, it has been submitted by
the defendant that, whilst the amount of the premium was, after
the issue of
the demand, reduced from almost $14,000 to $110 and that amount of $110 has
subsequently been paid, nevertheless the
defendant is entitled to the full
amount of the interest claimed in the demand, that component being $2,893.64,
because, so it is
submitted, the WorkCover Authority has declined to waive the
calculation of that interest.
<P>

15   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, however,
that that interest which has been the subject of representations
to the
WorkCover Authority and of the decision by the WorkCover Authority is not
interest upon the premium which is payable by the
plaintiff to the defendant,
being in an amount of $110. Rather, so it is submitted, that component is in
the nature of a penalty
which may be payable by the plaintiff to the defendant
consequent upon the failure of the plaintiff to provide information concerning
employees in accordance with the statutory requirement in that regard. Thus, so
it is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, it cannot
be interest upon the
amount of any premium which may be payable by the plaintiff to the
defendant.
<P>

16   	If there were no dispute as to the component in the demand
representing the amount of interest, then the appropriate course
would be to
reduce the amount claimed in the demand from the total of $16,797.14 to the
figure in respect of which there was no dispute.
 But I have already expressed
my view during submissions that I find a logical difficulty in understanding
how the defendant can
be entitled to interest calculated in a certain manner at
a certain rate upon a premium in a certain amount, such interest said to
total
almost $3,000, when the premium upon which that interest is calculated is now
conceded by the defendant to be only $110, not
$13,903.50
<P>

17   	It may be that the plaintiff is, in fact, liable to pay to
the defendant an amount equal to the calculations provided by the
defendant in
annexure S to the affidavit of Phillip Mark Day sworn 20 April 1999. But, if
so, it does not seem to me that that liability
is a liability for a component
of the amount claimed in the statutory demand, being expressed to be the
interest for the period specified
at the rate specified upon any outstanding
premium, when that premium is now only $110.
<P>

18   	It seems to me, therefore, that there is a genuine
dispute, not only as to the component for the premium, but as to the component
for the interest claimed in the statutory demand.  Accordingly, therefore, I
propose to order that the statutory demand dated 15
June 1998 be set aside.
<P>

19   	(Counsel addressed on costs.)
<P>

20   	It is noted that the amount of the premium at $110 has
been conceded by the defendant, but only since the wages information
was
provided on 20 November 1998.
<P>

21   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that the statutory demand dated 15 June 1998 served by the
defendant upon the plaintiff be set aside.
<P>

(2)	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff.
<P>

	The exhibits may be returned
