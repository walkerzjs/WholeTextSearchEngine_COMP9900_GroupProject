<i>Tuesday, 18 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3089/98	ALLSTATE EXPLORATIONS NL &amp; ORS   -v-   BEACONSFIELD GOLD NL
&amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> By notice of motion filed on 3 May 1999 the
plaintiffs, Allstate Explorations NL, Allstate Prosecting Pty Ltd and ACN 070
164 653
Pty Ltd seek substantively an order pursuant to Part 31 rule 2 of the
Supreme Court Rules, that certain questions set forth in the
schedule to that
notice of motion be determined separately from any other question or issue in
the proceedings and before any final
hearing of the proceedings.  That
application is contested by the defendants, Beaconsfield Gold NL, Beaconsfield
Operations Pty Ltd
and Beaconsfield Tasmania Pty Ltd.  
<P>

2   	The substantive proceedings arise out of what is referred
to as the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture Agreement.  
<P>

3   	There have been a considerable number of pleadings filed in
these proceedings, including pleadings in relation to a cross-claim
brought by
the defendants.  There have already been a number of interlocutory applications
made in these proceedings.
<P>

4   	In support of the notice of motion there has been filed an
affidavit by Gary Lance Kent sworn on 12 May 1999, he being the
member of the
firm of solicitors for the plaintiffs who is directly responsible for the
conduct of the proceedings.  Mr Kent refers
to evidence upon which the
plaintiffs proposed to rely for determination of the proposed separate
questions.  He expresses an estimate
that a trial of the entire proceedings
would occupy approximately three days but that the determination of the
separate questions
should occupy no more than three to four hours, and refers
to the costs which would be incurred having a full trial of the proceedings,
rather than a determination of the separate questions.
<P>

5   	I have been taken to a number of authorities relating to
the circumstances in which it is appropriate that the Court should
order
separate determination of questions before a final hearing.  In particular, I
have been taken to the decision of the Court
of Appeal in <i>CBS Productions
Pty Ltd v. O'Neill </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 601</a> (especially the judgment of the then
President, Kirby P.)  In that case the Court held (as set forth in the
headnote):
<P>

The procedure under Pt 31 r 2, should be confined to cases which are ripe for
this treatment; a matter is ripe for separate and
preliminary determination
where it is a central issue in contention between the parties, the resolution
of which will either obviate
the necessity of litigation altogether or
substantially narrow the field of controversy.
<P>

6   	I have also been taken to the decision of Giles CJ Comm.
Div. in <i>Tallglen Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v. Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd &amp; Ors
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2022%20ACSR%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 22 ACSR 130</a> where his Honour said at p 141 concerning this
procedure:
<P>

In the ordinary course all issues in proceedings should be decided at the one
time, but separate decision of a question may be appropriate
where, for
example, the decision of the question is critical to the outcome of the
proceedings and (at least if decided in one way)
will bring the proceedings to
an end.   In particular circumstances the separate decision of a question may
be appropriate even if
it will not bring the proceedings to an end, such as
where there is a strong prospect that the parties will agree upon the result
when the core of their dispute is decided or where the decision will obviate
unnecessary and expensive hearing of other questions,
but such occasions must
be carefully controlled lest fragmentation of the proceedings (particularly
when the exercise of rights of
appeal is borne in mind) brings delay, expense
and hardship greater than that which the making of an order was intended to
avoid.
 It is often the case that the need to make findings of fact for a
decision of the separate question, especially findings which may
involve issues
of credit, tells strongly against the making of an order because related facts,
and renewed issues of credit, will
or may arise at a later stage in the
proceedings.  Experience teaches that it should be able to be seen with clarity
that decision
of a separate question will be beneficial in the conduct of the
proceedings and the resolution of the parties' dispute.
<P>

7   	I have also been taken on behalf of the defendants to a
number of other decisions, including <i>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Herbert Smith
&amp; Co &amp; Ors </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20AC%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) AC 93</a>, the judgment of Lord Denning MR and
<i>Radstock Co-operative &amp; Industrial Society Limited v. Norton-Radstock
Urban District Council </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%201%20Ch%20605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 1 Ch 605.</a>  In that latter case Harmon LJ said
at 624:
<P>

"At this juncture I should like to protest against this method of procedure.
This is not a <i>preliminary point </i>at all. It deals with the whole
subject-matter of the action, and without any evidence, and the court is left
in a most unsatisfactory
position and has to guess at many things which, on a
hearing would be properly proved in evidence."
<P>

8   	Essentially, the defendants submit that the matter is not
one which is, in the words of the Court of Appeal in <i>CBS Productions Pty Ltd
v. O'Neill</i>, "ripe for this treatment".  The defendants submit that answers
to the first two of the five questions will not result in a determination
of
the proceedings as a whole, because there will still remain in issue the
defendants' assertion that the plaintiffs, irrespective
of the construction of
the joint venture agreement and irrespective of the legal rights of the
plaintiffs under that agreement, are
yet in breach of a fiduciary duty which,
so the defendants assert, the plaintiffs owed to the defendants.
<P>

9   	Further, the defendants submit that the remaining three
questions which are posed by the plaintiffs in the present application
are
questions which require findings of fact for their determination and that it is
inappropriate that disputed questions of fact
in this case should be the
subject of questions determined separately and before a final hearing of the
totality of the proceedings.
<P>

10   	As I understand it, it is submitted on behalf of the
plaintiffs that if the answers to the questions posed are in one direction,
then those answers will be determinative of the proceedings as a whole, but if
the answers are in the other direction, then the matter
must, of necessity, go
to a final hearing.
<P>

11   	The Court is given a discretion to make an order of the
nature which is presently sought.  The procedure is not limited to
cases which
are regarded as extremely lengthy or extremely complex or extremely expensive.
The purpose of the procedure is to facilitate
a determination of disputes. But
it is not to deprive a party of the entitlement of that party to have its case
heard in an appropriate
fashion by the calling of evidence and the
cross-examination of witnesses concerning disputed questions of fact.  The
disadvantages
of the procedure are highlighted in the extracts which I have
read from the decisions of Giles J in <i>Tallglen </i>and of Harmon LJ in
<i>Radstock</i>.
<P>

12   	Where, as here, the decision on the questions will not, of
necessity, result in the determination of the proceedings, but
will result in
such determination only if the answers go in one direction, it seems to me that
the defendants should not be deprived
of their right to have the matter heard
at a final hearing of the entirety of the proceedings. That is especially so
where, as here,
the defendants have raised on the pleadings the assertion that
the plaintiffs are in breach of a fiduciary duty, and especially to
where, as
here, a decision on some, at least, of the questions must depend upon disputed
questions of fact.  
<P>

13   	I am not satisfied, therefore, that it is appropriate that
the Court should make an order of the nature which is sought in
the present
application. Accordingly I propose to dismiss the notice of motion of the
plaintiffs.
<P>

14   	Does anyone wish to address me concerning costs?
<P>

15   	(Mr Styring sought costs of the notice of motion.)
<P>

16   	(Mr Street submitted it should be a question of the
defendants' costs in the cause.)
<P>

17   	<b>MASTER</b>:  I do not need to hear you on the question
of assessment, Mr Styring.  As a matter of course, I make an order of the
nature which
you have referred to.  I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the notice of motion filed by the plaintiffs on 3 May 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiffs pay the costs of the defendants of the aforesaid
notice of motion.
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the defendants to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>

	All exhibits may be returned.
