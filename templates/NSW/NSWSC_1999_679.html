MASTER MALPASS
<P>

WEDNESDAY 7 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>20166/99</u>	<u>RODNEY WAYNE TRIGGER v MICHAEL JOHN MOLONEY</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	In September 1995, the defendant was carrying on business as a
finance broker.  The plaintiff was the owner of a property at
Weston (the
property).  The plaintiff approached the defendant to arrange a loan on the
security of the property.  The plaintiff
attended at the office of the
defendant and discussion took place between them.  A loan was arranged in the
sum of $10,000.00.  A
solicitor (Diana Karageorge) acted for the plaintiff in
the mortgage transaction.  The transaction was completed and moneys were
advanced to the plaintiff.
<P>

2  	The purpose of the loan had been to enable the plaintiff to go
into a bush rock business with Peter O'Shea.  The plaintiff has
said that he
signed relevant documentation when suffering from the delusion that he was
going to make a lot of money out of the business.
 Following the making of the
advance, moneys were handed over to Peter O'Shea.  It appears that Peter O'Shea
may have gambled away
the moneys.  He then committed suicide.  As a
consequence, the plaintiff did not obtain any benefit from the business dealing
with
Peter O'Shea.
<P>

3  	The mortgage was for a period of one year and had a fixed rate of
interest.  The plaintiff paid interest under the mortgage
and at the end of the
year it was renewed for a further period of one year.  This was done at the
written request of the plaintiff.
 Interest was paid pursuant to the renewed
mortgage.  However, default took place in the payment of the principal at the
end of the
term.  It appears that the plaintiff had received some legal advice
which led him to the view that he should challenge the mortgage
itself.
<P>

4  	Thereafter, the mortgagee brought proceedings founded upon
default under the mortgage and claiming an order for possession.
 These
proceedings remain on foot and are being defended.  A Cross-claim has been
brought against Diana Karageorge.  It appears that
the present proceedings
could have been brought by way of Cross-claim in the possession proceedings,
however because of a perceived
limitation problem separate proceedings were in
fact instituted.  The Court has been informed that arrangements have been made
for
both proceedings to be heard together (subject to the application which is
now before the Court).
<P>

5  	The Statement of Claim was filed on 24 September 1998.  It claims
damages for inter alia depression, anxiety and economic loss.
 The claim is
founded on alleged misleading or deceptive conduct within the meaning of both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
52</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</u> 1974</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act</u> 1987</a>.  It is alleged that four false representations were made by the
defendant.  The alleged representations are as follows:-
<P>

"(a)	The defendant held himself out as a solicitor acting for the plaintiff in
relation to the loan transaction.
<P>

(b)	The defendant stated that the plaintiff was seeking a loan of $10,000.
<P>

(c)	The defendant stated that the plaintiff owned a car to the value of
$7,500.
<P>

(d)	The defendant stated that the plaintiff was earning $500 per week as a
musician."
<P>

These are representations which are alleged to have been made to the mortgagee.
In substance, the thrust of the plaintiff's claim
is that they led to him
getting a loan which was larger than he wanted (he contends that he wanted only
about $4,000).
<P>

6  	The application before the Court is made pursuant to Notice of
Motion filed on 6 April 1999.  The defendant seeks a summary
dismissal of the
proceedings pursuant to Pt. 13 r 5 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules </u>1970</a>.
<P>

7  	The defendant has sworn an affidavit.  The plaintiff has sworn an
affidavit (which annexes an earlier affidavit sworn by him).
 He has been
cross-examined.  There has been a tender of documentation.
<P>

8  	The granting of summary relief has been the subject of more than
abundant authority.  The Court has a discretionary power to
summarily terminate
proceedings prior to trial.  The discretion is exercised having regard to the
relevant circumstances of the particular
case before the Court and so that
justice is best served between the parties.  The onus rests with the applicant.
The view has been
taken that summary relief should only be granted in what may
be described as clear cases (see inter alia <u>Webster v Lampard</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">177 CLR
598).</a>
<P>

9  	In resisting the application, the plaintiff places stress on two
matters.  It is said that the material throws up conflict on
matters of fact
and that the granting of the relief would deprive the plaintiff of the benefit
that may be gleaned from the exercise
of the interlocutory processes of the
Court.
<P>

10  	There is affidavit and other material which does give rise to
some questions of fact (relevant to inter alia the alleged representations).
There is other oral evidence from the plaintiff (as well as other material)
which diminishes the force that may be given to the area
of apparent dispute.
The recollection of the plaintiff is defective.  This is a matter that he
concedes (inter alia he has conceded
that he does not have a good recollection
of what was said during discussion with the defendant).  What he has said
stands in conflict
with a body of documentation.  The defendant's argument that
the plaintiff's evidence which gives rise to that dispute would not
be accepted
is highly persuasive.  There is force in the view that the area of dispute is
more apparent than real.
<P>

11  	Relevant documentation has been made available to the parties
and it seems likely that any further exploration of interlocutory
processes may
not assist in advancing the plaintiff's case.
<P>

12  	But whether or not there may be real questions of fact, I am
satisfied that the plaintiff's claim is otherwise doomed to failure.
 There are
inter alia questions of causation.  It seems to me that these are
insurmountable and that there is no utility in allowing
the proceedings to go
to trial.  I am of the view that the interests of justice are best served by
bringing these proceedings to
an end summarily.  A trial would merely see
needless costs being thrown away and a waste of valuable court time.
<P>

13  	I order that the proceedings be dismissed.  The plaintiff is to
pay the costs of the proceedings.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
