<b><u>5075/98 TANZONE PTY. LIMITED v WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>General Issue</b>
<P>

1  	The main question to be decided in this action is whether Westpac
Banking Corporation (Westpac) as lessee of premises 140-144
Main Street Lithgow
(the premises) is liable to pay rent to Tanzone Pty. Ltd (Tanzone) the owner of
the premises upon terms of the
lease as claimed by Tanzone in the statement of
claim or whether it, Westpac, is entitled to relief by way of rectification of
the
lease or under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> on the ground that Tanzone
has engaged in unconscionable conduct with s51AA of that Act.  
<P>

There are other issues but those are the main claims.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2  	The premises were owned by Westpac but sold and leased back
pursuant to the provisions of a contract which arose on exercise
of an option
granted by Westpac to Mainzeal Overseas Pty. Limited (Mainzeal) dated 30 July
1984.  The option deed had annexed to
it a draft contract which was deemed to
come into existence upon exercise, the terms of which obliged the parties to
enter into an
agreement for lease in accordance with a draft annexed to the
draft contract.  Triden Contracting Pty. Ltd. (Triden), a subsidiary
of
Mainzeal, contracted as a party to the lease to erect a bank building on the
land for occupation by Westpac as lessee.
<P>

3  	The form of agreement of lease contained a means of calculating
the annual rent on a measured area base, provided for review
dates on the
second anniversary of the commencement date and each two years thereafter and
provided by clause 2.02 as follows:
<P>

2.02	The yearly rent payable set out in Clause 2.01 hereof shall be increased
on and from each Review Date to an amount equal to
the greater of:-
<P>

(i)	The amount of the rent payable immediately preceding the Review Date
multiplied by 1.1664 (equivalent to 8% compounded annually),
and
<P>

(ii)	the amount of the rent payable immediately prior to the Review Date
multiplied by X over Y where X is the Consumer Price Index
Weighted Average
Sydney All Groups Number for the quarter last preceding the Review Date and Y
is the Consumer Price Index Weighted
Average Sydney All Groups Number for the
last quarter preceding the Date of Commencement of the term of this Lease.
<P>

4  	The rights of Mainzeal as grantee were assigned to Mr. &amp; Mrs.
Raymond (the Raymonds)the third and fourth cross defendants
in this action.
They exercised the option by notice dated 21 August 1984.  Settlement of the
sale took place on 31 August 1984 the
required agreement for lease being
executed and exchanged that day.
<P>

5  	The building work proceeded in accordance with the agreement for
lease and practical completion was reached on 15 March 1985,
which date
accordingly became the commencement date of the lease.  The lease was executed
upon the agreed terms.  It is dated 10
July 1985 and is registered number
W006367.  It is for a term of twenty years commencing on 15 March 1985,
terminating on 14 March
2005.  The initial rent was calculated in accordance
with the agreement at $69 404.25 so that clause 2.01 and 2.02 of the lease are
as follows:
<P>

2.01.	<u>YEARLY RENT</u>
<P>

The Lessee covenants with the Lessor that the Lessee will during the whole of
the term hereof pay to the lessor without demand from
the Lessor free of
exchange and without any deduction whatsoever the Yearly Rental of $69,404.25
until the first Review Date and
thereafter as determined in accordance with
Clause 2.02 of this Article.
<P>

2.02	The yearly rent payable set out in Clause 2.01 hereof shall be increased
on and from each Review Date to an amount equal to
the greater of:-
<P>

(i)	The amount of the rent payable immediately preceding the Review Date
multiplied by 1.1664 (equivalent to 8% compounded annually),
and
<P>

(ii)	the amount of the rent payable immediately prior to the Review Date
multiplied by X over Y where X is the Consumer Price Index
Weighted Average
Sydney All Groups Number for the quarter last preceding the Review Date and Y
is the Consumer Price Index Weighted
Average Sydney All Groups Number for the
last quarter preceding the Date of Commencement of the term of this Lease.
<P>

6  	On 4 November 1993 Tanzone purchased the premises from the
Raymonds at auction for $1 770 000.  The contract provided that the
property
was sold subject to the lease, a copy of which was attached.  The purchase was
settled on 16 December 1993 by transfer registered
I945409.  The rent being
paid under the lease at the date of the contract was $131,501 per annum.
Clause 30.1 of the contract dated
4 November 1993 was as follows:
<P>

30.1	The property is sold subject to the lease existing as at the date of this
contract and referred to in Schedule 1 (the 'Lease")
the benefit of which shall
be given to the purchaser on completion.  The purchaser acknowledges having
inspected the Lease (a copy
of which is attached) and confirms that it has
satisfied itself in respect of the Lease.  The purchaser cannot make any
objection,
requisition or claim for compensation or rescind or terminate or
refuse to complete this contract as a result of the terms of the
Lease or in
respect of anything lawfully done under the Lease.
<P>

7  	Tanzone mortgaged the property to Perpetual Trustee Company
Limited by Mortgage I945410 to secure a sum of $1 066 600 presumably
applied
towards the purchase moneys.  It seems that the mortgagee thought that the CPI
renewal was on a ratchet basis as did its
valuer, Jones Lang Wootton, which
company considered the purchase price was at the uppermost level.  That firm's
valuation proceeded
on the basis that without the Westpac lease but with a
normal rent with normal increases the property was worth about $800 000, that
above market rents based on 8% annual increases, increased the value by $760
000 which is added to $800 000 and rounded up the figure
to $1.6 million.
<P>

8  	On 14 March 1995 Tanzone wrote to Westpac stating that rent as
from 15 March 1995 being the next review date would be $221 557.69
per annum at
which stage Westpac became acutely aware of the formula in clause 2.02.
Westpac replied that this calculation was not
an accurate reflection of the
agreement as to rent as Tanzone knew or should have known.  There was no real
response to this statement,
although Tanzone did ask what was meant by
"intended review mechanism".  It obviously knew because Mr. Madson of Tanzone
had told
Mr. Raymond there was a mistake in the lease and Tanzone would get
more rent.  About the same time Westpac entered a caveat against
the title to
the leased land.  As that document claimed a leasehold interest under the lease
dated 10 July 1985, which was the lease
registered on the title, and only
prevents registration of dealings affecting that interest, it is difficult to
see its purpose although
it seems to be thought it prevented registration of a
variation of mortgage.  On 26 February 1997 Tanzone sent to Westpac notice
of
increase of rent from 15 March 1997 to $402 059.67 per annum which was
challenged in the same way, this time by Messrs. Allen
Allen and Hemsley acting
for Westpac, the challenge being by letter of 5 April 1997.
<P>

9  	Rent has been paid by Westpac in accordance with its calculations
and accepted by Tanzone without prejudice to its rights under
the lease.  On 21
December 1998 this action was commenced, seeking withdrawal of the caveat and
declarations as to entitlement to
rent as claimed in the review notices,
damages and interest.
<P>

<b>Facts specific to the review clause</b>
<P>

10  	The original discussions which brought about the sale, building
and lease back agreement were conducted by Mr. Mair, Southern
Premises Manager
of Westpac and Mr. Allan Hunt of Triden.  The proposal as finally put forward
was that "rent reviews be every two
years, adjustments to CPI or 8% whichever
is the higher.  These reviews to be established on a compound basis."
<P>

This was accepted by Mr. Mair.  Mr. Hunt said he would have read the option
deed.  He said the intention of Triden and Mainzeal
was that rent "be increased
every two years by 8% compound annually or in line with the increase with the
CPI during the two year
period whichever was higher".  Mr. Mair said that was
his understanding as to what was contained in the lease.  To make things
clearer
I will refer to such a provision as a " CPI ratchet provision" or
"ratchet clause".  Mr. Hearne, solicitor of Messrs. Cowley Hearne,
acted for
Mainzeal.  He deposed that the draft option agreement, which included the draft
agreement for lease, was intended to incorporate
arrangements between Mainzeal
and Westpac arrived at through Messrs. Hunt &amp; Mair and that he understood
the CPI comparison was
"between that immediately prior to the review date and
that at the prior review".  Upon the option being exercised he drafted or
had
drafted the agreement for lease which of course conformed with the draft
option.  Mr. Holtsbaum of the then Messrs. Perkins Stevenson
and Linton, acted
for Westpac on the option.  He wrote to Westpac on 25 June 1984 a letter
containing the following:  "The rent is
to be reviewed on the second
anniversary of the commencement date and thereafter biennially.  The new rent
is to be the greater of
the rent multiplied by 1.1664 (equivalent to 8%
compounded annually) and the current rent increased by the Consumer Price
Index."
 He also said that had he been asked to advise Westpac prior to the
auction of what it should do on the basis that it had brought
to its attention
the result of the wording in the lease, he would have advised Westpac to seek
agreement to a variation, and if that
did not succeed then to seek
rectification, and if that failed to advise purchasers at the auction of the
claim and possibly to consider
purchase itself.
<P>

11  	Mr. Linton solicitor, then a partner in Perkins, Stevenson and
Linton, acted for Westpac on the dealings after the option was
exercised, but
so far as the lease was concerned only checked to ensure that it accorded with
the agreement.
<P>

12  	Mr. J.S. Davis of Messrs. Henry Davis York, acted for Mr. and
Mrs Raymond.  He reviewed the draft lease attached to the option.
 His
understanding was that clause 2.02 related to a ratchet clause, in other words
increases due to the CPI increase during the
two year review period.  The
Raymonds thought the provision was a ratchet provision.  Their statements
admitted into evidence made
that clear, although they appeared reluctant
witnesses which was probably not surprising.  Mr. Davis also acted for the
Raymonds
on their sale to Tanzone.  Messrs. Gillis Delaney Brown acted for
Tanzone and after auction sought information as to the current
rent and how it
was calculated in accordance with clause 2.02 of the lease.  It seems that in
response to this inquiry, or for some
other reason, Gillis Delaney Brown were
furnished with correspondence which showed that increases had been calculated
on the ratchet
formula or the 8% compound whichever was greater.
<P>

13  	By 1993 Westpac had become concerned about the cost of operating
its Lithgow branch, mainly because of its rental cost.  There
was internal
correspondence in Westpac as to the possible purchase of the building or
attempts to negotiate a decrease in rent. 
The concern was about the 8% per
annum compounding increases and not about the literal meaning of the CPI
clause.  It was noted the
property was being marketed with emphasis on the
favourable provisions for increase in rent.  Mr. Leyden, the leasing manager,
was
brought into the picture.  It is clear from a memorandum of his of 8
October 1993, that he thought that the ratchet formula applied.
 He said in
that memorandum:
<P>

Clause 2.02 of the lease provides for a biennial review with a prescribed
increase being the greater of the applicable CPI or alternatively
8% compounded
annually.  Obviously the latter formula increase, which is causing concern to
the branch and to Paul Lahiff applies
in current times."
<P>

The view of Mr. Nass, who was the asset manager in the property and premises
group of Westpac, was the same.  He gave some consideration
to the matter when
making a recommendation to Mr. Robert Gough, the chief manager of the property
and premises group about Mr. Leyden's
suggestion that purchase of the site
should be considered.  At this time a Mr. J.C. Adamson, the senior leasing
coordinator of New
South Wales for Westpac, who reported to Mr. Leyden who
reported to Mr. Nass.  Also reporting to Mr. Nass were Miss Caceda and Mr
Elder.  I am satisfied that it was never thought by any of them that clause
2.02 operated other than as a ratchet provision.  Westpac
decided against
purchase.
<P>

<b>Reviews from 1987 to 1993</b>
<P>

14  	The review for 1987 created no problems.  It was calculated on
the CPI increase but of course the base figure was the original
base figure.
That increase was greater than an increase of 8% per annum compound and was
calculated as follows:  $69 400.25 x 160.10/134.7
= $82 491.65.
<P>

15  	The review for 1989 was again calculated on the CPI ratchet
basis.  The original checking of figures against those put forward
by the
agents for the lessor was carried out at Westpac by Ms Loughran a clerk in the
property and premises department of Westpac
and checked by Mr. Elder.  Ms
Loughran thought that she checked the lease provisions from the document or
from a lease summary, but
the summary in evidence could not have been the one
used.  While the accepted figure was calculated on the ratchet basis Ms
Loughran
did carry out a calculation based on the literal wording of clause
2.02 and was not able to give any real explanation for this, although
she did
say that she considered the calculations agreed with Raine &amp; Horne, the
lessor's agents, were in accordance with the
lease provisions.  She reported to
Mr. Elder, who was supposed to check her calculations, although that does not
seem to have been
done with any great accuracy.  While he was not a perfect
witness, I am satisfied that he considered the rent reviews were to be
on a
basis of the greater of 8% compounded annually and the CPI on the ratchet
basis.  Even if that were incorrect I am satisfied
no one whose knowledge would
be that of Westpac knew of the lack of a ratchet clause in 1989.
<P>

16  	The 1991 and 1993 reviews were calculated on the 8% compounded
basis.
<P>

<b>Action before auction - strange happenings</b>
<P>

17  	The property was advertised for auction to take place on 4
November 1993.  The advertisements were a little misleading, but
a major
selling point was the lease to Westpac with "rental growth assured through
annual increases of 8% or CPI whichever is greater."
<P>

18  	A Sydney barrister, whom it is not necessary to name as he is
neither a party nor a witness, was a customer of what was called
in evidence
the Westpac Private Bank.  It was not suggested this was a separate entity but
rather a part of the bank dealing with
customers of some net worth.  The
barrister wrote on 21 October 1993 to Mr Bush, one of the executive managers at
the private bank,
seeking approval for a loan to a company which would be
acquired and the shares in which would be owned in equal numbers by his family
interests and those of a solicitor partner in Messrs Freehill Hollingdale and
Page.  He sent a copy of the lease to Mr. Bush pointing
out that the rent
review provisions were favourable to the tenant (a mistake for landlord).  He
pointed out that on each review the
rent would increase by not less than 62%
and included various tables showing that an 80% advance on a purchase price of
$1.2 million
would be repaid by March 2000 out of rent after tax and an advance
on a purchase price of $1.4 million would be repaid by March 2001.
 There was
further correspondence supporting this calculation.
<P>

19  	Mr. Bush and his assistant Mr. Ryan, investigated the proposal.
Mr. Ryan checked the rent claim with someone in the property
department.  The
solicitor also checked with that department.  Nobody at Westpac threw up their
hands, in fact the opposite happened,
Mr. Bush recommending that approval be
given to the funding outside the general guidelines because the loan repayments
could easily
be met out of rent and the loan would be repaid over a short
period.  In recommending it for approval Mr. Bush said that part of
the
security should be a charge taken over the rent.  Approval to the loan was
given by Mr. Mayo, manager, NSW Commercial Credit
Centre of Westpac, he stating
that the factors which influenced the decision to proceed outside the normal
guidelines were first,
the quality of the tenant and second, the amortisation
offered which would reduce the loan security ratio in a reasonable time.
<P>

20  	This approved loan did not proceed presumably because the
customers were outbid.  Nevertheless the evidence is relied upon
on the issues
of knowledge, acquiescence and the question of construction.
<P>

<b>Effect of the clause</b>
<P>

21  	Some remarkable figures are set out in evidence on the result of
the strict construction of clause 2.02 even for the ten year
period from 15
March 1995.  Suffice it to say that taking forward estimates into account the
estimated difference in rent over the
ten year period between that which would
be paid on the strict wording of clause 2.02 and that which would be paid
otherwise, which
for the most part has been calculated on the 8%, is a figure
of over $9.5 million.  Even more remarkable figures are shown for the
total
period of the lease from 1985 bringing about an estimated difference of $24
million.
<P>

<b>Admissions</b>
<P>

22  	No affidavit or oral evidence was given by witnesses for the
plaintiff.  There were, however, some admissions made in verified
answers to
interrogatories.  These were:
<P>

A.	That Tanzone had knowledge of the rent clause prior to the auction.
<P>

B.	That prior to settlement it knew how the rent was being paid and calculated,
the approximate rental which would have been payable
had the rent been
determined in accordance with clause 2.02 and the difference between that paid
and that which would have been payable
on that basis.
<P>

C.	That Tanzone believed prior to auction that the rent review clause entitled
the lessor to increase the rent each review date
on the basis that the fraction
was calculated with the denominator remaining at the original figure.
<P>

<b>Pleadings</b>
<P>

23  	In its defence to the plaintiff's claim for declarations as to
entitlement Westpac raised issues on the construction of the
lease and claims
of estoppel by convention and by representation.  
<P>

24  	The construction issue is raised by paragraph 5 of the amended
defence, Westpac saying in paragraph 5(c)
<P>

(c)	... it was a term of the Lease inter alia that the yearly rent payable
would be increased on and from each Review Date to an
amount equal to the
greater of:
<P>

(i)	the amount of the rent payable immediately preceding the Review Date
multiplied by 1.1664 (equivalent to 8% compounded annually);
and
<P>

(ii)	the amount of the rent payable immediately prior to the Review Date
multiplied by X over Y where X is the Consumer Price Index
Weighted Average
Sydney All Groups Number for the quarter last preceding the Review Date and Y
is the Consumer Price Index Weighted
Average Sydney All Groups Number for the
last quarter preceding the Date of Commencement of the term of this Lease in
the case of
the first Review Date and thereafter Y is the Consumer Price Index
Weighted Average Sydney All Groups Number for the quarter preceding
the last
Review Date.
<P>

25  	The defence based on conventional estoppel is founded on the
claim that prior to the purchase by Tanzone, rent reviews were
conducted on the
basis that the ratchet approach was correct, that Tanzone knew of this, that
both Tanzone and Westpac assumed that
it would continue and that up to 14 March
1995, Tanzone adopted that course of dealing.
<P>

26  	The defence based on estoppel by representation is claimed to
arise through silence in Tanzone deliberately refraining from
alerting Mr.
Raymond or Westpac to the situation, while aware of their assumption as to the
lease terms, the sale being conducted
on those terms, and Tanzone acting so as
to avoid any action being taken prior to auction or settlement to rectify the
lease.
<P>

27  	By its further amended cross-claim Westpac seeks first
rectification, second an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>
(Cth) (the TPA) by reason of Tanzone having engaged in unconscionable conduct
in breach of s51AA of the TPA, and third rescission
for unilateral mistake.
<P>

28  	So far as rectification is concerned, Tanzone having taken the
reversion by assignment, Westpac claims it is entitled to rectification
nevertheless by reason of much the same facts which are alleged to give rise to
the estoppel defences, namely the knowledge in Tanzone
of the mistaken belief
of Westpac and the Raymonds as to the terms of the executed lease, the
refraining by Tanzone from taking any
steps which would result in the original
parties to the lease becoming aware of their mistaken belief, and the knowledge
that the
property was being sold on the basis that the lease terms were as
believed.
<P>

29  	For much the same reasons it is claimed that Tanzone's claim to
enforce the lease is unconscionable conduct in trade or commerce
in
contravention of s51AA of the TPA.  Lastly, the claim for rescission of the
lease is based on the same allegations.  It is fair
to say I cannot see how
this claim could be made out as it would be impossible to restore the parties
to the original position as
in 1985.  Nevertheless, so far as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> is concerned an order could be made that the lease be
declared void or perhaps rectified as from 16 December 1993.
<P>

30  	In defence to the cross-claim, Tanzone says (a) that it has an
indefeasible title to the property and the rights under the
lease, this being
acquired by registration; (b) that there can be no rectification because third
party rights have intervened or
been acquired after the lease was entered into,
namely by Tanzone as purchaser and by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited as
mortgagee;
(c) that the lease has been affirmed by Westpac Banking Corporation,
it having become aware of the true position in March 1995; (d)
that the claim
based on the TPA is barred by time and (e) that so far as relief other than
rectification is claimed it is barred
by laches, acquiescence and delay because
prior to the auction Westpac was aware of all the circumstances relating to the
rent review
provisions, but took no steps to raise the problem or remedy it.
<P>

<b>Construction of Lease</b>
<P>

31  	There is no ambiguity in clause 2.02 of the lease.  Its words
are perfectly clear.  The question is whether these words lead
to an absurd
result looking at the situation in 1985.  If they do then they should be
construed so as to avoid the absurdity by supplying,
omitting or correcting
words.  <b><cite>Watson v Phipps</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2060%20ALJR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 60 ALJR 1</a>;
<b><cite>Fitzgerald v Masters</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2095%20CLR%20420" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 95 CLR 420</a> at 426  However, if
the result of giving words a literal meaning is seen to be unreasonable that
unreasonableness cannot be remedied
through construing the words contrary to
their true meaning.  <b><cite>Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australian
Performing Rights Association</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a>  at 199 and 214.
<P>

32  	It is of course much easier to construe a document not in
accordance with its words, if a mistake is so obvious that it can
be rectified
by including or deleting a word obviously left out or inserted such as "not".
<b><cite>Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v Martins Investments Pty.
Ltd.</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20144%20CLR%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 144 CLR 596</a>; or by reading "inconsistent" as
"consistent".  <b><cite>Fitzgerald v Masters</cite></b>.  It is not so easy to
do so when the construction put forward requires the clause under discussion to
be read as if the words "in
the case of the first Review Date and thereafter Y
as the Consumer Price Index Weighted Average Sydney All Groups Number for the
quarter preceding the last Review Date" were added to it.
<P>

33  	There is an obvious difference between supplying words without
which the document is ineffective, such as in <b><cite>Lisciendro v The
Official Trustee</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20139%20ALR%20689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 139 ALR 689</a>; or an intended right not
created;  <b><cite>Watson v Phipps</cite></b>, and the supplying of words to a
document quite effective on its face.
<P>

34  	While extraordinary results were shown on the evidence to arise
on the assumption of particular inflation rates, that is not
sufficient to
carry the day.  The review clause is workable, it is effective, and it is not
contrary to any other provision of the
lease.  Perhaps the strongest evidence
that it is not absurd is in the reaction of those in Westpac Private Bank when
they were asked
to approve an advance against the property supported by
security the value of which depended upon the words being given their ordinary
meaning.  It seems to me that is the end of the absurdity claim.
<P>

<b>Estoppel</b>
<P>

35  	The defence of estoppel by convention might possibly have been
available if the Raymonds had in 1995 attempted to enforce the
lease on its
strict terms.  However the fact Tanzone was aware of the prior course of
dealing does not mean it assumed it would continue;
in fact the evidence makes
it quite clear its assumption was that it would not.  The defence based on
conventional estoppel fails.
<P>

36  	The defence based upon estoppel by representation relied upon
representation by silence.  There is no evidence of any relationship
or contact
between Tanzone or Westpac prior to the action so it is impossible to see how
Westpac could have relied upon Tanzone accepting
its assumed position.  Silence
after purchase was immaterial as there was no review until 1995.  This defence
fails.
<P>

<b>Claims under cross-claim</b>
<P>

<u>Claim for Rectification</u>
<P>

37  	I consider a claim for rectification would have succeeded as
against the Raymonds.  They are in fact cross-defendants to the
cross-claim
having been joined at the last moment and having filed a submitting appearance.
It is, I think, clearly established that
the wording of clause 2.02 does not
reflect the intention of the parties.  So far as Westpac was concerned its
intention was formed
at the time the option was entered into.  It is perfectly
clear on the evidence of Mr. Hunt and the evidence of Mr. Mair, that the
intention was for a CPI ratchet provision as sought in the cross-claim for
rectification.  Nevertheless that does not determine the
position, because the
contract to enter into the lease, which included 2.02, was made upon exercise
of the option by the Raymonds.
 They exercised that option on the understanding
that the CPI alternative had a ratchet effect.  The reviews for 1989, 1991 and
1993
were conducted on that basis.  Had it been intended that the original CPI
figure continued as the denominator in the fraction, the
1991 and 1993 reviews
would not have been conducted on the 8% compound per annum basis.  The
intentions of both parties were the
same, this is borne out by their evidence
and by their conduct.  There is no requirement for an expression of accord;
<b><cite>NSW Medical Defence Union v Transport Industries Insurance Company
Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20740" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 740.</a>  A case for rectification between original
lessor and lessee is made out.  That however is not what Westpac seeks because
they seek
to bind Tanzone, being a third party which has acquired the interest
of the Raymonds.  
<P>

<b>Rectification against Tanzone</b>
<P>

38  	The fact that third party rights would be effected by an order
for rectification is in most circumstances good reason for not
ordering
rectification, but it was not contended by counsel for Tanzone that there were
not circumstances in which it was appropriate
for an order for rectification to
be made, which would bind third parties or bind persons not parties to the
original agreement.
 Perpetual Trustee Company Limited has filed a submitting
appearance.  Its solicitor stated at a directions hearing it did not object
to
rectification.
<P>

39  	The benefits of the lessee's covenants run with the land on sale
of the reversion <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s117.</a></b>  That does not make the
assignee of the reversion a contracting party with the original lessee.
Nevertheless it was accepted, correctly,
that although an equity of
rectification of a lease is a "mere equity" it is available or would bind a
purchaser taking with notice
of the equity, perhaps because it is attached to
an equitable interest in land; <b><cite>Smith v Jones</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1954%5d%201%20All%20ER%20823" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1954] 1 All
ER 823</a> <b><cite>Downie v Lockwood</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1965/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] VicRp 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20VR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] VR 257</a>; <b><cite>Equity and
Law Life Assurance Society Limited v Coltness Group Limited</cite></b> (1983)
267 EG 949; <u>Meagher Gummow &amp; Lehane Equity Doctrines and Remedies</u>
3rd Ed. 429.  This is a somewhat difficult area to which I will need to return.
The question is whether Tanzone took with notice
of the right of rectification.
In other words did it purchase with notice of a common mistake on the part of
the Raymonds and Westpac,
giving rise at least to a right in Westpac to seek
rectification in the terms sought or to the same effect.  I consider there is
no doubt whatsoever that it took with such notice prior to completion, and I
also consider that it took with such notice prior to
purchase at auction.  It
was aware of the clause; a conversation between Mr. Madson and the Raymonds
after the auction, of which
detailed notes were taken, was extraordinary for
what was not in it; Tanzone must have known prior to auction that the rent
being
paid was not calculated on the rights under clause 2.02 on its wording.
The absence of any evidence from any officer of Tanzone enables
one more
readily to conclude that Tanzone was well aware of the mistake from the start,
particularly as those persons interested
in Tanzone were Mr. Madson, a very
experienced property investor, Mr. Hall and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sperling, all three
being solicitors.
 The non-admission of paragraph 9 of the cross-claim, while
there was some attempt to explain that, reinforces my conclusion as does
the
failure to deny the accusations of Westpac in the first response to the March
1995 demand.  I therefore conclude that on the
principles of general law,
leaving aside the question of indefeasibility, Tanzone having taken with
knowledge of the common mistake
and thus with notice of the right of
rectification, an order for rectification of the lease could be made which
would effect its
interests under that lease as assignee of the reversion.  That
does not necessarily mean relief would be granted but it could be.
<P>

<b>The effect of indefeasibility</b>
<P>

40  	In some ways this is the most difficult and the most interesting
question to be determined in this action.  Tanzone is registered
proprietor of
the property.  Pursuant to s42(1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a></b> (RPA)
and in the absence of fraud, it holds the land subject to such other estates
and interests as are recorded in the folio of
the register, but free from all
other estates and interests not so recorded, except certain interests which are
not relevant here.
 In addition as a person dealing with and taking a transfer
from the registered proprietors, namely the Raymonds, of their interest
in the
property, Tanzone was not affected by any notice of any unregistered interest,
except in the case of fraud, and knowledge
of an unregistered interest is not
in itself fraud.  RPA <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s43.</a> 
<P>

41  	First I shall deal with fraud.  There was no conduct directed at
the Raymonds, there was no fraud in obtaining registration
of the transfer and
even if subsequent conduct can amount to fraud, which is at least doubtful,
there was no conduct to which this
could apply.
<P>

42  	Mr. Bathurst QC relied on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> and s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">43</a> of the RPA to overcome any
problems which might arise through a finding of notice.  Mr. Macfarlan QC,
senior counsel for Westpac
argued that as Tanzone was aware of the mistake
giving rise to a right of rectification in Westpac then had the lease been
rectified
an order would still have been made as between the Raymonds and
Tanzone for specific performance of the contract of sale after rectification
of
the lease and therefore there was an obligation on the part of Tanzone to
recognise the pre-existing interest of Westpac.  That
is probably right at
least prior to registration, although the prior claim to rectification is a
mere equity competing with an equitable
interest.  To some extent this argument
was put on the basis that when a purchaser took under a contract subject to a
lease, and
that lease was noted on the register, then the purchase took subject
to the equity of rectification of the lease, relying on <b><cite>Downie v
Lockwood</cite></b> as authority of this proposition.  It is important to
understand, however, as was explained by McLelland CJ in Eq in <b><cite>Ong v
Luong</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20ANZ%20Conv%20R%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] ANZ Conv R 596</a>, that the decision in
<b><cite>Downie</cite></b> was based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/tola1958160/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42(2)(e)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/tola1958160/" class="autolink_findacts">Transfer of Land Act
1958</a> (Vic) which excluded from the doctrine of indefeasibility "the interest of
a tenant in possession of the land"; which was there held
to include a claim
for rectification on the basis that specific performance would have been
ordered subject to that right.  At page
599 in <b><cite>Ong</cite></b>,
McLelland CJ said: 
<P>

There is however no equivalent of s42(2)(e) of the Victorian Act in the New
South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>, and so the chain of reasoning in Downie can have
no application in New South Wales.  The only interest of the plaintiffs to
which,
as a matter of equity, the defendants could be held to be subject, was
the interest specified in the contract of purchase, which
was defined by
reference to the instrument of lease and annexed thereto, on the true
construction of which, as I have held, the leased
property comprised only the
lock up shop number 38.
<P>

43  	The plaintiffs on the other hand relied on
<b><cite>Downie</cite></b> and <b><cite>Ong</cite></b> to claim that the equity
of rectification was an interest within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s43</a> of the RPA and that
irrespective of notice Tanzone took free of that interest.  At page 599 in
<b><cite>Ong</cite></b> the then Chief Judge said:
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a> protects the defendants from any equity, such as an equity to
rectification, arising between the plaintiffs and the predecessors
in title of
the defendants, and even if they were held to have had notice of any such
equity prior to becoming a registered proprietor
of the subject land (and this
has not in my opinion been established) they are, by the express terms of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42(1)</a> except in the case of fraud, not to be 'affected by notice direct or
constructive of any unregistered interest, any rule of law or
equity to the
contrary not withstanding, and their knowledge that any such unregistered
interest is in existence shall not of itself
be imputed as fraud.
<P>

That was a case in which it was found that there was no knowledge of that
interest and in fact it was found that there was no right
of rectification in
any event, even had it not been for the provisions of the RPA so that what was
said was not strictly necessary
for the decision.  Nevertheless on general
principles so far as Torrens land is concerned, one could have no argument with
it although
it will need further consideration.
<P>

44  	This discussion led naturally to a detailed consideration of
<b><cite>Bahr v Nicolay (No 2)</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 604.</a>  That case is
authority for the proposition when applied to the facts of the present case
that if, upon the true construction of
clause 30(1) of the contract, there was
an agreement to take the property subject to the lease on the terms attached to
the contract
and the right to rectification attaching that lease, then the
lease as rectified would be the interest of the lessee, and if after
obtaining
registration that right of rectification were repudiated then either that
conduct of repudiation would amount to fraud
(see Mason CJ and Dawson J) or the
act of repudiation would be so unconscionable that it would be declared the
registered proprietor
held the property upon trust to give effect to the lease
as rectified (Wilson &amp; Toohey JJ).  In the present case, however, it
could
not be said, as it was in <b><cite>Bahr v Nicolay</cite></b>, that there was
any such agreement.  In fact as the intention was the opposite, no such term
could possibly be implied.  While a
great deal of attention was given to those
parts of the judgment dealing with notice of an unregistered interest and
fraud, I do
not consider that they apply here.  None of the judgments goes so
far as to say that an agreement to take subject to a lease implies
an agreement
to take subject to a right of rectification, the right to which and need for
which is unknown to the transferor and
the lessee from the transferor.  It
follows that I would not have held that the plaintiff in acquiring with notice
of the mistake,
was guilty of fraud in failing to recognise the right to
rectification or that it was so unconscionable not to do so as to require
the
imposition of a trust.  To do so would be to act contrary to the wording of the
Act and cases such as <b><cite>Oetel v Hordern</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%20AC%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] AC 176</a>,
<b><cite>Monro v Stewart</cite></b> 1924 [41] SR(NSW) 203; and <b><cite>Mills v
Stokman</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20116%20CLR%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 116 CLR 61.</a>  
<P>

45  	A right of rectification is a "mere equity" as opposed to an
equitable estate.  It is therefore an interesting question as
to whether the
protection given to a registered proprietor by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42(1)</a> and s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">43</a> of the RPA bears
on this case at all.  On general principle it would seem to be illogical and
inimical to the whole theory of Torrens
if there were protection against
interests in land of which there was notice but no protection against lesser
mere equities of which
there was notice.
<P>

46  	There are several ways of looking at this matter.  It must be
accepted that a right of rectification is a mere equity, all
the books on
equity say so.  One can take the robust view as McLelland CJ in Equity did in
<b><cite>Ong</cite></b>, saying that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a>, except in the case of fraud and the
specific exceptions, protects the registered proprietor against any equity; or
one can accept
the reasoning of Bryson J in <b><cite>Double Bay Newspapers Pty.
Ltd. v A.W. Holdings Pty. Ltd.</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 409</a> that mere
equities do not impinge on registered titles, at least where there is no
notice, because they do not compete in priority
claims with equitable
interests, the equitable doctrine as to first in time going to competition
among competing equitable interests.
<P>

47  	Thus to put it in the words of Upjohn J in <b><cite>Westminster
Bank Ltd v Lee</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%201%20Ch%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] 1 Ch 7</a> at 19 (following <b><cite>Cave v

<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/1044.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1861] EngR 1044</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281861%29%204%20DeG%20F%20%26%20J%20208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1861) 4 DeG F &amp; J 208</a> and quoted by Bryson J in <b><cite>Double Bay
Newspapers</cite></b>:
<P>

The defence of purchaser for value without notice may be available by the owner
of an equitable estate against the holder of a prior
equity.
<P>

This is because <b><cite> Phillips v Phillips</cite></b> and <b><cite>Cave v
Cave</cite></b>, which Upjohn J followed, both held that in a competition
between a purchaser without notice of an equitable estate and the holder
of a
prior equity of rectification the later in time could prevail over the former.
All of this law depends upon a consideration
of the effect of notice, it being
clear that notice prior to purchase must defeat a claim for priority of the
later equitable interest,
just as it would defeat a claim involving common law
title of a purchaser for value of the equitable estate, who gets in the legal
estate.
<P>

48  	As the effect of the Torrens System was to put a purchaser with
notice who obtains registration of the transfer without fraud,
in the same
position as a bona fide purchaser of the legal estate without notice, or a bona
fide purchaser of an equitable estate
who gets in the legal estate after
notice, then in my view the only sensible conclusion to be drawn is that unless
there is some
right in personam Tanzone takes free of the equity of
rectification.  In other words Tanzone holds free from some equity, not
notified
on the register, which can only exist through attachment to an
interest in land.
<P>

<b>Claim in personam</b>
<P>

49  	Indefeasibility does not bring to an end personal claims at law
or in equity:  <b><cite>Frazer v Walker</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20AC%20561" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1 AC 561</a>;
<b><cite>Breskver v Wall</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20176%20CLR%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 176 CLR 384</a>; <b><cite>Bahr v Nicolay
No. 2</cite></b>, and many other cases.  For instance if the actions of Tanzone
had given rise to some personal claim in the Raymonds, the fact that
Tanzone
had been registered as proprietor could not defeat that claim.  Thus had
Tanzone contracted with the Raymonds that it would
recognise the right of
Westpac to rectification, there is no reason to suppose such obligation would
not be enforced in equity. 
While <b><cite>Bahr v Nicolay</cite></b> recognised
the right of repurchase as a competing equitable interest, that was not stated
to be determinative because there was no
need to express any position on this.
But as I have said the Raymonds had no idea of the mistake and it was not in
their interest
to require it to be acknowledged if they did know of it as that
might have brought about an obligation to refund part of the purchase
price.
Thus the right of Westpac cannot flow through such right in the Raymonds, and
any right must depend upon its having a direct
claim in personam against
Tanzone.  
<P>

50  	It is obvious that the Raymonds gained by Tanzone's knowledge,
because on the evidence it seems clear they got more for the
property than they
would have got had the lease been rectified.  But this is not a case of their
standing by taking advantage of
a mistake by Tanzone of which they were aware.
They were not aware of the mistake so that it could not be said that there was
"sharp
practice" or dishonest practice as against the Raymonds entitling them
to rectification on the ground of unilateral mistake as was
obtained in cases
such as <b><cite>Johnston v Arnabaldi</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%202%20Qd%20R%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 2 Qld R 138</a>; or
<b><cite>Johnstone v Commerce Consolidated Pty. Ltd.</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1976/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] VicRp 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20VR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] VR 463</a>,
which were referred to by Mr. Macfarlan.
<P>

51  	There is a considerable body of case law and a lot of discussion
devoted to the question of rights in personam and their inroads
on
indefeasibility.  Many of the cases are discussed in articles by S. Robinson
and D. Skapinker in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=67%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">67 ALJ 355</a> and  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=68%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">68 ALJ 587</a> respectively.  It is purposeless
for a trial judge to attempt yet another explanation but one can hardly forbear
to say that unfortunate
facts seem sometimes to have given rise to unfortunate
decisions, but that there now appears to have been movement back from the
somewhat extreme decision in <b><cite>Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance Co.
Limited v Gosper</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%2032" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 32</a> which was referred to in
argument, and it is clear there is no basis for a claim unless the facts give
rise to a known legal or equitable
cause of action:  See <b><cite>Garofono v
Reliance Finance Company Pty. Limited</cite></b> [1992] NSW Conv R 55/640 and
<b><cite>Grgic v ANZ Banking Group Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 202</a> at
220.  Indeed if the view of Professor Butt <u>Land Law</u> 3rd Ed. 753 is
correct that the only basis for the decision in <b><cite>Gosper</cite></b>, was
the finding that there was no authority from Mrs. Gosper to the mortgagee to
use the certificate of title for the purpose of
obtaining registration of the
variation of mortgage so that improper act gave rise to the cause of action,
then while one must follow
it, if it remains binding, that result is I should
point out with respect very surprising.  That is because first hard to see how
an equity could have been raised had a forged authority been obtained; it is
hard to see how an equity could have been raised; second
for many years
variations were registered on the mortgage which the mortgagee was entitled to
hold, not on the certificate of title
or the folio identifier and it could not
be said the mortgagee had no implied authority to register a variation on the
mortgage so
that there could be no reason for thinking that a new practice of
registration on the certificate of title should alter that situation;
and
third, as judges are supposed to be aware of conveyancing practices (see
<b><cite>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher</cite></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387</a>
at 435 it is reasonable for one who has acted on hundreds of variations to say
that never in his experience in acting for a mortgagor
has he been asked for or
required to produce an authority for the use of the certificate of title to
register the variation, nor
when acting for a mortgagee, has he ever asked for
any such authority which is obviously registered.  The only purpose in saying
this is to point out that movement back seems to be based on the desirability
of greater certainty not attainable if rights pursued
are not within any known
cause of action.
<P>

52  	In the instant case there is of course a known action for
rectification.  Is it available?  The purpose and effect of the abolition
of
the effect of notice brought about through <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s43</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> cannot
be defeated by some cause of action which relies on notice for its existence.
Thus it is accepted that rectification can be
ordered against a successor in
title to a lessor, who took with knowledge of the mistake if Old System land is
involved.  But that
cannot in itself be sufficient where Torrens Titles are at
issue.  Thus what <b><cite>Bahr v Nicolay</cite></b> establishes, is that while
notice itself cannot lead to a right in personam, notice together with an
agreement to be bound by the
interest can amount to unconscionable conduct
justifying relief.  When this is applied to the facts in the present case, I do
not
consider a case for relief by way of rectification is made out.  There was
no express or implied agreement to recognise the claim
for rectification and
there was no suggestion to the Raymonds or to Westpac that such right existed.
The Raymonds had no idea of
the mistake, while Westpac proceeded with knowledge
of the facts but no apparent understanding of or regard to the mistake.
Tanzone
did not take advantage of the Raymonds because while Tanzone knew the
property was worth more with the lease as it stood than with
what was intended
the Raymonds could not have taken advantage of this.  And to refuse to be bound
by an unregistered lease could
conceivable cause loss similar to the apparent
loss to Westpac here.  Many purchasers make use of knowledge which will result
in
disadvantage to persons other than vendors.  If this position seems hard,
then the Torrens System requires that at times to make
it effective.  In any
event it must be borne in mind that had the customers of Westpac Private Bank
purchased the property, Westpac
could have made no complaint about the lease
terms, it having agreed to lend on the rights those terms gave to the lessor.
In other
words any possible claim for rectification arose through good luck and
not good management
<P>

<b>Rectification for unilateral mistake</b>
<P>

53  	This was pleaded as a separate claim under paragraph 12A of the
cross-claim.  Insofar as I have not already covered it there
are two reasons
why I consider such a claim must fail.  The first is that Tanzone was not a
party to the original lease, so that
it could not be said that it engaged in
unconscionable conduct in letting the mistake occur with knowledge of it; the
second is that
the Raymonds were not responsible for the mistake.  The ground
of the claim would have to be that the conduct of Tanzone in failing
to bring
to the attention of Westpac its mistake and its right to rectification amounted
to unconscionable conduct, giving rise to
a right to rectification.  None of
the cases referred to me would extend the principle upon which rectification is
granted for unilateral
mistake so far.  These include <b><cite>Taylor v
Johnson</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 422</a>; <b><cite>Tutt v Doyle</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2042%20NSWLR%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
42 NSWLR 10</a>; and <b><cite>Tercerioro v Milne </cite></b>{1997] BCR 5733.
<P>

<b>Unconscionable conduct s51AA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth)</b>
<P>

54  	Section 51AA is as follows:
<P>

(1)	A corporation must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is
unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law,
from time to time, of
the States and Territories. 
<P>

(2)	This section does not apply to conduct that is prohibited by section 51AB
or 51AC.
<P>

55  	It was not argued that if there were conduct to which the
section otherwise applied it was not in trade or commerce.  In essence
what is
claimed is that Tanzone, in taking title with notice of the mistake, engaged in
unconscionable conduct by taking advantage
of the mistake.  It is very
difficult to conceive how a major financial institution can be in a position of
special disadvantage
of the sort generally required to bring entitlement to
relief for unconscionable conduct.  When ignorance is referred to in
<b><cite>Bromley v Ryan </cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 362</a> at 415 it is as part of
the general incapacity of a party to a transaction.  In this case ignorance
arose, if it arose at all, through
an extraordinary blindness to revealed
facts.  And usually unconscionable conduct requires the party under the
disability to have
been in direct relationship with the oppressor so that there
is some inequality of position or power between them.  Thus unconscionable
conduct often involves the insistence upon legal rights "to take the benefit of
another's vulnerability in a way that is unreasonable
and oppressive to an
extent that offends ordinary minimum standards of fair dealing".
<b><cite>Commonwealth v Verwayen</cite></b> (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 441; or in
circumstances such a those which arose in <b><cite>Bahr v Nicolay</cite></b>
refusing to acknowledge a right having been found to have been agreed to be
bound by that right.  The facts of the case do not bring
it within either of
these principles.  In addition, s51AA cannot in my view be used as a means to
defeat indefeasible title by an
attack from flank.  That is because s51AA must
be directed to conduct which would, under State law, give rise to a right to
relief.
 In some respects it may do little more than extend the range of
remedies available under State law.  Thus this claims fails. 
<P>

<b>Rescission</b>
<P>

56  	An order for rescission was sought in the cross-claim on the
ground of unilateral mistake.  It was never explained to me how
such a right
could arise.  The mistake in the lease was not a unilateral mistake which could
give rise to relief under the principle
in <b><cite>Taylor v
Johnson</cite></b>.  It is not possible to restore the parties to the lease,
namely Raymond and Westpac, to the position they were in at the commencement
of
the lease.  It was not suggested it was possible.  The claim must fail.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> - Limitation defence - and claim relief should be
refused as matter of discretion</b>
<P>

57  	Although in view of my decision it is not necessary to deal with
the special defences raised it may be desirable if I do so
shortly.  The
plaintiff has sought an injunction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s80</a> and additional relief under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1).</a>  The limitation periods of two and three years provided in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1CA)</a>
apply only to applications for orders under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1A).</a>  It has been argued that
this is a mistake which occurred as a result of legislative amendments.
Whether or not that is so it seems
to me that the wording is perfectly clear
and thus I must differ from the conclusion of Pincus J in <b><cite>Calmao Pty.
Ltd. v Stradbroke Waters Co-Owners Co-Operative Society Limited</cite></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/407.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 407</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2021%20FCR%2028" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 21 FCR 28.</a>  I have little doubt that what was intended was to carry
forward the three year limitation period which applies to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s82</a> claims to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87</a>
claims, other than those for unconscionable conduct under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> and to have
a two year limitation period for those latter claims.  It is quite
unsatisfactory not to have a fixed period for a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1)</a> claim, but that is the
position as it now exists.  A discretion to grant or refuse relief makes for
undesirable uncertainty.  However
the defence based on the statutory limitation
fails.
<P>

58  	Westpac has been aware of the claim of Tanzone since at the
latest, April 1995.  The cross-claim was filed on 18 February 1999,
and
relevant sought relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1A)</a>; the further amended cross-claim seeking
the relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1)</a> coupled with an injunction was filed on 19 April 1999.
While it is clear that Westpac contended that the true construction of the
lease, or in the alternative the intended meaning was not that incorporated in
the actual words of clause 2.02, there is no evidence
that any suggestion of
conduct in breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4a" class="autolink_findacts">Part IVA</a> was raised prior to the cross-claim being filed
at which time the claim as then made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1A)</a> would have been barred.
While the amendment got over the statutory time bar there remains a discretion
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1).</a>  I am of the view that in the circumstances which arise here it
would not be proper to allow the claim to be brought.  The party
seeking relief
of the nature sought here ought to act promptly and not to stand by waiting to
see whether a claim made will be enforced
by litigation.  In this case the
position in my view is that the court would not grant an injunction unless some
order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(2)</a> were made.  The plaintiff is seeking a declaration as to its
rights, but the real subject of litigation is the claims in the cross-claim.
The relief that Westpac really seeks is an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(2)(b)</a> that the lease
take effect from 16 December 1993 as if it were rectified as sought.  It could
not readily be rescinded from that
date in view of the payments made.  While I
accept that there is no unconscionable conduct until an intention to act in the
manner
complained of is notified, I do not accept that, if there is a
limitation period, time does not begin to run until legal proceedings
are
commenced and on one argument, completed.  Had there been a limitation period
then in my view time would have commenced to run
in April 1995.  If it had been
necessary to determine the matter I would, in exercise of discretion, have
refused relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87(1)</a> of the TPA.
<P>

59  	There is also raised as a separate matter the defence the claim
that relief under the TPA should be refused as a matter of
discretion because:

<P>

on or from 22 May 1989 and at the latest in October 1993 and prior to the
auction that Westpac was aware of all the circumstances
of and concerning what
it now alleges to be an error in the lease and did not raise it.
<P>

It is clear from some pencilled notes on Exhibit F that Ms Loughran must have
given some consideration to the literal meaning of
the  review clause as one of
the calculations she did in calculating the 1989 review figures used the
original CPI figure as the
denominator, but it has not been established that
anyone else was aware of this or that she thought that was a correct
calculation
or understood its import.  I am however satisfied that Westpac was
aware of all the facts prior to the auction.  They had been presented
with
startling clarity to the private bank at a senior level.  There is no evidence
that the private bank was any more a separate
entity that any major branch.
Knowledge of Mr. Bush and Mr. Mair was knowledge in the bank.  Westpac had
knowledge of all the facts
which would have enabled it to understand it had a
right of rectification provided of course that it could establish a common
intention
of the Raymonds.  With that knowledge it allowed the auction to
proceed.  It could not be said that in doing so it affirmed the lease
as
executed, although had its client purchased it must have failed in an action
for rectification.   Tanzone did not know of Westpac's
knowledge, or rely on
it.  As it is not necessary to decide what effect Westpac's knowledge but lack
of understanding should have
on this discretionary decision I do not do so.

<P>

<b>Laches and acquiescence, lack of clean hands and affirmation</b>
<P>

60  	It was not argued by Mr. Bathurst that laches and acquiescence
was a defence to the claim for rectification.  It was not raised
in reply to
estoppel defences.
<P>

61  	It is pleaded as a defence to the claim for equitable relief.
Thus it must be restricted to rescission because the claim under
s51AA of the
TPA is for statutory relief not equitable relief.  As it is clear that claim
for rescission must fail it is not necessary
to consider this further.
<P>

62  	No argument was addressed to a defence of lack of clean hands,
so I do not deal with it.  Affirmation was raised on the basis
that since March
1995, Westpac has remained in occupation, taken the benefits as tenant and
lodged a caveat to protect its interest.
 It has since March asserted the words
did not convey the true intention.  There was no affirmation of the lease on
its terms.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

63  	The plaintiff is entitled to succeed on its claim for rent and
removal of the caveat.  The cross-claim should be dismissed.
 In coming to this
conclusion in this difficult case I am aware that the result may seem unfair
even if to some extent self inflicted.
 However, purchasers of land often know
of a hidden value of which alters who will be affected do not know.  The court
is not a court
of morals.  The conclusion is reached without expression of a
view as to the conduct involved, except so far as it bears on the claims
in the
cross claim.  The parties can calculate the interest and I will give judgment.
Westpac must pay the costs of the proceedings,
those of the submitting
cross-defendants on that basis.
