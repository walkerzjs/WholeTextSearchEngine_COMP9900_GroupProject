<b>55003/1999 - DORAN CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) (RECEIVERS AND
MANAGERS APPOINTED) v BERESFIELD ALUMINIUM PTY LIMITED
</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, Doran Constructions Pty Limited (In
Liquidation) (Receiver and Manager Appointed), ("Doran Constructions"),
for
which Mr A.S. Martin of Senior Counsel appeared, moves, pursuant to an Amended
Notice of Motion which was filed in Court on 29
November 1999, against
Beresfield Aluminium Pty Limited, ("Beresfield"), for which Mr M.S. Jacobs of
Queen's Counsel and Mr P.J.
Bambagiotti of Counsel appeared.  The Amended
Notice of Motion seeks leave to amend the Notice of Motion filed in Court on 20
August
1999, and substantive orders that Doran Holdings Pty Limited, ("Doran
Holdings"), at its own expense and risk as to costs, be authorised
to use the
name of Doran Constructions as plaintiff "in these proceedings"; that
alternatively Doran Holdings, at is own expense
and risk as to costs, be
authorised to use the name of Doran Constructions as plaintiff in proceedings
to be instituted against Beresfield
substantially in the form of the Amended
Summons, which is Annexure "A" to the affidavit of Mr David Jury, sworn on 22
June 1999;
and that either of those orders be conditional upon Doran Holdings
delivering to the liquidator of Doran Constructions the Deed executed
by it in
the form annexed to the Amended Notice of Motion.
<P>

2   	It is, in my opinion, important to note that:-
<P>

(a)	Doran Holdings does not seek to be joined as a plaintiff in the
proceedings;
<P>

(b)	Doran Holdings does not make any application for any relief in the
proceedings;
<P>

(c)	there was no appearance by or on behalf of Doran Holdings; and
<P>

(d)	the liquidator of Doran Constructions was not sought to be joined in these
proceedings.
<P>

The strange situation has arisen where, notwithstanding the matters to which I
have referred, the plaintiff, Doran Constructions,
is seeking orders that Doran
Holdings "be authorised" to use Doran Constructions' name as plaintiff.  The
consequence of that would
be that the plaintiff would not only be Doran
Constructions in name, but also in fact and law, and that Doran Holdings,
although
apparently providing Doran Constructions with the financial
where-with-all to bring the proceedings, would not be a party to them.
<P>

3   	To try to understand this attitude, it is necessary to set
out some of the history.  Doran Holdings and Doran Constructions
are both
companies within the Doran Group of Companies, of whom four brothers, namely Mr
Paul A. Doran, Mr P.J. Doran, Mr M.L. Doran
and Mr J.C. Doran, are and were
respectively the sole directors.  It seems that Mr Paul A. Doran is the
principal director.
<P>

4   	Doran Constructions carried on building activities for a
number of years, mainly in the Newcastle area, and, on 1 March 1995,
it entered
into an Arbitration Agreement with Beresfield that referred all disputes
arising out of the construction of an aluminium
curtain wall at Gosford
Hospital to an arbitrator.  In that construction work Doran Constructions was
the head contractor and Beresfield
was the sub-contractor.  Mr Gerard Davies
was appointed the Arbitrator.
<P>

5   	On 18 July 1995 Doran Constructions, as chargor, entered
into a Deed of Charge, ("the Charge"), with Doran Holdings, which
was referred
to as the "financier".
<P>

6   	At about the same time as the arbitration proceedings, or
perhaps a little earlier, Doran Constructions was also involved in
quite
extensive litigation with the University of Newcastle arising out of
rectification work it carried out for the University to
remedy damage caused in
the Newcastle earthquake.  
<P>

7   	The arbitration commenced on 10 February 1997, the hearing
taking place over a four week period.  Certain evidence was given
and
submissions were made thereafter, the submissions being completed in September
1997.  There was no further hearing until the
Arbitrator signed his Interim
Award on 12 January 1998 in which he found Doran Constructions was liable to
pay Beresfield $656,786.80
in respect of the claims made in the arbitration.
<P>

8   	On 24 December 1997 Doran Constructions was placed into a
creditors' voluntary liquidation, and Mr Alan Lewis of Ferrier Hodgson,
Chartered Accountants, was appointed its Liquidator.  
<P>

9   	On 12 March 1998, the Arbitrator signed his Final Award in
which he held that Beresfield was entitled to $656,786.80 and to
costs in the
sum of $470,762.  In the Final Award the Arbitrator noted that in handing down
the Interim Award he had requested the
parties to furnish submissions in
relation to costs by the end of February 1998; that he received those of
Beresfield dated 20 February
1998; but that he had received none from Doran
Constructions.  There was no evidence that Beresfield's submissions on costs
were
furnished by it or the Arbitrator to Doran Constructions or Mr Lewis.
<P>

10   	Section 500(2) of the <b>Corporations Law</b> states:-
<P>

<b>"After the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up, no action or
other civil proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced
against the company
except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court
imposes."</b>
<P>

It was not in issue that no such leave was granted before the signing of the
Interim and/or Final Awards.
<P>

11   	The sequence of events in relation to the making of the
Awards requires some careful analysis.  On 12 December 1997, the Arbitrator
directed that Doran Constructions pay into the Newcastle Master Builders'
Association Trust Account $10,000 prior to 9 January 1998.
 On 16 December
1997, Mr Lewis, who had been requested by Mr Martin Linz, an accountant who
acted on behalf of various companies
in the Doran Group, to act as
Administrator or Liquidator of Doran Constructions on 15 December 1997,
attended a meeting at which
Mr Linz, Mr Paul Doran and another accountant from
Mr Lewis' office were present.  Mr Lewis kept handwritten notes of that
meeting,
which are Annexure "A" to his affidavit of 27 April 1999.  In
paragraph 2 of that affidavit he recorded that Mr Linz said that Doran
Constructions was involved in two sets of litigation, being those concerning
Beresfield and the University, and that Doran Holdings
"is no longer wishing to
fund both sets of the proceedings and we want the company to be wound up".  The
inference was, and so much
did not seem to be in issue, that Doran Holdings was
financing the arbitration proceedings and those involving the University.  
<P>

12   	On 16 December 1997 Doran Holdings wrote to Doran
Constructions stating:-
<P>

<b>"In light of the continued protraction of legal claims being pursued by
Doran Constructions Pty Limited and the escalating cost of
legal fees to pursue
these claims, the Directors of Doran Holdings Pty Limited have decided to cease
the provision of funds by providing
notice in writing of such cessation.  This
letter serves to provide the requisite notice."</b>
<P>

On the same day there was a meeting of the directors of Doran Constructions to
discuss the receipt of that written advice, and it
was resolved:-
<P>

<b>"That the notice in writing of the cessation of additional funds from Doran
Holdings Pty Limited be accepted and that the company
seek advice from Alan
Lewis of Ferrier Hodgson as to the appropriate course of action required to be
taken by the company" i.e. Doran
Constructions.</b>
<P>

13   	Mr Lewis deposed, in paragraph 3 of his affidavit of 27
April 1999, that during the meeting of 16 December 1997 he formed
the view that
there may have been insufficient funds in Doran Constructions to meet his costs
as liquidator, and that Mr Paul Doran
said words to the effect:-
<P>

<b>"We would be prepared to indemnify you in relation to your costs."</b>
<P>

14   	On 16 December 1997 Mr Lewis received a report as to
affairs from Doran Constructions which, significantly for present purposes,
showed it had unsecured creditors of $1,403,883.
<P>

15   	In his affidavit of 19 February 1999 Mr Lewis stated that
he received an original of the Arbitrator's Final Award on or about
12 March
1998, and a full copy of the Interim Award on or about 28 July 1998.  He had
received the last two pages of the Interim
Award earlier in support of
Beresfield's Proof of Debt, and he maintained the stance that these documents
were ones to which he,
as liquidator, was entitled, but that Doran
Constructions was not.
<P>

16   	On 14 January 1999 proceedings were instituted by Doran
Holdings, as plaintiff, against Mr Lewis, as defendant, for the following
substantive relief:-
<P>

<b>"1.	An order that under s.1321 of the Corporations Law that the liquidator
allow appeal proceedings to be instituted against the award
of Mr Gerard Davies
in an arbitration between Doran Constructions Pty Ltd and Beresfield
Aluminium.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	An order under s.531 of the Corporations Law that Doran Holding (sic)
be given access to the books and records of the liquidator."</b>
<P>

17   	On 15 January 1999 Windeyer J ordered that the issues in
paragraph 1 be separated from and determined prior to those in paragraph
2, and
dismissed paragraph 1 with costs.  The issue in paragraph 2 would seem to
relate, at least in part, to Mr Lewis' refusal to
make the Awards available to
Doran Constructions.
<P>

18   	Windeyer J identified the issue in paragraph 1 as being
one whereby Doran Holdings sought an order that Mr Lewis appeal against
the
Arbitrator's Awards.  His Honour said that Doran Holdings was a secured
creditor of Doran Constructions for an amount of $1,232,954
and that it claimed
to be an unsecured creditor for $1.  He considered that its interest was very
slight and that there would be
a question of whether or not it were a party
interested within the meaning of s.1321.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"The effect of an appeal against the award of the arbitrator would be that
one of the creditors of the company in liquidation, which
would otherwise be
admitted as a creditor, may have the amount of the debt for which it can claim
reduced.  It is claimed that the
liquidator has failed to appeal from the award
and therefore that the plaintiff is a person aggrieved by that omission.</b>
<P>

<b>Without going into any unnecessary detail it appears from the evidence that
an interim award was made on 10 January 1998 and a final
award on 12 March
1998.  The evidence shows that the company Doran Constructions was in
liquidation on both of those dates.</b>
<P>

<b>The time for an appeal against the arbitrator's award or the time during
which an appeal can be brought is determined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/index.html#p72a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 72A</a> rule 5 of the Supreme
Court Rules, namely 28 days after the date on which notice of the reasons is
given by the arbitrator to the
person who wishes to apply on appeal to the
Court.  It is perfectly clear from that rule that notice of the reasons must be
given
by the arbitrator to the relevant parties.  In that case there is no
evidence that the arbitrator has given notice of his reasons
to the company in
liquidation or to the liquidator.</b>
<P>

<b>If that is the position and time for an appeal has not begun to run, some
question might arise if the arbitrator informed one of the
parties that his
reasons were available upon payment of his fees, which is something which is
not unusual in these matters, and those
fees were not paid.  It might be
arguable, and I have no need to decide in these proceedings, that time would
commence to run from
the date notice of the reasons were available was given.
If that were the position then that time has long since passed in which
case
the time for appeal has long since passed.</b>
<P>

<b>To obtain the order sought it would be necessary for the plaintiff to show
that the time for appeal had commenced to run and had not
expired, as otherwise
the proceedings would be purposeless.  That has not been done, and in my view
on a matter commenced yesterday
requiring a decision to-day it would not be
right for the Court to make any order unless it had evidence of the actual
position,
even though the Court is aware that the liquidator has notice of the
amount of the award as it has been claimed by Beresford (sic)
in the
liquidation."</b>
<P>

19   	A quantity of relevant correspondence is annexed to the
affidavit of Mr James Alexander Shaw, who is an accountant working
under the
supervision of Mr Lewis and who has the day to day administration of matters
referable to the liquidation of Doran Constructions,
which was sworn on 19
February 1999.  He deposed that on or about 23 February 1998 Beresfield lodged
a Proof of Debt in respect of
the amount referred to in the Interim Award and,
on or about 12 March 1998, an original copy of the Final Award signed by the
Arbitrator
was delivered to the offices of Ferrier Hodgson.  On 28 July 1998 Mr
Gronow, a director of Beresfield, handed Mr Shaw a full copy
of the Interim
Award.  On 8 April 1998 Mr Paul Doran wrote to Mr Shaw referring to the Proof
of Debt lodged by Beresfield.  The letter
continued:-
<P>

<b>"I query whether one could make a judgment as to whether Beresfield
Aluminium was a creditor based on the last two pages of the Arbitrator's
Interim Award.  I believe that if there were certain circumstances in the
Interim Award, such as grounds for an appeal then you as
liquidator should be
aware of this before making any decision in regards to admitting Beresfield
Aluminium as a creditor.</b>
<P>

<b>It is quite possible that there may well be other offsets and contingencies
contained in the other part of the Interim Award.  If
there were grounds for an
appeal and if that appeal was funded by some interested party, (based on a cost
benefit analysis), and
if that appeal was successful, in my view it would
benefit all creditors.</b>
<P>

<b>I trust and I hope that you share my thoughts in relation to this and that
you insist that you be provided with a full copy of the
Arbitrator's Interim
Award."</b>
<P>

20   	On 29 July 1998 Mr Doran wrote to Mr Shaw referring to his
letter of 8 April 1998, and stating that he had not received a
copy of the
Interim Award.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Have you yet had an opportunity to seek legal opinion to see if there are
grounds for appeal as set out in my letter to you of the
8th April or
otherwise, if you have had such an opinion would you provide us a copy.  If
however you have not had an opinion then
Dorans would be interested in
obtaining same from the solicitors involved in the case being Doyles, on the
basis that you release
Doyles from their obligation to Doran Construction Pty
Limited so as they can accept a brief directly from us.  It may well be that
any opinion we receive from Doyles may not be available to other Creditors.
</b>
<P>

<b>As stated in our letter of the 8th April we see this as a benefit to the
majority of the creditors, should you elect not to seek an
opinion then we must
reserve our rights.  We await a copy of the Award together with your written
advice."</b>
<P>

21   	On 10 August 1998 Mr Lewis responded to the letter of 29
July 1998.  He said that the copy of the Interim Award was provided
in support
of the Proof of Debt lodged by Beresfield and that, accordingly, it did not
form part of the books and records of Doran
Constructions.  He continued that
Doran Constructions was not provided with a copy by the Arbitrator as it had
not paid its share
of the arbitration costs, a position, Mr Lewis noted, that
had not changed.
<P>

22   	He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Any right of appeal against the award if successful, would obviously
benefit the company and the other unsecured creditors in that
it would reduce
the quantum of unsecured claims admitted to rank for any available dividend.  I
note that at this point, however,
there are no funds available for a
distribution to unsecured creditors.</b>
<P>

<b>Any right of appeal would belong to the company and would need to be brought
by the company with my consent pursuant to s.471B of
the Corporations
Law.</b>
<P>

<b>As mentioned, I presently have no funds in this administration and
accordingly, I have not a legal opinion as to whether there are
grounds for
appeal.  I am prepared to obtain such an opinion on receipt from yourself of an
appropriate indemnity in respect of my
remuneration and expenses including
legal fees associated with the request.  Please advise whether you are prepared
to provide such
an indemnity."</b>
<P>

23   	On 25 August 1998 Mr Doran responded and joined issue with
the proposition that the Interim Award did not form part of the
books and
records of Doran Constructions.  He said that "Dorans" were very interested in
obtaining a legal opinion and providing
an appropriate indemnity for Mr Lewis's
costs, subject to the clarification of certain matters.  He raised a number of
matters, including
whether Doyle Construction Lawyers could be briefed, and, on
3 September 1998, Mr Lewis responded stating that pursuant to s.545
of the
<b>Corporations Law</b> he was not liable to incur any expense in relation to
the winding up of the company unless there was sufficient property to cover
those costs.  He noted that as Mr Doran was aware the administration "is
currently unfunded and my remuneration is unpaid".  The
letter said:-
<P>

<b>"When you approached my firm in December 1997 to assist in the Creditors
Voluntary Liquidation of the company, you undertook to indemnify
me in respect
of my professional fees to a maximum of $15,000.  I have since requested the
sum of $15,000 from you under this indemnity
which you have to date, refused to
pay.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to incur any further remuneration or
expenses in this
administration until such time as you pay the $15,000 on
account of my outstanding remuneration.</b>
<P>

<b>I note that I will be seeking an indemnity from the unsecured creditors of
the company at the adjourned meeting to be held on 14 September
1998 in respect
of my future remuneration and disbursements."</b>
<P>

24   	On 10 September 1998 Mr Doran wrote to Mr Lewis stating
that he wished to place on the agenda for the adjourned meeting of
creditors an
item relating to the appeal in the arbitration and, on 11 September 1998, Mr
Lewis replied that if the creditors resolved
at that meeting to indemnify him
in respect of his future remuneration, and if the indemnifying creditors so
directed, he would add
the issue of a potential appeal against the Arbitrator's
decision to the agenda.
<P>

25   	The minutes of the meeting show that Mr James Doyle asked
Mr Lewis, as chairman, whether a copy of the Interim Award was available
for
his inspection.  Mr Lewis advised that the issue was whether the document,
which had been provided as support for a Proof of
Debt, constituted books and
records of the company.  There was some debate about that, and Mr Paul Doran is
recorded as stating that
the Doran Group would indemnify the liquidator to
allow him to provide an answer to the five questions raised in his letter of 28
August 1998 relating to a potential appeal.
<P>

26   	On 22 January 1999 Doran Holdings gave notice to Mr Lewis
in the following terms:-
<P>

<b>"Doran Holdings Pty Limited (ACN000383782) of Level 3, 251 Wharf Road,
Newcastle (`Holdings') hereby gives you notice pursuant to
Clause 4.1(a) of the
Deed of Charge between Doran Constructions Pty Limited and Holdings dated 18th
July 1995 and registered 513319
(`the Charge') that the floating charge over
the assets, undertaking property and rights of Doran Holdings Pty Limited (In
Liquidation)
created by the Charge is hereby crystallised and now operates as a
fixed charge over all of the Charged Property as defined in the
Charge."</b>
<P>

There is obviously an error in this document.  The reference to "Doran Holdings
Pty Limited (In Liquidation)" should have been a
reference to Doran
Constructions.  This mistake, in itself, is probably immaterial. 
<P>

27   	However, it is not in issue that if the Charge is valid
and enforceable that it crystallised on 22 January 1999 when Doran
Holdings
appointed Messrs Hall &amp; Carter of Price Waterhouse Coopers as Receivers and
Managers of Doran Constructions.  A copy
of the Deed of Appointment is Annexure
"E" to Mr Lewis' affidavit of 19 February 1999.
<P>

28   	It is desirable to trace the argument.  Mr Martin
submitted that there was an automatic crystallisation pursuant to clause
4.1(b), which provides that in so far as the Charge is a floating charge, it
automatically crystallises and operates as a fixed charge:-
<P>

<b>"in respect of all of the Charged Property, instantly and immediately and
without the need for any act or notice by the Financier,
on the occurrence of
any of the Events of Default specified in" paragraph (f) of clause 10.</b>
<P>

That provides for an Event of Default "if a receiver or receiver and manager,
administrator, official manager or similar officer
is appointed of all or any
part of the assets or undertaking of" Doran Constructions.  The submission was
that the appointment of
the receiver and manager by Doran Constructions,
without more, constituted the Event of Default.  It seemed to me strange that
the
appointment by Doran Holdings, without more, would achieve this.
<P>

29   	In his written submissions in reply, Mr Jacobs referred to
Mr Martin's submission and continued:-
<P>

<b>"The Defendant does not take issue with this submission.  Therefore, without
prejudice to the Defendant's challenge to the charge
and its enforceability,
for the purposes of this issue, the Defendant says that if the charge is to be
enforceable, it is agreed
that it crystallised on 22 January 1999."</b>
<P>

The matter can thus proceed on that basis.
<P>

<b>The Present Proceedings</b>
<P>

30   	On 28 January 1999 Doran Constructions, as plaintiff,
commenced proceedings by Summons seeking orders, to the extent necessary,
for
an extension under Part 72A and Part 2 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> of the
time for appealing; pursuant to s.42 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act</a></b>
1984, ("the Act"), for the setting aside of the Interim and Final Awards; for
the granting of leave to appeal pursuant to s.38(4)
of the Act against the
Interim and the Final Awards in respect of questions of law arising from them;
alternatively, for an order,
pursuant to s.42 of the Act, removing the
Arbitrator under the Deed dated 1 March 1995; and for a declaration that the
Interim and
Final Awards "are void and of no effect".  These proceedings were
not brought with the consent of the Liquidator, and it did not
take long for a
confused situation to arise as to the party who did cause them to be
instituted.
<P>

31   	On 4 March 1999 Beresfield filed its Defence raising the
point, firstly, that Doran Constructions' Summons for leave to appeal
was out
of time; that by the time of the appointment of the Receivers and Managers
Doran Constructions' claims in realtion to the
Awards had lapsed and,
accordingly, were not assets to which the Charge could attach; and that,
accordingly, the Receivers and Managers
had no standing in the matter.
<P>

32   	The Defence raised the point that in the proceedings
before Windeyer J the same issues had been litigated unsuccessfully,
although
it must be remembered that in those proceedings the plaintiff was Doran
Holdings, and Beresfield was not a party to them.

<P>

33   	In its Reply Doran Constructions denied the Summons was
out of time and stated:- 
<P>

<b>"Additionally, if the Court finds that the Summons is out of time the
defendant has failed to specify why the Court would not grant
an extension of
time."</b>
<P>

<b>Interlocutory Proceedings Before Brownie AJ</b>
<P>

34   	The matter came before Brownie AJ on 21 May 1999.  His
Honour recorded that Mr Doyle announced his appearance "not for the
plaintiff
company, but for the receiver". Beresfield took the preliminary objection that
Mr Doyle should not be permitted to appear
for Doran Constructions, because his
instructions came not from the Liquidator, but from the Receiver.  His Honour,
apparently, was
not referred to many, if any, authorities, and stated that he
proposed to consider whether the Receivers had standing and, therefore,
whether
Mr Doyle should be heard on behalf of Doran Constructions.  However, so as not
to waste time, his Honour granted Mr Doyle
a limited right to appear and
considered it was appropriate to make an order under Part 31 rule 2 "on the
determination of the question
of whether the awards are a nullity" "by reason
only of the fact that before the award the plaintiff company was in liquidation
as
nobody had obtained the leave of the Court to proceed further with the
arbitration".  There is no doubt that his Honour was referring
to both Awards,
and he determined that point favourably to Beresfield, because he did not
consider that the circumstances, "assuming
they existed", changed the way in
which the Court should approach the question of the proper construction of
s.500(2), viz that an
act taken in contravention of s.500(2) "would, by virtue
of those circumstances alone, be a nullity".  His Honour was apparently
not
invited to consider the Interim Award and the Final Award separately.
<P>

35   	I would also note that it would have been, and still may
be, open to Beresfield to seek the leave of the Court <i>nunc pro tunc</i>.
<P>

36   	On 28 May 1999 his Honour gave judgment as to the standing
of the Receivers to prosecute the proceedings.  He traced the history
of the
granting of the Charge and Doran Constructions' going into liquidation and said
that he thought it was clear that if the Receivers
had been appointed prior to
that event they would have been the agents of Doran Constructions "if the
company was suing to recover
money said to be owed to it".  He noted that he
had been told, without objection, that the Liquidator had refused to conduct
the
present litigation, and that it was in those circumstances that Beresfield
challenged the right of the Receivers to act on behalf
of the company.  He
referred to his decision in <b>Kelaw Pty Limited v Catco Developments Pty
Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2015%20NSWLR%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 15 NSWLR 587</a>, and several later authorities, and adhered to
the views he had there expressed, viz that if, upon the proper construction of
a mortgage
debenture, a receiver had power to conduct litigation in the name of
and as agent for a company, then upon the making of a winding
up order, the
receiver might continue the conduct of the litigation in the name of the
company, but no longer as agent for it but
as agent for the chargee.  He also
held that despite that power, the receiver could not continue the litigation in
such a way as
to create liabilities provable in the winding up, and that, in a
practical sense, it was the receiver, or the mortgagee standing
behind him, who
must fund the continuing prosecution of the litigation.  His Honour was
concerned with a case where the receiver
brought proceedings before the
liquidation, and as agent for the chargor, but where, during the course of the
proceedings a winding
up intervened.  In those circumstances, he was of the
view that the proceedings could be continued, but that the receiver was then
acting as agent for the chargee.  At p.593, after a consideration of <b>re
Henry Pound Son &amp; Hutchins</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%20ChD%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) ChD 402</a> at p.421 and a number of
texts, his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"I conclude that if upon a proper construction of the relevant debenture, a
receiver has power to conduct litigation in the name of
and as agent for the
company, then upon the making of a winding up order, the receiver might
continue the conduct of the litigation
in the name of the company, but no
longer as agent for the company.  In the circumstances of the present case, it
seems plain that
the receiver does so as agent for the mortgagee."</b>
<P>

37   	In that case the proceedings were commenced before the
winding up order was made.  The chronology was different in this case,
in that
the winding up order was made before the proceedings were commenced.  His
Honour was aware of this and of the Liquidator's
refusal to conduct the
litigation in Doran Constructions' name.  He was of the view that the Receivers
had authority, as agents of
Doran Holdings rather than Doran Constructions, to
take proceedings in the name of Doran Constructions to "collect and get in" its
assets, including any money payable to it.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"However, the receiver's authority to act in this way does not extend to the
receiver doing anything which might create liabilities
provable in this winding
up, for example the costs which might be ordered to be paid by" (Doran
Constructions) "to" (Beresfield).</b>
<P>

38   	In the result he concluded that while Mr Doyle might be
permitted to appear in the name of and on behalf of Doran Constructions,
that
was only to be permitted on terms that he secured Doran Constructions and
Beresfield against the chance that an order for costs
might be made against
Doran Constructions.  He thought that Doran Holdings should be ordered to
provide security for Beresfield's
costs.
<P>

39   	Thus, subject to the provision of appropriate security for
Doran Constructions and Beresfield, his Honour's judgment may have
ended the
preliminary skirmishing, leaving the substantive issues to be argued out at a
final hearing.
<P>

40   	His Honour returned to the facts of the present case and,
in paragraph 8, stated:-
<P>

<b>"The hearing proceeded on the assumption that the financial state of the
company is such that unsecured creditors are wholly unlikely
to be paid
anything at all; and indeed the only creditor likely to be paid anything is the
plaintiff's holding company, as secured
creditor.  Additionally, as the
defendant pointed out, the Arbitrator found in favour of the defendant on the
arbitration, making
an award to the effect that the plaintiff owed the
defendant money, and the defendant did not owe the plaintiff money; and he
ordered
the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the arbitration.  It is
true that the plaintiff now asserts that the award should be
set aside, for a
variety of reasons, but I have no way of knowing, at this stage, how weak or
how strong these arguments may eventually
be seen to be, and the fact remains
that at this stage the defendant has succeeded on the arbitration, so that
there is a finding
that the defendant is not a debtor of the plaintiff, and,
for what it is worth, that the plaintiff is a debtor of the defendant."</b>
<P>

41   	One submission made to me was that the initial words of
this paragraph indicated that there was either a <i>res judicata</i>, an issue
estoppel or an <b>Anshun</b> type estoppel in relation to Doran Holdings being
a secured creditor of Doran Constructions.  I shall return to this.
<P>

42   	His Honour concluded that in the circumstances Mr
Doyle:-
<P>

<b>".. might be permitted to appear in the name of and on behalf of the
company, this is only to be permitted on terms effectively securing
the
company, and the defendant, against the chance that an order for costs will be
made against the company.  Subject to what might
be submitted, I am inclined to
think that this means that the financier" (Doran Holdings) "should be ordered
to provide security
for the costs of the defendant of these
proceedings."</b>
<P>

43   	Pausing at this point, his Honour had made clear that if
the matter was to proceed in the manner contemplated:-
<P>

(a)	the Receivers would be acting as agents for Doran Holdings; and
<P>

(b)	they would have to provide an adequate indemnity to Doran Constructions so
that it would not be placed in a position of having
to pay, or more accurately
would be indemnified for any amount it had to pay, by reason of the taking of
the proceedings; and
<P>

(c)	Beresfield, which was being sued by an insolvent company, was entitled to
make an application for security for costs.
<P>

Inherent in the second proposition is the requirement that the Liquidator be
satisfied that the security, which is presently in
the form of a Deed Poll
given by Doran Holdings, is adequate.  The Liquidator is not a party to these
proceedings and there is no
evidence that he has been made aware of the
security being offered or, if he has, whether he considers it is adequate in
all the
circumstances.
<P>

<b>Is Doran Holdings A Creditor Of Doran Constructions?</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

44   	The hearing before me then proceeded on another issue,
namely whether Doran Holdings is a creditor of Doran Constructions.
 This was
not an issue raised before Brownie AJ, who made the assumptions to which I have
referred.  In my opinion, these were assumptions
his Honour was invited to make
in coming to his conclusions.  They were not findings his Honour made on the
basis of issues propounded
for his decision.
<P>

45   	The basis on which it was suggested that Doran Holdings
was not a creditor of Doran Constructions was that, prior to a reconstruction
within the company, to which I shall refer, Doran Holdings held shares in Doran
Constructions and Doran Property Services Pty Limited,
("DPS").  It sold its
shareholdings in those companies to Doran Constructions Australia Pty Limited,
("DCA").  No money changed hands,
the transaction being financed by Doran
Constructions lending to DCA $4.1m.  DCA, in turn, paid Doran Holdings that
amount to discharge
the purchase price of the shares, and Doran Holdings paid
to Doran Constructions $4.1m in repayment of the balance owing by it to
Doran
Constructions on the loan account.  This transaction was concluded in November
1994 and led to the situation whereby Doran
Constructions became a creditor of
DCA, rather than of Doran Holdings.  Doran Constructions subsequently forgave
the debt to DCA.
 There was evidence that moneys were lent by Doran Holdings to
Doran Constructions at about the time of and after the entry into
the
Charge.
<P>

46   	I was informed from the Bar Table, and there was evidence
of this, that the Receivers have now ceased to act.  Whatever may
have been the
position before Brownie AJ, it has now changed at least to that extent.  Doran
Holdings contends, on a proper construction
of the Charge, that it is entitled
to pursue the proceedings in its own name.
<P>

<b>An Amended Summons</b>
<P>

47   	Unfortunately, however, nothing is straightforward in this
case.  On 23 June 1999, Doran Constructions filed a Notice of Motion
whereby it
sought leave to file an Amended Summons.  On 30 July 1999, Beresfield filed a
Notice of Motion seeking security for costs
and, on 13 August 1999, a Notice of
Motion seeking an order that the proceedings be struck out and for
consequential relief.  On
20 August 1999, Beresfield filed another Notice of
Motion seeking substantially the same relief as in that of 13 August 1999 and,
on 25 August 1999, Beresfield filed a Notice of Motion seeking security for
costs in the sum of $30,000 in respect of the Notice
of Motion filed on 20
August, to which I acceded.
<P>

48   	On 20 August 1999, Doran Constructions filed the first
Notice of Motion with which I am presently concerned.  That Notice
of Motion
has been used as the vehicle to argue a number of matters arising from
Beresfield's assertion that the proceedings should
be dismissed.  The bases on
which that has been put are:-
<P>

(a)	Doran Constructions is not indebted to Doran Holdings, so that there is
nothing to support the Charge.  This is a principal
basis for attacking the
validity of the Charge.
<P>

(b)	The circumstances in which it is said that Doran Constructions became
indebted to Doran Holdings involved a number of manoeuvres,
including a
financial "round robin", which bespoke commercially unacceptable behaviour, and
led to circumstances in which the alleged
indebtedness should be set aside or
was void, and in which there were breaches of fiduciary duties to Doran
Constructions such that
the transactions were tainted in a way which would
preclude the Court giving effect to them.  It was submitted, at least in part,
that the fiduciary duty arose because Doran Holdings was a de facto director of
Doran Constructions.
<P>

(c)	The enforcement of the Charge is the enforcement of equitable rights, and
the conduct of Doran Holdings, to which I have referred,
taints the
transactions supporting the Charge, and hence the Charge, so that the equitable
rights should not be enforced.
<P>

(d)	The application for leave to appeal is out of time and there is no
appropriate evidence on which the Court can exercise its
discretion to extend
the time, so that the proceedings are futile.
<P>

(e)	The grounds relied on are manifestly hopeless, both in so far as manifest
errors on the face of the Interim and Final Awards
are concerned, and so far as
breaches of ss.42 and 44 of the Act are alleged, such that the proceedings
should be dismissed summarily.
<P>

49   	Mr Martin made a number of responses:-
<P>

(a)	The winding up of Doran Constructions on 24 December 1997 brought about the
statutory stay provided for by s.500(2) of the <b>Corporations Law</b>,<b>
</b>("the Law"), so that either Beresfield could not require the Arbitrator to
take any further step in the arbitral proceedings thereafter
without the leave
of the Court or, alternatively, if the Arbitrator was permitted to give the
Interim Award, he was not permitted
to seek further submissions in relation to
costs for the purpose of finalising his Award and to publish a Final Award.
<P>

(b)	The terms of the Charge were sufficient to allow receivers appointed by
Doran Holdings to enforce the legal choses in action
in the name of Doran
Constructions which, by the Charge, had been transferred to Doran Holdings.
<P>

(c)	There was clear evidence of a debt owing by Doran Constructions to Doran
Holdings.  It was not really in issue that this arrangement
had been entered
into to change the situation which had previously existed whereby Doran
Holdings owed Doran Constructions money
so that, in the event of Doran
Constructions encountering sufficiently severe financial problems to cause it
to be wound up, recourse
could not be had by its creditors to the loan funds
owing from Doran Constructions.
<P>

(d)	That no question of any breach of a fiduciary duty arose and there could be
no issue of any de facto directorship as, at all
material times, Doran Holdings
did not hold shares in Doran Constructions, and there was no evidence that
Doran Constructions was
accustomed to act in accordance with Doran Holdings'
directions.
<P>

(e)	That Beresfield was estopped either by <i>res judicata</i>, issue estoppel
or an <b>Anshun</b> type estoppel from asserting that money was not owing from
Doran Constructions to Doran Holdings.
<P>

(f)	That the time under Part 72A rule 5 for appealing was not running because
the Arbitrator had not furnished to Doran Constructions
his Interim and Final
Awards.
<P>

(g)	That there was no substance in the point that the questions of law did not
raise manifest errors of law on the face of the Award,
and certainly it could
not be said that the argument was "hopeless", such as to merit summary
dismissal.
<P>

(h)	That a determination as to whether the Arbitrator had misconducted himself
should await a full hearing of all the facts and
not be decided at an
interlocutory stage, conformably with the usual provisions governing the
striking out of proceedings.
<P>

50   	In disposing of some points the view may be taken that I
have been somewhat short, having regard to the detailed oral and
written
submissions, but I am, after all, dealing with interlocutory proceedings, and,
unless Beresfield can satisfy me that it is
entitled to succeed on many of
them, the proceedings must go to trial.
<P>

<b>Does Doran Constructions Owe Doran Holdings Money?</b>
<P>

51   	Firstly, I am not satisfied that the various transactions
leading to Doran Constructions owing Doran Holdings money should
be set aside.
Doran Holdings held shares in Doran Constructions and DPS,  which it agreed, in
1992, to sell to DCA for a consideration
of $3,176m and $1,665m: a total of
$4,841m.  The sale price was not payable until July 1995 and the amount
outstanding was interest
free.  There was also some evidence to suggest that
the sale was at an inflated value.  However all that may be, the transaction
was consummated and Doran Constructions ceased to be a subsidiary of Doran
Holdings.  The evidence does not allow me to hold that
the transaction was
uncommercial or should otherwise be the subject of any adverse comment.  At
most there may be reasons to ponder
about some aspects of it, but there is no
evidence which would permit my doing more than that.  Any such conclusion would
require
a far more detailed examination of what transpired in proceedings
properly constituted both as to parties and to raise the appropriate
issues.
<P>

52   	The next transaction, which was the subject of some
scrutiny, occurred on 1 November 1994.  At a meeting of the directors
of Doran
Constructions it was resolved that it would demand payment from Doran Holdings
of $4.1m owing on a loan account, on the
basis that Doran Constructions would
advance that amount to DCA which, in turn, would pay $4.1m to Doran Holdings in
a <i>pro tanto </i>discharge of the debt owing on the sale of shares.  Thus DCA
was substituted as Doran Constructions' debtor and DCA's indebtedness
to Doran
Holdings was reduced by $4.1m.  The transactions were evidenced by journal
entries, which were not written up until the
end of the financial year.  Mr
Linz, the former auditor of various companies in the Group, explained this in
terms I found satisfactory.
 The effects were to insulate Doran Holdings from
Doran Constructions, in the sense that any financial failure of it would not
enable
its Liquidator to call up the debt from Doran Holdings; and, probably,
give Doran Constructions a weaker debtor, i.e. DCA.  Once
again, one may wonder
about this transaction, although the reason for it seems clear enough.  But
business people are entitled to
regulate their affairs and, provided they do
not infringe the law, their method of doing so will not be impugned.
Furthermore, if
it is to be impugned that should be in properly constituted
proceedings where all the relevant matters may be investigated.  These
proceedings, at least as presently constituted, lack both the parties and the
pleadings required to consider such issues.  Further,
there was evidence that
DCA had repaid a not inconsiderable amount of the debt, which, at a prima facie
level, would indicate commercial
reality in the transaction.
<P>

53   	Nextly, there was evidence in the Proof of Debt that
Holdings had lent money to Constructions.  On the same day as the Charge
was
entered into an amount of $100,000 was credited to Constructions.  I appreciate
there has been some ambivalence as to the amount
of the debt, but I am
satisfied there was one owing.
<P>

54   	Whilst the conduct of certain of the directors and
officers of Doran Constructions has been investigated at a public examination,
and whilst that might, and I put the matter no higher because I am quite
unaware of the view the Liquidator and those giving him
legal advice take of
that evidence, lead the Liquidator to consider further proceedings, I do not
see that that impacts relevantly
on the present proceedings at this stage.
<P>

55   	In all these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the
various attacks made on the Charge have been made out.  By that I
mean that I
am not satisfied that there was not a debt to support the Charge, implicit in
which is my lack of satisfaction that any
of the transaction should be struck
down.  Nor am I satisfied that the transactions were tainted in the way for
which Mr Jacobs contended
or that there has been any breach of fiduciary
duty.
<P>

<b>Res Judicata Etc</b>
<P>

56   	The next matters I propose to dispose of are Mr Martin's
contentions about <i>res judicata</i>, issue estoppel and the <b>Anshun</b>
type estoppel.  He relied on the decision of Windeyer J, which cannot assist
him on any basis as Beresfield was not a party to those
proceedings, and the
decision of Brownie AJ on 28 May 1998.  In that case, his Honour made no
findings on the issues.  He was, as
I have said, prepared to assume certain
positions existed.  The parties were content for the matter to proceed on that
basis.  That
does not give rise, in the particular circumstances of an urgent
interlocutory application, to either a <i>res judicata</i> or an issue
estoppel.  Further, in the particular circumstances which existed, as more
fully set forth in Mr Ward's affidavit of
30 November 1999, it was not
unreasonable for Beresfield not to raise the points on 28 May 1999 before
Brownie AJ, such as to prevent
an <b>Anshun</b> type estoppel arising.
<P>

<b>The Charge</b>
<P>

57   	The Charge was entered into on 18 July 1995.  The recital
stated:-
<P>

<b>"The Chargor has requested the Financier to advance to it or provide
security for the Chargor to borrow from its Bankers and/or to
forebear to sue
the Chargor in and for the sum of One hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter
appearing and the Chargor may from time to
time request the Financier to provide further advances and
accommodation."</b>
<P>

Therefore, not only is indebtedness provided for, but so also is forbearance to
sue.
<P>

58   	An "Event of Default" is defined as any of the events
specified in clause 7, relevantly for present purposes, and "relevant
company"
is defined, once again relevantly for present purposes, as the Chargor.
<P>

59   	"Secured Moneys" are given a wide meaning to include any
moneys, which the Chargor might, in almost any circumstance, owe
to the
Financier.
<P>

60   	The Charge is stated to be a fixed charge over the
property specified in clause 2.1(a) and a floating charge over all other
"Charged Property".
<P>

61   	"Charged Property" is defined as:-
<P>

<b>"... the undertaking and all the property assets and rights whatever
(whether situated within or outside Australia) both present and
future
including the goodwill of the business and the uncalled and called but unpaid
capital (including premiums) for the time being
on the shares of the
Chargor."</b>
<P>

62   	Clause 2.2 provides that the Charge ranks first in point
of priority over the Charged Property, and clause 2.3 places restrictions
on
further securities and dealings.  Clause 4 is headed "Automatic
Crystallisation", and I have referred to the relevant provisions
in relation to
crystallisation and Mr Jacobs' acceptance that that occurred on the appointment
of the Receivers.
<P>

63   	Clause 11.1 provided for the appointment of a receiver at
any time after the Secured Moneys had become payable and/or the
Charge had
become enforceable, and clause 11.2 set out the powers of the receiver, not
specifically excluded by the terms of the
appointment:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	to take possession of, to collect and to get in the whole or any part
of the Charged Property, including, but not limited to,
any loans to any
Related Property Corporate."</b>
<P>

64   	Sub-clause (m) gave the receiver the power:-
<P>

<b>".. to take proceedings at law, in equity or in bankruptcy in the name of
the Chargor or otherwise for all or any of the purposes
set out in this
clause."</b>
<P>

65   	Clause 11.3 provided that the receiver would be the agent
of the Chargor, which, alone, would be responsible for his acts
and
defaults:-
<P>

<b>".. but if at any time a resolution is passed or an order is made for the
winding up of the Chargor, the Receiver will be the agent
of the Financier and
the Financier may exercise the power to appoint a Receiver under clause 11.1 at
or after that time."</b>
<P>

This clause recognised the position at law as I have stated it.  It may,
however, give rise to the question as to how the Receiver,
as agent for Doran
Holdings, is able to sue in the name of Doran Constructions.  The answer to
that may be that the legal interest
in the choses in action, which constitute
the right to take legal proceedings, remain in Doran Constructions, the Charge
having brought
about an equitable assignment of them.
<P>

66   	Clause 11.5 provided:-
<P>

<b>"Notwithstanding that a Receiver may or may not have been appointed under
this clause, it will be lawful for the Financier at any
time after the Secured
Moneys become payable and without giving any notice to exercise all or any
powers and authorities conferred
on the Receiver under this Clause."</b>
<P>

67   	This becomes of significance in the present situation
because the evidence is that as at 16 August 1999 one of the Receivers
had
informed the solicitors for Doran Constructions that he and the other Receiver
were proposing to retire and, it seemed common
ground, that that has now
occurred.
<P>

68   	In O'Donovan (2nd Edition) <b>"Company Receivers and
Managers"</b> at paragraph 10.200, the author stated:-
<P>

<b>"A Receiver, as such, is not ordinarily entitled to bring an action in his
own name since no property or cause of action is automatically
vested in him by
his appointment.  He can, however, institute legal proceedings in the company's
name even without its consent. 
By instituting proceedings in the name of the
company, a Receiver will not necessarily avoid personal liability for the
defendant's
costs if the suit fails."</b>
<P>

69   	In <b>M. Wheeler &amp; Company, Limited v Warren</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1928%5d%201%20Ch%20840" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1928] 1 Ch 840</a> the English Court of Appeal implied a power, where no express
power existed, for a receiver to bring proceedings in the name of the
company.
At p.844 Lord Hanworth MR said:-
<P>

<b>"The fact that he was made the agent of the company and given the power to
get in the property charged is, in my opinion, sufficient
to give him power to
take the only effective steps in the name of the company.  ...  The purport of
the debenture was to give ample
security to the lender, and, taking this into
account, I come to the conclusion that the words of sub-clause 1 must be taken
to confer
power on the Receiver to bring actions as the agent of the company,
and so to get in by action in the company's name the property
of the
company."</b>
<P>

70   	Lawrence LJ thought that there was no real necessity for
an express power, because if the authority was not implied the power
conferred
on the receiver for the greater security of the debenture holder of getting in
the property would be illusory.
<P>

71   	At p.846 Russell LJ said that the contract provided that
the receiver was to be the company's agent and to have the power
to get in the
property charged.  He considered that that involved the receiver's being able
to sue in the name of the company.
<P>

72   	Both the Master of the Rolls and Russell LJ emphasised the
position of the receiver as agent of the company.
<P>

73   	The position of the receiver, to which I have referred,
changes upon the company going into liquidation.  I have referred
to the
authorities for this and, in any event, the Charge in the present case provided
so expressly.
<P>

74   	In my view, upon a proper construction of the Charge,
proceedings may be brought by Doran Constructions in its own name, at
the
behest either of the Receivers or, in the absence of any, in the name of Doran
Constructions by Doran Holdings.  However, the
right to bring such proceedings
carries with it the dual requirements of providing a proper indemnification to
the Liquidator and,
if it be appropriate, providing security for costs to
Beresfield.  I add that qualification to the entitlement of Beresfield to an
order for security for costs because the mere fact that Doran Constructions is
in liquidation does not, necessarily, mean that it
will be required to provide
security for costs.  Obviously, there are strong prima facie reasons why it may
be.  However, it would
be quite wrong to conclude that that result must
follow.
<P>

75   	The view to which I have come acquits me of the necessity
to consider the various discretionary matters to which I would have
to have
regard if the application was one for the appointment of a receiver to pursue a
cause of action on behalf of another: <b>Lloyd-Owen v Bull</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%204%20DLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 4 DLR
273</a>; <b>Aliprandi v Griffith Vintners Pty Limited</b> <b>(In Liquidation)</b>

Limited</b> (1999) 32 ACSR 367.
<P>

76   	There is another reason why it is unnecessary for me to
deal with those authorities.  In <b>Cadima Express Pty Limited v Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/1143.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 1143</a> Austin J dealt with the law at
length and, at paragraph 45, his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"The better view is that the Court should consider whether the cause of
action asserted in the pleading, together with such evidence
as is relied on in
the application, demonstrates an arguable case for the relief which the
proposed litigation would seek."</b>
<P>

His Honour, in paragraph 46, also noted what Gummow J had said in
<b>Scarel</b>, namely that the ordinary rule is that the liquidator is the
appropriate person to decide whether the company should commence proceedings,
subject to review under the statutory provisions.  In paragraph 47, his Honour
referred to the judgment of Cole J in <b>Partnership Pacific Pty Limited v
Aliprandi</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ACSR%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ACSR 51</a> at p.54, where his Honour had said that for an
application to succeed, more must be shown than that the liquidator's position
is
protected by an indemnity.  Austin J continued:-
<P>

<b>"In particular, if the liquidator is of the view that the proposed
litigation is soundly based, but he cannot pursue it because of
absence of
funds, a Court will be more disposed to admit proceedings by a contributory in
the company's name than if the liquidator
has decided that there is no
reasonable foundation for the claim."</b>
<P>

77   	His Honour continued that <b>Scarel </b>and <b>Partnership
Pacific</b> indicated that the Court is entitled to have the liquidator's
assistance in making its assessment whether an arguable case has been
demonstrated and that, normally, the Court will give weight to the liquidator's
view.
<P>

78   	At paragraph 49 Austin J continued:-
<P>

<b>"In addition to inquiring whether there is an arguable case or solid
foundation for the proceedings, the Court needs to be satisfied
that practical
considerations support the initiation of the proceedings.  The cases to which I
have referred indicate that typically
the applicant offers to indemnify the
company in liquidation and the liquidator in respect of the proceedings, and to
conduct the
proceedings in such a fashion that liability to pay costs is
undertaken by the applicant rather than the company to the extent that
it is
possible to do so.  The Court will wish to be satisfied that the assets of the
company in liquidation are not put at risk by
the proceedings and that the
liquidator is not exposed to personal liability without proper protection, and
may also properly have
regard to the risks which the litigation poses for the
other party, given that the plaintiff is a company in liquidation, the assets
of which are to be protected.   To these ends, the Court may require that the
person who conducts the litigation gives an indemnity
supported by security for
the benefit of the company and the liquidator, and perhaps also security for
costs to protect the other
party to the litigation.  It may also be possible,
as contended by counsel for the liquidator in the present case, for the Court
to make an order permitting the liquidator to be excused from the proposed
proceedings, in order to protect the liquidator from personal
liability with
respect to the proposed proceedings.  But I doubt whether it would be
appropriate to require the proposed receiver
to provide a personal indemnity to
the liquidator or the company in circumstances such as the present,
notwithstanding Brownie J's
observations in somewhat different circumstances in
<i>Kelaw</i> ...".</b>
<P>

79   	Thereafter Austin J considered any other problems, which
may be associated with the appointment of a receiver and, in paragraph
56,
concluded that they demonstrated that the Court has the power to appoint a
receiver in cases where it decides to permit proceedings
to be commenced and
prosecuted in the name of the company in liquidation by a person other than the
liquidator.  He continued:-
<P>

<b>"Although the appointment of a receiver should not be lightly ordered, the
principles by reference to which the order may be made
are partly the same as
for an order that a creditor or contributory be authorised to take proceedings
in the company's name.  First,
the Court must be satisfied that there is an
arguable case or solid foundation to support the relief which the proposed
proceedings
seek and, secondly, the Court must be satisfied that the practical
considerations to which I have referred, relating to protection
of the assets
of a company in liquidation, the liquidator's personal position and the
position of the other party to the proposed
proceedings."</b>
<P>

80   	I have referred to this aspect of the law because, if I am
wrong in thinking that the Charge does permit Doran Holdings to
bring the
proceedings in the name of Doran Constructions, the question would arise as to
whether I would allow it to do so conformably
with the principles to which I
have just referred and, if I did, what conditions I should impose.
<P>

81   	It is convenient to consider the strength of the case
sought to be made in the context of the application, which was argued
quite
fully, that Doran Constructions' case was hopeless, such that the Summons
should be dismissed.
<P>

<b>The Time Limitation Point</b>
<P>

82   	Mr Jacobs submitted that the provisions of Part 72A rule 5
provided an absolute defence to the assertions that there were
manifest errors
of law on the face of the Award, such as to attract a grant of leave to appeal
under s.38 and for an order under
s.42.  His submissions were, first, that the
material date expired long before the proceedings were instituted, and that
there was
no evidence before the Court on the basis of which it could exercise
its discretion to extend time.
<P>

83   	This submission requires a consideration of the relevant
rule, which provides:-
<P>

<b>"5(1)	In this rule material date means -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	in respect of an award which, by agreement by the parties to the
arbitration agreement, may be made with reasons later - the date
on which
notice of the reasons is given by the arbitrator to the person who wishes to
apply or appeal to the Court;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	in respect of any other award - the date on which notice of the award is
given by the arbitrator to the person who wishes to apply
or appeal to the
Court.</b>
<P>

<b>   (2)	Notwithstanding Part 51A rule 3 (which relates to time for an appeal)
an appeal to which section 38(4)(a) of the subject Act
applies (which paragraph
relates to an appeal with the consent of the parties) must be instituted not
later than twenty eight days
after the material date or within such extended
time as the Court may fix."</b>
<P>

84   	Sub-rule (3) provides that proceedings on an application
to the Court for orders under ss.38(4)(b), 42 and 43 are to be commenced
within
twenty eight days after the material date or within such extended time as the
Court may fix.
<P>

85   	It was not in issue that in the present case the material
date was that provided in s.5(1)(b), the requirement being for an
award with
reasons.
<P>

86   	The ascertainment of the material date is triggered  by
the furnishing of the Award, including the reasons, by the Arbitrator
to the
person who wishes to apply or appeal to the Court.  Mr Martin submitted until
it was established that the Arbitrator had furnished
his Awards to Doran
Constructions time did not commence to run as there was no material date.
There was some argument as to whether
the provisions of rule 5(1) were
satisfied by the Arbitrator's advising the parties that the Award was
available, but not releasing
it until payment of his fees.  However, on
reflection, I do not consider that that is the only, nor the better,
construction of the
rule.  It seems to me that a party cannot exercise, if it
wishes to do so, a right to appeal until it has been furnished with the
Arbitrator's reasons.  And, from a practical point of view, there may be very
real difficulties in seeking to bring applications
pursuant to ss.42 and 43
without them.  Therefore, it seems to me, that prima facie the material date
runs from the time when the
Award is given by the Arbitrator to Doran
Constructions.  That is supported by rule 5(1)(a), which provides the relevant
date as
being that on which the reasons are given.  It would be very odd to
have different situations obtaining in relation to sub-rules
(a) and (b).
<P>

87   	Mr Jacobs argued, however, that this interpretation would
frustrate the arbitral process, which is intended to bring about
a speedy
resolution to problems.  He contended that a party, thinking that it may not
have succeeded or no longer being interested
in the result, could refuse to pay
the Arbitrator's fees and thereby deny itself of the right to the Award, with
the consequence
that the time for appealing would be extended by, in effect,
the default of that party.
<P>

88   	In my opinion, it is arguable that where the parties agree
with the Arbitrator that the Award is not to be furnished to them
until such
time as his fees have been paid, the failure by a party to the arbitration to
pay the fees does not necessarily mean that
the time commences to run once that
party has notice that the Award is available.  The receipt of the Award and,
therefore, the reasons,
is dependent on compliance with the condition that the
fees are paid and, until that happens, the Arbitrator is not under an
obligation
to hand over the Award.  However, that does not mean that, for the
purpose of determining the material date, the fees must be paid.
<P>

89   	The non-payment of fees by one party would not prevent the
other party to the arbitration, however, from paying the outstanding
fees and
having the Arbitrator deliver the Award to both parties, whereupon the first
mentioned party could take proceedings to enforce
the Award and the material
date, so far as the second mentioned party is concerned, would run from the
date of delivery of the Award
to it.
<P>

90   	In certain cases, although there is no evidence to suggest
this is one, the party not paying the Arbitrator for a period may
rely upon its
inability to do so until a later period in support of an application to extend
time and the Court may, in the exercise
of its discretion, accept that as an
appropriate reason for extending the time.  As I have said, Mr Jacobs
submitted, as is the case,
that there is no evidence in this case to show that
Doran Holdings did not have the financial ability to pay and, thus, to obtain
the Award.
<P>

91   	Further, if the party which has obtained the Award
instituted proceedings to enforce it, it would be necessary for it to place
the
Award before the Court, so that the Court could be satisfied that the Award is
one in form and substance appropriate to be enforced
and, at that stage, the
other party would have the opportunity, subject to an extension of time being
granted, to challenge the validity
of the Award.  However, all of this comes
back to stating that the arguable view is that the material date does not run
until such
time as the party wishing to apply has received from the Arbitrator
the reasoned Award.
<P>

92   	In these circumstances I am of the opinion that on this
point it cannot be said that Doran Constructions does not have an
arguable
case.
<P>

<b>The Section 500(2) Point</b>
<P>

93   	Mr Martin has submitted that the Arbitrator lacked power,
because leave had not been given pursuant to s.500(2), to make either
Award or,
if I was of the view that he was entitled to make the Interim Award, to make
the Final Award.  It seems to me that it is
arguable that without leave the
Arbitrator was able to make the Interim Award, but that thereafter proceeding
with the arbitration,
arguably, required the leave of the Court pursuant to
that section.
<P>

<b>The Indemnity Costs Point</b>
<P>

94   	Mr Martin submitted that the Arbitrator was in error in
awarding indemnity costs of $470,762, being the "total costs" Beresfield
incurred in pursuing its claim and thus, correctly in his submission,
constituting an award of costs on an indemnity basis.
<P>

95   	The power to award costs is contained in s.34 of the Act,
sub-ss.(1) and (2) of which provide:-
<P>

<b>"(1)	Unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement,
the costs of the arbitration (including the fees and expenses
of the arbitrator
or umpire) shall be in the discretion of the arbitrator or umpire, who may
-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	direct to and by whom and in what manner the whole or any part of those
costs shall be paid;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	tax or settle the amount of costs to be so paid or any part of those
costs; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	award costs to be taxed or settled as between party and party or as
between solicitor and client.</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	Any costs of the arbitration (other than the fees or expenses of the
arbitrator or umpire) that are directed to be paid by an
award shall, except so
far as taxed or settled by the arbitrator or umpire, be taxable in the
Court."</b>
<P>

96   	Mr Martin's submission was that the Arbitrator's power was
confined to awarding costs to be taxed or settled as between party
and party or
as between solicitor and client, and did not extend, notwithstanding the words
of sub-s.(b) and (2), to taxing or settling
the amount of costs on an indemnity
basis.  I have some difficulty with this submission.
<P>

97   	Mr Martin referred me to the recent decision of the Full
Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in <b>South Australian
Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Leighton Contractors Pty Limited
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2066%20SASR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 66 SASR 509</a>, which was a unanimous decision and which is contrary to
my prima facie view.  This, therefore, indicates that there is a reasonable
argument that the Arbitrator was incorrect in coming to the view he expressed
in his final Award.
<P>

<b>Manifest Errors Of Law On The Face Of The Award</b>
<P>

98   	In the arbitration Doran Constructions cross-claimed
against Beresfield for $315,000 for costs and expenses incurred as a
result of
Beresfield not completing its contract as per the Head Construction Programme.
Beresfield denied that allegation on various
grounds.  The Arbitrator, in
reliance upon clause 39(j), refused the claim.  That clause stated:-
<P>

<b>"Unless otherwise agreed any amount which the Contractor is entitled to
recover from the Sub-contractor under the terms hereof including
loss and/or
damage suffered or incurred by the Contractor in respect of delay by the
Sub-contractor in substantially completing the
works and any other proper
charge arising out of the work under the Contract will be invoiced by the
Contractor to the Sub-contractor
and if practical within twenty one days of the
occurrence and recovered as a debt due and owing."</b>
<P>

99   	The Arbitrator found that Doran Constructions had, on many
occasions from March 1990 to December 1991, corresponded with Beresfield
because the construction programme was behind and that, on 8 March 1991, Doran
Constructions had written to Beresfield claiming any
delay costs incurred by it
together with liquidated damages and stating that they would be "assessed and
charged to your account".
 The Arbitrator continued that Doran Constructions'
claim was not made until June 1995 and quoted the words "and if practical
within
twenty one days of the occurrence".  The Arbitrator found that Doran
Constructions' quantified claim "being  3&#189; years late does
not fall within
clause 39(j) of the Contract" and disallowed it.
<P>

100   	My prima facie view is that this was a mixed question of
fact and law, and does not give rise to a manifest error of law
on the face of
the Award.  The Arbitrator's determination was, clearly enough, that the claim
was made far too long after Doran Constructions
became aware of it having
regard to the requirements of the clause.
<P>

101   	The next point related to the rectification of the
sub-contract.  Beresfield, by its pleadings before the Arbitrator, sought
to
rectify the sub-contract to embody the actual agreement made between the
parties, namely, that the steel work and insulation did
not form part of the
scope of works.  The Arbitrator noted, in paragraph 7.09 of the Interim Award,
that Beresfield stated that the
contract failed to incorporate the agreement
concluded between the parties on 2 February 1990.  He considered the evidence
in some
detail and, in clause 7.16, stated that he accepted the evidence of the
witnesses called by Beresfield concerning the quotation "that
it did not
include the support steel or insulation for the Curtain Walling".  He
continued:-
<P>

<b>"7.16	Based on my considerations of the conduct of the parties and my
understanding of the reasonable interpretations of the contract
documents.  I
believe the intention of the parties was for the Sub-contractor to supply
aluminium Curtain Walling and windows and
doors and for some other party to
supply and fit the support steel.</b>
<P>

<b>  7.17	I therefore find that the documents listed in the first schedule are
incomplete and should have included all those documents
listed in paragraph
7.10 above."</b>
<P>

102   	Mr Martin submitted that there was a manifest error of
law because the Arbitrator did not give any attention to whether there
was a
mutual mistake or a mistake on the part of Beresfield of which Doran
Constructions was aware, but rather made a finding as
to what constituted the
contract.  In other words, his submission was that the Arbitrator failed to
deal with the issue of rectification,
as such, but, rather, considered what, as
a matter of fact or mixed fact and law, constituted the contract.  Mr Jacobs
submitted
that this was a finding of fact or, at worst from his point of view,
mixed fact and law, as to the terms of the contract.
<P>

103   	Notwithstanding the pleadings, it will be necessary to
determine how the case was fought.  If the matter proceeded simply
on the basis
of rectification then, arguably, the Arbitrator is in error.  If, on the other
hand, the Arbitrator was merely finding
the terms of the contract, then the
probabilities would seem to be that the finding was of the type for which Mr
Jacobs contended,
such that leave to appeal would not be granted.  However, it
cannot be said, at this point, that there is not an arguable point to
be
made.
<P>

<b>Misconduct On The Part Of The Arbitrator</b>
<P>

104   	So far as the alleged misconduct on the part of the
Arbitrator is concerned it was not really in issue that as the evidence
presently stands it may be difficult to establish any misconduct.  Certainly
there were communications from the solicitors for Beresfield
to the Arbitrator,
but the Arbitrator, at least prima facie, seems to have dealt with these in an
unexceptional way, including taking
his own legal advice.  However, Mr Martin
has submitted that all the evidence as to the alleged misconduct of the
Arbitrator is not
presently before the Court, and in this particular area I
would not be disposed to say that a case was hopeless until all the evidence
was received.  I should also note that Mr Jacobs has made the point that the
pleading is defective because the Arbitrator has not
been joined and,
therefore, will not be given an opportunity to be heard.  It will be necessary
for Beresfield Constructions to determine
whether it wishes to join the
Arbitrator or to take the risk that the failure to do so may lead to its being
unsuccessful in relation
to the allegations against him.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

105   	I have come to the view that there are sufficiently
arguable matters advanced by Doran Constructions to enable it to resist
the
strike out application.  As I have said, if I am wrong in relation to the
position of the Receiver and it is necessary for the
Court to appoint a
Receiver to prosecute the litigation, I would find that a sufficiently serious
case has been established by Doran
Constructions to justify that.
<P>

106   	The question, which then arises, is as to the appropriate
orders to be made.  I am not prepared to make the orders sought
in the Notice
of Motion for the following reasons:-
<P>

(a)	Doran Holdings does not seek the relief which is claimed.  It is
inappropriate, in my opinion, to grant what is, in effect,
declaratory relief,
to a party, which is not prepared to seek it.
<P>

(b)	I do not consider, in any event, that declaratory relief is appropriate.  I
have held, the parties choosing to conduct the matter
in this way, that Doran
Holdings is entitled under the terms of the Charge to bring the proceedings in
the name of Doran Constructions.
 Nothing more is justified in circumstances
where Doran Holdings does not choose to become a party.
<P>

(c)	The making of declaratory relief may lead to the conclusion that the Court
is doing more than making the basic finding to which
I have referred in (b),
including the inference that the proceedings may go forward without more.
<P>

(d)	Relief in the nature of declaratory relief should always be granted with
care in relation to a justiciable issue and to achieve
a practical result.  In
view of my findings that is not required.
<P>

107   	In my opinion the way forward for this litigation is,
first, that Doran Constructions must come to an arrangement with the
Liquidator
to secure Doran Constructions and the Liquidator against any order for costs
which may be made against Doran Constructions
and/or the Liquidator in
consequence of the prosecution of these proceedings.  That may involve
negotiations with the Liquidator
and the taking of judicial advice by him but I
am not prepared to allow these proceedings to go forward until I am satisfied
that
the Liquidator is satisfied that he is properly secured.  This is no more
than Brownie AJ required as long ago as 28 May 1999.
<P>

Once this aspect has been dealt with, it will then be necessary to determine
Beresfield's application for security for costs, but
I do not propose to do
that until the Liquidator's position has been resolved.
<P>

108   	I stand the proceedings over to Friday, 18 February 2000
to enable the Liquidator's position to be finalised.  If that has
been achieved
by then I will fix a date for the hearing of Beresfield's application for
security for costs.  I grant liberty to either
party to apply on two days' or
such shorter notice as a Judge of the Court may allow.  I reserve the costs of
the hearing of this
Notice of Motion for further argument.
