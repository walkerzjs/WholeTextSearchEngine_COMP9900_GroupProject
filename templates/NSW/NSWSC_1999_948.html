<P>

21272/95	<b>LORRAINE BEVERLEY CORLISS   v   KEN ADAMS</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Lorraine Beverley Corliss has sued Ken Adams seeking
damages for injury allegedly sustained in a fall at Bucca,
near Bundaberg,
towards the end of 1992.  The precise date of the accident assumes significance
for reasons to which I shall presently
refer.  The plaintiff has sued the
defendant as the occupier of the premises where the accident happened.  The
defendant has pleaded
that the action is barred by statute, he has denied
negligence and he has raised contributory negligence.
<P>

2  	The premises in question are known as the Bucca Hotel.  The hotel
building was described in evidence as having at its rear a
grassed area
extending to the back fence.  There is a gate in that fence affording access to
a paddock immediately behind the hotel.
 This paddock was regularly used for
the local horse club's events and the plaintiff's case is that her injury was
sustained on the
day of one of those horse sports carnivals.
<P>

3  	According to the plaintiff the accident happened at about 2.00 pm
on a date which she fixed as being 6 or 7 December 1992. 
The plaintiff said
that after the events had finished she proceeded from the paddock behind the
hotel towards the bar area of the
hotel, entering the hotel property through
the gate to which I referred.  The plaintiff said that having passed through
the gate
it was necessary for her to veer to the left across the grassed area
to the bar of the hotel.  The plaintiff was familiar with the
hotel, having
previously visited it many times.  She said that on the day of the accident
there were a number of cars parked in that
grassed area behind the hotel.  The
plaintiff described her accident as follows (T 4):
<P>

<i>"I was walking along and just fell into a hole, or indent in the ground.  I
thought I'd actually broken my ankle at the time, because
I was sure I heard it
crack but it turned out that I didn't.  I was in the company of another person
who I asked for help.  They
left me sitting on the ground after they had looked
at my ankle, went into the hotel and came out with my husband and another
person
that was in attendance on the day.  The young fellow that I was walking
across the paddock with, carried me into the hotel into the
bar area, sat me
down on a chair.  They then got a bucket of ice from behind the door, put my
foot in the bucket of ice."</i>
<P>

4  	Whilst sitting on the ground immediately after her fall awaiting
assistance, the plaintiff looked at the terrain and described
the hole as being
a round hole approximately 12 x 12 inches, generally circular with grass that
had grown over the top of it.  The
plaintiff described the hole as being some
four to five inches deep and said that she stepped into it with her left
foot.
<P>

5  	In cross examination the plaintiff agreed that there were no
clear edges to the depression, and said that her observation after
the fall was
that it was <i>"an indent in the ground that had been covered by grass"</i>.
<P>

6  	It was put to the plaintiff in cross examination that the area of
the accident was one where the grass was long and that she
did not know why she
fell.  The following questions drew the following responses (T 31):
<P>

<i>"Q.	And you don't know whether you tripped, or slipped, or how you
fell?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I do.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would you tell us how you fell then?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I put my foot down and it went from under me.  I definitely did not slip
and I definitely did not trip.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You see I'm suggesting to you that the area where you were walking, was a
small unmown area where the grass was about mid shin
height.  Mid shin to knee.
Would you agree with that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I wouldn't."</i>
<P>

7  	The plaintiff was further tested about the length of the grass
but said she did not remember it as being very long as she sat
in it waiting
for assistance.
<P>

8  	It was the plaintiff's evidence that the person who carried her
into the hotel was employed there.
<P>

9  	The evidence indicated that the plaintiff had since separated
from her then husband in circumstances of bitterness and he was
not called to
give evidence nor was the hotel employee and there was no witness who gave
evidence of seeing the plaintiff fall.
<P>

10  	The defendant was working in the hotel when the accident
happened and he became aware of it when, according to him, the plaintiff
came
into the hotel in a wheelbarrow being pushed by her husband.  
<P>

11  	There was no issue but that the horse sports club used the
paddock behind the hotel on a regular basis and there was no issue
about there
having been a meeting of that club in the paddock behind the hotel on the day
of the plaintiff's accident.  There was
a very live issue however as to the
accident date itself, and that issue I will consider shortly.
<P>

12  	Mr Adams said that on the day of the accident the grass behind
the hotel was cut.  He cut it with a slasher and he said he
cut it down to
about an inch in height over the cut area but he did not cut all the grass.  He
said there was an area which he did
not mow and he refrained from mowing it
deliberately.  Mr Adams gave this evidence (T 53:-54):
<P>

<i>"Yes, we mowed the back paddock and we mowed round where the old garage,
where the cars are parked in the old garage house round there.
 I especially
saw that it was mowed as a track, so anyone could see that it goes straight
through the gate beside where that little
shed was, because that was a bad
little spot there.  I kept that reasonably high.  You could see a definite mark
round where the
mower went round."</i>
<P>

13  	In the unmown area there was what Mr Adams described as a gentle
sloping depression which was three feet long and about four
inches deep.  That
was an area about which Mr Adams expressed himself as being <i>"a bit worried"
</i>(T 55):
<P>

<i>"I was a bit worried about that area myself because it had the dip in it.
But it also had a pipe which was close to the shed, which
was an old bore in
the hotel and it was up so high of course and I was worried about someone
tripping over the [bore] pipe."</i>
<P>

14  	His evidence was that he deliberately did not mow this area to
discourage anyone from walking in it but he also acknowledged
in his evidence
that it would have been <i>"just natural"</i> for someone in a hurry to
<i>"just cut straight across"</i>, which as I understand the evidence of the
witness, would have involved crossing the area of long grass.
<P>

15  	Two other witnesses were called in the case for the defendant,
namely Richard Sammon and Colin Scott.  Their evidence was really
directed to
the issue of the date of the accident rather than the circumstances of it and I
shall refer to the evidence that these
two witnesses gave shortly.
<P>

16  	Mr Cullen, who appeared for the defendant, submitted that I
would not be satisfied on the evidence that the plaintiff had established
negligence.  However I reject that submission.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff's evidence that she fell having entered on to the
defendant's premises was not challenged and I accept that the
plaintiff fell
when her left foot gave way after the plaintiff stepped with that foot into a
depression.  I am also satisfied that
the existence of that depression was
concealed by grass that covered it and that such depression and its concealment
was causative
of the accident.
<P>

18  	The defendant's evidence establishes that the defendant was
aware of the danger which the depression presented for those crossing
the
grassed area.  It was foreseeable that harm could be occasioned to a pedestrian
in that area in the precise manner in which the
plaintiff came to grief.
<P>

19  	It seems to me that in the circumstances the defendant owed a
duty of reasonable care towards the plaintiff and that in the
discharge of that
duty the defendant ought to have taken reasonable precautions to avoid the
exposure of the plaintiff to the very
risk which caused her injury.  It does
not seem to me that the defendant discharged this duty merely by not cutting
the grass over
the depression in question, whether the depression was as
described by the plaintiff or by the defendant.  It is common ground that
there
was no warning notice and that there was no fencing or other deterrent to
anyone crossing over that depression.  Accordingly
I am satisfied on the
balance of probabilities that the plaintiff has proved negligence by the
defendant causative of her fall and
the injury then sustained.
<P>

20  	Mr Cullen submitted that the plaintiff was guilty of
contributory negligence.  His submission was in effect that the plaintiff
ought
not to have walked in an area where the grass had not been cut or cut as low as
in the balance of the grassed area.  It is,
of course, for the defendant to
prove contributory negligence and I am not persuaded that he has done so.  The
plaintiff denied that
the grass was noticeably longer in the area where the
depression was located.  Her evidence about this conflicts with that of Mr
Adams.  However even if the grass was somewhat longer as described by Mr Adams,
and I am not satisfied that it was, the defendant
has not proved to my
satisfaction that the plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable care in placing
her left foot where she did. 
I am satisfied that the depression was masked by
the grass covering it, whether that grass was longer in the general area
surrounding
the depression or not.
<P>

21  	Accordingly I am satisfied that negligence has been proved but I
do not find contributory negligence.
<P>

22  	This brings me to the defence that the claim is statute
barred.
<P>

23  	The statement of claim was filed on 5 December 1995.  It is
accordingly common ground that if the accident happened on 6 December
1992 the
defence in reliance on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/colpa1993301/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/colpa1993301/" class="autolink_findacts">Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act</i>
1993</a> (NSW), in conjunction with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/loaa1974226/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/loaa1974226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions Act</i>
1974</a> (Qld), would fail.  If, however, the accident happened, as the defendant
contends, one week earlier then the plaintiff's claim would
be statute
barred.
<P>

24  	Mr Adams' recollection is that the accident happened on the day
that the area experienced a "twister".  He said that there
was a "twister" on a
horse sports day, and he has concluded that the date both these events
coincided was 29 November 1992.  He said
he worked that date out following
discussions with his wife.
<P>

25  	A photocopy of a local newspaper item of 30 November 1992 was
tendered which described the occurrence of <i>"a tornado"</i> on the previous
day <i>"through the small rural area of Bucca"</i>.  On the following day there
was a second item described that same tornado and hail storm damage to crops in
the Bundaberg area.
<P>

26  	In cross examination Mr Adams conceded he had some memory
difficulties and he said that he was not asked to think back for
the first time
as to when it was that the plaintiff had had her fall until about three years
ago.
<P>

27  	Mr Sammon took over as licensee of the Bucca hotel from the
defendant on 15 December 1992 and he gave evidence that he had
worked there for
some four to five months before that.  He recalled seeing the plaintiff wheeled
into the hotel and he placed that
incident as having occurred on the same day
as the tornado, which I am satisfied was on Sunday 29 November 1992.  Mr Sammon
was first
asked to recall the date of the plaintiff's accident about a month
prior to giving evidence.  He said he fixed the date as being
three weeks
before he took over.  He said he was the treasurer of the horse sports club and
he considers it to be highly unlikely
that he has arrived at the wrong date.
<P>

28  	Colin Scott gave evidence that for many years he lived in a
caravan in the paddock behind the Bucca Hotel and he used to man
the barbecue
at the hotel on sports club days.  He said that he still does so.  He remembers
the occasion that the plaintiff was
injured.  He recalls seeing her in a
wheelbarrow in the bar of the hotel and he places that happening as being on
the day that the
tornado struck in late November.  Mr Scott said that he was
first asked to recall when the plaintiff's accident had happened three
years
after the event.
<P>

29  	Each of the witnesses called in the case for the defendant
placed the plaintiff's injury as having occurred on the same day
as the
tornado, and if this evidence is correct then the accident happened on 29
November 1992 and the plaintiff cannot maintain
her claim.
<P>

30  	I accept the defendant, Mr Sammon and Mr Scott as witnesses who
were endeavouring to tell to the truth.  I am satisfied that
each of them
believes that the plaintiff's fall was on 29 November 1992.  However I find on
the balance of probabilities that the
accident happened one week later.
<P>

31  	It was the plaintiff's evidence that when she left the hotel
after her fall she went to the hospital at Bundaberg in the company
of her
husband.  The plaintiff said that she drove to the hospital because her husband
had been consuming alcohol.  The defendant's
understanding was that when the
plaintiff left the hotel her husband was taking her to hospital.  Mr Sammon's
recollection was also
that when the plaintiff left the hotel she went off to
hospital.
<P>

32  	It is in this context that the hospital records which were
tendered as Exhibit A tip the balance on this issue as to the accident
date in
favour of the plaintiff.  The Bundaberg hospital notes have this entry for the
plaintiff on 6 December 1992:
<P>

<i>"Fall over inj[ury] L ankle</i>
<P>

<i>O/E [On examination] tender lat[eral] malleolus &amp; bruised</i>
<P>

<i>Can't WB [weight bear]</i>
<P>

<i>For	strap</i>
<P>

<i>	RICE [rest, ice, compression, elevation]</i>
<P>

<i>	crutches</i>
<P>

<i>	Aspalgin</i>
<P>

<i>	XR [x-ray] in am"</i>
<P>

33  	There follows an entry for 7 December 1992:
<P>

<i>"XR NBI [no bony injury]"</i>
<P>

34  	Having considered the hospital notes I am satisfied by their
content that the plaintiff did seek treatment at the Bundaberg
Hospital on 6
December 1992.  Mr Cullen submitted that notwithstanding those notes the
explanation may be that the plaintiff did
not go to the hospital for treatment
until the lapse of one week from the date of her mishap.  That, of course, is
possible but I
consider it to be much more likely that the plaintiff went to
hospital immediately after she left the hotel.  The evidence is uncontradicted
that she was moved out of the hotel in the wheelbarrow and that before this her
injured ankle was packed in ice in the hotel.  I
am satisfied by these
circumstances and by the plaintiff's specific evidence that she went from the
hotel to the hospital that this
is what happened in fact.
<P>

35  	Accordingly I find on the balance of probabilities that the
accident happened on 6 December 1992 and in the result the defence
under the
<i>Limitations Act</i> fails.
<P>

36  	I should add that the plaintiff was cross examined about the
tornado.  The plaintiff agreed that there was a tornado on the
occasion of a
horse sports carnival but she said that this was before the day of her fall.
The plaintiff was at that carnival and
said that she remembered what happened.
Roofs were blown from several houses and the plaintiff recalled waiting
anxiously in the
hotel for news of friends who occupied one of those houses.
The plaintiff also remembered bringing some children into the hotel and
putting
them underneath the pool tables.  I accept her evidence about the tornado.
<P>

37  	The probable explanation for the misapprehension shared by Mr
Adams, Mr Sammon and Mr Scott is that casting their minds back
so long after
the event they have mistakenly placed the plaintiff's misfortune as having
occurred on the very same day as the tornado.
<P>

38  	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established an entitlement
to damages and I now turn to a consideration of their assessment.
<P>

39  	The plaintiff was born on 23 February 1950 so that when the
subject fall happened the plaintiff was forty-two years of age
and she is
presently forty-nine years old.
<P>

40  	The plaintiff said, and I accept, that she experienced pain in
the left ankle immediately after the fall and found she was
unable to place
weight on it.  The plaintiff was unable to enter the hotel without assistance.
When helped into the hotel the injured
ankle was placed in a bucket of iced
water and subsequently the ankle was bandaged.  The plaintiff then went to
hospital where the
ankle was strapped and the plaintiff was discharged on
crutches, returning the next day to the hospital where x-rays disclosed there
had been no bony injury.
<P>

41  	The swelling subsided shortly after the fall and the bruising
that appeared went away over the course of the next ten days.
 The ankle
gradually settled down and the plaintiff said she was on crutches for one week
only.
<P>

42  	The plaintiff said that within a reasonably short period she
began to resume her normal activities but was hesitant about putting
weight on
the ankle and said indeed that the ankle was at times unstable and she said it
was very painful if she stood on it for
long periods or walked any distance.
<P>

43  	There was a period during which the plaintiff was cared for by
Dr Dipold and his records were admitted into evidence.  His
notes disclose that
at a consultation prior to 2 November 1993 the plaintiff gave him a history of
having injured her left ankle
in December 1992 and of complaining that since
that time the ankle had given way three times.  He apparently prescribed
physiotherapy
and the wearing of an ankle guard.
<P>

44  	The plaintiff subsequently came under the care of an orthopaedic
surgeon, Dr Sherry, and he operated on the ankle at the Nepean
Hospital on 21
July 1995.  His diagnosis of the injury responsible for the plaintiff's systems
was that she had sustained a lateral
ligament injury that had resulted in
chronic laxity and the procedure which Dr Sherry carried out was a ligament
reconstruction procedure.
 It appears that following that procedure the
plaintiff was in a half slab for two weeks and then a full plaster of Paris
below the
knee for six weeks.  Dr Sherry reported in June 1997 that the
plaintiff had obtained an excellent result and had mobilised well.
 That
assessment was apparently based on the doctor's last examination on 12
September 1995.
<P>

45  	According to the plaintiff however the procedure carried out by
Dr Sherry has not proved successful and the ankle has remained
unstable.  The
plaintiff described her ongoing problems in response to the following
questions:
<P>

<i>"Q.	May I ask you about the problems that you are experiencing in your left
ankle at the moment?  Can you give his Honour, please,
a summary of those
problems that you are now having?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Your Honour my ankle can be fine for a few weeks at a time.  Sometimes it
can be fine for a month, and I will be walking along
and it seems to give away.
It is very unstable.  When that happens I experience pain in my ankle area.  It
bruises and becomes swollen
and that takes seven days, eight days for the pain
to be completely gone and the bruising to be gone and then I will be fairly
normal,
or my ankle will be fairly normal until the same thing occurs again and
that could be two weeks, it could be two months.  It is very
hard to
predict.</i>
<P>

<i>I feel there are a lot of things that I am cautious of because of it.  I
still attempt to do just about everything I can, but I am
cautious a lot of
times of jumping.  I make sure that if I step down steps I always land on my
right ankle, not my left one.  I can't
carry any weights and put my left ankle
down first.  If I am carrying anything heavy I need to put my weight on my
right ankle before
my left ankle otherwise it becomes unstable.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Apart from the instability in the ankle, do you have pain from time to
time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have a lot of pain if I have been standing on it for a long time or if
I have been walking any distance.  If I have been riding
for any amount of time
it becomes very painful.  It gets sore in the winter, in the cold it is always
sorer.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Does that prevent you doing things?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It doesn't really prevent me doing things, it just limits the amount of
time that I can do things for and it limits the quality
of the things that I
do, I suppose."</i>
<P>

46  	The plaintiff has been examined twice by a specialist, Dr
Conrad.  On 12 November 1997 the plaintiff presented to that doctor
complaining
of pain and stiffness in the left ankle and difficulty standing or walking and
going up and down stairs.  She complained
that the ankle tends to give way.  On
examination the doctor found some degree of instability and ten degrees loss of
flexion, extension
and internal rotation.  
<P>

47  	Dr Conrad saw the plaintiff again on 12 November 1998.  On
examination he found some slight tenderness in the ankle, a slight
degree of
instability, and ten degrees of loss of flexion, extension and internal
rotation.  It was his opinion that the plaintiff
had sustained a partial or
complete rupture of the lateral co-lateral ligament of the left ankle with
resulting stiffness and instability.
<P>

48  	Dr Ellis assessed the plaintiff on 9 July 1999.  This was for
the purposes of a medico-legal report.  The plaintiff gave the
doctor a history
which was consistent with the evidence given in this Court.  Dr Ellis on
examination found a loss of half the normal
range of extension but flexion,
inversion and eversion were full.  He detected no localised tenderness.  The
doctor reported:
<P>

<i>"As a result of the fall in the hotel grounds in Bucca in 1991, Mrs Corliss
suffered lateral ligament tear affecting her left ankle
with subsequent
instability requiring reconstructive surgery.</i>
<P>

<i>The results of this have been indifferent and pain and disability persist in
the ankle and her leg as a result.  This has prevented
her from continuing her
work with horses in dressage, competition and instruction and in work as track
work rider.  Her other avenues
of employment in bar work and in disabled
childcare are similarly compromised.</i>
<P>

<i>This is no evidence of psychosomatic illness.</i>
<P>

<i>Continued medical supervision and conservative treatment, the wearing of
custom made orthotics and shoe adjustment may give her some
relief.  There is a
20% permanent loss of efficient use of her left foot and a 20% permanent loss
of efficient use of her left lower
limb at and above and below the knee as a
result of these injuries.</i>
<P>

<i>There is no evidence of pre-existing abnormality or debility affecting this
assessment."</i>
<P>

49  	There was also tendered in the plaintiff's case a psychologist's
report from Mr Glancey.  The plaintiff did not understand
why she had been sent
to the psychologist and I do not find myself to be assisted by the report,
except in one respect to which I
shall presently refer.
<P>

50  	None of the doctors upon whom the plaintiff relied and whose
evidence I have reviewed was required for cross examination.
<P>

51  	The plaintiff was assessed by an orthopaedic specialist, Dr
Cummine, on behalf of the defendant.  Dr Cummine examined the plaintiff
on 21
February 1997 and on examination he detected no restriction of ankle movements
but he did observe slight swelling anterior
to the lateral malleolus when
compared with the other side.  Dr Cummine concluded that the accident at the
Bucca Hotel had resulted
in a rupture of the lateral ligament of the ankle but
that the rupture had responded <i>"extremely well to surgical repair"</i>.  It
was the opinion of Dr Cummine that the plaintiff was fit to continue
indefinitely in the occupation she was following when he
saw her, which the
doctor understood to be a part time position in the hospital system.
<P>

52  	Dr Cummine considered it highly unlikely that the plaintiff
would develop post traumatic osteoarthritis and he later reviewed
an x-ray
dated 7 December 1992.  That, of course, was the x-ray taken when the plaintiff
first presented at hospital after the accident.
 As I understand the doctor's
report of 4 August 1997, commenting on the x-ray, he did not regard this x-ray
as being particularly
helpful for the purpose of assessing the risk of
arthritic changes developing but that x-ray did not change his opinion that it
was
highly unlikely that this complication would develop.
<P>

53  	Dr Lee conducted a psychiatric assessment for the defendant and
his report is dated 16 April 1999.  The doctor concluded that
the plaintiff has
no psychological injuries sustained as a result directly of her ankle injury.
Having considered Dr Lee's report
and the psychological report previously
mentioned, namely that of Mr Glancey, I accept that conclusion expressed by Dr
Lee.
<P>

54  	The defendant introduced into evidence some handwritten notes
produced by Dr Whittle.  Dr Whittle was the plaintiff's general
practitioner
after the plaintiff went to Queensland and the notes produced indicate that Dr
Whittle first saw the plaintiff on 14
February 1990 and that he last saw the
plaintiff on 25 November 1992.  The introduction of these notes has brought
into question
the reliability of the evidence given by the plaintiff.  In
cross-examination the plaintiff said that she had had no problems with
her left
ankle before this incident and denied having presented to Dr Whittle
complaining of problems in the ankle.  The doctor's
notes however indicate
otherwise.  In particular there are three entries relating to the ankle:
<P>

<i>"25/6/90	Left ankle unstable.  Twists internally with no provocation since
injury - 10 years with lateral ligament sprain...  Advice
re footwear, ankle
guards, strapping etc....</i>
<P>

<i>4/10/90	Left ankle sore...</i>
<P>

<i>24/1/91	Left ankle more troublesome...for opinion x-ray."</i>
<P>

55  	The plaintiff was directly cross-examined about what appears in
Dr Whittle's notes.  She directly denied that she had ever
had a problem with
her ankle prior to her fall in December 1992.
<P>

56  	The plaintiff did acknowledge that there were other entries in
the doctor's notes which related to her and it seems to me that
the entries
concerning the ankle in Dr Whittle's notes do relate to the plaintiff and lead
me to conclude that the plaintiff gave
Dr Whittle a history of ankle
instability following an injury some ten years previously.  There are no notes
of a complaint concerning
the left ankle in Dr Whittle's records, other than
those I have recorded above.  I observe that the doctor saw the plaintiff,
according
to those records, approximately fifteen times and the last time the
left ankle is mentioned is the entry of 24 January 1991.  Of
those fifteen
visits, eight were made after the entry of 24 January 1991.
<P>

57  	I have approached the assessment of the plaintiff's evidence
with caution, not only because of the notes of Dr Whittle, but
also because the
plaintiff denied in cross examination that she had spent time in hospital in
1995 and in 1996.
<P>

58  	The plaintiff was asked the following questions and gave the
following answers (T 48):
<P>

<i>"Q.	During 1995 and 1996, did you have some problems in relation to the
breakdown of your marriage?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In 1995 and 1996?  I didn't have any severe problems, I had a breakdown
of the relationship but I had no severe problems.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you have a nervous breakdown during that time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No sir.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Were you hospitalised at Nepean Hospital during 1995 for approximately
two weeks after a nervous breakdown due to marriage difficulties?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No sir I was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Were you hospitalised twice during 1996, the first occasion for about two
weeks and then in September and October of 1996 for five
to six weeks?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No sir, I was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Were you ever under the care of a Dr Manning?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No sir, I was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Psychiatrist?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Were you ever under the care of a psychiatrist at Nepean Hospital?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No sir, I was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you tell your solicitors--</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I didn't.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	--In late 1996 or early 1997, those facts?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No sir I did not."</i>
<P>

59  	The cross examination recorded above was no doubt prompted by
the content of the letter which the plaintiff's solicitors wrote
to the
defendant's solicitors on 4 February 1997 (Exhibit 10).  That letter reads in
part:
<P>

<i>"I have now had the opportunity of conferring with my client and have
instructions to proceed with the matter.</i>
<P>

<i>She suffered a nervous breakdown due to marriage difficulties which lead
[sic] to a separation from her husband.</i>
<P>

<i>She has been treated by Dr P Gilbertson of St Marys and a psychiatrist Dr
Manning at Nepean Hospital.</i>
<P>

<i>My client was hospitalised at Nepean District Hospital once during 1995 and
twice during 1996.  Apparently, the first two occasions
were for approximately
2 weeks and the third occasion during September and October 1996 was for 5-6
weeks."</i>
<P>

60  	What am I to make of this conflict between the plaintiff's
evidence and the letter which her solicitor's wrote?
<P>

61  	The only records tendered in evidence from the Nepean District
Hospital relate to the surgery undertaken on the ankle in 1995.
 There is no
reference in those notes to any nervous disorder.  No records have been placed
before this Court to establish that the
plaintiff was treated in the Nepean
District Hospital in 1996.  There has been no evidence from Dr Manning or Dr
Gilbertson.  However,
I note that when Dr Lee assessed the plaintiff in April
1999, he had available to him clinical notes from the Nepean Hospital of
July
1997 and also Dr Gilbertson's medical records from February 1994 until June
1998.  Dr Lee wrote a detailed report and I infer
he considered the notes from
Nepean Hospital to which he did refer as being available to him.  It would have
been of significance
for the purposes of Dr Lee's report if the plaintiff had
been hospitalised for a psychiatric disorder in 1995 and in 1996 but Dr
Lee
makes no mention of any such hospitalisations.  He did however comment on
having reviewed Dr Gilbertson's notes but made no mention
of any treatment by
that doctor for a psychiatric condition.  I infer that those notes contained no
record of any such treatment.
<P>

62  	Mr Glancey's report of 19 January 1998 to which I made earlier
reference is a very detailed report but the author obtained
no history of any
psychiatric treatment undergone by the plaintiff in 1995, 1996 or at all.  No
doctor whose reports have been introduced
into evidence has obtained any
history corresponding with the content of Exhibit 10.
<P>

63  	Whatever be the explanation for the content of that document, I
do not find on the evidence that the plaintiff did spend time
in hospital in
1995, other than for the ankle injury, and I do not find that the plaintiff was
hospitalised at all in 1996.  The
evidence does not support the content of
Exhibit 10 which I have extracted above.
<P>

64  	I do not find that the answers which the plaintiff gave in cross
examination as above set out were untruthful.
<P>

65  	The plaintiff gave her evidence before this Court in a seemingly
forthright fashion and I do not find that she has set out
to deceive this
Court.  Generally I accept her evidence as to the nature of the problems that
she has been experiencing in her ankle
since December 1992 and the evidence the
plaintiff gave as to the present position, which I recorded earlier in para 45
of this judgment.
<P>

66  	However, in view of what is contained in Dr Whittle's notes I do
not regard as reliable the plaintiff's evidence that she had
no trouble with
the ankle before December 1992.  On the other hand none of the doctors whose
reports I have reviewed was required
for cross examination.  Dr Conrad and Dr
Ellis accepted that the plaintiff's complaints were referable to the fall in
December 1992
and Dr Cummine also accepted that the plaintiff sustained a
rupture of the lateral ligament of the ankle as a result of the accident
at
that time.  It emerged when Mr Cullen tendered Dr Whittle's notes that these
were produced under subpoena and were available for
inspection as long ago as
1996.  It was by letter dated 14 October 1996 that the defendant's solicitors
gave notice to the plaintiff's
solicitors that the defendant would seek to rely
on those subpoenaed notes.
<P>

67  	None of the doctors whose reports have been tendered appear to
have been asked to consider the significance of the complaints
which Dr Whittle
had recorded in terms of their bearing upon what necessitated the surgery which
the plaintiff underwent or upon
the plaintiff's persisting complaints.
<P>

68  	Mr Cullen submitted that I should find that the plaintiff
suffered no more than a minor strain from which she made a recovery
within a
few weeks.  I have given close consideration to that submission but ultimately
I have concluded I should not accept it.
 Not without hesitation, I find on the
balance of probabilities that the plaintiff sustained tearing of the lateral
ligament in the
accident in December 1992 in an ankle that was already
vulnerable and prone to instability.  I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities
that the complaints the plaintiff made to Dr Dipold in 1993 and
the need for the operation in July 1995 arose by reason of the injury
sustained
in December 1992.  I am also satisfied that the tearing that occurred in
December 1992 is playing a causative role in such
difficulties as the plaintiff
has continued to experience since that time.
<P>

69  	In making those findings I do not overlook the evidence that the
plaintiff fell on 20 July 1995, the day before Dr Sherry performed
the
operation upon her (see Exhibit 8).  However Dr Sherry had earlier been
consulted by the plaintiff, and I accept that the plaintiff
had already been
placed on the waiting list for the operation that was undertaken, prior to the
fall on 20 July 1995.  In Dr Sherry's
report of 23 June 1997 the doctor stated
that by 21 July 1995 the plaintiff had developed <i>"chronic laxity requiring
surgery"</i>, and I accept that to be the case.
<P>

70  	It seems to me that the falls that the plaintiff has had since
December 1992 are on balance due to the instability in the ankle
since then,
and that, accordingly, the injury in 1992 has played a causative role in those
falls.
<P>

71  	A period of nearly seven years has now elapsed since the
accident in December 1992 and such problems as are persisting are
likely to be
permanent.
<P>

72  	I have decided that an appropriate allowance for the non
economic aspects of general damages is $50,000.  I propose to include
that sum
in my assessment.
<P>

73  	I apportion $25,000 of that amount to the past and I allow
interest on that sum at two percent, so I calculate interest at
$3375, rounding
the calculation off.
<P>

74  	The parties are agreed on the out of pocket expenses in the sum
of $2145.  Most of that sum is referable to the surgery and
it would seem from
Exhibit M only $320 has been paid to date.  No part of the out of pocket
expenses have been paid by the plaintiff.
 No claim has been made for interest
on the out of pocket expenses and it does not seem to me that it would be
appropriate to allow
any interest on them.
<P>

75  	There remains for consideration the claim for loss of earnings
and loss of earning capacity.  That claim I have found to present
considerable
difficulty.
<P>

76  	I note that the claim found expression in the Pt 33 r 8A
statement attached to the letter from the plaintiff's solicitors to
the
defendant's solicitors dated 15 April 1996.  In those particulars a claim was
made on the basis of what the plaintiff would have
earned in working as a
barmaid from January 1993 onwards.  However when Exhibit 10 was written in
February 1997 a claim was made
that the plaintiff intended to return to work
training show horses and that this would have earned her $35 per half hour.  It
was
alleged that due to the ankle injury the plaintiff was no longer able to
attend to such employment and that <i>"an economic buffer"</i> would be claimed
for this lost ability.  It was also asserted that the plaintiff would be unable
to obtain employment in a position
<i>"that required standing, walking and such
like"</i> and that once again <i>"an economic buffer"</i> would be claimed for
that lost ability.  It was again asserted in conclusion that the plaintiff was
no longer able to do work as
a barmaid or a shop assistant.
<P>

77  	At the hearing in the course of his final address Mr Lucas first
submitted that it would be appropriate to measure the plaintiff's
current
earning capacity uninjured at $1155 per week.  He based this submission upon
some evidence to which I shall presently refer
as to what the plaintiff
asserted that she could earn teaching riding.  That claim bore no resemblance
to any stage of the plaintiff's
pre injury working history.  Finally Mr Lucas
restated the claim for loss of earning capacity, making a claim that the loss
of capacity
should be measured at $180 per week for the past and for the
future, based upon what the plaintiff could have earned training horses.
<P>

78  	Obviously the plaintiff's claim for loss of earnings and loss of
earning capacity calls for close scrutiny.
<P>

79  	The plaintiff gave evidence that before the accident she had
worked as a barmaid and in numerous capacities handling horses.
 The plaintiff
said she had a ticket as a licensed strapper and stable hand, and she still
does.  She said she also worked giving
riding lessons.
<P>

80  	At the time of the accident the plaintiff does not appear to
have been in gainful employment.  The plaintiff did help her son
by assisting
him in a general store but she was not paid for this.  The plaintiff said that
she was assisting her husband on a property
holding thoroughbred racing stables
and claimed that she and her husband were jointly drawing $450 per week but the
plaintiff has
available no records concerning any income from that venture and,
according to the Australian Taxation Office, the plaintiff did
not lodge income
tax returns for the years ending 30 June 1992 to 30 June 1997 inclusive (see
Exhibit L).  I find no useful measure
of the plaintiff's earning capacity in
what work she was doing at the time of the accident.
<P>

81  	After the accident the plaintiff continued to reside in the
Bundaberg area until the property was sold.  The plaintiff was
vague about when
this was but following the sale the plaintiff went to Nowra and, as best I can
determine on the evidence, remained
there until the beginning of 1995.  Whilst
in Nowra the plaintiff did not seek work and explained this was due to
<i>"family reasons"</i>.  The plaintiff endured what I accept was an unpleasant
separation from her husband following the breakdown of the marriage and this
may well have distracted the plaintiff from gainful employment.  The plaintiff
said that the marriage ended in 1995.
<P>

82  	On the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff
would have sought gainful employment at any time before she
did in 1995,
whether she had injured her ankle or not.
<P>

83  	In 1995 the plaintiff sought and obtained employment at the
Nepean Hospital.  Group certificates (part of Exhibit L) first
record evidence
of the plaintiff's employment at the hospital as commencing on 1 July 1995 but
the plaintiff said, and I accept,
that she was already employed there before
that.  In any event, the plaintiff had continuous employment at the hospital
from 1995
until early in 1999 when the plaintiff resigned for personal reasons.
At that time she gained custody of her son and because of this
found the hours
at the hospital unsuitable.
<P>

84  	The work carried out by the plaintiff at the hospital was
varied.  To begin with the plaintiff had a position in the medical
imaging
department and this involved computer work.  The second position was as a
receptionist and the plaintiff described this as
a front desk position
directing visitors and members of the public to various areas of the hospital.
Eventually the plaintiff was
required to re-apply for that position when it
became a part-time permanent position and her application was successful.  The
plaintiff
worked in the hospital for four hours in the afternoon and evening
seven days per fortnight.  I am satisfied the plaintiff was physically
capable
of performing that sort of work and would have been capable of doing it on a
full-time basis.
<P>

85  	Whilst working at the hospital however the plaintiff was also
occupied in voluntary work with Riding for the Disabled Association.
 The
nature of the work done for that organisation is described in a document
comprising part of Exhibit K.  The work was voluntary
but the plaintiff was
provided with accommodation.  The letter from the Association describes the
plaintiff's position as a caretaker
and the plaintiff's duties required her to
feed, exercise and look after some fourteen horses.  The plaintiff had
maintenance responsibilities
for the caretaker's cottage and grounds.  The
plaintiff was capable of carrying on that work whilst working at the hospital
at the
same time.
<P>

86  	After leaving the hospital the plaintiff obtained a position
with Inghams as a stable hand and track work rider.  In this capacity
the
plaintiff worked five days per week five hours per day.  Some of the work was
heavy as a stable hand and the plaintiff was required
to carry out track work
as well.  The plaintiff said that she found the work physically too demanding
from the point of view of her
ankle and gave up this work on 18 May 1999.
Since then the plaintiff has done some part-time work as a shop assistant.
<P>

87  	I accept that the plaintiff found it difficult to continue with
the work at Inghams but the position there was only a casual
one, and the
evidence does not establish that the work there was better paid than the work
the plaintiff was able to do as a hospital
employee.  The evidence does not
satisfy me that if the plaintiff put her present ability to work to full use as
a receptionist or
in clerical work for which she is suited that she would earn
less in that sort of work than in the sort of work she did for a time
at
Inghams.
<P>

88  	The submissions made by counsel in support of the claim for loss
of earning capacity find their origin in evidence that the
plaintiff gave to
the following effect:  that she was aware of jobs available in the community
for horse trainers, that the plaintiff
had trained horses for other people and
that if she did train horses for somebody else, the going rate is $180 per
week, presumably
gross.  The plaintiff said that if she was teaching riding the
rate of pay would be $50 to $55 per hour and that a teacher could
expect to be
teaching three or four hours per day maximum over a seven day week.  The
plaintiff said that she considered herself
now to be incapable of horse
training, certainly of training thoroughbreds.  This was because she was not
balanced well enough and
she attributed that loss of balance to her ankle.  The
plaintiff said that she could teach riding and that she has done so.  The
plaintiff did not say when and provided no evidence of any earnings from that
source.  The plaintiff said that because of her ankle
she felt that she would
be limited to an hour per day if she undertook teaching.
<P>

89  	It is on the basis of the above answers that Mr Lucas expressed
the claim, later abandoned, for a loss of earning capacity
of $1155 per week
(from teaching) and the claim finally pursued for a loss of $180 per week in
training a horse.
<P>

90  	No evidence was forthcoming other than from the plaintiff about
the availability of teaching work or horse training work. 
Whilst I would
accept that the plaintiff's ankle would prevent her from teaching riding on a
full-time basis three hours per day
seven days per week, I am not persuaded
that work has been available in the past or present to allow the plaintiff to
do that amount
of work as a teacher.  Moreover it has not been established to
my satisfaction that the plaintiff ever taught riding so intensively.
 In
addition the plaintiff said that she could teach for an hour or so per day, but
the plaintiff has not attempted to do that kind
of work even on a limited
basis, so I am unpersuaded that were it not for her ankle, the plaintiff would
have been teaching three
hours per day seven days per week, or on any other
regular basis.
<P>

91  	So far as the claim for training a horse is concerned, the
plaintiff is well able to earn more in work for which she remains
physically
capable.
<P>

92  	I accept that the persisting problems with the injured ankle are
such as since the accident would have limited the plaintiff's
capacity for work
as a barmaid and for work that required her to be on her feet continuously.  I
accept that her ability to teach
riding would be limited in the manner I have
indicated.  I accept that these restrictions would have placed the plaintiff at
a disadvantage
on the labour market.  However, I am not satisfied by the
evidence that the plaintiff has sustained any measurable economic loss
between
the date of the accident and the present time by reason of such physical
restriction as I find the plaintiff to have.  The
claim for loss to date
fails.
<P>

93  	For the future, I am satisfied that the plaintiff remains
capable of full time clerical or receptionist type work, and indeed
all such
work that does not require her to be constantly on her feet, or moving about on
uneven ground.  The sort of restrictions
I have defined as resulting from the
plaintiff's injury to the present time will however persist in the future.  It
follows that
the plaintiff's disadvantaged position on the labour market will
persist in the future.  I think it probable that the plaintiff would
have
continued to work to age sixty-five but for this accident and that she will
continue to work to age sixty-five in spite of that
accident.  However in the
remainder of her working life the plaintiff will be restricted in the type of
work she can undertake. 
This need not necessarily result in economic loss but
there is the possibility by reason of her disadvantaged position that the
plaintiff
may suffer loss of earnings from time to time.  I consider it
therefore appropriate to make some provision to compensate the plaintiff
for
this.  In arriving at a figure I do not lose sight of the contingency that
whether this accident had happened or not, the pre-existing
weakness in the
ankle may at some time have interfered with the plaintiff's ability to earn in
any event.  I propose to allow the
plaintiff for the claim I am presently
considering the sum of $25,000.
<P>

94  	I summarise my assessment as follows:
<P>

General damages - non economic aspects	$50,000
<P>

Interest for the past	3,375
<P>

Out of pocket expenses	2,145
<P>

Loss of earning capacity	<u>25,000</u>
<P>

	$80,520
<P>

95  	There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of
$80,520.
<P>

96  	I reserve the question of costs to afford the parties the
opportunity of making appropriate submissions.
