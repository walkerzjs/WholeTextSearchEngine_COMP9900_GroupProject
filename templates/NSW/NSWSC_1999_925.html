LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiffs are engaged in the development of a retirement
village.  The defendant is a financier which has advanced money
to finance that
development.  The amount owing under the facility is something like $4 million.
As security for the advance, the
plaintiffs have provided a mortgage over the
site of the development and an adjacent site, and also certain charges and
guarantees.
 The defendant alleges there have been defaults under the loan
agreement, and is threatening to exercise remedies, including the
appointment
of a receiver.  In particular, the defendant alleges a default in payment of
interest which was due to be paid on 22nd
July this year, and default in
relation to failure to rectify an alleged deficiency in the ratio between the
value of security and
advances made.
<P>

2  	I am dealing with an application for an interlocutory injunction
to restrain the defendant from exercising remedies based on
those two alleged
defaults.
<P>

3  	In relation to the latter of the defaults, it is accepted by the
defendant that there is a serious question to be tried on whether
the defendant
has properly determined, pursuant to cl.4.3 of the loan agreement, that the
ratio between the money secured and the
value of the security exceeds the
specified ratio.  However, Mr. Fagan SC for the defendant has submitted that no
serious question
to be tried has been shown in relation to the other matter of
default, namely the failure to pay interest due on 22nd July.  
<P>

4  	Mr. Fagan submitted that, while the defendant accepted that the
plaintiffs could seek draw-downs to cover interest, and while
draw-downs were
in fact permitted which covered interest, there was no promise or
representation that interest did not have to be
paid on the due dates,
irrespective of whether a draw-down covering interest occurred or not.  Mr.
Fagan further submitted that,
even if there was some representation based on
the practice adopted which could require the giving of notice to the plaintiffs
that
payment of interest was required, such notice was in fact given on 30th
July this year, and interest was not then paid prior to 5th
August this year,
when the notice of default was issued.
<P>

5  	Notwithstanding that submission, my opinion is that there is a
serious question to be tried on this aspect.  There is evidence
that an
arrangement was made whereby interest could be claimed in the applications for
draw-downs, and at least until June, draw-downs
covering interest were
provided.  The proceeds of such draw-downs were paid into an account of the
plaintiffs, and then the amount
of the interest was recovered by the defendant
through its own act.  The defendant had authority to that extent to have the
plaintiffs'
account debited.
<P>

6  	It appears that in June this year, despite an earlier indication
that something over $407,000.00 was to be provided, only $192,000.00
was
provided; but it seems that interest was paid, presumably by the defendant
securing the payment of interest out of the amount
of $192,000.00 credited to
the plaintiffs' account.
<P>

7  	In July, a draw-down was sought, apparently at the usual time.
It was not paid at the usual time; but on 30th July 1999, the
defendant advised
the plaintiffs that the payment could be expected early the following week.  I
interpolate here that 30th July
was a Friday.  On the same day, the defendant
gave notice that interest had not been paid, and required immediate payment of
interest.
 However, it did not, in that letter, suggest that the July draw-down
was not to be available early the following week as had been
stated in the
other letter of 30th July, nor did it state that the payment was required
within any specified time after the letter.
 It appears that no particular time
limit was imposed until a letter of 4th August, which imposed a time limit of
12 noon the following
day.  The notice of default was in fact issued on 5th
August. 
<P>

8  	In my opinion, there is a serious question to be tried on whether
the arrangement plus the practice I have outlined, coupled
with the statement
that the July draw-down was to be made early in the week following 30th July,
gave rise to a situation where payment
of interest otherwise than out of that
draw-down could be insisted upon only after reasonable notice had been given,
such notice
requiring the express limit of a reasonable time, coupled with
advice that payment was required irrespective of whether the draw-down
was
provided.
<P>

9  	In my opinion, should the plaintiffs, at a final hearing, succeed
on that point, it would have the result that the notice of
default given on
5thAugust was invalid.
<P>

10  	I turn to the question of balance of convenience.
<P>

11  	Mr. Fagan for the defendant submitted that the balance of
convenience does not favour the grant of relief, because the plaintiffs
can
continue with their project only if they are able to use the proceeds of the
sale of units in order to pay the builder.  Sale
of units requires the consent
of the defendant, and there is no evidence that that consent has been given.
The sale of units and
use of the proceeds to pay the builder would reduce the
value of the security, and the defendant is under no obligation to consent
to
the sale of units, at least on any terms other than the payment of the whole of
the proceeds to the defendant.
<P>

12  	Mr. Coles QC for the plaintiffs has submitted that that was not
a matter raised in the evidence, and that on his instructions,
evidence can be
led showing consent by conduct or an appropriate estoppel in relation to sales
which had been effected of about twenty
units; and it is the settlement of
those sales already entered into which would be required to enable the project
to continue.  Mr.
Coles further submitted that the application of the proceeds
of sales of units for that purpose would in fact improve the security
position
of the defendant, by reducing the amount still to be paid to complete the
project.  I would note that the defendant has
indicated an intention, if a
receiver is appointed, that the receiver proceed to complete the project.  That
could be done either
with the existing builder, in which case the receiver
would have to pay the amounts which the plaintiffs are now proposing to pay
from the sale of units; or alternatively, with a new builder, which may save
the cost of paying the present builder for amounts due
for work in the past,
but would certainly involve substantial establishment costs in relation to such
a new builder.
<P>

13  	Mr Coles further submitted that, even on the defendant's own
figures, the security the defendant presently has over the subject
property
substantially exceeds the amount owing.  The ratio which the defendant claims
to have been exceeded is a 60% ratio, and
the ratio presently claimed is 67%.
In addition, the defendant has the benefit of other securities which Mr. Coles
submits, on the
material before me, are of substantial value.  
<P>

14  	One other matter I should mention is that there is evidence that
the plaintiffs have applied for finance to pay out the defendant;
and there is
evidence that the plaintiffs are expecting two letters of offer of such finance
within about 48 hours, and that the
actual advance would then be arranged
within a further period of 4-8 weeks.  Mr. Coles submitted that interlocutory
relief should
not be limited in such a way as to make the plaintiffs reliant on
such re-financing:  there is a serious question to be tried as
to whether the
plaintiffs are in default at all, and they should not be put in the position of
having to accept whatever offer they
can achieve in such a short time.
<P>

15  	I should add that it is common ground that if any relief is
given, it should be limited to the earlier of 21st February 2000
or further
order, because the date for repayment of the principal is 21st February
2000.
<P>

16  	In my opinion, when one has regard to the very serious
consequences for the plaintiffs of the appointment of a receiver, and
the other
factors I have mentioned, the balance of convenience does favour the granting
of relief.  At present, no order is sought
by the plaintiffs requiring consent
to the completion of existing sales.  The orders sought propose the application
of proceeds of
any such sale, first, in payment of interest falling due in the
future to the defendant, and secondly, in payment of the builder
and other
expenses of the development.
<P>

17  	I am not able in this hearing to determine whether consent to
sales has been granted, or even if there is a serious question
to be tried as
to whether consent has been granted.  I would express the tentative view that,
if there is a serious question to be
tried as to whether there has been
consent, at least by conduct, or an equivalent estoppel, then the balance of
convenience would
favour allowing the sales to be completed on the terms
proposed by the plaintiffs.  In my opinion, the use of proceeds for payment
of
interest is a use for the benefit of the defendant, notwithstanding Mr Fagan's
submission that it reduces the security without
reducing principal.  In my
opinion also, payments made to the builder and other persons engaged in the
development substantially
increase the value of the security for the reasons I
have already given.  I would therefore hope that, if there is a serious
question
to be tried on the matter of consent, this is not a matter that has to
be made the subject of a further lengthy interlocutory contest
before the
Court.  In taking the approach that I do, I do give weight to the consideration
that, on the material before me, the total
security available to the defendant
seems to be more than adequate to ensure that it is repaid in full.
<P>

18  	The other matter I need to decide is whether I should limit the
relief to two weeks in the first instance, and if a letter
of offer is
obtained, a further ten weeks.  On the whole, I do not think it appropriate to
limit the relief in that way.  I have
found that there is at least an arguable
case that the plaintiffs are not in default at all.  I have found that on the
material before
me, the defendant seems to have ample security.  For those
reasons, I do not think it appropriate to subject the plaintiffs to the
requirement of immediately accepting the first offer they can obtain for
re-financing.  I also take account of the fact that such
a restriction could
lead to further interlocutory skirmishing, if the defendant takes the view that
a letter of offer may not be
adequate to give a reasonable prospect of the
defendant being paid out.
<P>

19  	In substance then, I would propose to grant the relief in the
form sought by the plaintiffs.  I would make the relief limited
to 21st
February 2000 or further order, whichever is the sooner.  I might also be
minded to impose some requirement of notice in
relation to proposed settlements
by the plaintiffs, and any proposed action by the defendant based in any way on
an allegation that
the settlement of sales is a default under the mortgage.
<P>

<center>(Submissions ensued)</center>
<P>


<P>

20  	Having heard further submissions, I would propose to include in
the order a provision for notice of proposed settlements and
application of
proceeds, and notice from the defendant of any intention to treat a settlement
as a default.  At present, I am inclined
to think that 7 days' notice in each
case would be appropriate.  The order should provide for payment of interest on
due dates irrespective
of any settlements.  
<P>

21  	A question arises as to the extent to which proceeds of sale
could be held back from payments under lower categories of paragraph
6, because
of an anticipated claim for payment in the near future of one of the higher
categories.  When attempting to draft the
order precisely, in my opinion the
order should allow a small amount of flexibility to the plaintiffs because the
time for payment
of the items under paragraph 6 will not necessarily coincide
with the time of the settlement.
<P>

<center>(Submissions on costs)</center>
<P>


<P>

22  	On the question of costs, Mr. Coles has submitted that there
should be an order for costs in the plaintiffs' favour.  Mr. Fagan
submits that
costs should be costs in the proceedings.  In my view, the proper order for
costs is that they be plaintiffs' costs
in the proceedings.  I would make it
clear that that is not a final determination that the defendant cannot
ultimately add the costs
to the mortgage.  However, if it is sought, I would
make an interlocutory order that for the purpose of determining security ratio
and the like, the costs of this interlocutory application not be included by
the defendant in this calculation until further order.
<P>

23  	I stand the matter over to tomorrow for short minutes.
<P>

24  	The exhibits may be returned.
