<b>JUDGMENT (Particulars of defence of comment &amp; qualified privilege -
mitigation of damages - contextual imputations - capacity
- form)</b>
<P>

1	This matter (and accompanying litigation, matter numbers 20701/94, 20929/94
and 20930/94) has been the subject of judgments and
orders as follows:  Dowd J
27 November 1995;  Levine J 30 November 1995;  Studdert J 5 June 1996;  Levine
J 29 August 1997.  The
background and general nature of the litigation is
usefully set out by Studdert J in his judgment.
<P>

2	By Notice of Motion filed on 4 December 1997 the applicant seeks relief
essentially in the nature of the defendants' defences
being struck out in whole
or in part, or alternatively, that the defendants supply further and better
particulars.  All relevant
documentary material is contained in a folder (which
regrettably had to be supplied twice by the solicitors for the plaintiffs, the
first having gone astray in the Registry) which folder is MFI "A" and which
will be returned to the solicitors for the plaintiff
with a direction that it
be kept intact. 
<P>

3	The Notice of Motion was filed, as a I understand it, consequent upon the
defendants failing to satisfy the solicitors for the
plaintiff in their
response to a letter of 3 December 1997 which comments upon and protests about
various aspects of the defendants'
pleadings.
<P>

4	I shall deal with the matters of complaint in the same order as is set out in
that letter, which order was followed by Mr Henskens
of Counsel for the
plaintiff.
<P>

5	The particulars of the "<i>proper material for comment</i>" provided in the
defendants' letter of 10 November 1997 are inadequate.  The defendants, insofar
as they rely upon statements of
fact in the matters complained of as
constituting proper material for comment, should set out from the matters
complained of what
they assert to be those statements of fact and what it is
about them that makes them "<i>proper</i>" material for comment.
<P>

6	The nature and purpose of the particulars required in support of a defence of
comment have been dealt with by Hunt J in <b><i>Sims v Wran</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20NSWLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1
NSWLR 317</a> at 322C-326E.
<P>

7	Insofar as it is contended for the plaintiff that to the extent that the
defendants are asserting that all the matters complained
of contain statements
of fact then, by definition, a concession is being made by the defendants that
none of the matters complained
of contain comment, I must say I find myself in
disagreement.  The nature of the defence of comment has recently and most
usefully
been clarified by Priestley JA in <b><i>New South Wales Aboriginal
Land Council v Perkins</i></b> (Court of Appeal, unreported, 20 November 1998)
at pages 6-7.
<P>

8	The response for the defendants by reference to the particulars set out under
(10) on page 10 of the Defence and to the defendants'
letter of 16 December
1997 is inadequate.
<P>

9	The defendants' will be ordered to supply proper particulars, in accordance
with these reasons, of their defence of comment, within
28 days.
<P>

10	The defendants' rely upon the defence of qualified privilege as provided by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i> and at common law.  In the exchange of
correspondence in MFI I complaint is made as to the inadequacy of the
particulars provided
by the defendants in support of this plea.  The purpose of
particulars is clear:  a party must be made aware of the nature of the
case
that party is called upon to meet (<b><i>Sims v Wran </i></b><i>(supra) </i>at
321D and authorities therein referred to).  In the same case at pages 326F-328A
Hunt J sets out the nature and purpose of particulars
of a defence of qualified
privilege particularly under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> (see also <b><i>Konstantidis v Foreign Media
Pty Limited &amp; Ors</i></b>;  <b><i>Konstantinidis v Foreign Language
Publications Pty Limited</i></b> (Levine J, unreported, 8 August 1997).  It is
argued for the defendant that the particulars set out at pp 9-10 of the Defence
together
with the material contained in the correspondence is sufficient.
Clearly, as to the former, it hardly can be argued that the material
provided
is of sufficient particularity when particulars (b)(iv), (v) and (vi) are
conditional.  The plaintiff is entitled to particulars
of the facts, matters
and circumstances upon which the defendants' rely in establishing each
component of the defence whether it
be under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> or at common law.  The
plaintiff is not entitled to the evidence that the defendant would lead in
support of those facts, matters
and circumstances.  The plaintiff's solicitors
in their letter of 21 October 1997 paragraph 3(b) and (c), in effect, make the
request
in the usual terms.  That they were entitled so to do is clear from the
deficiency in the particulars appended to the pleadings to
which I have
referred.  The material in the defendants' correspondence does advance their
case to some extent but not, and in this
I agree with Mr Henskens, sufficiently
to expose the case either under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> or at common law which the defendants'
intend to litigate.  The material is to some extent argumentative.
<P>

11	The exercise in supplying particulars should be as simple as the exercise in
requesting them.  The form of request to which I
have referred above should
facilitate the provision of succinct and clear enunciation of the defendants'
case.  This the defendants'
will be required to.  I will not however order, at
this stage, that the defendants' identify by name each recipient of the subject
publication.  However the nature of the communications is such that the
plaintiff is entitled in relation to the components of the
statutory defence
and the particular bases of the defence at common law which have been
identified, to the identification of a "<i>class of recipients</i>" with some
precision.  
<P>

12	Accordingly, the defendants will be ordered within 28 days and in accordance
with these reasons, to provide further and better
particulars of the defences
of qualified privilege under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> and at common law in accordance with the
plaintiff's solicitor's request dated 21 October 1997.  
<P>

13	In relation to particular (ii) in the particulars of Mitigation of Damages
appended to the Defence, "<i>the bad reputation of the plaintiffs", </i>I am
satisfied that the particulars provided are sufficient.  They are probably more
than sufficient.  The evidence by which the defendants
propose to prove that in
the relevant area the plaintiff had a bad reputation is something that will be
forthcoming at trial.
<P>

14	Particular (iii) "<i>truth of the imputations"</i>:  the defendants have not
pleaded truth pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15.</a>  If they propose to do so they shall have to,
absent the plaintiff's consent, formally move the Court for leave, in which
eventuality,
no doubt full and proper particulars will be part of the
documentation in support of the motion. 
<P>

15	As to particular (iv) the plaintiff is entitled to the facts, matters and
circumstances relied upon in support of the truth of
the contextual
imputations.  It is to be noted that the defendants have deferred providing
those on the basis that the availability
of the contextual imputations is in
question.  I shall deal with that below.
<P>

16	As to particular (v) the "<i>conspiracy</i>":  this is on its face an
egregiously embarrassingly particular and I will order it to be struck out.  If
the defendants persist
in making an allegation of this kind they will have to
formally seek leave to amend and in doing so make it quite clear how it is
contended that a properly particularised conspiracy is a matter that can
affect, in a properly particularised way, the damages to
which the plaintiff is
entitled.
<P>

17	As to particular (vi) "<i>abuse of process</i>":  I strike this out.  The
defendants' application to Studdert J in this regard failed, and <i>in this
action</i> there being no attempt separately to plead abuse of process as a
cause of action, this particular is also embarrassing.  If the defendants
propose to pursue it then the same approach will have to be adopted as I have
referred to in relation to particular (v).
<P>

18	As to particular (vii), <i>"false claims</i>":  this particular will be
struck out as embarrassing.  No information hitherto provided really clarifies
what is intended by this
allegation under the heading of "<i>Mitigation of
Damages</i>"; insofar as the plaintiff is claiming general and special damages,
that will be an issue for the plaintiff to prove.  The "<i>falsity</i>" of any
claim for special damages, for example, may well be exposed in evidence.  This
particular is embarrassing.
<P>

19	As to particulars (viii) and (ix):  "<i>delay in prosecuting the claim</i>"
and <i>"delay in supplying proper particulars"</i> I do not propose to strike
these out.  The defendants have given notice to the plaintiff that presumably
they will propose to adduce
evidence in proper form as to delay and seek to
argue that that delay does not conform with the usual reasons why an action for
defamation
is instituted.  The plaintiff however is entitled to particulars of
the facts, matters and circumstances relied upon by the defendants
in asserting
that there was "<i>delay"</i> in both cases and the defendants will be ordered
to provide those particulars within 28 days.  
<P>

20	As to particular (x) relating to the initiation of proceedings on 12
December 1991 and the parties then named and an alleged
breach of SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p21" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 21</a> r
2, I am not in the position on any of the information available to determine
how this can conceivably operate to the diminution
of any damages to which the
plaintiff is entitled.  This is an embarrassing particular and will be struck
out. Again if the defendants
assert that they can make a case in relation to
these events "<i>in mitigation of damages</i>" then they will formally have to
seek leave to amend the defence properly to particularise such a claim (see my
comments in relation
to particulars (v) and (vi) above).
<P>

21	Complaint is made by the plaintiff concerning the defendants' contextual
imputations, the complaints relating to form, difference
in substance and
capacity.
<P>

22	The Amended Statement of Claim (filed on 15 July 1996) pleads five
publications.
<P>

23	The plaintiff contends that the first publication gives rise to the
following imputation:
<P>

	<i>"3(a)	the plaintiff has acted in breach of its duties as manager of the
Estate Mortgage Trusts by making recommendations to the unit
holders which were
contrary to their interests in order to advance the interests of one of its own
shareholders, namely, Mercantile
Mutual".</i>
<P>

24	The defendants contend that the matter complained of conveys the following
contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"14(a)...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiff has been incompetent in the management of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts or one or more of them.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiff has been negligent in the management of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts or one or more of them.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiff is dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiff has been deceitful in the management of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts or one or more of them.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiff has received or will receive excessive fees for or in
respect of the management of the Estate Mortgage Trusts or
one or more of
them.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiff has acted and has continued to act for the benefit of a
third party in the management of the Estate Mortgage Trusts
in breach of their
obligations.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiff improperly wants to turn the unit holders investment
into a sharemarket driven investment so that it can continue
to receive
excessive fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The plaintiff improperly wants the Trusts listed on the share market
in order to receive high management fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	The plaintiff unjustifiably opposes the proposals made by or on behalf
of the first defendant as set out in annexure `A'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(x)	the plaintiff has acted unreasonably in opposing the first defendant's
proposals set out in annexure `A'".</i>
<P>

25	In <b><i>Hall &amp; Anor v Nationwide News Pty Limited </i></b>(unreported,
5 November 1998) I held essentially that a defendant is bound by the same rules
as to precision and difference in substance
in pleading contextual imputations
as is a plaintiff in pleading imputations as causes of action.
<P>

26	A mere glance at these ten contextual imputations exposes each to be
defective in form as contravening the principles in <b><i>Drummoyne Municipal
Council v The Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 135</a>
and<b><i> Ma Ching Kwan &amp; Anor v John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited
</i></b>(Court of Appeal, unreported, 30 July 1998).  None of the contextual
imputations asserts in the requisite sense the act or condition
of the
plaintiff corporation;  (i) and (ii) are rolled up;  (iii) is embarrassingly
vague;  (iv) does not identify the "<i>deceit</i>";  (v) and (vi) are rolled
up;  (vii) and (viii) use the word "<i>improperly</i>";  (ix) and (x) are vague
and embarrassing by reason of the use of "<i>unjustifiably</i>" and
"<i>unreasonably</i>" and by referring something described as "<i>annexure
`A'".</i>
<P>

27	The defendants should give very careful consideration to all issues relating
to the pleading of contextual imputations not the
least being the number
thereof, and certainly to the "<i>capturing" </i>precisely of a relevant act or
condition of the corporate plaintiff that does not offend against the rule that
the contextual imputation
must differ in substance from the imputation pleaded
by the plaintiff.
<P>

28	The plaintiff with respect to the second matter complained of pleads that it
conveys the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"5(a)	the plaintiff acted contrary to its duties as manager of the Estate
Mortgage Trust by concealing the availability of a legal
claim available to the
trusts from the unit holders for the purpose of securing financial advantage to
itself;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiff has acted in breach of its duty as manager of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts by attempting to prevent an audit of the
trusts' accounts in
order to conceal its own misconduct as manager".</i>
<P>

29	The defendants plead the following contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"15(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiff has acted or will act in its own self interest to the
detriment of the Estate Mortgage Trust.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiff is dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiff has been deceitful in the management of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts. </i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiff's true intentions are to ensure payments to itself of
excessive fees at the expense of unit holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiff improperly wants an increase in remuneration to the
excessive amount of $4 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiff has improperly failed to disclose to unit holders that
they will be worse off if they vote yes to resolution F
propose by the
plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiff improperly opposed an audit and may have something to
hide.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The plaintiff engages in trickery to obtain more powers from unit
holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	The plaintiff unjustifiably opposes the proposals made by or on behalf
of the first defendant as set out in annexure `B'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(x)	the plaintiff has acted unreasonably in opposing the first defendant's
proposals as set out in annexure `B'".</i>
<P>

30	Again the same position applies to these ten contextual imputations which I
propose to strike out. 
<P>

31	In relation to contextual imputation (viii) which did receive some
particular attention in the course of submission, the matter
complained of does
refer to a "<i>clever trick</i>";  this does not save the contextual imputation
as to form.  Where the matter complained of identifies that which it also
describes
as a "<i>trick</i>", a contextual imputation, subject to any other
consideration as to form or difference in substance, should "<i>capture</i>"
the conduct and its description.  
<P>

32	As to the third matter complained of the plaintiff pleads that it conveys
the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"7(a)	The plaintiff has acted in breach of its duties as manager of the
Estate Mortgage Trust by exercising its power as manager for
the sole purpose
of securing financial advantage to itself".</i>
<P>

33	The defendants plead the following contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"16(a)...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiff is seeking excessive fees from the Estate Mortgage
Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiff is insolvent.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiff is not competent to manage the Estate Mortgage
Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiff is planning to retain excessive fees at the expense of
unit holders who will get nothing.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiff proposes to lock up unit holders funds in perpetuity with
a stock market listing in order to obtain excessive fees
while the unit holders
get nothing.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiff looks after itself at the expense of unit
holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiff is dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The plaintiff saved itself from financial disaster by acting as
Manager of the Trusts and gaining access to excessive fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	The plaintiff unjustifiably opposes the proposals made by or on behalf
of the first defendant as set out in annexure `C'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(x)	The plaintiff has acted unreasonably in opposing the first defendant's
proposals as set out in annexure `C'".</i>
<P>

34	With respect to these contextual imputations, I hold that (ii) is incapable
of arising; (i), (iv)and (vi), in my view, encapsulate
only what already is
contained in the plaintiff's imputation and they are struck out.  Contextual
imputations (viii), (ix) and (x)
are struck out, the first by reason that it
really does not differ in substance from that pleaded by the plaintiff, and the
last
two being egregiously defective in form. 
<P>

35	I will allow proposed contextual imputation (v) to go the jury.  
<P>

36	As to contextual imputation (vii) I will strike this out as being vague and
embarrassing and otherwise defective in form.
<P>

37	As to the fourth matter complained of the plaintiff alleges it conveys the
following imputation:
<P>

	<i>"9(a)	the plaintiff has breached it duties as manager of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts by failing to pursue e legitimate legal claim
pm behalf of the
trust".</i>
<P>

38	The defendants contend that it conveys the following contextual
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"17(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiff was nearly bankrupt when it took over the Trust as
Manager and is reliant on Estate Mortgage to provide it with
an income.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiff charges excessive fees".</i>
<P>

39	With respect to each of these contextual imputations I am satisfied that it
arises and differs in substance from that pleaded
by the plaintiff and is not
defective in form.
<P>

40	Accordingly, contextual imputation 17(a)(i) and (ii) will go to the jury.

<P>

41	As to the fifth matter complained of the plaintiff contends that it conveys
the following imputation:
<P>

	<i>"11(a)	The plaintiff has engaged in corruption in acting as manager of the
Estate Mortgage Trusts".</i>
<P>

42	The defendants contend that it conveys the following contextual
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"18(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiff is a corrupt organisation in the sense that it has been
made bad by errors.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiff is a corrupt organisation in the sense it is without
integrity.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiff is a corrupt organisation in the sense it is
dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiff permits itself to be managed by a director who is
unscrupulous.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiff connived with the Trustees to fetter the Chairman (Sir
Laurence Street) for its own advantage".</i>
<P>

43	It is to these contextual imputations that the principles in
<b><i>Drummoyne</i></b><i> (supra) </i>are particularly applicable.  The
publication as pleaded is short and the contextual imputations (i), (ii) and
(iii) are captured
by the clearly capable of being conveyed imputation pleaded
by the plaintiff.
<P>

44	Contextual imputations 18(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) will be struck out. 
<P>

45	After much consideration I am of the view that contextual imputations
18(a)(iv) and (v) are capable of being conveyed, are not
defective in form and
thus shall go to the jury. 
<P>

46	The remaining matter appears to be the objection taken to paragraph 10 of
the Defence.
<P>

47	Paragraph 10 is in the following terms:
<P>

	"<i>The first defendant admits writing the letter begin Schedule `E' of the
ASC but says the letter was explained, qualified and added
to by the first
defendant's last fax to Sir Laurence Street and a fax of Graham Sackley of 10
December 1991 and that these two documents
must be read with the letter in
Schedule `E' and the plaintiff should be required to plead and set them out in
the ASC.  Otherwise
the first defendant does not admit the matters set out in
paragraph 10 of the ASC".</i>
<P>

48	The matter complained of is constituted by a letter from Hari Bhagat to Sir
Laurence Street dated 10 December 1991.  It refers
to "<i>the views expressed
by Graham Sackley in his fax of today to you"</i>. 
<P>

49	The plaintiff took the position that the matters pleaded in paragraph 10
were embarrassing and Mr Evatt for the defendants took
up the suggestion that
he <i>nunc pro tunc</i> make an application to "<i>strike in</i>" the two
documents referred to (<b><i>Gordon v Amalgamated Television Services Pty
Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 410</a>;  <b><i>Burrows v Knightley </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20651" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987)
10 NSWLR 651).</a>
<P>

50	In the original letter requesting particulars dated 21 October 1997 from the
plaintiff's solicitors to Mr Bhagat the first request
was for a copy of each of
the documents referred to in paragraph 10.  Unfortunately none of the material
I have appears to expose
to me the enclosures referred to in Mr Bhagat's letter
of 10 November 1997 in which he said that those particular were
"<i>enclosed</i>".  The correspondence annexed to an affidavit (which was not
read) of April Gillian Mountfort alas, does not contain the material.
 This
does not render my task impossible.  The matter simply can be resolved.
Paragraph 10 in the Defence is an embarrassing pleading
which cannot be cured
by an application of the kind Mr Evatt sought to make.  I strike out paragraph
10.  If the defendants are of
the view that in accordance with established
principle (see the cases cited above) the plaintiff should have pleaded a
communication
from another person other than the defendants but to the same
recipient and on the same date, and a communication from the defendants
to the
same recipient a week later then the defendants should, in a manner more
formal, move the Court and make detailed submissions.
 I am not persuaded,
presently, however, on the face of that which purports to be set out in
paragraph 10 of the Defence, that a
case for a "<i>strike in"</i> has been
made.  I have only ruled that paragraph 10 is embarrassing as a pleading.
<P>

51	It is clear that the plaintiff has succeeded predominantly and costs will be
awarded accordingly.
<P>

52	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The defendants are to provide proper particulars of the defence of comment,
