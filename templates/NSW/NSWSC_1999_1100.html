<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>BELL J</b>
<P>

<b>Tuesday, 16 November 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>011212/99 - MICHAEL DAVID DICKSON v THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>: By these proceedings the plaintiff
claims a declaration that the defendant, his servants and agents, have no power
to require a
person charged with an offence to submit to having physical
measurements of their body taken.  Further, the plaintiff claims an order
that
the defendant, his servants and agents, be prohibited from requiring the
plaintiff to submit to the taking of measurements by
a medical practitioner or
any other person acting on behalf of the defendant.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff is a remand prisoner currently being held in
custody at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, Silverwater.
 On 29
March 1999 he was charged with the commission of an armed robbery offence at
the ANZ Bank, Crown Street Wollongong on 1 October
1998.  
<P>

3   	The robbery is being investigated by officers attached to
Task Force Mega. In the course of their investigations police attached
to the
Task Force obtained advice from Dr Richard Smith, of the Faculty of Health
Sciences, Cumberland Campus, Sydney University.
Dr Smith specialises in the
study of biomechanics. It is proposed to have  Dr Smith study a video film
showing the robber and comment
on any similarity between the person depicted
therein and the plaintiff. Professor Smith needs to compare measurements of the
plaintiff's
limbs with his observations of the person depicted in the video in
order to form an opinion.  
<P>

4   	The investigating police wish to arrange for an examination
of the plaintiff to be carried out by a medical practitioner. 
It is proposed
that the medical practitioner take measurements of the plaintiff's limbs and/or
other physical features.  The measurements
need to be made on a bare segment.
Any obstruction such as clothing would need to be adjusted in order to permit
the medical practitioner
access to the plaintiff's joints at each end of the
segment of the limb and to allow a tape measure to be placed against the
segment.
 The practitioner would then palpate the joint to locate a known
anatomical landmark and place a water soluble ink dot at that point.
 The
process would be repeated at the other end of the limb segment.  The distance
between the dot points would be measured. It is
possible to conduct the
examination without the need for placing marks on the body of the plaintiff,
although the latter would make
the measurements more precise.  
<P>

5   	The power to conduct such an examination is said to be
found in s 353A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> 1900.
<P>

6   	Section 353A(2) is in these terms:  
<P>

"When a person is in lawful custody upon a charge of committing any crime or
offence which is of such a nature and is alleged to
have been committed under
such circumstances that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an
examination of his or her person
will afford evidence as to the commission of
the crime or offence, any legally qualified medical practitioner acting at the
request
of any officer of police of or above the rank of sergeant, and any
person acting in good faith in his or her aid and under his or
her direction,
may make such an examination of the person so in custody as is reasonable in
order to ascertain the facts which may
afford such evidence."
<P>

7   	Section 353A was inserted in the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> by Act
No. 10 of 1924 (<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> Amendment Act</b> 1924, s 13).  A number of
subsections have been added to s 353A since that time.  Subsection 2 has
remained unchanged (save for the
inclusion of words to make it non gender
specific) since 1924.  This provision was examined by the Court in <b>Fernando
v Commissioner of Police</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 567.</a>  In that case the majority
held that the terms of the section did not authorise the drawing of blood from
the body of a person in
lawful custody.  Priestley JA observed (at 572):
<P>

"Considering merely the words of s 353A when enacted in 1924, my opinion would
be that an examination of the person of someone in
custody as permitted by
subsection (2) would permit an external examination involving an examination by
eye and touch."
<P>

8   	Mr Craddock, who appeared for the plaintiff, submitted that
the examination permitted by the subsection is confined to a medical
examination.  It is to be observed that the section is not, in terms, so
limited.  
<P>

9   	Mr Craddock submitted that what was proposed in this case
was the use of a medical practitioner to meet one of the requirements
of the
subsection. However the examination, so it was submitted, must be as to matters
upon which a medical practitioner relying
on his or her specialised skill and
knowledge is able to express a medical opinion. 
<P>

10   	The construction for which the plaintiff contends would
produce arbitrary results.  In a case charging a sexual offence where
the
appearance of the offender's genitalia was of relevance, the section would
authorise an examination to determine the presence
or absence of genital warts
but not a distinctive tattoo or birthmark. 
<P>

11   	In <b>Fernando</b> the majority declined to follow the
decision of the South Australian court in <b>R v Franklin</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2022%20SASR%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 22 SASR
101</a>, a case which was concerned with the interpretation of a similar provision
in the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soa189/" class="autolink_findacts">Summary Offences Act</a></b> 1953 (SA). Wells J in the latter case held
that because a medical practitioner is the person nominated to carry out the
examination
it is implied that the scope of the examination is such that a
medical practitioner might carry it out in the ordinary course of
medical
practice. From this it flowed that the taking of blood samples was embraced by
"the examination" authorised by the section.
In analysing the reasoning of
Wells J in this regard Priestley JA in <b>Fernando </b>observed:
<P>

 "it seems to me, with respect, to be a mistake to equate an examination by a
medical practitioner <i>for the purpose of obtaining evidence</i> with a
medical examination for the purpose of diagnosis" (emphasis added, at
pp.580/1).  
<P>

I do not read the judgements in <b>Fernando</b> as lending any support to the
plaintiff's contention.
<P>

12   	The defendant referred me to the more recent decision of
the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>R v Dyson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1997/6581.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] SASC 6053</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2092%20A%20Crim%20R%20233" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 92 A
Crim R 233.</a> In that case the appellant sought to argue, in the light of
<b>Fernando</b>, that <b>Franklin</b> had been wrongly decided. In view of the
fact that there were conflicting decisions in South Australia and News South
Wales a bench
of five judges was convened to hear <b>Dyson</b>. In the result,
the South Australian court held that <b>Franklin</b> had been rightly decided
and that the authorisation of the "examination" extended to the taking of
samples of blood from the body
of a person held in lawful custody.  Thus there
exists a division of opinion on a provision said to be in substantially similar
terms
as between the South Australian court and this court.  Naturally I am
bound by the decision of this court. 
<P>

13   	There are passages in the judgments in <b>Dyson</b> which
bear on the issue raised by the plaintiff in the present proceedings (and which
were not addressed, in terms, in <b>Fernando</b>).  Doyle CJ observed of the
South Australian provision:
<P>

"The context in which the word is used is that of a provision for the obtaining
of evidence of the commission of an offence.  The
provision enables the
examination of a person to that end ...  A legally qualified medical
practitioner is the obvious person to
perform such an examination.  The skills
of such a person and the intrusion upon privacy which is involved makes such a
choice appropriate.
 But it remains an examination with a view to the obtaining
of evidence." (at p.238)
<P>

14   	Mr Craddock submitted that Priestley JA, in the passage
quoted in paragraph 11 above, was not to be taken to be asserting
that the
examination conducted for the purpose of obtaining evidence was other than a
<i>medical </i>examination. As to the passages in <b>Dyson</b> bearing on this
issue, he submitted that they provide no assistance in resolving the proper
construction of s 353A(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> since s 81 of the <b>Police
Offences Act</b> (SA) is in relevantly different terms. I note both the New
South Wales Court and the South Australian Court have approached the two
sections upon the basis that they are in similar terms. Priestley JA in
<b>Fernando</b> referred to them as being "in substantially identical words"
(at p. 575). 
<P>

15   	Mr Craddock draws attention to the circumstance that the
New South Wales provision includes the qualifying words "any crime
or offence
<i>which is of such a nature and is alleged to have been committed under such
circumstances</i> that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an
examination of his or her person will afford evidence as to the commission
of
the crime or offence".  The examination permitted by the section is to be
undertaken because the crime is of such a nature and
committed under such
circumstances that an examination may afford evidence as to the crime.  The
examination is to be carried out
by a medical practitioner. Thus, it is
contended, the subsection is concerned with cases where the nature of the
offence and the
circumstances of its commission are such that a medical
examination might afford evidence.
<P>

16   	In the course of submissions Mr Craddock conceded that the
words "offence which is of such a nature" must, depending on the
circumstances,
extend to any offence.  So in respect of the investigation of any category of
offence where it is said the offender
sustained a gunshot wound the subsection
would permit an examination by a medical practitioner. 
<P>

17   	I do not consider the presence of the words "offence which
is of such a nature and is alleged to have been committed under
such
circumstances" relevantly distinguish s 353A(2) from its South Australian
equivalent. I consider the observations of Doyle CJ,
set out in paragraph 12
above, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the decision of the
Court in <b>Fernando </b>may be of assistance in resolving the issues raised by
the plaintiff in these proceedings. I respectfully adopt his Honour's
observations
that the reason for requiring the examination be carried out by a
medical practitioner might be thought to derive from considerations
of privacy
but that the examination remains one which may afford evidence of the
commission of the offence.    
<P>

18   	Mr Craddock sought to call in aid of his construction of s
353A(2) the terms of the section's heading which reads; "Power
to search, make
medical examination, take photograph, fingerprints etc".  It was accepted that
the heading does not form part of
the Act.  However, relying on s 34 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</a></b> 1987, Mr Craddock submitted that I may have regard to
the words "medical examination" as they appear in the heading to resolve any
ambiguity raised by the terms of the subsection.  To my mind there is no
ambiguity in s 353A(2).  I consider the terms of the subsection
make plain that
the examination of the person to be carried out by a legally qualified medical
practitioner is an examination to
ascertain facts which may afford evidence as
to the commission of the crime with which the person is charged.  I see no
warrant for
qualifying the examination authorised as a "medical examination".

<P>

19   	The subsection authorises an infringement of fundamental
rights (the privilege against self incrimination and the right not
to be
assaulted) and must be read restrictively.  Giving full weight to that
principle of construction does not justify reading into
the provision a
qualification that does not appear.  
<P>

20   	The examination which the defendant seeks to carry out is
to be conducted by Dr Sue Jennings, Police Forensic Medical Officer.
 It is
proposed that she might place water soluble ink dots on various anatomical
landmarks on the plaintiff's body in the course
of that examination.  I
consider this aspect of the proposed examination goes beyond the examination by
eye and touch contemplated
by the majority in <b>Fernando</b>. 
<P>

21   	The terms of the subsection do not in my view clearly
express either directly or by necessary implication an unambiguous and
unmistakable intention to authorise the marking of the person's body in any
fashion during the examination; see <b>Fernando</b> and the references therein
to <b>Coco v the Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 427.</a> I do not consider that the
examination authorised by s 353A(2) extends to the placing of water soluble ink
dots on the person of
the plaintiff.  
<P>

22   	For these reasons I decline to grant the relief the
plaintiff claims by his Summons.  I propose to declare that the examination
authorised by s 353A(2) does not extend to the placing of water soluble ink
dots on the body of the plaintiff.  I do not see the
necessity for making an
order prohibiting the defendant from conducting an examination of the plaintiff
by way of placing marks on
his body.  In the way the matter was developed
before me I apprehend that, in the light of the view I take, the defendant will
arrange
for an examination which does not involve the use of the ink dot
procedure.  If there is any difficulty in this respect I would entertain
a
further application by the plaintiff.  
<P>

23   	The plaintiff has had some success by his proceedings.  In
the circumstances I consider it is appropriate that I make no order
as to
costs.  
<P>

24   	I declare that the examination authorised by s 353A(2) of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> 1900 (NSW) does not extend to the placing of water
soluble ink, or other markings, on the body of the plaintiff.
