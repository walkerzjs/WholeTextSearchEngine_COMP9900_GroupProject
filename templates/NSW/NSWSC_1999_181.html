<b>JUDGMENT (On application by the plaintiff to read as evidence, part of the
affidavit of Lola Ann Scott)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  I am presently dealing with a motion on behalf of the plaintiff
to preclude the defendant from having access to,
essentially, three bodies of
material:  material produced by the plaintiff; material produced by the police;
and what I will call
the 29 January 1999 material.
<P>

2	Evidence, both on affidavit and orally, has been given in support of the
motion and a question has arisen as to the admissibility
of certain parts of an
affidavit sworn by Lola Ann Scott on 3 March 1999.
<P>

3	The deponent to that affidavit is the Assistant Deputy Commissioner of
Police.  The affidavit was filed on 3 March 1999 in court,
leave having been
granted to Mr Singleton, of the State Crown Solicitor's Office who is
representing the Commissioner of Police.
 The Commissioner had been served with
a subpoena issued on 26 February 1999 at the request of the defendant.  The
Commissioner is
asserting that material the subject of that subpoena relating
to the interview of 29 January 1999, that is material in the possession
of the
police, should not be produced as it is protected by public interest immunity.
The affidavit of Ms Scott was filed in the
proceedings to determine that
issue.
<P>

4	To revert to the substantive motion by the plaintiff to preclude inspection
by the defendant, it is to be noted, as was made clear
this morning, that in
relation to the 29 January 1999 interview, privilege is claimed in respect of
the three exhibits attached to
the affidavit of Mr Lee sworn 2 March 1999 and
filed for the plaintiff; those exhibits being tapes, transcript and notes made
by
Mr Lee in relation to the events of 29 January 1999.
<P>

5	No claim for privilege is made on behalf of the plaintiff in respect to the
police material of the events of that date, which
material is subject of the
discrete application for public interest immunity.  The plaintiff, however,
contends that in addition
to what I will describe as Mr Lee's material being
protected by privilege, it is protected by the application of a doctrine in the
nature of public interest immunity and would be capable of being excluded under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 130(4)(c)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.
<P>

6	Whilst Ms Scott's affidavit has been filed in the particular action, that is
as part of the Court's file, I do not find it to
have been filed by the
defendant in response to the plaintiff's motion to preclude inspection.  Nor,
on any reasonable basis, can
it be said that it was filed by the Commissioner
in connection with the plaintiff's motion.
<P>

7	Reliance is placed by the plaintiff on some statements in the judgment of
Brinsden J in<b> <i>The Barristers Board of Western Australia v Tranter
Corporation Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20WAR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) WAR 65</a> at 67 where his Honour says:
<P>

	"<i>Evidence may be lead by either party by affidavit in support of its
respective case.  If evidence is so led by affidavit then the
deponents must
submit themselves to cross-examination by reason of an order having been made
under O 36 r 2(3).  Evidence is lead
by affidavit, not be merely filing the
affidavit, but by reading it to the Court.  An affidavit which has been placed
on the file
does not become part of the proceedings until it is opened to the
Court (see Manson v Ponninghaus <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1911/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1911] VicLawRp 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%20VLR%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] VLR 239).</a>  A party is entitled to read
to the Court an affidavit filed on behalf of another party (see Re Margetson
&amp; Jones  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%202%20Ch%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] 2 Ch 314)".</a></i>
<P>

8	The affidavit of Ms Scott does not strike me as being an affidavit filed on
behalf of another party, either to the action or to
the plaintiff's motion.  It
is filed in respect of the independent and discrete proceedings relating to the
claim for public interest
immunity by the Commissioner for Police, in respect
of which it can be said that there are really ex facie two parties, the
subpoenaing
party, the defendant, and the recipient of the subpoena, the
Commissioner of Police.
<P>

9	Insofar as SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 36</a> r 7 makes provision for a party, with the leave of the
Court, but saving all just exceptions, being able to read evidence or an
affidavit
filed in other proceedings, there might be some initial attraction in
saying that Ms Scott's affidavit is an affidavit filed in "<i>other"</i>
proceedings, namely that as between the Commissioner for Police and the
defendant, as part of the action brought by Mr Marsden against
Channel 7.  But
in that respect I am not persuaded that the foundation for relevance, leaving
aside any other matter, has been laid
in that that to which the deponent is
deposing is a consequence of her having turned her mind to the material in Mr
Lee's possession
in relation to 29 January, as distinct from turning her mind
to material in the Commissioner for Police's possession in relation
to 29
January.  One must not lose sight of Mr Lee's material being the subject of the
plaintiff's application.
<P>

10	Thus for two reasons I am disposed to exclude the material.  The first is
the party point, as it has been described.  Second,
no basis has been laid
under SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 36</a> r 7.
<P>

11	A third point is this:  that notwithstanding the characterisation by counsel
for the plaintiff of the second leg of the plaintiff's
motion as being in the
nature of a public interest immunity claim, I do not see how that
characterisation can relieve the plaintiff
of the obligation, if the affidavit
was otherwise admissible, of having the deponent available for
cross-examination.  Any rules
restricting cross-examination of deponents in
public interest immunity claims, in my view, should carefully be confined to
claims
for public interest immunity made by such persons as the Commissioner
for Police in response to a subpoena served upon that person.
<P>

12	I decline to permit there to be read as evidence, any of the affidavit of
Lola Ann Scott sworn 3 March 1999.
