<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>KIRBY J</b>
<P>

<b>Thursday 15 July 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>70002/97  -  REGINA  v  MICHAEL PATSALIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70200/97  -  REGINA  v  ALEXIOS SPATHIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (Re Police Academy)  [No 2]</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:   </b>The Crown has foreshadowed that it will rely
upon the participation by the accused, Mr Patsalis, in the recruitment
programme of the
Police Academy.  It intends to call Sgt Gorman, an officer
responsible for the records of the Academy.
<P>

2  	The records reveal that, between 28 January 1990 and 14 March
1990, Mr Patsalis was enrolled as a student at the Academy at
Goulburn.  He
left the Academy, however, before the completion of Phase 1 of the course.
<P>

3  	Mr Patsalis re-enrolled at the Academy on 28 April 1991.  He
completed an eight week residential course (Phase 1), and a four
week field
work course (Phase 2).  He then began a further residential course (Phase 3).
The course was scheduled to last fourteen
weeks.  Upon completion, students
were to be sworn in as probationary constables.  However, less than two weeks
before the completion
date, Mr Patsalis left the Academy.
<P>

4  	Sgt Gorman, by reference to the records, is able to describe the
instruction given to Mr Patsalis during his time at the Academy.
 The courses
included Police Practice, Patrol and Investigation.
<P>

5  	The Crown suggests that, having had such training, Mr Patsalis
would have been aware of the steps that could be taken to conceal
the crime.
Gloves were purchased before the murder.  The Crown invites the inference that
this was done to avoid fingerprints.  The
vehicle in which Mr Ludwig was
stabbed was destroyed by fire.  The knife which had been used to stab Mr Ludwig
was left within the
cabin of the truck, as were petrol tins used to set the
vehicle alight.  These items were destroyed or damaged, again eradicating
fingerprints.
<P>

6  	Objection is taken on behalf of Mr Patsalis.  It is suggested the
evidence is irrelevant.  It is also prejudicial.  Indeed,
it is a matter of
some sensitivity.  Mr Patsalis, part way through his course, was charged with a
criminal offence.  The matter was
brought before the Local Court.  The charge
was dismissed.  Mr Patsalis was then allowed to resume the course.  However,
before completing
Phase 3, he was again subject to further allegations.  A
female police cadet apparently made the allegations.  Mr Patsalis was then
dismissed from the Academy, without charges having been laid.
<P>

7  	I believe the relevance of the evidence is slight.  Any adult,
and certainly one who has watched television, would know that,
from the
viewpoint of someone who had engaged in crime, gloves were desirable to avoid
fingerprints, as was the destruction of evidence.
 Tuition at the Police
Academy would hardly be necessary to impart that knowledge.
<P>

8  	I believe there is some danger of unfair prejudice to Mr
Patsalis, were the evidence led.  The jury may wonder why he left the
Academy
when he had almost completed his course.
<P>

9  	I therefore believe that the probative value of the evidence is
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s137</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, I
refuse the application by the Crown to adduce such evidence.
