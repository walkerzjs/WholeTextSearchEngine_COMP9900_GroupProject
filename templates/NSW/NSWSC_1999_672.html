<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

TUESDAY 6 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>12765/1989</u>	<u>ROZENE PTY LIMITED v RAINE &amp; HORNE </u>
<P>

<u>COMMERCIAL PTY LIMITED</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The defendant has filed a Notice of Motion seeking an order that
these proceedings be dismissed for want of prosecution.  The
opposed
application was heard on 15 June 1999.
<P>

2  	In support of the application, the defendant has read a number of
affidavits (the deponents are Messrs Joyce, Wilkinson, McCarney
and Sharpe).
Mr Joyce was cross-examined.  The plaintiff relies on an affidavit sworn by Mr
Andrews (the Managing Director of the
plaintiff).  Further, there has been a
tender of documentation.
<P>

3  	At the relevant time, the defendant carried on the business of a
Real Estate Agent.  It acted as agent for the plaintiff in
respect of a sale of
certain real estate (the property).  The defendant introduced a purchaser and
in May 1988 contracts were exchanged
for the sale of the property for a price
in the order of 8.25 million dollars.  This contract was completed in November
1988 simultaneously
with a further contract for sale.  This contract was for
the sale by the purchaser for a price in the order of 12.5 million dollars.
<P>

4  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed in the
Commercial Division on 22 June 1989.  The Summons claimed inter alia
damages
for breach of agreement.  It is alleged that the agreement was made between Mr
Andrews (on behalf of the plaintiff) and Mr
Walters (on behalf of the
defendant).  It is alleged inter alia that there was a breach of duty to obtain
the best price.
<P>

5  	At the time of the commencement of the proceedings, Diamond
Peisah &amp; Co were the solicitors acting for the plaintiff.  Largely,
the
conduct of the proceedings was in the hands of Mr Michael Diamond and employed
solicitors.
<P>

6  	The defendant filed a Notice of Appearance in July 1989.  On 21
July 1989, the proceedings were transferred to the Common Law
Division.
Thereafter, no steps were taken in the proceedings for many years.
<P>

7  	There are no pleadings.  There has not been a request for
particulars.  The matter has not been set down for trial.  It has
not been
listed for directions.
<P>

8  	It appears probable that the plaintiff's sale file has been lost.
This may have occurred in about 1990.  It may have been given
to Mr Marriott
(the Managing Director of the defendant) for the purpose of the bringing of
proceedings to recover a claim for commission.
<P>

9  	It appears that in April 1992, a meeting took place between
Messrs Marriott and Andrews to explore settlement of the proceedings.
 This
meeting did not lead to their resolution.  There was no contact between the
plaintiff or its solicitors and Phillips Fox (the
solicitors for the defendant)
during the period 21 July 1989 to September 1993.  In or about September  1993
Phillips Fox closed
and archived its file.
<P>

10  	Thereafter, until August 1996, there was no contact between
plaintiff and defendant.  On or about 21 August 1996, the plaintiff
filed and
served a Notice of Change of Solicitor.  Musgrave Peach then became the
solicitors for the plaintiff.  Thereafter, communication
took place between
Phillips Fox and Musgrave Peach.  The plaintiff issued a number of subpoenas.
On 16 April 1997, the plaintiff
filed a Notice of Motion seeking the granting
of access in respect of material produced in response to the subpoenas.  The
Notice
of Motion has not been brought to hearing.
<P>

11  	On 28 April 1997, the defendant filed the Notice of Motion which
brings the present application before the Court.  It came
before the Court on 5
May 1997 and 8 May 1997 and was then stood over generally.  It did not come
back before the Court until 9 March
1999.  A hearing date was given on 20 April
1999.
<P>

12  	The defendant seeks relief under either Pt. 5 r 12 or Pt. 33 r 6
of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</u> 1970</a> (it does not look to the inherent
jurisdiction of the Court).  The latter rule has no application in the present
case.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Part 33</a> is expressed to apply to proceedings commenced by Statement of
Claim.  In this case, the originating process was a Summons and there
are no
pleadings.
<P>

13  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> r 12 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"(1)	Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or direction
as to the conduct of the proceedings, or does not
prosecute the proceedings
with due despatch, the Court may, on application by any party or of its own
motion, stay or dismiss the
proceedings.
<P>

(2)	The Court may not make an order under subrule (1) without giving the
plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to be heard.
<P>

(3)	The Court may, on application by any party, set aside an order that is made
on the Court's own motion under subrule (1)."
<P>

14  	This rule confers a discretionary power upon the Court to stay
or dismiss proceedings when any of the relevant threshold requirements
have
been satisfied.  In the present case, the relevant threshold requirement is
that of failure to prosecute the proceedings with
due despatch.
<P>

15  	It is not (and could not be) in dispute that the threshold
requirement has been satisfied.  The question at issue is whether
or not the
discretionary power should be exercised in favour of the defendant.
<P>

16  	The parties have referred the Court to a number of decided cases
(including <u>Australian Guarantee Corporation v Reid</u> (Supreme Court of
Victoria - Court of Appeal - 19 March 1996), <u>Tricon Industries Pty Ltd v
Abel Lemon and Company Pty Ltd (No 2)</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QCA/1997/376.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] QCA 376</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%202%20QdR%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 2 Qd.R  551</a>, <u>Cooper v
Hopgood and Anor</u> (Supreme Court of Queensland - Court of Appeal - 2 June
1998), <u>Stollznow v Calvert</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 749</a> and <u>Hartigan v
International Society for Krishna Consciousness Incorporated</u> (Bryson J, 15
February 1999)).
<P>

17  	The discretionary power is exercised having regard to the
relevant circumstances of the particular case before the Court and
so that
justice is best served between the parties.  Whilst other decided cases provide
guidance, each case can be expected to turn
on its own particular facts.  The
onus of demonstrating an entitlement to relief rests on the applicant.
<P>

18  	As is usually the case, the discretionary considerations of
inter alia delay, explanation for the delay and prejudice are material.
<P>

19  	The relevant events happened about 11 years ago.  However, the
proceedings were commenced with reasonable promptitude.  The
defendant did have
the opportunity to prepare its case whilst the events were relatively fresh.
<P>

20  	There has been protracted inactivity by both parties.  Largely,
the matter has not progressed during a period of about 10 years.
 This
situation seems extraordinary when regard is had to the magnitude of the claim.
The plaintiff seeks to recover damages and
interest.  The damages component is
said to be in excess of 4 million dollars.  An interest calculation puts that
component in excess
of 6 million dollars.  The quantum of the claim is now well
in excess of the limit of the defendant's relevant professional indemnity
insurance policy.
<P>

21  	The material advanced to explain the plaintiff's delay is to be
found in the affidavit sworn by Mr Andrews.  Mr Andrews principally
blames his
former solicitors Diamond Peisah &amp; Co.  Clearly, they did very little
whilst the matter was in their hands, whilst
leading him to believe that it was
proceeding normally.  By August 1995, he had begun to have doubts about the
diligence of their
prosecution of the proceedings.  Ultimately, in April 1996,
he gave instructions for the transfer of his file to the present solicitors.
Some activity then ensued during 1996.
<P>

22  	For completeness, I should mention that during the many years
they had the conduct of the proceedings, one of the partners
(Jack Diamond) of
Diamond Peisah was struck off the Roll of Solicitors.  This event however does
not appear to be related to the
delay in this case.
<P>

23  	In my view, the matters advanced by the plaintiff fall short of
sufficiently explaining the delay both prior to August 1996
and thereafter.
There has been lack of diligence on the part of the plaintiff itself (inter
alia it should have acted much earlier
in relation to its problems with Diamond
Peisah and despite a change of solicitors a lack of diligence persists).  It
must bear part
of the blame for the delay.
<P>

24  	It can be expected that oral evidence will be of significance in
determining the issues.  It is reasonable to expect that memories
will have
faded over the years.  The delay can be expected to make the determination of
factual issues more difficult.
<P>

25  	The loss of the relevant sales file means firstly that the case
may have to be determined without the advantage of having relevant
documentation before the Court.  Secondly, there is a loss of a source for
refreshing recollection.  For completeness, I should record
that it is not said
that the delay bears any responsibility for this loss.
<P>

26  	It seems that the defendant has taken some advantage of the
opportunity had to prepare its case.  Whilst there are no signed
statements
from witnesses, there is material which records what has been said in
conference with potential witnesses.
<P>

27  	Prior to 1997, the defendant adopted the stance of letting
sleeping dogs lie.  It made no attempt to activate the matter or
 complain
about delay and warn of prejudice.  It took the course of closing its files in
the hope that the matter would not be activated
thereafter.  It had "lain
silent" and now claims prejudice by reason of the delay (see Calvert at 754
).
<P>

28  	Although the present application was brought more than 2 years
ago, steps were not taken to bring it on for hearing until this
year.  It
remains unclear as to why it has taken the parties so long to bring it on for
hearing.
<P>

29  	During  that time, nothing appears to have been done by the
plaintiff to advance the matter.  There had been the minor flurry
of activity
which took place before the application was brought.  Even that activity, has
not been pursued to date.  As to the future,
the Court is left with the
unchallenged statement made by Mr Andrews in paragraph 48 of his affidavit ("I
have been and I remain
anxious to prosecute these proceedings").
<P>

30  	The relevant circumstances of this case place the Court in
somewhat of a dilemma.  The discretionary exercise is not an easy
one.
Ultimately, after considerable deliberation, I have come to the view that I am
not satisfied that justice would be best served
by dismissing the proceedings
at this stage.  However, I should make it clear that, if the plaintiff does not
take advantage of what
may be seen as a final opportunity to expeditiously
pursue this litigation, it can expect that the proceedings may well be the
subject
of a dismissal order in the future.  The continuing unsatisfactory
situation cannot be allowed to persist.
<P>

31  	I dismiss the Notice of Motion.  The proceedings are to be
listed before the Acting Prothonotary on 12 July 1999 for directions.
 The
question of costs is not an easy one.  In the circumstances of this case, it
seems to me to be appropriate to order that each
party pay its own costs and I
so order.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
