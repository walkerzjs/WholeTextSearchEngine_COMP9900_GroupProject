WEDNESDAY 28 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>11032/1992</u>	<u>SECURITY PACIFIC GOLD LIMITED v LEON RODNEY BALDERSTON
&amp; ORS</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The proceedings were commenced in 1992.  The claim now propounded
by the plaintiff is pleaded in the Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim
filed on 21 April 1998.  It is a claim for judgment in a monetary sum.
<P>

2  	The hearing commenced on 28 June 1999.  The contest is between
the plaintiff and the first defendant.  The second and third
defendants did not
appear at the hearing.
<P>

3  	The parties have relied on affidavit evidence.  Messrs Selles,
Whitley, Morrison, Collins and Procajlo have each sworn an affidavit
for the
plaintiff.  The first defendant relies on his own affidavit.  Save for Mr
Whitley, each deponent has been cross-examined.
 There has been a tender of
documentation.
<P>

4  	At all material times, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority was
the owner of premises known as the Clock Tower Building.  A head
lease was
granted to CBD Investments Pty Limited (CBD).  There was a sub-lease of part of
the premises to the plaintiff.  On 1 February
1991, there was a sub-lease of
part of the premises from the plaintiff to Aust In Capital Corporation Limited
(Aust In) for a term
of more than 3 years.  The sub-lease (although in
registrable form) was not registered (there were delays and Mr Procajlo did not
lodge it for registration because by that time Aust In had ceased its
occupation).  A copy is an annexure to the affidavit sworn
by Mr Whitley.  It
contains a definition of "The Lease" (it means "The Lease of the demised
premises").  It was common ground that
the sub-lease was not now capable of
being made the subject of an order for specific performance.
<P>

5  	The date for commencement of the sub-lease was expressed to be 1
February 1991.  Aust In was not permitted to move into occupation
until a bank
guarantee had been provided.  The bank guarantee was a requirement of the
sub-lease (clause 12.01).  Aust In was desirous
of entering into possession and
had not been able at that stage to arrange a bank guarantee.  As an interim
measure, until the bank
guarantee was arranged, Aust In was allowed into
possession after a personal guarantee had been provided by its directors.  It
was
provided in the form of a Deed of Guarantee made on 5 March 1991 (the
Deed).  The Deed was executed by the directors for Aust In
(who are the
defendants in these proceedings).
<P>

6  	Although the first year of the sub-lease was rent free, Aust In
was obliged to pay outgoings.  Certain outgoings became outstanding.
 Aust In
was required to both pay these outgoings and provide the bank guarantee.
Whilst the outgoings were subsequently paid, the
bank guarantee was never
provided.
<P>

7  	In early October 1991, the plaintiff came to the view that the
sub-leased premises had been abandoned.  On 11 October 1991,
the plaintiff
re-entered the premises.  Thereafter, the plaintiff took steps to re-let the
premises.  On 30 March 1992, Aust In went
into liquidation.  On 21 August 1994,
a new sub-lessee moved into occupation of the premises.  On 5 December 1997,
there was a voluntary
liquidation of the plaintiff.
<P>

8  	On 29 June 1999, after oral evidence from Mr Selles had been
taken, the plaintiff made application to further amend its originating
process.
The Second Further Amended Statement of Claim pleads that on or about 10
October 1991, in breach of its obligations under
the sub-lease Aust in
abandoned the premises and thereby repudiated the sub-lease.  The purport of
the proposed amendment was to
expand the allegations of breach by adding the
allegations of failure to provide the bank guarantee and failure to pay certain
outgoings.
<P>

9  	The application to amend was opposed by the first defendant.
Counsel for the first defendant informed the Court that he needed
further time
to consider the potential implications of any such amendment.  That there was a
need for such opportunity was not in
dispute.  It was common ground that if
leave to amend was given it may be necessary to grant an adjournment of the
proceedings.
<P>

10  	A consensus then emerged between the parties as to the further
conduct of the proceedings.  Whilst the application remained
on foot, further
consideration of it was deferred.  The course was then taken to complete the
evidence and to then as a separate
question hear submissions on a Defence
raised by the defendant (it is raised in paragraphs 3 and 5 of the Second
Amended Defence).
 This was a Defence founded on the judgment of the majority
in the High Court decision of <u>Chan &amp; Anor v Cresdon Pty Limited</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 242.</a>  It was common ground that if the first defendant was
successful on the Defence, the plaintiff's case must fail.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff's case is founded on the Deed of Guarantee.  A
copy of the Deed is Annexure C to the Affidavit sworn by Whitley.
 Relevant
provisions are inter alia the first recital and clause 1.  The first recital is
in the following terms:-
<P>

"The Lessor has sub-let to Aust. in Capital Corporation Limited (hereinafter
called `the Lessee') certain premises known as part
of Level 4, 55 Harrington
Street, Sydney pursuant to a sub-lease dated the     day of      1991
(hereinafter called `the Lease')."
<P>

Clause 1 is in the following terms;-
<P>

"In consideration of the premises the Guarantor as evidenced by his execution
hereof guarantees the due performance by the Lessee
of all the terms and
conditions of the Lease and covenants that he will upon demand pay to the
Lessor all moneys which may become
due to the Lessor thereunder and remain
unpaid for a period of seven (7) days and will be responsible for the due
compliance by the
Lessee with all the terms and conditions thereof in the same
manner and to the same extent as if they were a party thereto and covenanted
as
Lessee without the necessity of the Lessor giving any prior notice to them or
requiring the payment of such moneys or to remedy
any default by the
Lessee".
<P>

12  	The first defendant says that <u>Chan</u> has application in
this case.  The plaintiff propounds a view to the contrary.  The dispute throws
up a question of construction
of clause 1.
<P>

13  	The relevant issue is whether or not the plaintiff's monetary
claim can be said to be referable to moneys which may become
due under "the
lease" [and "thereunder"] in the sense that the terminology is used in clause
1.  The plaintiff's monetary claim was
made in respect of money said to have
become due under the sub-lease.  In <u>Chan</u>, it was held that the
guaranteed obligations  were referable to a lease at law (which in that case
meant a registered lease) only.
 In that case, the majority were of the view
that it was obvious that the parties had intended that the lease be registered
and that
in the circumstances of that case there was an obligation to register
or procure registration (pp. 247-248).  It was said that the
phrase "this
lease" meant "the instrument of lease in its character as a lease".  In this
case also, a lease at law has to be a registered
lease.  The High Court
rejected the contention that the <u>Chan</u> guarantee attracted liability to
pay rent under either an equitable lease or a common law tenancy.
<P>

14  	The plaintiff accepts that <u>Chan</u> is binding authority.  It
seeks to distinguish the decision in the light of the particular facts of this
case.  The decision had
been distinguished by the Court of Appeal in <u>Telado
Pty Limited v Vincent</u> (19 July 1996).  In that case, there were provisions
in the guarantee of a nature which are not present in this case.  The decision
turned on the construction given to those provisions.  The view was taken that
it was the intention of the draftsman to impose on
the parties obligations to
which they would, or might, not have been subjected in the event that the lease
was not registered.  It
was said that the provisions made it clear that the
subject lease was not necessarily intended to operate as a lease at law.
<P>

15  	Counsel for the plaintiff has reduced his submissions to
writing.  The writing was amplified by oral argument.  It is convenient
to
identify these submissions by reference to the writing.
<P>

16  	There were submissions which sought to distinguish the present
case from that before the Court in <u>Chan</u>.  The submissions were as
follows:-
<P>

"The guarantee in this case was in the form of a different document and not
part of the lease as in Chan v Cresdon.  The wording
is different and is more
extensive.
<P>

.........
<P>

The clauses are to be construed differently.  The clause in this case is wider
and extends liability to the guarantors, `in the
same manner and to the same
extent as if they were a party thereto.'
<P>

The recitals indicate the purpose for which the guarantee was prepared, that is
to suit the particular difficulties faced by Aust
In in being unable to produce
the bank guarantee as a precondition to being allowed occupation.
<P>

Clause 2 contemplates the continuing nature of the guarantee and that the
obligations under 1 are absolute, unconditional, irrevocable
and remain in
force until the provision of the bank guarantee.
<P>

Clause 4 clearly indicates that the guarantee is to be in addition to any other
rights that the plaintiff may have against Aust
In."
<P>

17  	I have had regard to these submissions.  In my view, they do not
throw up any matter which can lead to the present case being
distinguished from
the guarantee construed in <u>Chan</u>.  For completeness, I shall add some
further observations.
<P>

18  	Clause 1 is a longer covenant.  There are some differences in
terminology between it and the <u>Chan</u> guarantee (inter alia "the lease"
and "this lease" on the one hand and "thereunder" and "under this lease" on the
other hand).  The
Deed was a separate document which had been executed
subsequent to the sub-lease.  These matters go towards explaining some of the
differences in terminology.
<P>

19  	Despite the differences, it seems to me that the Deed was
largely similar in effect to the <u>Chan</u> guarantee.  In any event, I am not
satisfied that any of the matters raised by these submissions are of
significance in determining
the question of whether or not the terms "the
lease" or "thereunder" should not be regarded as referable to a lease at
law.
<P>

20  	An alternative argument was also put.  It relied on what was
said by Mason J as he then was in <u>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail
Authority of NSW</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a> AT 352.
<P>

21  	The submission was in the following terms:-
<P>

"Alternatively, the guarantee is ambiguous and it is not clear on its face as
to whether or not it is intended to apply only if
the lease is registered".
<P>

"The surrounding circumstances are that Aust In was anxious to gain occupation,
it could not get the bank guarantee as required
by the lease, its solicitors
suggested the directors' guarantee method, the same solicitors prepared the
guarantee and arranged for
its signature, submitted the guarantee for approval
and the presence or absence of registration of the lease was not a matter which
was in the contemplation because the urgency was to secure occupation.
<P>

The fact also is that the sublease was conditional on the completion and
registration of the CBD lease and the giving of consent
by CBD to the lease.
(see annexure `A' to the Whitley affidavit p. 3 and the letter from Greaves
Wannan &amp; Williams of 24 January
1991, Procaljo pp 6 &amp; 7) (sic)  This
was a fact clearly known to Aust In and its solicitors who presumably informed
each of the
guarantors.
<P>

The parties certainly had in contemplation that the lease ultmately (sic) be
registered, but that was not a condition precedent
to the effectiveness of the
guarantee.  The parties contemplated that there would be a period where the
plaintiff needed to be protected
and protected both until the bank guarantee
was provided and it is submitted until the lease was registered.
<P>

Chan v Cresdon should be confined to the case where the plaintiff sought to
call upon the bank guarantee as contemplated by the
lease as it would have been
entitled to do in the event that it had been provided in accordance with Aust
In's obligations under
the lease.
<P>

It could have not been the intention of the parties to have the guarantee
conditional upon the registration of the lease which could
never have taken
place prior to occupation in any event."
<P>

22  	<u>Codelfa</u> is authority for the proposition  that evidence
of surrounding circumstances is admissible to assist in the interpretation of a
contract
if the language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one meaning.
In my view, if there be ambiguity in this case, I am not satisfied
that the
said surrounding circumstances lead to the result contended for by the
plaintiff.
<P>

23  	It is common ground that it was contemplated by the parties that
the lease be registered.  Also, as in <u>Chan</u>, there was an obligation to
register or procure registration.  The plaintiff accepted that this was its
responsibility.  It is accepted
by the plaintiff that <u>Chan</u> would have
applied to any bank guarantee given pursuant to the sub-lease.  It could be
expected that the interim measure would have
been intended to stand in the same
position as the bank guarantee contemplated by the sub-lease.
<P>

24  	In <u>Chan</u> at p. 256, the majority applied the traditional
view that the liability of the surety is strictissimi juris and that ambiguous
contractual
provisions should be construed in favour of the surety.  It was
referred to as a settled principle governing the interpretation of
contracts of
guarantee.  As was said in that case, there is no justification for reading the
guarantee as extending to obligations
which do no arise under a lease at law.
In my view, a similar position applies in this case.
<P>

25  	The written submissions raise an argument founded on estoppel.
It became apparent during oral submissions that this argument
was beset with
problems.  It was thereupon abandoned.
<P>

26  	In my view, the Defence argued by way of separate question has
been made out by the first defendant.  Accordingly, the first
defendant has a
good Defence to the whole of the plaintiff's claim.
<P>

27  	In these circumstances, it should not be necessary to proceed
further with the hearing.  If that be the case, there should
be judgment for
the first defendant on the plaintiff's claim and the plaintiff should pay the
first defendant's costs of the claim.
 Exhibits may be returned.
<P>
