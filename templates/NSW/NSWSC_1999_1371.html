Respondent      Steven Naris and Co
ORDER
  Appeals dismissed
JUDGE1
GLEESON CJ, DOWD AND SPERLING JJ  The appellants, together with
George Savvas,
were tried before Grove J and a jury, on charges set out below, and convicted.
They have both appealed against their
conviction, and seek leave to appeal
against the sentences imposed. Their co-accused, Savvas, who was also
convicted, withdrew his
appeal.


2.  The charges concerned two separate conspiracies, one to import a
commercial quantity of heroin, and- one to import
a commercial quantity of
cocaine. The appellant Kapeliotis and Savvas were charged with the alleged
conspiracy to import heroin.
Both appellants, together with Savvas, were
charged with the conspiracy to import cocaine. The appellant Mari was not
alleged to
be a party to the conspiracy to import heroin. The jury convicted
the appellant Kapeliotis and Savvas of conspiring to import heroin,
and the
appellants Kapeliotis and Mari, together with Savvas, of conspiring to import
cocaine.


3.  The appellant Kapeliotis was
sentenced to two concurrent terms of
imprisonment involving a head sentence of twelve years and a non-parole period
of seven years.
The appellant Mari was sentenced to imprisonment for eight
years with a non-parole period of six years.


Background to the convictions
4.  According to the Crown case, a central figure in both conspiracies was
Savvas. Another central figure in the heroin conspiracy
was Mario Postiglione.


5.  At the time of the alleged conspiracies Savvas and Postiglione were
prisoners, and, for a time, cell
mates at Long Bay Prison. Savvas was serving
a lengthy term of imprisonment following a conviction relating to the
importation of
a large quantity of heroin. He had appealed to this court,
unsuccessfully, against that conviction, and the High Court refused an
application for special leave to appeal. It is not without interest that, as
appears from the judgment in relation to that appeal,
the heroin importation
was alleged to have been facilitated by the corruption of certain Customs
Officers.


6.  In due course Postiglione
entered a plea of guilty to a charge relating to
his part in the alleged heroin conspiracy, and he gave evidence for the Crown
at
the trial of the appellants and Savvas.


7.  The appellant Kapeliotis was an associate of Savvas and frequently visited
Savvas in
prison. The appellant Mari was an associate of Postiglione and he,
likewise, frequently visited Postiglione in prison.


8.  A curious
feature of the case was that the existence of the cocaine
conspiracy was discovered, virtually by accident, in the course of police
surveillance operations undertaken in relation to the heroin conspiracy.


9.  Another feature of the case, which was not given particular
importance in
any of the arguments advanced at the trial, but which was heavily relied upon
on the appeal, having regard to the recent
decision of the High Court in
Ridgeway v The Queen ((1995) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20ALJR%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 ALJR 484)</a>, was that there was a substantial
element of undercover police involvement in the heroin conspiracy. The
position was different in
relation to the cocaine conspiracy which, as was
noted, only came to the knowledge of the police in the course of their
operations
concerning the heroin conspiracy.


10.  It is convenient to begin by outlining in a general way the case relating
to the heroin
conspiracy.


11.  In late 1990 and early 1991, Savvas and Postiglione, whilst together in
prison, conceived a plan to arrange for
the importation to Australia from Asia
of a substantial quantity of heroin. The quantity that was ultimately
discussed was twenty
kilograms, although it is not clear precisely when that
amount was agreed upon. The person who was to make the arrangements to obtain
the heroin was another prisoner, named Lentze, with whom Postiglione was in
contact. At some stage (the time is not clear) Lentze
determined to inform the
Australian Federal Police of Postiglione's approaches to him. (Lentze was
called as a witness in the Crown
case.) The Australian Federal Police and the
Drug Enforcement Agency of the New South Wales Police then embarked upon a
joint operation.


12.  Lentze had represented to Postiglione that he had sources of supply in
Bangkok. Savvas and Postiglione agreed that Savvas
would use his contacts in
the Australian Customs to secure the undetected entry into Australia of heroin
supplied from Bangkok. It
was arranged that the deal would be set up through
meetings, outside the prison, between a contact nominated by Savvas,
representing
the Sydney importers, and a contact nominated by Lentze
representing the Bangkok supplier. Savvas nominated Kapeliotis as his contact.
Lentze nominated as his contact a person who was, in truth, an undercover
police officer.


13.  There followed a series of meetings
both outside and inside the prison.
The conversations at these meetings were recorded by listening devices. The
conversations between
Kapeliotis and the undercover police officer, who
represented himself as having access to a supply of twenty kilograms of heroin
in Bangkok, were recorded, as were conversations between Kapeliotis and Savvas
when Kapeliotis visited Savvas in prison. The tapes
of those conversations
were in evidence, and transcripts were before the jury. They recorded the
undercover police officer and Kapeliotis
discussing in detail the proposed
importation of twenty kilograms of what the Crown says were obviously illegal
drugs from Bangkok,
and they recorded Kapeliotis and Savvas discussing, again
at length and in detail, the same subject.


14.  The compelling nature
of the tapes can, perhaps, be understood by
reference to the nature of the defence cases of Savvas and Kapeliotis.
Kapeliotis, in
his unsworn statement, acknowledged that he was engaged, on
behalf of Savvas, in discussions relating to the illegal importation
of twenty
kilograms of something from overseas, but he maintained that what he was
discussing was the importation of twenty kilograms
of diamonds. It suffices to
say that the jury were entitled to find this explanation of the recorded
conversations to be entirely
unconvincing. Savvas, in his unsworn statement,
took the line that he had become aware at an early stage that conversations to
which
he was a party were being recorded, and he went along with the pretence
that he was engaged in a plan to import drugs for the purpose
of entrapping
and exposing certain corrupt police officers. Once again, the jury obviously
did not think much of that explanation.


15.  It was in the course of these secretly recorded conversations that it
became apparent that Savvas was the central figure in
the organising of a
proposed importation into Australia, from South America, of a large quantity
of cocaine. The evidence showed
that Savvas arranged for his girlfriend, Nancy
Dufek, to travel to South America in March 1991 to meet a supplier in Brazil
to negotiate
the purchase of a quantity of cocaine. He gave her written
instructions about the purchase, and the shipment. Dufek travelled to
South
America, but her trip was cut short when she realised she was being followed
by police. In the meantime Savvas engaged the
services of Postiglione to
endeavour to find someone to import the cocaine from South America and to
raise money for the venture.
As a result, Postiglione approached his
associate, the appellant Mari, and enlisted his assistance in travelling to
South America
and in raising finance.


16.  After Dufek returned from South America in March 1991 she and Kapeliotis
visited Savvas at Long Bay
Prison. The conversation at that meeting was
secretly recorded. Kapeliotis was instructed to meet Mari outside the prison.
At the
same time as Dufek and Kapeliotis were speaking to Savvas in the
prison, Mari was visiting, and speaking to, Postiglione. Kapeliotis
was
instructed to arrange for himself and Mari to travel to Brazil and to meet a
named cocaine supplier. Police observed Kapeliotis
and Mari meeting outside
the prison following the visit. On two later occasions in April 1991, when
Kapeliotis visited Savvas, he
informed Savvas that he had met Mari and that
they had planned their flights to South America. Kapeliotis was given
passwords and
information about the meeting with the supplier, and
instructions for the shipment of the cocaine.


17.  In the meantime, the appellant
Mari sought out an acquaintance named
Oastler (who was a witness in the case) to arrange finance for the project.
Oastler introduced
Mari to two women respectively named Bird and Lamont. He
arranged for the women to provide him with a substantial amount of money,
which was handed to him in a suitcase. Later, Mari and Postiglione met in the
visitor's section of Long Bay Prison. Mari applied
for a passport in April
1991 and booked his departure for 1 May. On 26 April 1991, at a meeting with
Postiglione in the prison, Mari
was given detailed instructions about the
consignment, the packaging of the container, the price to be paid for the
cocaine, flight
and consignment details, contacts and telephone numbers, and a
proposal about arranging a further quantity for subsequent importation.
At a
meeting with Postiglione on 30 April 1991 Mari was promised $100,000 when the
consignment was delivered.


18.  On the morning
of Mari's proposed departure Postiglione made an urgent
telephone call to Mari telling him to call off the trip because problems
had
arisen following the discovery by the authorities of the corruption of the
Customs Officers earlier mentioned.


19.  In the
events that occurred there never was any relevant importation of
cocaine or heroin. Whether, in relation to the cocaine, that was
because of
the discovery of the allegedly corrupt Customs Officers, or for some other
reason, was not entirely clear. So far as the
heroin was concerned, the person
who was represented to be a supplier, or a contact of a supplier, was an
undercover police officer
who is not shown to have 'intended to supply any
actual heroin.


20.  Having regard to the reliance sought to be placed, in this
appeal, in
relation to the heroin conspiracy, upon the decision of the High Court in
Ridgeway, it is important to note one thing
about the way the trial was
conducted. There was no attempt at the trial to rely upon what might be
described as entrapment, either
as a defence, or as a reason for seeking a
stay of proceedings, or as a discretionary basis for the exclusion of any
evidence. There
was an argument at the trial, based upon Bunning v Cross
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20141%20CLR%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 141 CLR 54</a>, but it related to some only of the tapes of the secretly
recorded conversations, and it had nothing to do with entrapment. Counsel
for
Mari submitted that the listening devices which had been installed in the
visitor's section of the Long Bay Prison had been installed
illegally by
reason of the failure of the police authorities to comply with the
requirements of certain legislation. On that basis,
it was argued, the
evidence of the conversations secretly recorded should have been excluded on
discretionary grounds. Grove J rejected
the premise on which that argument was
based, and ruled that there was no illegality involved in the installation of
the listening
devices. This is a matter which will require further
consideration in dealing with the appeal of Mari. What is to be noted,
however,
is that this was the only form of illegality raised at the trial. It
was not suggested at the trial that the conduct of the undercover
officer who
dealt with Kapeliotis involved any form of illegality relevant to the
admissibility of evidence. In the light of the
decision in Ridgeway, an
attempt has now been made to advance an argument based upon such illegality.
One of the practical consequences
of the way in which the trial was conducted,
however, is that there was no detailed examination of some of the matters that
might
have been relevant to a determination of the question whether, and to
what extent, there was such illegality, or to an investigation
of an issue of
entrapment. For example, the question of the extent to which the initiative in
relation to the heroin importation
was taken by Savvas and Postiglione, on the
one hand, or the prisoner Lentze, on the other hand, was evidently not
regarded at the
trial as something that required closer investigation. Nor
does it emerge with any clarity from the evidence exactly when, and in
what
circumstances, Lentze contacted the police.


21.  Entrapment was not an issue at the trial and, as was noted above, the
evidently
about the tape recorded conversations was so compelling, in its
revelation of a plan to import something illegal, that the battle
lines were
drawn by the attempts of the accused Savvas and Mari to provide an innocent
explanation of the arrangements they were
clearly intent upon making. Savvas
said that he was engaged in his own exercise of entrapment, and Kapeliotis
said that he thought
he was talking about arranging an importation of
diamonds. It was never submitted to the trial judge that the conduct of the
undercover
police officer who was representing himself to be a potential
supplier of heroin and who was meeting outside the prison with Kapeliotis
was
illegal or that, on that account, any particular evidence ought to have been
excluded.


22.  Even on this appeal, it has not
been argued that what was said to be
illegality in the conduct of the police affected the charge concerning the
proposed importation
of cocaine. The appeal of Kapeliotis against conviction


23.  The first ground of appeal complains that Grove J misdirected the
jury on
the onus of proof. Trial counsel for Kapeliotis made no such complaint and did
not request any redirection. Leave to raise
the point should be refused.
However the court heard argument on the matter and we will indicate why we
consider there is no merit
in the complaint.


24.  As was noted above, the evidence of the tapes, together with the other
evidence led by the Crown, made it
so obvious that there was a plan on foot
for the illegal importation of something that the defence cases were seriously
constrained.
Kapeliotis said the plan was to import diamonds. Savvas said he
was only pretending to be planning to import heroin. In the case
of the
cocaine importation Kapeliotis said he was taking money to South America, but
not for cocaine. Those lines of defence defined
the main issues for the jury
to resolve, and Grove J summed up accordingly. He did not omit to give the
jury the usual directions
as to the ingredients of the offences alleged, or as
to the Crown's onus of proof. However, at a very early stage of his summing
up
he went to the principal issues which, as the case was fought, required
resolution.


25.  The argument is that, in doing so,
and in particular in directing the
jury to consider what they made of the explanations given by the accused for
the taped conversations,
he gave the jury the impression that the accused
carried an onus. For example, he observed that, in essence, the jury had to
decide
whether they attached any credibility to the explanations given by the
accused. In the course of a lengthy summing up, there were,
from time to time,
remarks directed to whether the jury would accept, or reject, or regard as
possibly true, the explanations. It
is now said that the cumulative effect was
a reversal of the onus of proof and a miscarriage of justice.


26.  We are unable to
agree. The trial judge gave clear and accurate
directions on the onus of proof. The comments he made about the explanations
were
appropriate, and virtually inevitable, having regard to the way the trial
was fought. There was no reversal of the onus.


27.  The
second and third grounds relate to corroboration. Postiglione, Lentze
and Oastler were accomplices. Their evidence, it might be added,
was
powerfully corroborated, especially by the tapes. Furthermore, the ultimate
area of challenge to their evidence was fairly narrow.


28.  Grove J gave the usual directions on corroboration of accomplice
evidence, and, in addition, specified to the jury various
items of evidence
that were capable of being regarded as corroboration. However, in relation to
the lengthy tape recorded conversations,
he declined to go through the
transcripts in detail and refer to specific parts of them. This was
understandable and, in the circumstances
of the case, did not involve a
failure to give adequate directions.


29.  In relation to the heroin charge, there was nothing in
the tape
recordings that mentioned diamonds. The Crown asked the jury to infer (and the
inference was irresistible) from the whole
of the conversations that the
subject under discussion was the importation of illegal drugs.


30.  In relation to the cocaine charge,
the defence was that Kapeliotis was a
party to an arrangement that involved taking money to South America, but that
he was unaware
of any connection between that and a cocaine importation.


31.  There was no occasion for Grove J to seek to specify individual
portions
of the conversations as potential corroboration. The entire tapes were
corroborative of the accomplice witnesses.


32.
 Senior counsel in the appeal advanced an argument that was not put at the
trial. He submitted that, in a curious fashion, in the
circumstances of the
present case the standard directions on accomplice evidence and corroboration
would have left the jury with
the impression that they were being invited to
convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplices.


33.  Once again, having
regard to the factual issues that ultimately emerged
at the trial, and considering the summing up in the light of the way the trial
was fought, there is no substance in this complaint.


34.  These grounds of appeal must fall.


35.  Grounds 4, 5, 5A and 5B all
relate to a problem for the appellant which
arose by reason of the fact that the unsworn statements of the co-accused Mari
and Savvas,
which contained material supportive, or potentially supportive, of
the appellant's defence, were not available to be considered by
the jury as
evidence in the case between the Crown and the appellant. For example, Savvas
said in his unsworn statement that he had
assured Kapeliotis there was no
illegality involved in what he was asking him to do. He also said that he
concealed from Kapeliotis
his plan to expose corrupt police.


36.  Evidence was given in the appeal that neither Kapeliotis nor his legal
advisers had realised,
until the end of the evidence, that (as is now
conceded) what Savvas said in his unsworn statement was not evidence either
for or
against Kapeliotis. Grove J told the jury, without objection, that when
considering the Crown case against Kapeliotis they should
ignore what Savvas
said in his unsworn statement. It has not been argued that this direction was
wrong but, it is said, it came as
a surprise to Kapeliotis and his lawyers.


37.  Next, it is said that, if it had been realised that Kapeliotis was going
to be unable
to rely upon what Savvas and Mari said in their unsworn
statements, an application for a separate trial would have been made. Upon
the
(dubious) assumptions that the application would have succeeded, and that the
trials of Savvas and Mari would have been concluded
before the trial of
Kapeliotis commenced, then Kapeliotis would have called Savvas and Mari as
witnesses in his case. Mari has said
that, provided the proceedings against
him had all been completed, he would have been willing to give evidence for
Kapeliotis. The
position of Savvas is more complicated. He has ongoing
proceedings and has been advised not to give sworn evidence until they are
all
over. That could be a long time away.


38.  All this, is it said, involves a miscarriage of justice.


39.  The case was a proper
one for a joint trial. It was always likely that
Savvas and Mari would, like Kapeliotis himself, make an unsworn statement. It
is
a common feature of joint trials that one co-accused must accept the
consequences of another co-accused making an unsworn statement.
If there were
to have been separate trials, it is impossible to see why the trial of
Kapeliotis would have gone last, and why it
would not have commenced until
Savvas and Mari felt comfortable about entering the witness box.


40.  There is, in addition, an
element of unreality in the suggestion that
Savvas and Mari, as witnesses, would have provided significant assistance to
Kapeliotis.
The story told by Savvas, in particular, whilst portions of it
taken in isolation were exculpatory of Kapeliotis, was fundamentally
inconsistent with what Kapeliotis had to say. The defences of the two men,
considered together, were incongruous.


41.  No miscarriage
of justice arose from the events relied upon by the
appellant.


42.  The next two grounds of appeal complained about the directions
that were
given in relation to conspiracy. No complaint was made by trial counsel for
the appellant and leave is required to raise
these grounds. Leave should be
refused, but we will explain why they are not of substance.


43.  The particular passage in the summing-up
which is now complained of is as
follows: 
    "Hearsay involves conversations taking place outside the
    presence of a particular
person whose conduct is being examined.
    In other words, if you are examining Mr Mari's conduct, then on
    the face of it a
conversation between Mr Kapeliotis and Mr
    Savvas is hearsay because he is not present, he is not a
    participant, but in a
case of conspiracy where there is evidence
    of an agreement, I instruct you that evidence of acts done or
    admissions made,
by other persons whom you find to be
    participants in an agreement such as the one charged, may be
    used by you, not to prove
the truth of what is being said in
    relation to particular acts, but to establish the inference
    that an agreement exists.


44.  This was criticised as being an inaccurate and inadequate summary of the
principles stated, for example, in Tripodi v The
Queen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20104%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 104 CLR 1.</a> In
truth, however, a reading of the summing-up makes it clear that what was said
by Grove J was never intended to be a comprehensive
statement of the law as
enunciated in Tripodi. The quoted passage follows immediately upon a reference
to an argument that was put
to the jury in address by counsel for Mari. It
seems that counsel referred, on a number of occasions, to particular matters
being
hearsay. The remarks made by Grove J were in response to counsel's
characterisation of certain material as hearsay. Understood in
that context,
no exception can be taken to them and, indeed, no exception was taken to them
by trial counsel.


45.  There follow
two grounds of appeal in which it is contended that Grove J
failed adequately to direct the jury as to the mental element involved
in the
charges of conspiracy. Once again, leave is required to argue these grounds,
and leave should be refused. There is, in any
event, no merit in them.


46.  In evaluating the directions given by Grove J it is important to bear in
mind the issues that emerged
at the trial. What is now said is that, in
directing the jury that, to prove a person was la party to a conspiracy, the
Crown had
to prove that the person, knowing what was intended, agreed to
participate, the judge failed adequately to make clear that the accused
intended to perform the agreement. That, however, was not the issue in the
case.


47.  In relation to the alleged heroin conspiracy,
the issue that emerged at
the trial (putting aside questions of onus of proof) was whether the appellant
believed he was assisting
in the importation of drugs, or the importation of
diamonds. In the light of the way the trial was conducted, the explanation
given
by Grove J as to what was involved in the crime of conspiracy was quite
sufficient. It was neither necessary nor appropriate for
Grove J to give the
jury a lecture on the law of conspiracy. He was required to explain to the
jury the essential elements of the
offence, and to relate his explanation to
the evidence and arguments which emerged at the trial. That was done.


48.  Next it was
complained that Grove J failed adequately to direct the jury
as to the law relating to withdrawal from a combination. No objection
was
taken to the summing-up by trial counsel for the appellant in relation to this
matter. Leave to argue the point should be refused.
In any event we will
express our views on the merits of the argument.


49.  This was not a case which raised an issue of withdrawal
in the sense
discussed in While v Ridley <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20140%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 140 CLR 342.</a> Kapeliotis maintained that, as
soon as he learned, or came to suspect, that the proposals in respect of which
he was active were
not proposals to import diamonds but were proposals to
import drugs, he had nothing further to do with them. His case was that he
never was a party to a conspiracy to import drugs, not that he withdrew from
such a conspiracy in circumstances relieving him of
criminal liability. It
would have been unnecessary, and potentially confusing, for Grove J to have
embarked upon an explanation of
that area of the law.


50.  There was a submission that the verdicts of guilty were unsafe or
unsatisfactory, but this was principally
developed in connection with a point
that will be mentioned below. Insofar as it was contended that there was an
insufficiency of
evidence, of the kind considered in cases such as Chidiac v
The Queen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 432</a> or M v The Queen  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2069%20ALJR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 69 ALJR 83</a>, the argument
cannot be sustained. There was a powerful Crown case against the appellant,
principally because of the content of the
secretly recorded conversations.


51.  Finally, it is necessary to address the argument based upon the decision
in Ridgeway. That
argument was formally propounded as a submission that Grove
J was in error in admitting evidence of tape recorded conversations on
the
charge of conspiracy to import heroin. A corresponding argument in relation to
the charge of conspiracy to import cocaine was
disclaimed.


52.  What might be referred to as the entrapment involved in the heroin charge
was also, on appeal, given an additional
significance. It was argued that in
the circumstances, the alleged conspiracy was to do something that was itself
impossible to achieve,
and for that reason the charge had to fail.


53.  The relevant facts, to the extent to which they emerged at the trial, are
set
out in an earlier part of this judgment. Savvas and Postiglione, in
prison, formulated a plan to import heroin. Kapeliotis, an associate
of Savvas
who was outside the prison, was enlisted to further the plan. Lentze, and the
undercover police officer who dealt with
Kapeliotis, pretended to participate
in, and advance, the conspiracy. It is not argued that the last two persons
committed the crime
of conspiracy. It was not shown that it was ever their
intention that there would be an importation of heroin. The argument advanced
on behalf of the appellant is that the undercover police officer was guilty of
the crime of aiding and abetting a conspiracy (cf
Yip Chiu-Cheung v The Queen
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1994/1994_2a.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] UKPC 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%201%20AC%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 1 AC 111</a>, and the case note, in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20Crim%20LR%20824%2d836" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) Crim LR 824-836).</a>


54.  The allegedly criminal conduct of the police officer in the present case
is, to say the least, not as clear-cut as that involved
in Ridgeway, where
there was an actual illegal importation of heroin by the police for the
purpose of selling it to, and thereby
exposing as a drug dealer, the
appellant. Nor is it suggested that the police officer here aided and abetted,
or incited, any substantive
offence. Rather, he played the role of a willing
supplier of heroin, not intending that there would be any actual supply, but
intending
that the people who were taken in by his deception (people who were,
he had been told, planning an importation and seeking a supplier)
would
provide evidence of their guilty purpose. In the course of so doing they
would, at the same time as providing that evidence,
act in what they believed
to be the furtherance of their illegal object.


55.  In Reg v Anderson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20AC%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) AC 27</a> Lord Bridge of Harwich, with whom all the
other members of the House of Lords agreed, said, at 39: 
    "There may be many situations
in which perfectly respectable
    citizens, more particularly those concerned with law
    enforcement, may enter into agreements
that a course of
    conduct shall be pursued which will involve commission of
    a crime without the least intention of playing
any part in
    furtherance of the ostensibly agreed criminal objective, but
    rather with the purpose of exposing and frustrating
the
    criminal purpose of the other parties to the agreement. To
    say this is in no way to encourage schemes by which police
    act, directly or through the agency of informers, as agents
    provocateurs for the purpose of entrapment. That is conduct

   of which the courts have always strongly disapproved. But it
    may sometimes appear, as most of us with experience in criminal
    trials will know, that a criminal enterprise is well advanced
    in the course of preparation when it comes to the notice
 
  either of the police or of some honest citizen in such
    circumstances that the only prospect of exposing and frustrating
  
 the criminals is that some innocent person should play the
    part of an intending collaborator in the course of criminal
    conduct
proposed to be pursued. The mens rea implicit in the
    offence of statutory conspiracy must clearly be such as to
    recognise
the innocence of such a person... ".


56.  It may be added that it is hardly consistent with a recognition of the
"innocence" of
such a person to say that he is aiding and abetting a
conspiracy, even assuming that such an offence might otherwise arise in
similar
circumstances (cf R v Lanteri  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 359).</a>


57.  The borderline between exposing and frustrating a criminal purpose, and
acting as an agent provocateur, in a context such
as the present, may not be
easy to identify. That is why, if entrapment had been an issue at the trial,
closer investigation of facts
about which it suited everybody to be vague may
have been required.


58.  The decision in Ridgeway establishes that a trial judge
possesses a
discretion to exclude, on public policy grounds, evidence of an offence or
elements of an offence in circumstances where
its commission has been brought
about by unlawful conduct on the part of law enforcement officers. (The same
discretion was also
said to exist where a criminal offence has been induced by
improper, though not unlawful, conduct on the part of the authorities.
However, the present could hardly be described as a case of "creating
circumstances of temptation under which a vulnerable but otherwise
law-abiding
citizen" is lured into the commission of an offence.)


59.  Grove J was never invited to exercise such a discretion.
It has not been
demonstrated that the basis for the exercise of the discretion (illegality in
the conduct of the police officer)
existed. If the point had been taken at the
trial it would have been necessary to examine more closely the extent to which
the plan
for importation initiated by Savvas and Postiglione had, or would
have, developed without the participation of the police directly
or through
the agency of Lentze. Furthermore, Grove J would have had to weigh the
discretionary considerations outlined in Ridgeway.
It cannot be said what the
outcome of such a process would have been. That, too, would probably have
depended upon additional evidence.


60.  If this point had been taken at the trial, it may have given rise to some
interesting and difficult questions. It would have
required further
investigation of the facts. It does not assist the appellant at this stage of
the matter.


61.  The final, and
related, argument is that, because the police officer
never actually intended to provide heroin to the aspiring importers, their
object was impossible of achievement and, therefore, they could not be
convicted of conspiracy. Reliance was placed on Director of
Public
Prosecutions v Nock  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20AC%20979" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) AC 979.</a> The Crown does not accept that the facts of
the case are truly analogous with those in Nock. In any event, it has been
pointed out
that Nock has been trenchantly criticised, and not followed, in
England (eg Reg v Shivpuri <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%201%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 1 AC 1). (See</a> also R v Sew Hoy  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20NZLR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 NZLR
257).</a> A cognate decision, on the law of attempt, was not followed by this
Court in R v Mai  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2026%20NSWLR%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 26 NSWLR 371.</a> We do not consider that the present
conspiracy was, when correctly characterised, a conspiracy to do something
that was impossible.
It is at least doubtful that Nock represents the present
law in this State, but it is not necessary to decide that question.


62.
 The appeal of Kapeliotis against conviction should be dismissed.


The appeal of Mari against conviction
Ground 1
63.  This was
as follows: 
  1. His Honour the trial judge erred in law in not granting a separate trial
of the first count in respect of the appellant.


64.  The appellant Mari was charged on indictment with George Savvas and the
appellant Kapeliotis that between 1 October 1990 and
31 May 1991 they
conspired with each other and with Wayne Oastler, Nancy Dufek, Mario
Postiglione and others to import into Australia
prohibited imports to which
s233B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a> applied, namely, narcotic goods consisting of a
quantity of cocaine being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to
cocaine.


65.  In a second count George Savvas and the appellant Kapeliotis were charged
with a second conspiracy, namely, to import heroin.


66.  Before the trial, Mr Papayanni, counsel representing Mari, applied to
Grove J for an order that the two counts be severed.
The effect of the order
would have been that evidence relating exclusively to the heroin conspiracy
would not have been led at Mari's
trial, which would have been confined to the
cocaine conspiracy. The basis of the application is recorded in Grove J's
judgment of
31 January 1994. It was that evidence was to be presented by the
Crown in the form of intercepted conversations which had been recorded,
and
that there was considerable potential for confusion as to whether the speakers
were discussing the heroin conspiracy or the cocaine
conspiracy. Grove J
declined to grant the application. In his judgment, his Honour acknowledged
that the evidence had not yet been
led and said that a further application
could be made if prejudicial material emerged in the course of the trial which
could not
adequately be dealt with by direction to the jury. It does not
appear that any further application was made.


67.  As the evidence
came out, the two conspiracies were easily
distinguishable. The heroin was to be imported from Thailand, the cocaine from
Brazil.
The persons who were to acquire the drugs and courier them to
Australia were different in each case. Mari's alleged role in the cocaine
conspiracy was distinctive, being to arrange the finance, to travel to Brazil
and acquire the cocaine, and then to courier the cocaine
to Australia.. There
was no serious possibility that the jury might have confused evidence relating
solely to the heroin conspiracy
with the cocaine conspiracy or with Mari's
role in that conspiracy. The trial judge repeatedly directed the jury that
there were,
in effect, five counts which had to be considered separately, and
he identified the evidence against the respective accused.


68.
 It is not established that his Honour erred in refusing the application.
Nor is there any realistic possibility that Mari may have
suffered prejudice
as a result of the charges being heard together merely because some of the
recorded conversations related to the
other conspiracy or to both
conspiracies. It is usually preferable from the standpoint of an accused
person to be tried separately,
but that is not a prejudice which justifies
separate trials as a matter of course.


Grounds 2, 3 and 4
69.  These grounds relate
to the recorded conversations. They are as follows:

  2. His Honour erred in law in admitting the tapes in respect of the
apppellant's
conversations including those of 26 and 30 April and 3 May, 1991.

  3. His Honour erred in law in admitting all the tapes against
the appellant
including 5, 23, 30, March, 7, 14 and 28 April, 1991. 
  4. His Honour erred in law in failing to exercise his Honour's
discretion in
favour of the appellant in respect of Grounds 2 and 3.


70.  Objection was taken at the trial to the tender of recordings
made of
conversations which occurred in the visitors' room at Long Bay prison.
Transmitters had been fitted to tables in the room.
The recording was carried
out in a room nearby. In a judgment delivered on 15 February 1994, Grove J
gave his reasons for admitting
the evidence. He held that the use of the
listening devices was not shown to have been unlawful, and that the evidence
should not
be excluded in the exercise of his discretion.


71.  A number of arguments were put to the trial judge and to this court in
support
of the submission that the conversations had been recorded unlawfully.
These will be reviewed. But it is first necessary to note
certain features of
the legislation.


72.  A "listening device" is defined in s219A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a> as
meaning "any instrument, device or equipment capable of being used, whether
alone or in conjunction with any other instrument,
device or equipment, to
record or listen to spoken words".


73.  Section 219B(5) of that act provides for application to be made
to a
judge for the issue of a warrant authorising the use of a listening device "in
relation to a particular person". The subsection
further provides for the
issue of a warrant pursuant to such an application, authorising officials "to
use a listening device for
the purpose of listening to or recording words
spoken by, to or in the presence of that person, and ... to enter any premises
in
which the person is, or is likely to be, for the purpose of installing,
maintaining, using or recovering a listening device or a
part of a listening
device". Subsection (6) provides that such a warrant may authorise the use of
a listening device in relation
to such conversations occurring "anywhere in
Australia".


74.  Subsections (7) and (8) provide for the issue of a warrant in relation
to
particular premises as distinct from a particular person.


75.  The following observations may be made concerning subss(5) and
(6): 
    (a) A warrant issued under these provisions does not relate
    to a specified device identified by serial number or otherwise,
    ie it does not relate to any particular unit.
    (b) Accordingly, where the phrase "a listening device" is used
    in the legislation
or in a warrant issued pursuant to the
    legislation, the reference is to any such device as might be
    used from time to time
within the ambit of the authority given
    to listen to or record conversations by means of a listening
    device.
    (c) It follows
that more than one device may be used
    concurrently pursuant to the one warrant and that devices may
    be replaced from time
to time.


76.  The warrants issued in this case each authorised the Federal Police "to
use a listening device for the purpose of
listening to or recording words
spoken by, to or in the presence of (a named person) anywhere in Australia",
and further authorised
the Federal Police "to enter on any premises in which
(the named person) is or is likely to be, for the purpose of installing,
maintaining,
using or recovering such a listening device ... without
permission first being sought or demand first being made". The warrants were
stipulated as being for a period of 60 days or two months.


77.  The first argument was: that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a> did not authorise the
issue of a warrant to enter a State prison for the purpose of listening to or
recording conversations.


78.
 In Jacobsen v Rogers ((I 995) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20ALJR%20131" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 ALJR 131)</a> the High Court held that the
Crown in right of a State is subject to a search warrant issued pursuant to
s10 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1914</a> (Cth). It had been held in Bropho v Western
Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 1</a> that the presumption that legislation did not bind
the Crown could be displaced by a discernible legislative intention to the
contrary.
The more stringent test prescribed by the Privy Council in Province
of Bombay v Municipal Corporation of Bombay  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%20AC%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) AC 58</a>, at 63 was rejected.
The feature of s10 which led the court to discern an intention to bind the
Crown in right of a State was that
the section was concerned with the
investigation and prosecution of crime. Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and
Gaudron JJ said: 
    "In our view, it cannot have been intended by the legislature
    that a search warrant issued under s. 10 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>
    should stop short of Crown premises with the result that
    criminal offences might go unpunished or, at the very least,
  
 that their investigation and prosecution might be made more
    difficult. "


79.  The same reasoning applies in the case of s219B
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>.
The argument that the warrants in the present case were not effective to
authorise entry on State premises for the purpose of using
listening devices
to obtain potentially incriminating evidence has therefore to be rejected.


80.  But even if it be assumed for
the purpose of the argument that a warrant
issued pursuant to s219B(5) could not validly authorise entry upon State
premises, it
does not follow that the recording that was carried out was
unlawful. Entry may have been authorised by the prison authorities. It
would
be extraordinary if the surveillance was carried out other than by
arrangement. There was no evidence to the contrary.


81.
 It was said in argument that the police witnesses were asked if they had
received authorisation to enter the prison and some had,
the implication
apparently being that some had not. Authorisation by the governor or his
delegate pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/s113.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 113</a> does not have to be communicated to the
entrant.


82.  The second argument was: that no authorisation was given to any police
officer
to visit the prison by the governor of the prison pursuant to
regulation 113 of the Prisons (General) Regulations 1989.


83.  No
such authorisation was necessary if the warrants authorised entry, as
we hold they did. But even assuming they did not, there is
no evidence that
the governor of the prison or his delegate did not authorise the surveillance
operation. (Section 40C of the Prisons
Act 1952 provides for delegation of the
governor's functions.) Again, it would be extraordinary if the governor or a
duly authorised
delegate on the prison staff had not been consulted and had
not approved the operation.


84.  The third argument was: that the premises
on which the surveillance was
to be carried out were not specified in the warrants.


85.  The argument was said to be based on the
terms of s219B(7). But warrants
issued under that subsection relate to particular premises. The warrants in
the present case were
not issued pursuant to that subsection. They were issued
pursuant to s219B(5), which provides for warrants to be issued in relation
to
a particular person. There was no need for a warrant issued pursuant to
s219B(5) to specify particular premises. Indeed subs(6)
provides that such a
warrant may relate to conversations "anywhere in Australia". The warrants in
the present case were in those
terms.


86.  The fourth argument was: that his Honour failed to consider the question
of public interest immunity.


87.  This argument
was apparently actuated by the reference to public interest
immunity in Jacobsen. There, the court said it may be necessary in a
particular case to balance the public interest in the confidentiality of
communications with government officials against the public
interest in the
investigation of criminal activity and the prosecution of criminal charges. No
such question arises in the present
case.


88.  The fifth argument was: that each warrant was good for only one occasion.


89.  Reliance was placed on the requirement
that information be given on oath
to the judge issuing the warrant concerning an actual or suspected offence,
committed or likely
to be committed, and that use of a listening device would
be likely to assist enquiries into such offence or suspected offence;
s219B(5)(a)
and (b). It was argued that the information would vary after each
recording.


90.  It was not apparent from the argument what was
meant by an "occasion";
presumably, any one conversation was to be treated as an occasion.


91.  This argument also must be rejected.
It introduces a requirement which
the legislation does not include. Once the use of a listening device is
Justified by evidence of
the kind referred to in pars(a) and (b) of s219B(5),
the warrants authorise the use of a device to record any number of
conversations
involving the specified person (or, in the case of a subs(7)
warrant, any number of conversations on the specified premises). Where
the
grounds on which the warrant was issued cease to exist, action under the
warrant must cease; s219E. But so long as the matters
which grounded the
application for the warrant continue to operate there is no need to re-apply
for a further warrant or warrants
as further information comes to hand in the
course of the surveillance operation.


92.  The sixth argument was: that different transmitting
devices and different
receiving devices were used.


93.  For the reasons given earlier, this is not a valid complaint. A warrant
issued pursuant to the legislation does not relate to a particular device. If
a device is used for the purpose of listening to or
recording a conversation
in relation to a specified person (subs(5)) or a specified place (subs(7)) and
otherwise within the ambit
of the warrant, the use of the device is
authorised.


94.  The seventh argument was: that Federal Court judges do not have authority
to issue such warrants.


95.  No reasons were given for this argument. The legislation provides such
authority in terms, and Hilton
v Wells <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2058%20ALR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 58 ALR 245</a> holds that there is
no constitutional impediment to Federal Court judges being so authorised by
Commonwealth legislation to carry
out functions of this kind.


96.  The eighth argument was: that the warrants do not on their face comply
with "subs 7 as to (a)
or 9(b) " (a mistake for s219B(7) (a) and (b))


97.  As we have said, the warrants were issued pursuant to s219B(5) and not
pursuant
to s219B(7), but that does not matter in this instance because
pars(a) and (b) are the same in each case. These paragraphs specify
the
matters of which a judge must be satisfied before he is authorised to issue a
warrant.


98.  We have examined the terms of the
legislation and the terms of the
warrants. There is in fact no disparity between what is specified in the
warrants concerning the
matters in question and the provisions of pars(a) and
(b) in the legislation.


99.  The appellant cites George v Rockett <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 104</a>, and in
particular pp 110 and 111. So far as is relevant, that decision and the
passage referred to stand only as authority: for
the requirement that the
conditions governing the issue of a warrant must be strictly complied with.
The appellant has not pointed
to any statutory condition which was not
complied with in support of this submission. No such deficiency is apparent.


100.  The
ninth argument was: that the warrants are not in the prescribed form
and are consequently invalid.


101.  We have been directed
to the Customs (Narcotics Inquiries) Regulations.
The form for a warrant under s219B(5) appears in Schedule 1 of the
regulations.


102.  We have compared the warrants issued in the present case with the form
in Schedule 1. There is in fact no disparity.


103.
 As we have recorded earlier, the fourth ground of appeal was: that his
Honour had erred in not exercising his discretion to exclude
the evidence of
the recorded conversations.


104.  No argument was put to this court in support of this ground of appeal.
The discretion
refer-red to is presumably the discretion to exclude evidence
obtained illegally. In view of what we have said, the ground of appeal
does
not arise for consideration.


Grounds 5, 10, 11 and 12
105.  These were as follows: 
  5. His Honour erred in law in failing
to give a verdict of acquittal by
direction. 
  10. His Honour erred in law in misdirecting the jury and/or failing to
direct the
jury as to the roles of the alleged conspirators in the operation.

  12. The conviction of the appellant was unsafe and unsatisfactory.


106.  These grounds were dealt with together in submissions. Grounds 5 and 12
were said to related and Grounds 10 and 11 similarly.


107.  The argument in support of Grounds 5 and 12 consisted of a critique of
the adequacy of the evidence relied upon by the Crown
and referred to by his
Honour in his summing-up. We are comfortably satisfied that the evidence was
adequate to support a finding
of guilt on the part of Mari. The evidence of
Postiglione, of the recorded conversations at Long Bay Prison and of
intercepted telephone
conversations was amply sufficient to enable a jury to
find that Mari agreed to travel to South America to secure cocaine, agreed
to
raise finance for its purchase and did in fact raise such finance. Indeed, so
compelling was the evidence against him that Mari's
reponse had to be that he
in fact agreed to be involved but only to keep Postiglione happy, that he had
in fact agreed to take money
to South America but not for the purchase of
cocaine, and that he had in fact raised money in Sydney (delivered in American
dollars
contained in a brown paper bag) but for the purpose of a business he
was carrying on. There was ample evidence to the contrary of
that construction
of the events, which apparently satisfied the jury of guilt beyond reasonable
doubt and satisfies us that this
was the correct conclusion.


108.  Included in this argument was the submission that certain of the
recorded conversations should
not have been admitted against Mari because the
person concerned was referred to by Savvas as Maurice in those conversations,
whereas
Mari was said to have been known to Savvas as Maurizio. We were not
referred to any evidence to demonstrate that this was so. Nor
apparently was
the trial judge, who said he had not noticed any such evidence. But,
nonetheless, his Honour instructed the jury that
if they were so satisfied
they should disregard those passages.


109.  As to Grounds 10 and 11, it is sufficient to say that we
have examined
the directions given by the trial judge on the topics specified in those
grounds of appeal (namely, the alleged roles
of the conspirators, the legal
elements of the crime charged, the time at which Mari allegedly joined the
conspiracy relative to
the agreement which was then allegedly on foot, and the
mental element in the crime charged). We have found no material fault in
these
directions.


Ground 6
110.  This was as follows: 
  His Honour erred in law in failing to put the appellant's case adequately
(as requested in document filed in Court).


111.  We find no fault with the way the trial judge conveyed Mari's case to
the jury.


Ground 13
112.  This was as follows: 
  His Honour misdirected the jury in respect of the taped conversations of 5
March, 1991
(p57 of the Transcript).


113.  The specified conversation was between Savvas and Dufek. Savvas is
recorded as telling Dufek that
when she was overseas she was to tell someone
that they (the Sydney personel) would be sending someone over. His Honour went
on to
say that such conversations were available evidence against Mari, not to
prove the truth of what was said but to enable the jury
to infer the existence
of the agreement. That was the underlying agreement to import a commercial
quantity of cocaine into Australia
from South America.


114.  The earlier arrangements with Dufek were capable of being treated by the
jury, along with other evidence,
as establishing that underlying agreement.
The direction was unexceptionable.


The sentence appeals
115.  It is convenient to deal
first with the complaint of the appellant
Kapeliotis who, like Savvas, was convicted of two conspiracies. The appellant
submits that
the sentences imposed by Grove J were unduly severe, and that
there is a problem of disparity with the sentence imposed upon Savvas.


116.  Savvas was at all material times serving concurrent sentences, for
conspiring to import and supply heroin, involving a non-parole
period of
eighteen years commencing on 24 August 1988. (His appeal against that sentence
was unsuccessful both in this court and
in the High Court - see Savvas v The
Queen ((1995) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20ALJR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 ALJR 564).</a> Grove J sentenced Savvas to imprisonment for
twenty-five years, to date from 17 June 1994 (the date of sentencing) with a
non-parole
period of eighteen years. Savvas (assuming no further offences)
will be eligible for release on parole on 16 June 2012.


117.  Grove
J sentenced the appellant Kapeliotis, on each count, to concurrent
terms of imprisonment for twelve years to date from 27 July 1992,
with a
non-parole period of seven years. The appellant will be eligible for release
on parole on 26 July 1999.


118.  These sentences
are not excessive. The appellant has a prior record
including a prison term for a drug offence. Although his role in the two
subject
conspiracies was subordinate to that of Savvas, his function was, as
Grove J said, to act as a reliable agent for Savvas outside
prison. He was
described as "a willing and dedicated acolyte prepared to be obedient to any
request from his superior Savvas".


119.  In comparing the sentences imposed on Savvas and Kapeliotis, it is
important to bear in mind that Savvas received a non-parole
period of eighteen
years, commencing in June 1994 whilst Kapeliotis received a non-parole period
of seven years commencing in July
1992. We do not see disparity in their
treatment.


120.  The appellant Mari, in turn, complains of disparity in his treatment
when
compared with Kapeliotis and Postiglione. He also says that his sentence
did not reflect his minor role in the cocaine conspiracy
and the short time of
his involvement.


121.  Grove J sentenced Mari to imprisonment for eight years to date from 24
July 1992,
with a non-parole period of six years.


122.  The appellant Mari had a prior conviction for conspiring to import
heroin, for which
he had been sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment with a
non-parole period of approximately six years.


123.  Grove J rejected
a submission that the role of Mari in the cocaine
conspiracy was minor. He described him as playing an active part in obtaining
funds
for the proposed venture. Grove J obviously regarded Mari's role in the
cocaine conspiracy as significantly more important than that
of Kapeliotis in
either conspiracy. This view was justified by the evidence.


124.  Postiglione had been sentenced by another judge,
having pleaded guilty
to the two conspiracies. He received a head sentence of eighteen years with a
non-parole period of thirteen
years ten months. He was given the benefit of a
"discount" for co-operation with the authorities.


125.  We do not regard Mari's
sentence as excessive nor do we see relevant
disparity.


126.  The approach to sentencing adopted by Grove J involved no error of
fact
or principle.


127.  Both appellants should have leave to appeal against sentence but their
appeals should be dismissed.


Orders:
128.  In the case of the appellant Kapeliotis we make the following orders: 
  1 Appeals against convictions dismissed. 
  2 Leave to appeal against sentences granted but appeals dismissed. 
  3 Time spent in custody pending the appeals is to count.

In the case of the appellant Mari we make the following orders: 
  1 Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
  2 Leave to appeal against
sentence granted but appeal dismissed. 
  3 Time spent in custody pending the appeal is to count.
