LIMITED &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> This is an appeal against a decision of Deputy Chairman
Hoeben of the Commercial Tribunal, given on 9 April 1998.  The Tribunal
determined
that it had no jurisdiction to entertain certain matters raised by
the defendant (Taylor Farms (Australia) Pty Limited ("Taylor Farms")
in a
document headed "Amended Cross Claim and Further Defence to Claim".  The
pleading was struck out.
<P>

2	A Calkos Pty Limited ("Calkos") is the owner of a shopping centre near
Penrith, known as the Emerton Shopping Centre.  On 20 July
1994, Calkos
executed a lease of shop 37 within that centre.  The lessee was Angliss (NSW)
Pty Limited ("Angliss").  The lease was
for a period of five years, commencing
on 1 May 1994.  It was scheduled to end, therefore, on 30 April 1999.
<P>

3	Within a short time Angliss decided to assign its interest in the lease.  A
substitute tenant, Taylor Farms, was found.  The consent
of the owner was
sought and given.  A Deed of Consent and Assignment of Lease was drawn up.  The
recitals to the deed were as follows:
<P>

	"A.	The Lessor is the registered proprietor of the land referred to in Item 4
of the schedule to this Deed.
<P>

	B.	The Lessor has granted the Lease to the Assignor.
<P>

	C.	The Assignor wishes to assign all its right, title and interest in the
Lease and the Premises to the Assignee.
<P>

	D.	The Lessor has consented to the assignment of the Lease to the Assignee in
accordance with this Deed."
<P>

4	The Deed defined a number of terms.  Amongst the definitions provided, were
the following:
<P>

	"1.1	`Lease' means the lease of the Premises granted by the Lessor to the
Assignor and being of the date referred to in item 5
of the schedule to this
Deed;
<P>

	1.2	`Premises' means the premises referred to in item 6 to the schedule to
this Deed;
<P>

	1.3	`Assignment Date' means the date referred to in item 7 of the schedule to
this Deed;"
<P>

5	The Schedule was, relevantly, in these terms:
<P>

	"Item 1	Lessor:		A Calkos Pty Limited ...
<P>

	
<P>

	Item 2	Assignor:		Angliss (NSW) Pty Limited ..
<P>

	 
<P>

	Item 3	Assignee:		Taylor Farms (Australia)
<P>

	Pty Limited
<P>

	
<P>

	Item 5	Date of Lease:	July 20, 1994
<P>

	
<P>

	Item 6	Premises:		Shop 37, Emerton Shopping
<P>

	Centre, Emerton
<P>

	
<P>

	Item 7	Assignment Date:	November 11, 1994"
<P>

	
<P>

6	The Deed effected the assignment with these words:
<P>

	"3.1	The Assignor assigns to the Assignee on and from the Assignment Date all
its right, title and interest as lessee under the
Lease and in the Premises
(together with the benefits and burdens of the covenants under the Lease
whether or not such covenants
touch and concern the land)  including the rights
so far as may be necessary to demand performance or to sue for and enforce the
terms and conditions of the Lease in the name of the lessee for the residue of
the term of the Lease."
<P>

7	The relationship between the owner, Calkos, and the new tenant, Taylor Farms,
did not run smoothly.  One gathers from the Amended
Cross Claim that Taylor
Farms asserted that, before the Deed was signed, and it entered into
possession, there were certain misrepresentations
by the owner, or its agents.
It was said, for instance, that the floor upon which shop 37 was located would
remain a food court,
that certain improvements would be made, and facilities
provided.
<P>

8	At some point Taylor Farms ceased to pay rent.  An action was commenced in
the Penrith Local Court.  Again, drawing on the Cross
Claim, one gathers that
it was settled on 14 June 1996.  The Cross Claim asserted that, in
consideration of Taylor Farms agreeing
to pay certain monies allegedly owing as
rent, the owner would devote part of those monies towards the refurbishment and
improvement
of the centre.
<P>

9	One further gathers from the Amended Cross Claim and Defence that on 19 July
1996 the owner sent Taylor Farms a letter repeating
some of the assurances
which had previously been given.
<P>

10	In June 1997, Calkos issued a further summons in the Penrith Local Court.
Taylor Farms was named as first defendant.  The company
which had assigned the
lease was named as second defendant.  That company had since changed its name
from Angliss (NSW) Pty Limited
to Union International (NSW) Pty Limited ("Union
International").  The summons claimed rent from September 1997, together with
outgoings
said to be payable under the lease.
<P>

11	The matter was, thereafter, by consent, transferred to the Commercial
Tribunal.  It is not clear whether, at the time of its
transfer, the action
included a cross claim by Taylor Farms against the owner.  At some point a
cross claim was commenced.  The document
ultimately struck out by Deputy
Chairman Hoeben was described as the "Amended Cross Claim and Further Defence
to Claim".  The document
opened with the following paragraph:
<P>

	"The cross claimant/first respondent seeks the following orders:
<P>

	1.	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 72(2)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a> that the cross
defendant pay to the cross claimant the sum of $236,000 for damages made up as
follows:
<P>

	a.  Loss of Profits					$180,000
<P>

	b.  Loss of goodwill				  $15,000
<P>

	c.  Expenditure wasted			  	  $21,000
<P>

	d.  Mental stress and physical inconvenience $20,000"
<P>

12	The monetary limit of the Commercial Tribunal in respect to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act 1994</a> is $250,000 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s73.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 73).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 72(2)(a)</a> simply gives the Tribunal
power to order a party to pay a specified sum of money.  The pleading does not
identify the basis upon
which the money is said to be payable by Calkos.  The
Tribunal assumed, reasonably, that the basis for the claim was the paragraph
which followed in the Amended Cross Claim and Further Defence (para 2).  That
paragraph relied upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 42</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>.
<P>

13	The remaining paragraphs of the Amended Cross Claim and Further Defence to
Claim identified the following claims:
<P>

&#183;	Para 3:	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 34</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>
<P>

&#183;	Para 4:	Is uncertain, but was assumed by the Tribunal to raise "a type
of promissory estoppel".
<P>

14	Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Cross Claim and Defence (which was the final
paragraph) was also struck out.  Taylor Farms does
not contest the validity of
that order. 
<P>

<b>Jurisdiction Under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a></b>
<P>

15	The Commercial Tribunal was established by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act 1984</a>.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18(1)</a> defines its jurisdiction.  It is in these terms:
<P>

	"18(1)	  The Tribunal has such jurisdiction as is, and such functions as are,
conferred on it by or under an Act."
<P>

16	A number of Acts have conferred jurisdiction upon the Tribunal.  They are
set out in a note, forming part of the Act.  They include
the Building Services
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act 1989</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca198474/" class="autolink_findacts">Credit Act 1984</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mda1974154/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Dealers Act 1974</a>, and many
besides.  They also include the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>, and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases
Act 1994</a>.
<P>

17	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> was designed to overcome a specific inadequacy in
state consumer protection law.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> provided a measure
of consumer protection.  However, it did not cover the field.  Constitutional
limitations confined its operation
to corporations.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>
was designed as its companion, applying to individuals.  Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</a>, the unfair practices proscribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt V</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act
1974</a> were replicated.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> includes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> (the equivalent of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>).  It is in these terms:
<P>

	"42.	<b>Misleading or deceptive conduct -</b>
<P>

	1.	A person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is
misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive."
<P>

18	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> deals with Enforcement and remedies.
Offences are created <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 62(1))</a> where the Act is contravened (although not for
contravention of s 42).  Such offences may be dealt with by either the Local
Court
or the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction (s 63(2)).  Injunctions
may be granted by the Supreme Court, in circumstances where
a breach of the Act
is apprehended (s 65).  Section 68 provides a right of action to a person who
suffers damage or loss.  It is
in these terms:
<P>

	"68(1)	   A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person
that is in contravention of a provision of Part 3, 4,
5 (section 43 excepted),
5A or 5B may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the
other person or against any
person involved in the contravention."
<P>

19	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> deals with Codes of practice.  Provision is
made for the preparation of Codes for fair dealing between suppliers and
consumers, and
for undertakings to be filed by persons found to be in breach.
The Commercial Tribunal is specifically given jurisdiction in relation
to such
Codes of practice, and undertakings.
<P>

20	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 68</a> does not specify the court which is to have jurisdiction to
determine claims for damages arising out of an alleged breach of an obligation
imposed by the Act.  Such claims, therefore, were taken to be within the
general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (s 23 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>).  In
1992 the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act 1973</a> was amended to insert <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a>, which was in
these terms:
<P>

	"<b>Jurisdiction in proceedings under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a></b>
<P>

	135.	The Court has the same jurisdiction as the Supreme Court, and may
exercise all the powers and authority of the Supreme Court,
in any proceedings
in which relief is sought under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> and where the amount
of the claim concerned does not exceed the amount for the time being specified
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 44(1)(a)."</a>
<P>

21	In 1996, the jurisdiction of the Local Court was enlarged by inserting the
following subsection, accompanied by a note:
<P>

	"12(9)		In this section, a reference to an action extends to an action
referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Note:</b>	The effect of subsection (9) is to confer jurisdiction on
a Local Court in respect of actions for damages referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>.</i>  That jurisdiction is similar to the
jurisdiction conferred on a Local Court by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 86</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act 1974</a> of the Commonwealth in respect of actions for damages referred to in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 82</a> of that Act."
<P>

22	No such amendment has been made to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act 1984</a>.
Neither the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act 1984</a>, nor the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>,
therefore, confer jurisdiction upon the Tribunal in respect of a claim for
damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>.  So much was common ground in
the present application.
<P>

23	The issue is whether that position has been disturbed by the passage of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>, that being a later statute.  Taylor Farms claims that
it has.  Under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>, the Commercial Tribunal is given the
following jurisdiction:
<P>

	"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 72(1)</a>  The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine a retail tenancy
claim lodged with the Tribunal under this Part."
<P>

24	The powers of the court are defined in these terms:
<P>

	"72(2)	  In proceedings on such a claim, the Tribunal is empowered to make
such one or more of the following orders as it considers
appropriate:
<P>

	(a)	an order that a party to the proceedings pay money to a person specified
in the order,
<P>

	(b)	an order that a specified amount of money is not due or owing by a party
to the proceedings to a specified person,
<P>

	(c)	an order that a party to the proceedings do any specified work or perform
any specified service."
<P>

25	The term "retail tenancy claim" is defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 70</a> as follows:
<P>

	"70 ... <b>retail tenancy claim</b> means any of the following claims in
connection with a liability or obligation with which a retail tenancy dispute
is concerned:
<P>

	(a)	a claim for the payment of a specified sum of money,
<P>

	(b)	a claim for relief from payment of a specified sum of money,
<P>

	(c)	a claim for the doing of specified work or the provision of specified
services."
<P>

26	The term "retail tenancy dispute" is also defined:
<P>

	"63(1) ... <b>retail tenancy dispute</b> means any dispute concerning the
liabilities or obligations (including any obligation to pay money) of a party
or former party to
a retail shop lease, being liabilities or obligations which
arose under the lease or which arose in connection with the use or occupation
of the retail shop to which the lease relates."
<P>

27	It was argued that the legislation is remedial in nature.  It was designed
to provide a forum where retail landlords and tenants
may sort out their
differences.  The legislature has manifested a clear preference for the
Commercial Tribunal as a place where such
disputes should be resolved.  That
preference is revealed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75</a> which includes the following:
<P>

	"75(1)	  If civil proceedings pending in a court involve a retail tenancy
dispute, the court must on the application of any party
to the proceedings
transfer the proceedings (or so much of the proceedings as involve such a
dispute) to the Tribunal to be dealt
with as a claim under this Division, but
only if the court is satisfied that:
<P>

	(a)	the dispute is such as may effectively be dealt with as a claim under this
Division and that it is appropriate that the dispute
be dealt with by the
Tribunal, and
<P>

	(b)	the interests of justice do not require that the matter be dealt with by
the court.
<P>

	(2)	In determining whether or not it is appropriate that a matter be dealt
with by the Tribunal, a court is to have regard to the
general principle that
retail tenancy disputes should be dealt with by the Tribunal rather than by a
court.
<P>

	(3)	Proceedings are taken to involve a retail tenancy dispute if any issue in
dispute in the proceedings involves a liability or
obligation with which a
retail tenancy dispute is concerned."
<P>

28	That section reflects a change of heart on the part of the Government during
the passage of the Bill.  The Minister, when introducing
the Bill on 20 April
1994, referred to a requirement that retail lease disputes should initially be
dealt with by mediation.  He
then said this:
<P>

	"If the mediation is unsuccessful, the parties will seek resolution through
the court system.  Both the BOMA and the RTA have suggested
to me that the
Commercial Tribunal is the appropriate forum for arbitration.  I believe,
however, that the court system is a more
accessible option, particularly to
those in regional areas of the State."
<P>

29	When the Bill next came before the House, however, the Minister made the
following statement:
<P>

	"I have examined a number of options for dispute resolution that have been put
to me recently.  I am now of the view that access
to both courts and a tribunal
would be preferable to access to the courts alone.  The amendment I have moved
will allow just that.
 Should mediation fail, one or both parties will now be
able to approach either the Commercial Tribunal or to a court to seek an
order.
Preference will be given to having the tribunal, rather than a court, determine
an order.
<P>

	The applicant before the tribunal may claim payment, relief from payment, or
that specified work be carried out.  The tribunal
will decide whether to make
an order.  However, an applicant before a court may seek a host of other
directions, such as terminating
a lease agreement, varying a lease agreement,
assigning a lease, et cetera.  Once the tribunal makes an order its decision
will be
final.  The tribunal will not be a rent-determining authority;  it will
be a body to resolve disputes concerning the liabilities
or obligations of the
parties to a lease."
<P>

30	The tenant, Taylor Farms, contends that a "retail tenancy claim" has been
deliberately framed in broad terms.  Relevantly, it
is a claim for payment of a
specified sum of money, or a claim for relief from payment.  The issue is
whether a claim under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> for a breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> is
a "retail tenancy claim".
<P>

31	The Cross Claim of Taylor Farms seeks to establish liability on the part of
the landlord under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>, which might then be set off against
any liability for unpaid rent.  The contention is, therefore, that the
Commercial Tribunal has
jurisdiction to determine whatever issues may separate
retail landlord and tenant.
<P>

32	Counsel for the landlord, Calkos, resisted such a construction upon a number
of bases.  First, given the history of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>, had
Parliament intended that the Commercial Tribunal should have jurisdiction to
deal with a claim for damages under that Act, it
would have said so, as it has
in the case of the District Court, and the Local Court. 
<P>

33	To accede to the plaintiff's submission would be to alter the careful
balance in the distribution of business relating to claims
for damages under s
68 "by a side wind" (cf Brennan J <b><i>Parkdate Custom Built Furniture Pty
Limited v Puxu Proprietary Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%2d82%29%20149%20CLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981-82) 149 CLR 191</a> at 224).
<P>

34	Secondly, the Second Reading Speech, and the provisions of s 75 itself,
reflect the limitations upon the jurisdiction of the
Commercial Tribunal.  Not
all issues arising between the retail landlord and tenant may be dealt with by
the Commercial Tribunal.
 It may be more convenient, and just, that a dispute
remain with the court, rather than be transferred to the Commercial Tribunal
by
reason of such limitations.
<P>

35	Thirdly, jurisdiction in the Commercial Tribunal is founded upon there being
"a retail tenancy claim".  A retail tenancy claim,
in turn, is dependent upon
their being "a retail tenancy dispute".  The "retail tenancy dispute" has, as
its touchstone, a liability
or obligation which arises in one or other of two
ways, namely:
<P>

&#183;	either under the lease, or
<P>

&#183;	in connection with the use of the retail shop to which the lease
relates.
<P>

36	Taylor Farms do not suggest that the obligation upon Calkos arose under the
lease.  Do such obligations arise "in connection
with the use or occupation of
the retail shop to which the lease relates"?  The words "in connection with"
are of wide import.  (<b><i>Burswood Management Limited &amp; Ors v Attorney
General (Cth) &amp; Anor </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1990/203.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] FCA 203</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2023%20FCR%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 23 FCR 144)</a>  Barwick CJ, in <b><i>Brown
&amp; Ors v Rezitis &amp; Ors</i></b> ((1970-71) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=127%20CLR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">127 CLR 157)</a>, a case concerned
with s 88F of the Industrial Arbitration Act 1940, said this:  (at 165)
<P>

	"Whilst it can be said that the expression 'in connection with' is of wide
import, it does emphasise the need for a close connection
between the order
made and the contract or arrangement varied or avoided..."
<P>

However, I do not believe that the words in the definition are so broad as to
encompass any liability, whatever its source.  The
retail landlord and tenant
come into contact by reason of that relationship.  That contact may give rise
to liability in a variety
of ways.  The tenant may assert, for instance, that
he or she has been defamed by remarks made by the landlord.  However, in a
claim
for rent by the landlord, the Commercial Tribunal, in my view, would not
be vested with jurisdiction to determine (without a jury)
whether rent should
be offset by an award of damages for defamation.  It was suggested, by counsel
for Calkos, that the causal connection
required to satisfy the requirements of
a "retail tenancy dispute" can only be met if the obligations arise either
under the lease,
or by virtue of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>.  The definition,
for instance, is apt to pick up obligations upon the landlord arising under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
34</a>, in respect of which the retail landlord may be obliged to pay compensation,
were he in breach.
<P>

37	Such a construction may be too narrow.  Negligence by the landlord impacting
upon the tenant, where damage was foreseeable, may
be enough (cf <b><i>Brian
Oxley and Frances Peroni v Imperial Charter Pty Limited</i></b> (Commercial
Tribunal, 26.8.96, Deputy Chairman R B Davidson).
<P>

38	Whatever the limits, I believe that determining a claim for damages under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 42</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a>) is beyond that limit.  I believe, with
respect, Deputy Chairman Hoeben expressed the point well when she said this:
<P>

	"Statutory substantive jurisdiction cannot be found by mixing and matching any
number of pieces of legislation, whether they give
limited jurisdiction to the
Tribunal (as it does by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78</a> of the FTA) with another jurisdiction conferred by
legislation, the latter forming the basis of the claim.  If the Tribunal was to
have jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 42</a> (and therefore 68) Parliament would either have
enacted the relevant amendment under either the Tribunal Act or the FTA, as it
did
with the District Court in 1992 with the introduction of s 135.  Parliament
has made no such amendment."
<P>

39	I believe, therefore, that the Tribunal was correct to strike out paragraph
2.
<P>

	<b>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a></b>
<P>

40	Paragraph 3 of the Amended Cross Claim and Defence sought compensation
against the owner, Calkos, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>.
That provision implies a number of obligations upon the lessor in any retail
shop lease. Where the lessor is in breach of these
obligations, the lessee may,
subject to certain formalities, claim compensation.  The obligations
include:
<P>

	"34	<b>Lessee to be compensated for disturbance</b>
<P>

	(1)	A retail shop lease is taken to provide that if the lessor:
<P>

	
<P>

		(a)	inhibits access of the lessee to the shop in any
<P>

	 substantial manner, or
<P>

	(b)	takes any action that would inhibit or alter, to a substantial extent, the
flow of customers to the shop, or
<P>

	(c)	unreasonably takes any action that causes significant disruption of, or
has a significant adverse effect on, trading of the
lessee in the shop, or
<P>

	(f)	in the case of a shop within a retail shopping centre, fails to adequately
clean, maintain or repair the retail shopping centre
(including common
areas),"
<P>

	and the lessor does not rectify the matter as soon as reasonably practicable
after being requested in writing by the lessee to
do so, the lessor is liable
to pay the lessee reasonable compensation for any loss or damage (other than
nominal damage) suffered
by the lessee as a consequence."
<P>

41	Before these obligations are implied there must be a "retail shop lease".
The Act includes the following:
<P>

	"<b>6.	Leases to which Act does not apply</b>
<P>

	This Act does not apply to any of the following leases of retail shops:
<P>

	(c)	leases entered into before the commencement of this section,"
<P>

42	The commencement date was 1 August 1994.  The lease between Calkos and
Angliss was entered into before the Act, namely on 20
July 1994.  The Deed of
Consent and Assignment between Calkos, Angliss and Taylor Farms, however, was
entered after, namely on 11
November 1994.  Is the date of the lease, for the
purposes of s 6(c), the date of the original grant to Angliss, or the date of
the
assignment?  Only if it were the latter, could the obligations under s 34
be implied.
<P>

43	The Act includes a definition of "lessee" and "lessor" which, in each case,
include assignees.  The definitions are as follows:
<P>

	"<b>lessee</b> means the person who has the right to occupy a retail shop
under a retail shop lease, and includes a sublessee and a lessee's or
sublessee's heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.
<P>

	<b>lessor</b> means the person who grants or proposes to grant the right to
occupy a retail shop under a retail shop lease, and includes a sublessor
and a
lessor's or sublessor's heirs, executors, administrators and assigns."
<P>

44	The word "lease" is given the following meaning for the purposes of the
Act:
<P>

	"<b>retail shop lease</b> or <b>lease</b> means any agreement under which a
person grants or agrees to grant to another person for value a right of
occupation of premises
for the purpose of the use of the premises as a retail
shop:
<P>

	(a)	whether or not the right is a right of exclusive occupation, and
<P>

	(b)	whether the agreement is express or implied, and
<P>

	(c)	whether the agreement is oral or in writing, or partly oral and partly in
writing."
<P>

45	The terminology chosen in this definition is that of the common law
("lease", "grant"), although the subparagraphs which elaborate
upon the
definition alter and extend the common law.  Paragraph (a), for instance, would
include a "licence".
<P>

46	Taylor Farms, also drew attention to s 8(1).  It was suggested that the
section emphasised the need for privity between the lessor
and the person in
occupation.  This section provides as follows:
<P>

	"<b>8.	When the lease is entered into</b>
<P>

	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, a retail shop lease is considered to have
been entered into when a person enters into possession
of the retail shop as
lessee under the lease or begins to pay rent as lessee under the lease
(whichever happens first)."
<P>

47	At common law, the assignment of a lease did not create a new lease
(<b><i>Mason v Harris</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281921%29%201%20KB%20653" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1921) 1 KB 653</a> at 655).  The issue is whether
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a> alters the common law so that the assignment, rather
than the lease, provides the relevant date for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6.</a>  That issue
has been considered in a number of jurisdictions in the context of legislation
comparable to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> of New South Wales.
<P>

48	In <b><i>Dileum Pty Ltd v J K Corporation Pty Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20WAR%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 1 WAR 244</a>,
the Full Court of Western Australia construed the Commercial Tenancy (Retail
Shops) Agreement Act 1985.  A lease was granted which
included an option.  The
lessee exercised the option.  Thereafter there was a change to the Act.  The
lessee subsequently assigned
the lease.  The new lessee sought to exercise
certain rights which were only available if the assignment could be regarded as
a new
lease for the purposes of the legislation.  The court held (Wallace J
dissenting) that it could not.  Kennedy J said this:  (at 256)
<P>

	"Counsel for the appellant argued that the assignment itself constitutes a
lease for the purposes of the Act.  The assignment in
question amounted to a
transfer or conveyance by the original tenant of the balance of a pre-existing
term.  The assignment itself
did not create any new term.  Nor did it contain
any grant by the lessors to the appellant of any entitlement to occupy the
premises.
 The assignment contained no covenant by the lessors in favour of the
appellant to observe the terms of the lease.  The lessors'
grant and the
covenants made by them are only to be found in the lease.  So far as the
lessors were concerned, the assignment simply
records their consent to the
assignment, albeit the price of that consent was a number of covenants by the
appellant directly in
favour of the lessors, together with certain undertakings
and an acknowledgment with respect to the existing liquor store licence.
 The
estate in leasehold which was assigned to the appellant was not the lessors' to
grant to the appellant.  That had already been
granted to Gordon Matheson Pty
Ltd."
<P>

49	Shortly thereafter, a similar issue came before the Queensland Supreme
Court, <b><i>Re Malsons Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%202%20Qd%20R%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 2 Qd R 61 (Thomas</a> J).  In that
case the lease was executed in 1987.  The lessors were given the right to
determine the lease, should they require the
property for redevelopment, and to
do so without payment of compensation.  In October 1988 the lease was assigned.
In the same year
the Retail Shop Leases Act 1984 was amended.  The amendments
required a lessor, in certain circumstances, to compensate a lessee
where the
premises were required for demolition or redevelopment.  In 1990 the owner gave
the lessee notice that the premises were
required for redevelopment.  The
lessee then sought a Declaration that it was entitled to compensation under the
1988 amendment.
 Thomas J said this:  (at 65)
<P>

	"It is true that when the present lessee applied for assignment of the lease,
and when the lessor decided to consent to assignment
of it to the new lessee,
the assignee was acquiring the bundle of rights contained in the old lease,
which included cl 15.13.  but
the law at that time included the 1988 Act which
engrafted a particular right in favour of the tenant in leases coming into
existence
from then on.  It did not matter what the parties wrote into their
leases in that respect, or what they might adopt from existing
documents, the
legislative provision would prevail.  Upon the lessor's consent to this
assignment a new set of rights and obligations
was created as between this
lessor and this lessee."
<P>

50	The Queensland legislation was subsequently altered.  The Retail Shop Lease
Act 1994, S 15, expressly excluded assignments from
the operation of the Act.
One author made the following comment in relation to that change:
(<b>`Assignment of Leases entered into prior to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>
(NSW)'</b> by Catherine Hallgath, Law Society Journal, vol 34 no 3 April
1996.)
<P>

	"It is likely that the express exclusion of assignments in the Queensland
legislation was in order to correct the decision in <i>Malsons</i>.  That case
may have been correct on the facts, but had the potential to produce
commercially unrealistic results when applied."
<P>

51	In the Victorian County Court in <b><i>Hamatan Pty Ltd v Narracan Nominees
Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20V%20ConvR%2054%2d471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) V ConvR 54-471</a>, Jones J said this:
<P>

	"I have carefully considered the views expressed by Thomas J in <i>Malson's
case</i> and they have force.  They are, of course, made in the context of the
Queensland legislation although that is similar to the Victorian
legislation.
However, after giving the matter careful consideration and, in particular, the
views of his Honour, I have reached a
different conclusion as to the position
under the Act in the circumstances of an assignment.  I do not consider that it
is the intention
of the Act that the assignment in this case constitute the
entering into a new lease by the Plaintiff and First Defendant at the
time of
the assignment.  Rather, it seems to me, what occurs is the substitution of one
tenant for another under an existing lease.
 The only thing that changes is the
tenant.  Otherwise the position is the same, the new tenant having the same
rights and obligations
as the old.  The position would be different, in my
view, if the Deed of Assignment changed the terms of the lease of the premises
to apply to the First Defendant by, for example, changing the basis of the rent
that was to be paid by the First Defendant under
the lease."
<P>

52	Here, the Deed of Assignment did not alter in any way the terms of the
lease.
<P>

53	Finally, in <b><i>Bradbun Pty Ltd v Bobo Nominees Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20V%20ConvR%2054%2d501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) V
ConvR 54-501</a>, in the Victorian Supreme Court, O'Bryan J considered the Retail
Tenancy Act, 1986, and expressed the following views:
<P>

	"Section 3(4) in the Victorian Act is couched in different language:  `A
retail premises lease is entered into when <u>under the lease</u> the tenant
enters into possession of the premises etc.'  (underlining for emphasis).
<P>

	If the words underlined refer to the original lease why should one not
conclude that a retail premises lease was entered into when
Bradbun entered
into possession of the premises and became a tenant with the approval of
Bobo.
<P>

	The effect o the assignment of the original lease to Bradbun was to create
rights and obligations between the parties from the
possession date in the
nature of a landlord and tenant relationship.  On 6 February 1992, and not
before, the parties' rights and
obligations as landlord and tenant
commenced.
<P>

	I am of the opinion that the reasoning of Thomas J in <i>Malsons Pty Ltd</i>
may be applied to the facts and circumstances in the present case, with the
result that a retail premises lease was entered into
when Bradbun entered into
possession of the demised premises."
<P>

54	The Commercial Tribunal, having considered these authorities, determined
that the assignment did not create a new lease under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act
1994</a>.  The lease, therefore, predated the Act, and s 34 had no application.
Paragraph 3 of the Cross Claim and Defence was, therefore,
struck out.
<P>

55	I agree with that Determination.  I prefer, with respect, the reasoning in
<b><i>Dileum Pty Ltd v J K Corporation Pty Ltd</i></b>, and <b><i>Hamatan Pty
Ltd v Narracan Nominees Pty Ltd</i></b>, to that in <b><i>Re Malsons Pty
Ltd</i></b> and <b><i>Bradbun Pty Ltd v Bobo Nominees Pty Ltd</i></b>.
Ultimately, it is, of course, a matter of statutory interpretation.  But it is
not without interest that the parties, at the time
they executed the Deed of
Consent and Assignment, plainly believed that they were transmitting to Taylor
Farms the rights of Angliss
acquired under the lease of 20 July 1994, and that
for the balance of the term.
<P>

56	I favour the view reached by the Commercial Tribunal for a number of
reasons.  First, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a> affected significant changes.  A
lessor would, henceforth, be obliged to provide a copy of the proposed lease to
the lessee when
conducting negotiations.  To do otherwise was an offence <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 9).</a>
Proceedings could be taken to recover a fine before a Local Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s84.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 84).</a>  The
lessee was to be given what was termed a Disclosure Statement.  It was to take
the form of Schedule 2.  That schedule runs for
some five pages.  A detailed
summary of the provisions of the lease had to be provided.  Provision was made
for the inclusion of
any representation by the lessor, or lessee, or side
agreements between them.  If a disclosure statement was not provided, or was
incomplete, or contained false and misleading information, the lessee had the
right to terminate the lease <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 11(2)).</a>  The parties may agree upon
compensation in the event of there being pre-lease misrepresentations <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 10).</a>
Provision was made for a minimum term of five years <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 16).</a>  If a lease was
entered in contravention of that section, the validity of the lease was not
effected.  The term, however, was simply
extended so that it amounted to five
years <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 16(2)).</a>
<P>

57	The Act, therefore, introduced a very different regime.  There were
significant penalties, including criminal penalties, for
failure to observe
that regime.  The Act recognised that it would be unfair to make those changes
retrospective (s 6(c)).  You would
have expected, therefore, that if the common
law position in respect of assignments were to be changed, s 6(c) would have
made that
clear (<b><i>Potter v Minahan</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1908] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%207%20CLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 7 CLR 277</a>, per O'conner
J at 304) .  You would have expected s 6(c) to provide that the Act did not
apply to leases entered into before the
commencement of the section, unless
that lease were assigned after the commencement date.  The construction for
which Taylor Farms
(the lessee) contends, would, in my judgment, be attended by
significant commercial inconvenience (cf <b><i>Butt</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 ALJ 763</a>;
<b><i>Halgarth</i></b>, Law Society Journal supra).  The parties here, for
instance, plainly gave no thought to the requirements of the new Act at the
time
they executed the Deed of Consent and Assignment.  The lease of 20 July
1994 was simply assigned, being the balance of the term of
five years (cf s
16),
<P>

58	Secondly, the construction suggested by Taylor Farms would operate as an
inhibition upon assignment, and that cannot have been
the legislative
intention.  Professor Butt made the following comment relevant in this context
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20763" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(69 ALJ 763</a> at 764):
<P>

	"The assignment will free the assignee from some of the obligations imposed on
the original tenant, and will give the assignee
rights that the original tenant
did not enjoy.  The landlord will find that the lease is now something quite
different to the lease
that existed between the landlord and the original
tenant.  Would this be a ground for the landlord to refuse consent to an
assignment?
 English case law suggests that it would be:  see <i>Bickel v Duke
of Westminster</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20QB%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] QB 517</a> (landlord entitled to refuse consent where
assignee would have a statutory right to purchase the free hold at a reduced
value); 
<i>West Layton Ltd v Ford</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1979/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] EWCA Civ 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%203%20WLR%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 3 WLR 14</a> (landlord entitled to
refuse consent where assignee would be entitled to the benefit of the Rent
Acts)."
<P>

59	Thirdly, the definition of "retail lease" speaks of a "grant" of the right
of occupation.  The grant was to Angliss.  The Deed
of 11 November 1994 simply
assigned the lease to Taylor Farms.  The original lessee (Angliss, which became
Union International) remained
liable under the retail lease of 20 July 1994,
although it was provided with an indemnity by the assignee (cl 4(2)).
<P>

60	I do not believe s 8(1) alters the construction which I favour.  It uses the
word "lease".  The lease was the grant by Calkos
to Angliss.  Section 8(1)
simply fixes the date of the lease, should entry into possession or the payment
of rent not correspond
with the date on the document.
<P>

	<b>Promissory Estoppel</b>
<P>

61	Paragraph 4 of the Amended Cross Claim and Further Defence to Claim was in
these terms:
<P>

	"4.	Pursuant to the Agreements between the Cross Claimant and Cross Defendant
on 14 June 1996 the Cross Defendant is estopped from
proceedings:
<P>

	<u>PARTICULARS</u>
<P>

<center>	a.	Agreement by Cross Defendant to withdraw proceedings number 718/96
at Penrith Local Court in consideration for part payment of
purported arrears
of rent and the Cross Defendant covenanting to complete the matters raised in
the Second Representations.</center>
<P>

	b.	Continuing agreement between June 1996 and August 1996 by Cross Defendant
to complete matters referred to in Second Representations
and Third
Representations in consideration for payment of reduced rental in the sum of
$2,372.00 per calendar month (instead of lease
amount of $2,791.66)."
<P>

62	The pleading is certainly unclear.  It refers to the "Second
Representations" and "Third Representations".  The Second Representations
were
said to have been made on 14 June 1996.  They are described in the particulars
which accompany para 2(b).  One gathers that
Calkos sued Taylor Farms in the
Penrith Local Court claiming rent.  It appears that the action was settled.
Presumably, the terms
were not reduced to writing.  The settlement, one
gathers, imposed obligations upon each party.  Picking one's way through the
pleadings,
it appears that the essential terms of the agreement, according to
Taylor Farms, were as follows:
<P>

&#183;	First, Calkos would withdraw the Summons.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, Taylor Farms would pay Calkos $13,000.00.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, Calkos would refurbish the Centre, cleaning it and removing
graffiti.  Further, it would promote the Centre, taking
steps to introduce a
number of major tenants.  It would devote $5,500.00 of the monies paid by
Taylor Farms towards these ends.
<P>

&#183;	Fourthly, that, during the period June 1996 to August 1996, the monthly
rental of Taylor Farms would be reduced from $2,791.66
to $2,372.00 (presumably
whilst the promises were being carried out).
<P>

63	That is a charitable construction of what the pleading appears to be saying.
It does not state (as it should) that, relying upon
these promises, Taylor
Farms paid the sum of $13,000.00, and yet the promises were not kept.
<P>

64	Deputy Chairman Hoeben dealt with this aspect in these words:
<P>

	"As paragraph 4 of the cross-claim is also headed `Further Defence to Claim'
the Tribunal allows the defence contained in that
paragraph to be pleaded.
However, the defence would seem to plead a type of promissory estoppel.  If
this is the case, and from the
pleadings it is not clear, the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to hear an equitable estoppel:  <i>Phillips v Acsai</i>, supra;
<i>Jarre Pty Limited v Vmbaca</i>, Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales,
unreported 14 November 1997.  To the extent that this is the case, the Tribunal
finds that
no cause of action arises in respect of the paragraph and therefore
it is accordingly struck out."
<P>

65	On first reading, there appears to be a contradiction between the opening
sentence of the Deputy Chairman's judgment, and the
order she ultimately made.
She allowed the defence, and then struck it out.  The explanation lies in the
heading of the pleading.
 It carries the title "Amended Cross Claim and Further
Defence to Claim".  The document does not (as it should) identify which
paragraphs
are pleaded by way of cross claim, and which by way of defence.  The
Deputy Chairman was simply saying that para 4 was not a cross
claim.  She
proposed to view it as a defence.  She then characterised that defence as in
the nature of promissory estoppel.  She
took the view that the Tribunal had no
jurisdiction to deal with a defence of promissory estoppel, and therefore,
struck out that
paragraph.
<P>

66	Taylor Farms makes two complaints about the Deputy Chairman's order:
<P>

&#183;	First, it was inappropriate to characterise para 4 as simply a plea of
promissory estoppel.  The tenant asserted an agreement.
 The agreement affected
the rent payable.  The Tribunal had jurisdiction to deal with that issue.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, assuming that para 4 did raise (or raised in part) a defence
of promissory estoppel, the Tribunal had jurisdiction
to deal with such a
defence, in circumstances where it was not required to grant equitable
relief.
<P>

67	Dealing with the first issue, one can sympathise with the Deputy Chairman,
confronted by a pleading as deficient as para 4. 
The Tribunal should not have
to guess what a party is saying.  Nonetheless, the Tribunal is a forum in which
the formalities often
associated with a court have been relaxed (cf s 19(9)(a)
and (b)).
<P>

68	How should para 4 be characterised?  There are a number of possibilities.
First, the agreement between Taylor Farms and Calkos
on 14 June 1996 may,
depending upon whether certain formalities have been observed (s 23C
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>), amount to a variation of the lease.  If it were a
variation, then any dispute concerning liabilities or obligations arising under
that agreement would arise "under the lease" and therefore amount to a "retail
tenancy dispute" within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63(1).</a>  It would give rise to a "retail tenancy
claim" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 70).</a>  The Tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear and determine such
a claim <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 72(1)).</a>  Even though the agreement, as described in the Particulars
accompanying the Second Representations, purports to include a variation
in the
rent payable, one assumes that there was no valid variation of the lease,
presumably because the formalities were not observed.
<P>

69	Secondly, if one were to assume that there was a contract arising out of the
court settlement (along the lines set out in para
62 above), could the tenant,
Taylor Farms, rely upon that contract in a claim by the landlord, Calkos,
before the Commercial Tribunal?
 The jurisdiction of the Tribunal ultimately
depends upon there being "a retail tenancy dispute" within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63(1).</a>  There is
such a dispute where, relevantly, the liability or obligation arises "in
connection with the use of the retail shop to
which the lease relates" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
63(1)).</a>  Given the subject matter of the contract, and the circumstances in
which it was made, do the obligations flowing from the contract
arise "in
connection with the use or occupation of the retail shop"?  It would obviously
be convenient if the Commercial Tribunal
were to have such jurisdiction.  It
could then determine the real issues which divide the retail landlord and
tenant.
<P>

70	Given the nature of the legislation, and the Second Reading speech, the
term, a "retail tenancy dispute", should not be given
a narrow construction.
Earlier, I stated my view that a claim for damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act 1987</a> did not come within the statutory definition of that term
(supra p 13, para 38).  The legislative history relating to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act 1987</a> was important in reaching that view.
<P>

71	However, where a contract between retail landlord and tenant (such as a
contract made in settlement of litigation relating to
the occupancy of the
premises) creates liabilities and obligations "in connection with the use or
occupation of the retail shop to
which the lease relates" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 63(1))</a>, then a
dispute concerning such liabilities and obligations is a "retail tenancy
dispute", and the Commercial Tribunal has jurisdiction.
<P>

72	The third possibility involves promissory estoppel.  The Deputy Chairman
characterised para 4 as pleading the defence of promissory
estoppel.  A
promissory estoppel would arise if Calkos made a clear and unequivocal promise,
or assurance, to Taylor Farms, which
was intended to affect the legal relations
between them, and to be acted upon, which Taylor Farms then did act upon (by
paying the
disputed arrears, and paying the reduced rent between June and
August 1996), such that Calkos should not be allowed to insist upon
the terms
of the lease.  Rather, Calkos must accept its legal relations with Taylor
Farms, subject to the qualifications which it
has introduced (see Halsbury 4th
ed, vol 16, p 931, para 1071).  The issue is whether the Commercial Tribunal
has jurisdiction to
entertain such a defence?
<P>

73	Neither the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act 1984</a>, nor the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>
specifically confer equitable jurisdiction upon the Tribunal.  However, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lraea1972263/" class="autolink_findacts">Law
Reform (Law and Equity) Act 1972</a> does confer limited equitable jurisdiction
upon inferior courts.  The Commercial Tribunal is, for the purposes of that
Act, an inferior
court (<b><i>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v
Consumer Claims Tribunal</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 473</a>, esp Hope JA at 477).  The
Act makes the following provisions:
<P>

	"6.	Every inferior court shall in every proceeding before it give such and the
like effect to every ground of defence, equitable
or legal, in as full and
ample a manner as might and ought to be done in the like case by the Supreme
Court under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act, 1970</a>.
<P>

	7.	This Act does not enlarge the jurisdiction of any court as regards the
nature or extent of the relief available in that court,
but any court may, for
the purpose of giving effect to sections 5 and 6, postpone the grant of any
relief, or grant relief subject
to such terms and conditions as the nature of
the case requires."
<P>

74	In a careful judgment, concerning the limitations upon the Commercial
Tribunal's jurisdiction, Deputy Chairman Rossiter in <b><i>Phillips v
Acsai</i></b> (unreported, Commercial Tribunal, 3 May 1996) said this:  (at p
9)
<P>

	"Unless there is complementary legislation conferring some form of equitable
jurisdiction upon the inferior court, as there is
in the case of the District
Court of New South Wales and the Magistrates' Courts in Victoria, no inferior
court may entertain a `defence'
which involves the award of an equitable
remedy.  For instance, in <i>Smedley v State Building Society</i>, Court of
Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Mahoney JA, 17 October 1990 unreported, the
Court of Appeal was of the view that a plea
raising breach of the duty owed by
a mortgagee to a mortgagor was not an equitable `defence' within the terms of s
6 <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lraea1972263/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Law and Equity) Act</i> 1972</a> and might, therefore, be outside
the jurisdiction of the District Court.  It is the view of Meagher, Gummow and
Lehane that the word
`defence' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lraea1972263/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lraea1972263/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Law and Equity Act)</i>
1972</a> is a reference to, for instance, an equity such as unclean hands or laches
<i>Equity Doctrines and Remedies</i> 3rd edition (1992) p 62.  The term
`defence' would also embrace, presumably, a plea of equitable set-off.  This
appears implied in
the reasoning of Jeffrey J in <i>West Street Properties Pty
Ltd v Jamison</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%202%20NSWLR%20435" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 2 NSWLR 435</a> at 441." 
<P>

75	See also <b><i>Henriksen v Bilpin Inn Pty Limited </i></b>(unreported,
Commercial Tribunal, 16 August 1996) at p 10.
<P>

76	Taylor Farms did not suggest that the Commercial Tribunal had jurisdiction
where it would be obliged to grant an equitable remedy
(injunction, specific
performance and declaration).  However, the issue was whether promissory
estoppel is a defence which necessarily
involved an equitable remedy.  Taylor
Farms contended that it did not.  Accordingly, there was, in its submission, no
inhibition
upon the Tribunal entertaining such a defence.
<P>

77	What, then, is the nature of promissory estoppel?  Counsel for Calkos
submitted that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is an
equitable defence
inextricably linked with the equitable remedies.  Since the Tribunal had no
power to grant such remedies, it had
no jurisdiction to entertain the
defence.
<P>

78	The foundation for the modern doctrine of promissory estoppel is, of course,
<b><i>Central London Property Trusts v Hightrees House Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%201%20KB%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 1
KB 130.</a>  During the war, the tenant could not afford to pay rent.  The landlord
agreed that, for the duration of the war, it would accept
a reduced rent.  The
landlord later sued for the full amount payable under the lease.  Lord Denning
determined that, in respect of
the period prior to the end of the war, the
promise made by the owner was binding, and that it should be held to that
promise.  He
commented:  (at 134)
<P>

	"The courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for
the breach of such a promise, but they have refused
to allow the party making
it to act inconsistently with it."
<P>

79	Promissory estoppel, as it became known, was used as a shield to defeat this
aspect of the landlord's claim.  No particular remedy
was called for.  In
<b><i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d88%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-88) 164 CLR 387</a>,
Mason CJ and Wilson J said this:  (at 400)
<P>

	"There has been for many years a reluctance to allow promissory estoppel to
become the vehicle for the positive enforcement of
a representation by a party
that he would do something in the future.  Promissory estoppel, it has been
said, is a defensive equity:
 <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%202%20AC%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) 2

<P>

80	Brennan J (as he then was), in the same matter, made the following remarks
about the nature of the remedy, where there was promissory
estoppel:  (at
419)
<P>

	"The element which both attracts the jurisdiction of a court of equity and
shapes the remedy to be given is unconscionable conduct
on the part of the
person bound by the equity, and the remedy required to satisfy an equity varies
according to the circumstances
of the case.  As Robert Goff J said in
<i>Amalgamated Property Co v Texas Bank</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20QB%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] QB 84</a> at 103:  `Of all
doctrines, equitable estoppel is surely one of the most flexible.'  Sometimes
it is necessary to decree that a party's
expectation be specifically fulfilled
by the party bound by the equity;  sometimes it is necessary to grant an
injunction to restrain
the exercise of legal rights either absolutely or on
condition;  sometimes it is necessary to give an equitable lien on property
for
the expenditure which a party has made on it:  see <i>Snell's Principles of
Equity</i>, 28th ed (1982) p 562.  However, in moulding its decree, the court,
as a court of conscience, goes no further than is necessary to
prevent
unconscionable conduct."
<P>

81	Mason CJ provided the following commentary upon that case, and the remedy
appropriate in promissory estoppel, in <b><i>Commonwealth of Australia v
Verwayen</i></b> (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 411:
<P>

	"So, in <i>Waltons Stores</i>, a majority of this Court concluded that
equitable estoppel entitled a party only to that relief which was necessary to
prevent unconscionable
conduct and to do justice between the parties.  Mason CJ
and Wilson J referred ((1988)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=164%20CLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">164 CLR 404)</a> to the statement of Scarman LJ in
<i>Crabb v Arun District Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20Ch%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] Ch 179</a> at 198, that the court
should determine what was `the minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff'.
We went on to state ((1988)
164 CLR at 405):  `Holding the representor to his
representation is merely one way of doing justice between the parties.'"
<P>

82	It is plain, therefore, that in many, if not most, situations, promissory
estoppel may involve remedies which the Commercial
Tribunal has no power to
grant.  However, it need not do so.  There are many examples in the cases where
promissory estoppel has
been used as a shield to defeat or moderate the
plaintiff's claim, and no equitable remedy has been necessary (<b><i>Central
London Property Trusts v Hightrees House Limited</i></b>;  <b><i>Commonwealth v
Verwayen</i></b>;  <b><i>Tasita Pty Limited v Sovereign State of Papua New
Guinea </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 691).</a>
<P>

83	Where a party does not seek a remedy, and merely seeks to use estoppel as a
shield, does the Commercial Tribunal have jurisdiction?
 The question admits no
easy answer.  One can envisage situations (and the facts in this matter may be
one illustration) where there
is a dispute between landlord and tenant
concerning some aspect of their arrangements, which is resolved informally by
the renegotiation
of a rent (as in <b><i>Hightrees</i></b>), where the landlord
represents that he will not insist upon his legal rights under the lease, and
gives certain assurances, which
the tenant relies upon to his detriment, and
thereafter the landlord brings an action claiming rent in accordance with the
lease.
 In such circumstances, the tenant may seek no more than the recognition
of the fact that the level of rent for which he is liable
is as promised,
rather than as set out in the lease.
<P>

84	However, I have some difficulty with the plaintiff's argument.  Promissory
estoppel is a flexible defence.  However, the court
has the ultimate
responsibility of fashioning a remedy which will do justice to the parties.  To
perform that function, the court
should have available the range of remedies
from which it can then choose.  It appears to me wrong in principle that a
party, in
an effort to give jurisdiction to a court with circumscribed powers,
should nominate one possible outcome, which the court is then
obliged to accept
or reject.  On balance, therefore, I believe that the Tribunal has no power to
entertain a defence based upon promissory
estoppel.
<P>

85	I believe, nonetheless, that in the course of the hearing, para 4 being
unclear, Counsel for Taylor Farms should have been invited
to identify the
precise issue which the defendant sought to raise, and to re-plead, in proper
form, that issue.  There are time limits
which apply to certain defences, and
striking out the pleading may effectively prevent a party from re-pleading an
issue which it
has, inexpertly, sought to raise.  There were, it seems to me,
within the particulars accompanying para 4, issues which were capable
(even
without resort to promissory estoppel) of amounting to a "tenancy dispute", in
respect of which the Tribunal would have had
jurisdiction.
<P>

86	In the absence of clarification, or a concession by Taylor Farms, that it
sought to raise promissory estoppel, and no more, I
do not believe that para 4
should have been struck out.
<P>

87	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I allow the appeal.
<P>

2.	I vary order 1 made by the Commercial Tribunal, so as to exclude para 4, and
vacate orders 2 and 3.
<P>

3.	I remit the matter to the Commercial Tribunal to redetermine the issues
arising under para 4.  Taylor Farms should have the opportunity
of re-pleading
para 4 so that the Tribunal can then determine whether it has jurisdiction to
deal with the issue.
<P>

4.	I reserve the question of costs.  Taylor Farms has ultimately succeeded upon
one aspect of the claim (although not an aspect
which it identified, in terms,
in the Statement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lraea1972263/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lraea1972263/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 5).</a>  I am inclined to think, subject to
further argument, that Taylor Farms should have one-third of its costs.
However, I give leave
to either party to relist the matter within 14 days to
argue the question of costs.  If, within that period, neither party does so,
my
order will be as above.
<P>
