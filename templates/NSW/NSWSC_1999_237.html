<b>4528/97	ALANBERT PTY LTD v BULEVI PTY LTD &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	I have heard argument concerning the costs of two motions in this matter,
each being an application by the third defendant, Elliot
&amp; Tuthill
(Mortgages) Pty Ltd, for an order that a caveat be withdrawn.  The caveats were
over two of the lots of a subdivision
which are in contention in these
proceedings between the plaintiff on the one hand and the first and second
defendants on the other
hand.  The third defendant was initially joined as
third defendant in the proceedings and there were, at that stage, claims by the
plaintiff that it had an interest in the land taking priority over the interest
of the third defendant as mortgagee thereof.  However,
those claims were
eschewed and the third defendant was dismissed from the proceedings at an early
stage.  It was subsequently rejoined
for the purpose of dealing with the
caveats the subject of this costs application.
<P>

2	The caveat concerned in the first application for withdrawal was caveat no
2785228, which was over both lots 11 and 12 in the
subdivision.  The interest
claimed in that caveat was in terms:
<P>

"as purchaser of the fee simple in possession pursuant to contract dated 2
March 1994 from Davhand Pty Ltd and Bulevi Pty Ltd."
<P>

On 22 October 1998 the third defendant gave the first and second defendants, as
proprietors of the land, the notice pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2B)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act 1900</a> ("the RPA") necessary to be given before power of sale is exercised.
It did not give notice, or a copy of the notice, to the plaintiff,
Alanbert Pty
Ltd, as the caveator.
<P>

3	The first ground on which the plaintiff sought to resist an order for costs
in relation to the first motion was that the occasion
for exercise of the power
of sale had not arisen because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> had not been complied with, since it had
not been given a copy of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> notice, which it said was required by the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2B)(1)(ii)</a> of the RPA.  However, to be entitled to a copy
notice under that section the caveator must be one:
<P>

"who claims as an unregistered mortgagee or chargee to be entitled to an estate
or interest in the land mortgaged or charged."
<P>

The plaintiff says that it was entitled to a mortgage interest in the property
as a result of the terms of the contract of sale
referred to in the caveat.  I
need not investigate whether this is so, because it seems to me that the claim
referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2B)(1)(ii)</a> must be a claim that appears on the face of the
caveat, and no claim as a mortgagee or chargee appears on the face of the
caveat.
 The plaintiff was, therefore, not entitled to notice of the caveat
and, once the notice given to the registered proprietors had
expired, the
occasion for sale had arisen.  At one stage the plaintiff suggested that it did
not know that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2B)</a> notice had been given to the registered proprietors,
but that suggestion was refuted by the tender of a letter dated 18 November
1998 from the third defendant's solicitors to the plaintiff which clearly
communicated the fact that such notice had been given.
<P>

4	However, the plaintiff also relies on a further basis in relation to the
costs of the first motion for withdrawal.  This is, that,
from some time in
November 1998 onwards, the third defendant and the plaintiff were in
negotiation for the sale of lot 12 to a person
associated with the plaintiff,
and, indeed, it was agreed between the parties, for the purposes of these costs
applications, that
Mr B O Bernoth, a brother of Mr Bernoth, the principal of
the plaintiff, did in fact enter into a contract to buy lot 12 on 23 or
24
December 1998 and that that contract was completed on 29 January 1999.  That
contract was at a price of $120,000.  It is not clear
at what point of time the
price of $120,000 was agreed on, but the negotiations were always on the basis
that Mr B O Bernoth would
pay a greater price than was offered by another
prospective purchaser of the lot, who had offered $110,000 for it.  The full
content
of the negotiations is not before me.  It is plain from what
correspondence is before me that the negotiations continued from some
time in
early or mid-November through to their successful issue just before Christmas.
There were various suggestions in submissions
as to whether or not requirements
made during the negotiations by the proposed parties to the contract that
various terms be included
in it were, or were not, reasonable.  The third
defendant took out the first motion for an order for withdrawal of caveat on 14
December
1998, and the motion first came before me on 17 December 1998.  On 23
December 1998 I ordered by consent that the plaintiff withdraw
the caveat by 4
pm on that day.  It is obvious that it was at about that time that the
negotiations came to final fruition and the
contract with Mr B O Bernoth was
exchanged.
<P>

5	The third defendant asks that the plaintiff be ordered to pay the costs of
the first motion on an indemnity basis.  It says that
the entire situation was
created by the mortgagor's default; that it was entitled to pursue its remedies
so long as that default
persisted; that the caveator had no right as against it
to maintain the caveat, and that it was quite unreasonable for the plaintiff
to
do so; and that the plaintiff would always obviously fail in the motion.  The
plaintiff says that it at all times, through Mr
B O Bernoth, had in the field
an offer for the purchase of the lot which was superior to the other offer;
that it would not, while
that offer was in the air, be reasonable for the
mortgagee to exchange contracts with the alternative purchaser at a lower
price;
and that it was not obliged, while that situation prevailed, to withdraw
the caveat so as to permit the lower offer to be accepted.
<P>

6	A mortgagor, who is under default under a mortgage, is in a fragile
situation.  That flows through to anybody making a derivative
claim through or
under that mortgagor.  Frequently orders for costs are made in favour of the
mortgagee in respect of enforcement
attempts, albeit enforcement action is not
ultimately taken by the Court.  But the situation is really rather different
here.  An
associate of the mortgagor was at the material times negotiating to
buy the mortgaged property at a better price than otherwise offered.
 First, I
am certainly not convinced that the mortgagee ought have costs on an indemnity
basis.  I do not think that there was any
unreasonableness in the plaintiff's
conduct that would justify that.  Furthermore, although the matter is perhaps
somewhat finely
balanced, I have come to the conclusion that there ought be no
order for costs in respect of the first motion at all in the circumstances
as I
have set them out.
<P>

7	The situation, however, is radically different in relation to the second
application for withdrawal of caveat.  That arose in
the following way.  A
replacement caveat was lodged by the plaintiff over lot 11 after the withdrawal
of the previously mentioned
caveat from lots 11 and 12.  It was contemplated at
the time the initial order for withdrawal was made that the plaintiff would be
entitled to lodge a fresh caveat claiming the same interest over the remaining
lot, lot 12.  However, a formal order was not, at
that stage, made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a>
of the RPA.  The matter of the second caveat was first agitated in Court before
me on 10 March 1999, when the plaintiff sought an
order that would overcome the
Registrar General's objection to the second caveat on the basis of the lack of
a formal <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a> order.  At that time there were negotiations proceeding again
between the plaintiff and the third defendant.  These were not, however,
negotiations regarding the destination of lot 11, but whether, and the terms on
which, the third defendant would transfer the mortgage
in respect of the
balance of the debt to the plaintiff or someone associated with it after funds
had come in on completion of the
sale of lot 11, which would reduce, but not
expunge, the moneys owing under the mortgage.  There was no question at that
time that
the plaintiff, or anyone associated with it, would buy lot 11 when it
was sold by the third defendant as mortgagee under power of
sale, as was quite
frankly and properly stated to the Court by Mr Fairbairn, of counsel for the
plaintiff, on the hearing of the
costs application.  That was not possible
because the plaintiff and his associates had "run out of money".  Whether or
not the third
defendant would, after the sale of lot 11, transfer the balance
of the mortgage to the plaintiff or some associate of his, had nothing
whatever
to do with whether lot 11 would be sold, or to whom.
<P>

8	I suggested in open Court, when the matter was before me on 10 March 1999,
that it might well not be worth the plaintiff's while
seeking to maintain the
caveat in view of the lack of any grounds to do so.  The plaintiff, however,
continued to maintain the caveat,
so that when the matter again came before me
on 12 March 1999, the third defendant, having at my invitation already notified
the
plaintiff that they would make such an application, sought and obtained
leave to file in Court that day a motion for the withdrawal
of the second
caveat and to move under that notice of motion for an order for its withdrawal.
Thereupon the plaintiff indicated that
it would consent to an order for
withdrawal of the caveat and an order was made.  Under those circumstances it
seems to me it was
quite unreasonable for the plaintiff to put the third
defendant to the costs of bringing the motion filed in Court on 12 March 1999.
It had at that time no right as against the third defendant to maintain the
caveat and there was no possibility that the withdrawal
would not be ordered.
In those circumstances, I propose to order that the plaintiff pay the third
defendant's costs of the notice
of motion for withdrawal of caveat filed on 12
March 1999 on the indemnity basis.
<P>

9	There are two further matters I should advert to.  The first is, that it may
be that the third defendant, as mortgagee, has a
right under the mortgage to
have its costs of the first motion from the mortgagor.  I do not say that it
does.  I do not enter into
that.  I regard that as quite irrelevant to my
determination, which is of the costs of a proceeding in the Court.  The order
that
I shall make will be made according to considerations arising from the
nature and conduct of those proceedings.  The other matter
that I should refer
to is that the first and second defendants did attend, at least to some degree,
upon a hearing of both notices
of motion.  They ask that they have their costs
of both motions from the plaintiff.  Obviously, from what I have said, I shall
make
no order in respect of their costs of the first motion.  Equally, whilst
they made some submission in relation to the second motion
for withdrawal, they
really were not parties to that motion.  Their participation was minimal and
for their own purposes, and I do
not think they should have in their favour any
order for the costs of the second motion.  There will be no order as to the
first
and second defendant's costs of the second motion for withdrawal of
caveat.
<P>

10	I now make orders in accordance with the short minutes initialled by me and
placed with the papers.
