<b>JUDGMENT (Interrogatories)</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:   In my judgment of 16 December 1998
(unreported) in the matter of<b> <i>Carney v Mack</i></b>, at the top of page 2
I indicated a view then held with respect, that there was a need to consider or
reconsider a series of decisions
by Justice Hunt in<b> <i>Howard &amp; Anor v
Nationwide News Pty Limited </i></b>(unreported, 26 February 1987); <b><i>
Lewis &amp; Anor v Page</i></b> (unreported, 18 July 1989)<b><i> </i></b>and
<b><i>Palmer v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 727.</a>
I am still of that view.
<P>

2   	There are outstanding judgments to be delivered by me on
interrogatory disputes that may or may not provide an occasion for
that
view.
<P>

3   	At about the time of my judgment in<b> <i>Carney v
Mack</i></b> the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in the<b> <i>New
South Wales Aboriginal Land Council v Perkins</i></b> now reported (1998) 45
NSWLR 340 which finally laid to rest the vexed question of what it was to which
comment was a defence.  The
result in that appeal, simplistically stated,
flowed from the following reasoning:  Comment is a defence;  it is a defence to
what?
the cause of action; what is the cause of action? the imputation.
<P>

4   	What at present is apparently the subject of some concern
is whether or not that defence provided by s 22 of the <i>Defamation Act</i> is
a defence to a cause of action, namely the imputation, or a defence to the
occasion of the publication of the matter that gives
rise to it, conformably
with the essence of the defence of qualified privilege at common law.
<P>

5   	Certainly the wording of s 22 points to the defence
focusing upon the matter published as distinct from the imputations conveyed
by
it.
<P>

6   	The relationship between defences in New South Wales and
the cause of action will again have to be the subject of consideration
in the
context of the defence of protected report in the light of the judgment of the
High Court in <b><i>Chakravati Advertisers Newspapers Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20154%20ALR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
154 ALR 294.</a>
<P>

7   	Arguably as a result of what fell from Brennan CJ and
McHugh J that the resolution of the question of whether the report was
a
protected one depended upon what was found to have been conveyed as a meaning
might well have an impact upon the resolution of
the issue as to that to which
s 22 applies.
<P>

8   	All this is said by way of introduction to a dispute in
relation to a series of interrogatories delivered by the plaintiff
to the
defendant in this action which is listed for call up early in July, which is
expedited, and which is likely to be given a
hearing date before the end of
this year.
<P>

9   	This case might in other circumstances constitute a vehicle
for resolving these outstanding issues after nearly a quarter 
of a century of
the operation of the <i>Defamation Act</i> of 1974. However conformably with
presently accepted doctrine my view is that the objections taken to
interrogatories 4, 5, 7 and
9 are well founded, but otherwise those
interrogatories should be answered as if they had been framed in the usual way
without reference
to "<i>imputations"</i> but with reference to the matter
published.   I direct the defendant to provide answers to those interrogatories
as if so framed
within 14 days of today.
<P>

10   	In relation to disputed answers to interrogatories 12 and
17, it is submitted for the defendant that the real issue is not
"<i>who did
it"</i> but "<i>what did the defendant do?"</i>  In this matter the defendant
has expressly stated that it took care to report accurately the material and
information it had in
its possession as part of its defence under s 22.  The
subject interrogatories clearly relate thereto, legitimately can be asked
in
addition to <b><i>Palmer</i></b> interrogatories.
<P>

11   	I direct that answers to 12 and 17 be provided within 14
days.
<P>

12   	I decline to order the defendant to answer interrogatory
14.
<P>

13   	(Compare the approach I adopted in<b> <i>Carney v
Mack</i></b> supra).
<P>

14   	Interrogatory 13 is said to be anchored in a claim in
relation to s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> <i>inter alia</i>, to what
is described as promotional material being appended to the Statement of Claim
as Schedule B. The objection taken to interrogatory
13 I am of the view is well
founded and the defendant is <i>not </i>be directed to answer it.
<P>

15   	An argument almost of inconsequential dimensions developed
in relation to the form of the answers provided by the defendant
pursuant to Pt
34 r 6. The objections were of a class provided for by the rules, and the basis
for making them enunciated in the
form of answer provided.  I do not consider
the defendant to have been in default.
<P>

16   	As to the application relating to the interrogatories it
seems to have turned out a draw and each party will pay its own costs.
<P>
