<b>JUDGMENT 12  (On admissibility of material in statement of Sgt
Buckley)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: 
<P>

1	Mr Stacey has given evidence of having seen the accused, Mr Kalache, push the
deceased and the accused Mr Sleiman then having
lunged at the deceased,
consistently with stabbing him.  He has also given evidence of having heard the
deceased shortly thereafter
saying that it was Mr Kalache who had done it.  It
was brought out in cross-examination that when interviewed by the police
immediately
following the event, Mr Stacey said nothing about that and gave an
account conveying that he had neither seen nor heard anything
of the kind.  It
was further brought out in cross-examination that it was only some seven months
later, on 20 December 1997, that
the witness gave the police the account of
events which he has given in evidence here.
<P>

2	The witness's explanation, of which the accused were on notice by the service
of statements, is that he was put in fear of his
own life and that of his
family, by things that happened immediately following the stabbing and
continued to happen thereafter. 
Those incidents were traversed, to some
extent, in cross-examination with a view to casting doubt on the witness's
contention that
he was truly put in fear of telling the police what he asserted
to be the truth.  I allowed re-examination over objection of the
accused as to
the detail of certain of the incidents on which the Crown wished to rely and as
to the effect which the witness said
the incidents had on him.
<P>

3	The evidence now sought to be led is evidence of conversations between Mr
Stacey and Sgt Buckley on 6 December 1997 and 13 December
1997.  The evidence
is contained in a statement by Sgt Buckley dated 15 March 1999, Exhibit P on
the voir dire.
<P>

4	For the reasons which follow, it would not matter whether the evidence were
given by Mr Stacey, Sgt Buckley or both.  It is convenient,
however' to note
the proposed evidence as it appears in Sgt Buckley's statement:
<P>

	"3.	I am a member of the Parramatta Golf Club and have been so for the past 10
years.  In December, 1997 I knew of another member,
Adam Stacey.  I also had
dealings with Adam in my role as a Police Officer attached to Parramatta Police
Station.  At that time Adam
was a security supervisor at the General Bourke
Hotel, Parramatta.  I had  a good rapport with Adam and his staff.
<P>

	4.	I remember, on Saturday, 6 December, 1997 Adam Stacey approached me in the
club house of the Parramatta Golf Club.  He said,
'Buck' (my nickname), 'can I
see you for a minute?'  I said, 'Adam, I have to leave, I'm in a hurry to get
home.  Is it important?'
 He said, 'Fuckin' oath it is, I've got huge dramas.'
I said, 'Mate, I'm really sorry but can it wait to next Saturday?  I'll be
here
the same time.'   He said, 'OK, I'll see you for sure.'  I said, 'No worries.'
I left the premises.
<P>

	5.	The following Saturday, 13 December 1997, I again saw Adam at the Golf Club
We went to a table and sat down.  I said, 'How can
I help you?'  He said,
'Buck, I can't handle it any more.  They're giving me heaps.'  I interrupted
and said, 'Hold on mate, what
are we talking about?'  He said,  'The Burton
murder.  The Lebs won't let me alone. Everywhere I go, they're there.  I go
shopping
with the missus in Westfield, they follow me.  They threaten me. They
hassle me.  I'm worried about the family, mate.'
<P>

	6.	I said, 'Why?  Why are they doing this?'  He said,  'Because of what I
know.  What I saw.'  I said, 'What did you see?'  He
said, after a long pause,
'If I give them up I'm a dead man.  You gotta understand, they mean business.'
I said, 'Look Adam, if you
want me to help you, you've got to be straight down
the line with me.  If you saw the murder, you've got a public duty to come
forward.
 If that's the case, we can help you.  We have systems in place to
protect you and your family.  Nobody will get to you.' He said,
'Buck, I saw
the lot.  I was in the beer garden out the back and saw the lot.'  I said, 'I
won't discuss the matter any more with
you.  That's for the detectives to sort
out.  I'll organise a meeting between Steve Morrisby and you.  I'm back at work
next week.
 Leave it with me.' The conversation concluded.
<P>

 
<P>

	7.	I had known Adam Stacey for some considerable time.  I had seen him in his
work at the General Bourke Hotel.  He has always
appeared to me to be a
sensible, laid-back person, not phased by pressure or stressful situations.  I
have seen him in potentially
violent situations outside the hotel dealing with
intoxicated and violent people.  He impressed me by the way he took charge of
the
situation, the way he dealt and spoke with unruly persons and the way he
appeared to control his emotions.
<P>

 
<P>

	8.	However, when speaking with him at the Golf Club, I noticed him to be on
edge, nervous and fidgety.  His demeanour was totally
in opposition to the
behaviour I have previously described."
<P>

5	The whole of that evidence is objected to.  
<P>

6	The proposed evidence includes the following elements or themes:
<P>

(a) 	     A social association between Mr Stacey and Sgt Buckley.
<P>

(b) 	     Mr Stacey's wish to speak to Sgt Buckley urgently.
<P>

(c)	Mr Stacey's anxiety over what he regarded as harassment  related to the
murder.
<P>

(d)	Mr Stacey's belief that if he told the police what he said he saw, he would
be killed.
<P>

(e)	The implication that Mr Stacey was looking to Sgt Buckley for guidance.
<P>

(f)	Sgt Buckley's advice to come forward and his assurance that Mr Stacey would
be protected if he did.
<P>

(g)	Mr Stacey's statement to Sgt Buckley that he had seen the murder from the
beer garden.  
<P>

7	There are broadly two categories in this evidence, although they overlap
considerably.  First, there is the statement by Mr Stacey
to Sgt Buckley that
Mr Stacey saw the murder from the beer garden and the context in which that
statement was made to Sgt Buckley.
 That evidence is proffered as a prior
consistent statement tending to rebut the attack on the credit of the witness
in his assertion
as to what he allegedly saw.  
<P>

8	The second category is evidence of Mr Stacey's fear of telling what he saw
and heard, as a result of the harassing incidents to
which he referred, and as
to how Mr Stacey came to tell the police what had occurred, notwithstanding.
That evidence is proffered
as evidence explaining the delay of seven months
which is relied upon by the accused as discrediting the witness' account of
events
given at that later time and in his evidence here.
<P>

9	The evidence in the first category, that is, the statement by the witness to
Sgt Buckley that he had seen the murder from the
beer garden, is admissible.
It is relevant and therefore admissible, unless otherwise inadmissible,
(<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></i>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 55</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">56</a>) because it tends to support the credit
of a witness which has been impugned.  The credibility rule (s 102) operates to
exclude the
evidence, subject to specified exceptions.  The exception in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108(3)</a> applies for the reasons which follow. 
<P>

10	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 108(3)</a> provides:
<P>

	"The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent
statement of a witness if:
<P>

		(a)	evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of 	the witness has been
admitted; or
<P>

		(b)	it is or will be suggested (either expressly or 	by implication) that
evidence given by the witness 	has been fabricated or
reconstructed (whether
deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a 	suggestion;
<P>

	and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent
statement." 
<P>

11	Paragraph (a) of subs (3) is attracted because it was adduced from Mr Stacey
in cross-examination that he had made a statement
immediately after the event
which was inconsistent with his evidence in chief as to what he allegedly saw
and heard. Paragraph (b)
of the subsection is attracted because fabrication of
the evidence in chief has been suggested. 
<P>

12	That raises the question of leave and I take leave to have been sought.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 192</a> provides as follows:
<P>

	"192. (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or
direction, the leave, permission or direction may
be given on such terms as the
court thinks fit.
<P>

	(2)	Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in
deciding whether to give the leave,  permission or direction,
it is to take
into account:
<P>

	(a)	the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to
shorten, the length of the hearing; and
<P>

	(b)	 the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness;
and
<P>

	(c)	the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission
or direction is sought; and
<P>

	(d)	the nature of the proceeding; and
<P>

	(e)	the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another
order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence."
<P>

13	In<b> </b><i>Graham</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 1491</a>, it was a ground of appeal that
the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of a statement by the complainant
in a sexual assault
case.  The statement was made six years after the last of
the acts alleged.  It was made in conversation with a flatmate when discussing
boyfriends.  Leave had not been sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 192.</a>  The trial judge was
not directed to the requirement for leave.  
<P>

14	In the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, the reasoning proceeded on
the basis of the statement was admissible pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 108(3)(b)</a> subject
to the question of leave.  Leave was held not to have been inevitable had it
been sought.  The appellant might, therefore,
have lost a significant chance of
acquittal.  It followed that the appeal should be allowed.  Callinan J, with
whom Gleeson CJ agreed,
also said that leave would not inevitably have been
given.  They allowed the appeal on this and other grounds.  
<P>

15	Some guidance as to how <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 192</a> could be applied in such a case may be
obtained from the following dicta in the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne
JJ (at 1493):
<P>

	"The exercise of the discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108</a> depends upon the effect of the
evidence on the witness's credibility: here, the suggestion of fabrication.
<P>

	How does the making of a complaint six years after the events bear upon that
question?  Unless the making of the complaint can
be said to assist the
resolution of that question, the evidence of complaint is not important (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
192(2)(c))</a> and would do nothing except add to the length of the hearing (cf
192(2)(a)).  And in this case, it is by no means clear that the
making of a
complaint six years after the event does assist in deciding whether the
complainant had fabricated her evidence.    
     			. . . . . . . . . . . . .
                                     	The complaint having been made in 1994,
and it having led
at once to the start of police investigations, it may be
doubted that a jury could gain assistance from its making in deciding whether
the complainant had fabricated her story."
<P>

16	The gist of this passage is that a late statement which is merely an
assertion of what is then given by the witness in evidence
has low probative
value.  It is unlikely to assist in resolving whether what the witness says in
his or her evidence is true.  Leave
might be refused on that account.  
<P>

17	That evidence may be adduced of statements before action pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
108(3)</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> <i>1995</a></i> in appropriate circumstances in
sexual assault cases cannot be doubted:  see <i>Hall </i>(CCA NSW, 28 February
1997, unreported)<i>, Foley </i>(CCA NSW, 5 June 1996, unreported)<i>, BD
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%20131" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 131</a><i>, DJT</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 22</a> and <i>Gillard and
Gillard </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 21.</a>  All that is really established by the dicta in
<i>Graham</i>, to which I have referred, is that leave is likely to be refused
where the statement is merely an assertion of what is then reasserted
in
evidence.  Mere repetition does not make the story unlikely to have been
fabricated.  The prior statement may not then be "important"
(see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 192(2)(c)).</a>

<P>

18	I would interpolate here a comment about the ordinary case of a police
statement in criminal proceedings or a proof of evidence
in civil proceedings.
Such a prior consistent statement would ordinarily be so devoid of value in
answering an earlier inconsistent
statement or in answering a suggestion of
fabrication as not to be arguably probative at all.  It would then not be
"relevant", and
would not be admissible on that account.  One would not come to
the application of the credibility rule in such a case, let alone
the
exceptions to it.  The evidence would be inadmissible at the anterior threshold
of relevance.  
<P>

19	The proposed evidence in the present instance is not mere prior assertion of
what was later said in evidence by the witness.
 There is the context in which
the statement was made to Sgt Buckley.  It would be open to a jury to accept
that this was a statement
made by a man, fearful of telling what he knew but
looking for a way to do so.  A statement made in that context would have a
probative
value beyond mere assertion, in advance, of what was later said in
evidence.  It could rebut the suggestion of fabrication.  
<P>

20	I have taken into account the considerations mentioned in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s192.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 192(2).</a>  Having
regard to the likely overall length of the trial, the evidence in Sgt Buckley's
statement would not add unduly to the length
of the hearing.  I do not
apprehend unfairness to the accused in admitting the evidence.  The evidence is
important for the reasons
I have mentioned.  In the exercise of my discretion I
grant leave pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(3).</a>  
<P>

21	I come then to the second category of evidence.  That is the evidence as to
how Mr Stacey came to tell the police what he says
he saw and heard,
notwithstanding his fear if he did so, proffered as an explanation for the
delay of seven months in doing so. 
It is, if accepted, the resolution of a
dilemma which had existed for that period of time, activated by an approach to
Sgt Buckley
for guidance and the advice and assurance that Sgt Buckley gave.

<P>

22	The evidence is admissible in re-examination, whether adduced from Mr
Stacey, from Sgt Buckley or from both.  Evidence which
explains adverse
evidence, adduced in cross-examination, is admissible in re-examination whether
adduced from the witness or from
some other source: <i>McLean v The
Commonwealth of Australia</i> (Sperling J, 27 June 1996, unreported).  It does
not matter that the evidence goes only to the credit of the witness, as this
does.
 Evidence in re-examination is an exception to the credibility rule: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
108(1).</a>  
<P>

23	It is submitted by counsel for Ms Cassar that I should not allow the
evidence because of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135(b)</a>, namely, that the probative
value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the
evidence might be misleading
or confusing.  It was observed in this submission
that the conversations with Sgt Buckley occurred only a week or so before Mr
Stacey
making the statement on 20 December 1997; secondly, that Mr Stacey's
statement to Sgt Buckley of what he saw was of a very limited
nature and not
plainly to the effect of the evidence which he gave here; thirdly, that the
evidence would be in the nature of the
witness corroborating himself.  
<P>

24	The evidence is not of low probative value for the reasons I have given. It
is important evidence in support of the credit of
Mr Stacey who is, as I
understand it, the Crown's only eye witness to what is alleged to have
occurred.  I do not believe that there
is any serious risk or danger that the
jury, properly directed, would be misled or confused about the significance
they would be
entitled to attach to it.  The evidence should not be excluded
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135(b).</a>  
<P>

25	For these reasons, the material in Sgt Buckley's statement may be adduced in
evidence.
