<center><b>REGINA v. GLENN TREVOR STAINES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>(On directed verdict of acquittal)</b> </center>
<P>

1  	GREG JAMES, J:  At the close of the Crown case, counsel for the
accused moved for a directed verdict of acquittal.  The Crown
did not concede
that such verdict should be directed but did make some significant concessions.
Those concessions included that,
in the evidence to which I will turn shortly,
there was raised self-defence in the sense that is referred to as a defence by
the
High Court of Australia in<b> Zecevic v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 645.</a>  That is, that the evidence established
that, in the physical dispute between the accused and the deceased, there was
material which
raised the possibility that the accused believed, on reasonable
grounds, it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did and that
what he
did did not exceed what he believed was reasonably necessary for the purpose of
defending himself.  But the bases upon which
the application was made went
further than the contention that the response was justified or excused by the
law of self-defence.
<P>

2  	Mr. Young, who appeared on behalf of the accused, put the
application on three bases, the first that the evidence in the case
did not
establish, in the circumstances in which the accused and the deceased were
engaged in the fight, an act causing death, in
this case, an act causing the
penetration of the deceased's heart by a knife used by the accused, was done
other than accidentally.
 That is to say, Mr. Young contended that the evidence
did not go further than establish the mere occurrence of that penetration
so
that it could not be found by the jury that the penetration was occasioned by a
willed or deliberate act in the sense spoken about
by Sir Garfield Barwick in
<b>Ryan v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20121%20CLR%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 121 CLR 205.</a>
<P>

3  	Mr. Young also contended that there was insufficient evidence to
establish, in the event that there was a willed act involving
the use of the
knife, an intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm with the knife.  Both of
those intentional states would be necessary
for the offence concerned to be
murder.  A further intentional state, that is, reckless indifference to the
taking of a human life,
while provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.18</a> of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a> was disclaimed by the Crown as being available in these circumstances
earlier on in the trial.  This is not surprising given the
reference in<b>
Zecevic</b> (supra) by the High Court at 662 in the judgment of the majority,
Wilson, Dawson and Toohey, JJ., that "recklessness may be put to
one side as
having no apparent relevance in the context of self-defence".
<P>

4  	For my own part, I am at a loss as to what their Honours meant,
since that minimal intentional state consistent with the crime
charged most
likely to be proved in the circumstances accompanying a striking, albeit for
the purpose of defending oneself, is an
adverting to the possibility or
probability of occasioning death but striking nonetheless to achieve the object
of personal security.
<P>

5  	Mr. Young contended on this second basis that, at the most, a
reckless disregard for the occasioning of grievous bodily harm
might be
established and that, in New South Wales at least, unlike at Common Law (see<b>
Crabbe v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 464)</a> it is insufficient to establish
murder.  Both counsel had, during the course of the trial, reviewed the
decision of the High Court
in<b> Cutter v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A. Crim. R.
152.</a>
<P>

6  	Mr. Young also put his submissions on the basis that the evidence
in the circumstances was incapable of rebutting the self-defence
that the Crown
evidence itself raised, if not established.
<P>

7  	Interestingly, in this case the evidence in the case was almost
entirely common ground.  The one doubtful element was in the
evidence from the
one eye witness who had the most continued presence at the scene of the
killing, Mr. Steengraver, whose evidence
it was conceded by the Crown, was
entirely partisan to such an extent that at the conclusion of his evidence the
Crown assented to
the proposition that a Jury would have to be directed in due
course that such evidence as he gave adverse to the accused might well
be
regarded by the jury as unreliable and would call for a direction under s.165
of<b> </b>the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.
<P>

8  	In response, the Crown put its position as really relying on the
use of excessive force by the accused, ie., more force than
he reasonably
believed was necessary to meet the exigency in which he believed he was placed.
It should be noted, when considering
questions of self-defence in murder that,
unless the Crown proves the intentional state necessary, that question of
self-defence
in one sense does not really arise.  However, it is almost
impossible to imagine the situation in which the intentional state should
be
considered separately and apart from the events that gave rise to the formation
of the intent and the purpose of the accused's
actions which are bound up in
that issue.
<P>

9  	If there was a killing committed intentionally by an accused
desiring the death of the person the accused intended to kill but
only because
that intent or desire had been formed in order to protect the accused against
the perceived necessity caused by a life-threatening
attack, the accused has
the defence of self-defence.  Indeed, when one refers to onus and standard,
when the matter is raised, it
is incumbent on the Crown to be able to point to
an hypothesis the jury could accept as rebutting all other inconsistent
hypotheses.
 So that where there is some evidence raising self-defence, for
guilt the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the
act was not
performed in the exercise of an attempt at self-defence.  That has been the law
in England at least since<b> Woolmington v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1935%5d%20AC%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1935] AC 462</a> and which in Australia,  has been considered to
be the law since before<b> Parker v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20111%20CLR%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 111 CLR 610.</a>
<P>

10  	Here then the evidence presents a problem in that, although
self-defence is raised and although it is the Crown evidence which
raises it
and although there appears to be no evidence by way of contradiction, it is
often said that one should proceed on a no
case submission disregarding such
evidence as might raise self-defence as that would be evidence by way of
qualification to which
regard should not be paid on an application of this
kind.  The test and the manner of its application is laid down in <b>The Queen
v. Doney</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 207.</a>
<P>

11  	It is, however, accepted in this case by the Crown and by the
defence that for me to undertake a course of attempting to winnow
out that
which might qualify other evidence led by the Crown to seek to detect a case
divorced from the evidence supporting self-defence,
would be artificial in the
extreme.  I agree.  The whole of the Crown case is entirely consistent as there
being a physical dispute
between the two in which the deceased was the initial
aggressor; the deceased at relevant times was on top of the body of the accused
and the Crown concedes it is unable to show that the accused did not believe,
on reasonable grounds (as he said to his wife when
overheard by the police)
that the deceased was attempting to kill him by choking him.
<P>

12  	In those circumstances, and taking the evidence as a totality,
the Crown has submitted that an analysis can be undertaken,
since there were
four wounds occasioned to the deceased which, based on the medical evidence of
Dr. Oettle would enable one to find
a particular sequence for those wounds so
as to elucidate whether there was an intent such as to make <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.18</a> of the<b>
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> applicable or alternatively, there was a continued progression
of blows of increasing force and gravity by the accused such as might
tend to
establish self-defence.
<P>

13  	The Crown has conceded that such an analysis, however, leaves it
really on the horns of a dilemma.  The Crown put it as suffering
from the
effects of a two-edged sword.  That is to say, that if the sequence does not
show an increasing progression of severity
of wounding, then there does not
seem to be a basis on which intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm,
absent self-defence, is
raised. Whereas, if there is an increasing progression,
so the Crown has conceded, that tends to support the proposition that there
was
such an intent but an intent inseparable from a desire to defend, oneself
reasonably based.
<P>

14  	The test, at the close of the evidence, has been expressed in<b>
Doney</b> (supra), by Glass, J. in his article in 51 ALJ "The Sufficiency of
Evidence for a Case to Answer" and in a circumstantial evidence
case, in<b> The
Queen v. JMR</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A. Crim. R. 39.</a>  That test requires that the Crown
evidence raise an hypothesis of guilt by evidence capable of establishing that
guilt beyond reasonable
doubt and that hypothesis be such that, although there
might be other hypotheses available on the evidence, a jury acting in
accordance
with its lawful function and in accordance with a proper direction,
can reject those other hypotheses.
<P>

15  	In this case the issue squarely enough turns on whether or not,
on this evidence, the Jury could reject the  hypothesis that
the accused acted
in self-defence in the sense of responding to a situation not of his making
which called for the use of force,
indeed deadly force, for him to protect his
own life and reasonably believing that such force might be necessary.  That is
whether
the situation was such that the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable
doubt that his resort to such force was not believed by him
to be reasonably
necessary.
<P>

16  	The question had been raised with counsel to consider last week
during the trial to afford counsel an opportunity to put considered
submissions
to me.  They have done so.  I have concluded that it would not be open to the
jury, if the matter was left to them, to
find the accused guilty of murder;
that it might have been open to the jury to have found an intent at least to
cause grievous bodily
harm; that it was open to the jury to find that the blows
that were struck were willed acts in the sense referred to in<b> Ryan
</b>(supra) but that if the jury accepted that there was an intent to kill or
cause grievous bodily harm, they could not have done so
by setting aside
self-defence.
<P>

17  	In those circumstances, I invited counsel to address me also on
whether there might be the alternative verdict of manslaughter
available.  The
Crown concedes that in those circumstances, if self-defence is available to a
charge of murder, then there is no
adequate basis on which manslaughter might
be left independently.
<P>

18  	I therefore determine that, on the evidence as it stands, the
proper course will be to direct the verdict of acquittal on the
basis I have
set out.
