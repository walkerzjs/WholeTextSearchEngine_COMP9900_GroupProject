<P>

<b>FRIDAY 9 APRIL 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>4013/98 PERMANENT TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED v THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Question</b>
<P>

1	The question for decision is whether a scheme should be established for the
administration cy-pr&eacute;s of one half of the estate
of Melbourne Earl
Siebert deceased in accordance with a general charitable intention, expressed
in his will, or whether there is
an intestacy in respect of that part of the
estate. 
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2	Melbourne Earl Siebert (the testator) died on 22 December 1992, having made a
will on 21 February 1950 which was admitted to probate
on 27 July 1993.  The
value of the one half share in question is about $107 000.  Clauses 3, 4 and 5
of the will deal with gifts
made to the wife, children and parents in law of
the testator, all of whom predeceased him.  As a result clause 6 of the will
comes
into operation.  It is as follows:
<P>

6. 	Should my said wife predecease me and no children of mine attain the age of
twenty one years and my said father-in-law and mother-in-law
dying before
entitled to a vested interest under this my will then I GIVE DEVISE AND
BEQUEATH the whole of my estate whether real
or personal and wheresoever
situate to the Spastic Centre of 6 Queen Street Mosman New South Wales and the
Margaret Reid Orthopaedic
Hospital Pittwater Road St.Ives New South Wales in
equal shares as tenants in common AND I DECLARE that the receipt of the
Secretary
or Treasurer for the time being of the said institutions shall be
sufficient discharge of all moneys paid under this my will and
also in this
event I APPOINT the Permanent Trustee Company of New South Wales Executor and
Trustee Company of this my will.
<P>

3	There is no problem with the gift of one half of the estate to the Spastic
Centre.  It is the remaining gift made to the Margaret
Reid Orthopaedic
Hospital (the Hospital) which is at issue in this case, because the Hospital
ceased to exist before the death of
the testator.  So a question arises as to
whether the gift lapses so that one half of the estate goes to the next of kin
on partial
intestacy, or does not lapse but is to be applied for purposes
similar to those carried on at the Hospital.
<P>

4	Before determining the legal character of the gift, it is necessary to
consider the nature of the hospital.  The evidence is that
there has never been
an institution called the Margaret Reid Orthopaedic Hospital, but there was for
many years an orthopaedic hospital
for children called the Margaret Reid Home
which was carried on by the New South Wales Society for Crippled Children (now
the Northcott
Society).  That organisation also conducted and still conducts
the Spastic Centre at Mosman. It is perfectly clear that the description
in the
will is a reference to the Margaret Reid Home. It was accepted that the same
"hospital" was considered by Hope JA in <b><cite>Attorney-General for NSW v The
Public Trustee  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 550</a></cite></b>.  In his judgment,  Hope JA sets
out the history of the Margaret Reid Orthopaedic Hospital, which is accepted by
Mr.Benson, the Secretary
for the Northcott Society, and is as follows:
<P>

"The New South Wales Society for Crippled Children (the Society) was
incorporated on 5 August 1930.  The objects of this Society
as set out in its
memorandum of association are charitable in nature.  The objects include the
assisting and providing for the medical,
educational and vocational needs of
crippled and handicapped children, including the provision of facilities to
meet these needs.
 The functions carried out by the Society include conducting
hospitals and nursing homes for orthopaedically handicapped children,
sheltered
workshops, special schools, welfare therapy and orthopaedic appliances.  In
pursuance of its objects the Society established
the Margaret Reid Orthopaedic
Hospital (the Hospital) at Mona Vale Road, St Ives, to care for orthopaedically
handicapped children
and to provide for the accommodation and education of
school-aged disabled children.  The Hospital was administered by the Society's
Board of Directors.  It did not have any separate administrative supervision.
It did not own any assets independently of the Society
and was funded by a
maintenance subsidy paid by the Health Commission of New South Wales and as
regards capital expenditure by the
funds of the Society.  On 19 February 1981
the Board resolved to close the Hospital for a variety of reasons including the
cutting
off of subsidies by the Health Commission.  The Hospital closed on 30
June 1981 and in the following year its premises were sold
by the Society.
<P>

<b>The Gift as a Direct/Absolute Gift or as a Charitable Trust</b>
<P>

1	The preliminary question to be determined is whether the gift is an outright
gift to the Hospital or whether it constitutes a
charitable trust for the
purposes of the Hospital.  <b><cite>In Attorney General of NSW v The Public
Trustee</cite></b>, Hope JA in considering a bequest to the same named
Hospital, found that it was a gift to the legal entity conducting the Hospital,
namely, the Society, for the general purposes of the Hospital (553).  However,
the gift there was to the Margaret Reid Hospital for
" the general purposes
thereof" (551).  Counsel for the Attorney General relied on the reasoning of
Hope JA in this case to argue
that  in the present case the gift was one for
the general purposes of the Hospital, focusing in particular on the matters
which
Hope JA considered to be most relevant to this point and applying them to
the present case: (1) As all the people named in the will
predeceased the
testator, the whole of the testator's estate has been applied to charity, (2)
the hospital was not a legal entity
and was merely a place where certain
charitable purposes were carried out, being purposes of the society, (3) that
where the receipt
is to be paid to the Secretary or Treasurer, on the evidence,
it could be no other person than the Secretary or Treasurer of the
Society, (4)
finally both charities named by the testator in his will were concerned with
handicapped children. 
<P>

6	Counsel for the plaintiff, who took a more positive and assertive stance than
is usual for counsel for a trustee in a construction
suit, argued that
<b><cite>Attorney General v Public Trustee</cite></b> should be distinguished
because in  the present case, the testator has not used the words "for the
general purposes thereof" and
an address was given for the hospital. This
argument would not carry the day.  In <b><cite>Sydney Homoeopathic Hospital v
Turner <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20102%20CLR%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 102 CLR 188</a> at 220-21</cite></b>, Kitto J stated in the context
of a bequest to an unincorporated association which operated a hospital, that:

<P>

"There is, I think a strong implication of an intention that, through the
medium of the unincorporated association, the relevant
income should be devoted
to the purposes which that association announced by its rules and was serving
by carrying on its hospital."
 
<P>

	He then goes on to say: 
<P>

Not, of course, that a trust arises in every case of a gift to a body
established for limited objects.....But if the objects of
a body are limited to
altruistic purposes, it is as an instrument of altruism that it is likely to
attract benefactions.  Very often,
to say the least, it will be a proper
inference, when a gift is made to such a body, that the donor intends the gift
to operate as
a devotion of the subject property to the relevant purposes, and
that the donee accepts it as such.  Where that is the case all the
elements
necessary for the creation of a binding trust are present.  Accordingly a gift
which would be invalid unless it operates
to create a charitable trust may be
upheld because when the objects of the body which is the donee are taken into
consideration,
an inference arises that the gift is upon trust for charitable
purposes.
<P>

The objects of the Hospital are clearly charitable in nature, and an inference
should I consider be drawn that the gift was one
for the purposes of the
hospital, thus constituting a valid charitable trust.
<P>

<b>Is there a General Charitable Intention?</b>
<P>

7	Having decided the gift constitutes a valid charitable trust, it is necessary
to ascertain what type of charitable intention the
testator had when making the
gift.  If there is a gift to a particular body for its purposes, the gift must
lapse; if there is evidence
of a general charitable intention but the gift
would otherwise fail then a cy-pr&eacute;s scheme should be ordered which
fulfils
as closely as possible the testator's charitable intention. The
distinctions were considered in <b><cite>Re Tyrie deceased (No 1) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1972/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] VicRp 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20VR%20168" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] VR 168</a>
at 177-8</cite></b> by Newton J who held that there were three exceptions to
what he called "the lapse rule", that is that "a gift by will to a particular
charitable institution...which at some time existed, but had ceased to do so in
the testator's lifetime ... ordinarily lapses". 
He held that one such
exception was where the testator had a dominant intention to benefit purposes
of the kind which the named institution
carried out, then the gift will be so
applied by means of a cy-pr&eacute;s scheme. 
<P>

8	I consider that there was a general charitable intention.  The fact that both
charities named in the will were concerned with
handicapped children, and there
being no evidence showing the testator to have had any particular association
with the Margaret Reid
Orthopaedic Hospital supports this; it also enables the
present case to be distinguished from cases such as <b><cite>Re:  Slatter's
Will Trusts</cite></b> [1964] 1 Ch512 where the testatrix made a bequest to a
hospital which had ceased to exist at the time of her death, the daughter
of
the testator having been a frequent patient in that hospital.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act</a></b>
<P>

9	Once it has been concluded that there is a charitable trust the relevant
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act 1993</a>  really determine the matter.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10</a> of that Act is as follows: 
<P>

<b>Requirement for general charitable intention of donor </b>
<P>

10.
<P>

(1)	This Part does not affect the requirement that trust property can not be
applied cy pres unless it is given with a general charitable
intention. 
<P>

(2)	However, a general charitable intention is to be presumed unless there is
evidence to the contrary in the instrument establishing
the charitable
trust.
<P>

There is no contrary evidence and therefore the statutory presumption
applies.
<P>

10	It follows that the court should direct that a scheme for the administration
of the trust be ordered which would enable the general
purposes of the trust to
be fulfilled as closely as possible.  Counsel for the Attorney General argued
that in those circumstances
the establishment of such a scheme it should be
referred to the Attorney General to establish the scheme pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13(2)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act</a>.  
<P>

11	I consider this to be the most appropriate course of action which would save
further costs being incurred as the fund involved
is quite small.  This would
be consistent with the purpose of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act</a> which seeks to
provide a mechanism for the administrative establishment of cy-pr&eacute;s
schemes by the Attorney General where the
value of the trust funds is less than
$500 000.
<P>

12	The appropriate declarations and orders are therefore as follows:
<P>

<b>Declarations:</b>
<P>

1	A declaration that there is no body in existence answering the description
"Margaret Reid Orthopaedic Hospital, Pittwater Road,
St. Ives" in Clause 6 of
the will of Melbourne Earl Seibert, made 21st February 1950.
<P>

2.	A declaration that the gift by the testator to the Margaret Reid Orthopaedic
Hospital evidenced a general charitable intention.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

1.	Order the amount of the gift by applied cy-pr&eacute;s.
<P>

2.	Order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act 1993</a> that it be referred
to the Attorney General to establish a scheme for the administration of the
charitable trust.
<P>

3.	Order the costs of all parties be paid out of the fund, those of the
plaintiff on the trustee basis.
<P>

I certify that paragraphs <b>1 to 11</b> are a true copy of the Reasons for
Judgment given by Mr Justice Windeyer in matter <b>4013/98 Permanent Trustee
Company Limited v Attorney General of the State of New South Wales &amp;
Ors.</b>
