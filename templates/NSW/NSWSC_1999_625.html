<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	In this matter the Administrator of the First and Second
Plaintiff seeks directions on an entirely novel situation so far as
case law is
concerned. This is, speaking very generally, as to whether the Administrator is
justified in not taking account in his
administration, of two statutory regimes
applicable only once winding-up begins, to reinsurance liabilities within and
outside Australia.
These directions are sought pursuant to s447D of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> which is to be found in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/index.html#p5.3a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.3A.</a> The directions are in
terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Summons of 21 June 1999, namely:
<P>

"1.	In carrying on the business and managing the property and affairs of the
First Plaintiff the Third Plaintiff as the duly appointed
Administrator is
justified in not taking into account the following matters:
<P>

(a)	the rights of any claimant in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 116(3)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Act</i> 1973</a>.
<P>

(b)	the rights of any claimant under a contract of reinsurance to be paid an
amount in respect of the relevant contract of insurance
or relevant contracts
of insurance in accordance with section 562A of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2.	In carrying on the business and managing the property and affairs of the
Second Plaintiff the Third Plaintiff as the duly appointed
Administrator is
justified in not taking into account the following matters:
<P>

(a)	the rights of any claimant in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 116(3)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Act</i> 1973</a>.
<P>

(b)	the rights of any claimant under a contract of reinsurance to be paid an
amount in respect of the relevant contract of insurance
or relevant contracts
of insurance in accordance with section 562A of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>."

<P>

<b>DIRECTIONS SOUGHT</b>
<P>

3   	Essentially what is sought is a direction that the
Administrator is justified, in circumstances where winding up is not yet
conceived as inevitable in not taking into account certain statutory provisions
in any dealings by the Administrator. These statutory
provisions are only after
winding up is begun or a liquidator appointed, as follows: 
<P>

(a)	after the relevant insurance business "is begun to be wound up" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s116(3)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Act</i> 1973</a> (Cth) precludes the discharge of non-Australian
liabilities prior to discharge of all Australian liabilities and may override
any
State or Territory law to the contrary, and
<P>

(b)	where a liquidator has been appointed and reinsurance liabilities arise,
s562A of the <i>Corporations Law</i> requires, speaking generally, that
reinsurance amounts received be applied to the corresponding liability and so
that in the event
of a shortfall, application is rateably between such
liabilities, subject to the possibility of an order to the contrary by
reference
to certain statutorily specified matters.
<P>

4   	The Administrator of the two Plaintiffs who carry on
reinsurance business is not able at this point to conclude one way or
the other
as to whether those companies will be wound up or instead may be resuscitated
following a deed of company arrangement if
one proves feasible. The
Administrator recognises that his duty, acting as he does in substitution for
the board of directors in
a company which is, or is likely to become insolvent
(s436B) though at present not inevitably so as salvage remains a possibility
under a DCA, is to have regard to the interests of the creditors as a whole and
not act contrary to them nor act other than impartially
as between creditors
(see <i>Re Spargold Enterprises Pty Limited: ex parte Geoffrey David McDonald
&amp; Anor</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/623.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 623)</a>, in entering into commutation and other
arrangements of the kind described generally in his affidavit of 17 June 1999.
It is apparent
that those arrangements may in some respects produce a different
outcome than from the statutory regimes that would apply were the
two
Plaintiffs now to be wound up; see 3 above. This will be simply as a result of
the beneficial conduct of the administration in
which, acting impartially as
between creditors in the interests of the companies and their creditors as a
whole, debts may be compromised
or commuted or other dealings made.
<P>

5   	Were the Administrator precluded from entering into these
arrangements, creditors as a whole would be disadvantaged, undermining
the very
purposes of the administration, reflected in s435A of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>. In circumstances where a winding up <i>was</i> imminent, or where
there was a deliberate attempt to reorganise a company's assets so as to
achieve a result diametrically opposed
to that of the statutory regimes
post-winding-up, it may be that the Administrator's duty could not be expressed
in unqualified terms
to the effect that the Administrator would be justified in
disregarding those statutory regimes. However I do not need to determine
that
issue at this stage. I simply note that the Administrator has recognised that,
should a winding up become imminent, it would
seek further directions. He has
also confirmed, through Counsel, that there is no intention to reorganise the
assets in the manner
I have described.
<P>

6   	I should note in passing that the provisions concerning
insolvent transactions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/index.html#p5.6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.6</a>, insofar as they relate to "unfair
preferences" or "uncommercial transactions" prior to the relation back day,
would not be applicable
to the Administrator having regard to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s9</a> in its
definition of "relation back day" and the relevant provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/index.html#p5.6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.6</a>
including s513C.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

7   	The present application is made in the absence of
precedent, though the guiding principles are clear enough. There are presently
no binding statutory provisions precluding the transactions which the
Administrator has in mind, as described in general terms in
his affidavit of 17
June 1999. Until such time as winding-up begins, or perhaps, is imminent, the
Administrator is simply bound by
the same general law obligation as would its
displaced board, being of a company which faces the prospect of insolvency
albeit not
yet imminent, namely: to act in the interests of the relevant
companies and, thus not to act contrary to the interests of creditors
as a
whole and to act as between creditors impartially for the benefit of creditors
as a whole. When insolvency does become imminent,
the matter must be
reviewed.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

8   	I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the
Plaintiffs' Summons of 21 June 1999, such orders to be read in the context
of
my earlier reasons including the need for further directions in the
circumstances there referred to.
