<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	By a Summons issued on 28 January 1999 the plaintiff, for which Mr M.J.
Slattery of Queen's Counsel and Mr G.A. Seib of Counsel
appeared, sued the
defendants, for which and whom Mr I.M. Jackman of Counsel appeared, seeking
declaratory relief in relation to
three agreements whereby the plaintiff
asserted that it was appointed the first defendant's exclusive agent in
Australia and New
Zealand for the distribution of the first defendant's
computer software containing games played on computer screens.  The agreements
were identified as the General Distribution Agreement, the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.  The
Summons also formulated
claims for relief based on the type of estoppel found in <b>Waltons Stores
(Interstate) Limited v Maher</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387</a>; breach of fiduciary duty
and breaches of the provisions of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> and the
<b>Fair Trading Act</b>, ("the Acts").
<P>

2	It was pleaded that the plaintiff is incorporated in Australia and that the
first defendant is incorporated in the United Kingdom.
 The evidence
established that the plaintiff carried on business of importing and
distributing computer software for home entertainment
purposes in Australia and
New Zealand, and that the defendant carried on business in England of supplying
and selling computer software
for home entertainment purposes, inter alia, to
its distributors.  The second defendant was, at all material times, a senior
executive
of the first defendant. 
<P>

3	By a Notice of Motion filed on 26 March 1999, which was subsequently amended
by an Amended Notice of Motion filed on 29 April
1999, the defendants sought
orders pursuant to Part 11 rule 8 that service of the Summons be set aside "in
whole or in part"; that
the proceedings be stayed in so far as they contain the
allegations in paragraphs 7 to 12, 15 to 17, 38 to 41, 44 to 51, and 59 of
the
Plaintiff's Contentions relating to the "general distribution agreement"; that
the proceedings be stayed generally; and for ancillary
relief.
<P>

4	By a Notice of Motion filed on 19 April 1999 the plaintiff sought leave to
proceed pursuant to Part 10 rule 2.  The plaintiff
accepted that such leave
could only be granted if at least one or more of the causes of action pleaded
had the jurisdictional nexus
with this State required by Part 10 rule 1A,
although it did not accept, notwithstanding a line of authority concerning the
"tacking"
of causes of action which did not have such a nexus, that it had to
establish that all causes of action pleaded had to fall within
one of the
sub-rules of Rule 1A.  Its submission was that provided one or more of the
causes of action had the required jurisdictional
nexus other causes of action,
which did not, could be relied on, particularly if they arose out of the same
basic factual matrix.
<P>

5	When the motions came on for hearing Counsel agreed it was convenient to hear
the plaintiff's motion first.  The plaintiff relied
on the affidavit of its
managing director, Mr David Mendels, sworn 23 April 1999, the exhibits thereto
becoming Exhibit A.  The defendants
relied on the affidavit of their solicitor,
Ms Ann Louise Donohue, sworn 25 March 1999.  No objection was taken to the
affidavits,
and neither of the deponents was required for cross-examination.
<P>

6	The defendants' basic submissions were that a number of causes of action
pleaded in the Summons did not have the jurisdictional
nexus necessary to
satisfy Part 10 rule 1A; that causes of action which did not have that nexus
could not be "tacked" onto those
which did; that the plaintiff had not
established that the causes of action which did have the necessary nexus were
sufficiently
likely to succeed; and that the General Distribution Agreement
expressly provided not only a "choice of law" clause, but also a "choice
of
court" clause, which gave the English High Court of Justice exclusive
jurisdiction.  Clause 10.1, which it was agreed could have
been worded better,
states:-
<P>

	<b>"This agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with UK
laws and Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the High Court
of Justice in AJA."</b>
<P>

The difficulty in wording was, firstly, the reference to "in AJA".  It was
submitted that this was a patent error, the obvious intention
of the parties
being that the jurisdiction was conferred on the English High Court of Justice.
There are a number of reasons why
I consider this submission should be
accepted.  Secondly, there is some problem about the subject matter of the
disputes to be heard
pursuant to that clause.  In my opinion, the clause covers
all disputes arising out of the agreements.
<P>

7	The General Distribution Agreement was the first into which the parties
entered.  It was part of the plaintiff's case that at
least certain of its
terms were implied into the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement.  It was
submitted by the defendants that the
choice of court provision was also implied
into that agreement and the Purchase Agreement, so that all disputes, at least
in relation
to the three agreements, were to be heard in the English High Court
of Justice.
<P>

<b>The Burden Of Proof On The Plaintiff</b>
<P>

8	In <b>The News Corporation Limited v Lenfest Communications Inc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2021%20ASCR%20553" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 21
ASCR 553</a> Giles J gathered together the authorities on the onus the plaintiff
must discharge to persuade the Court that it has jurisdiction
pursuant to the
sub-rules to Rule 1A: p.557.  His Honour continued:-
<P>

	<b>"To what does that extend?  It clearly includes the burden of establishing
that the Rules authorise service of the summons outside
Australia, but the
position is less clear so far as Lenfest asked the Court to decline to exercise
jurisdiction on forum non conveniens
grounds or on more general discretionary
grounds."</b>
<P>

9	Subsequently, at p.557, his Honour confirmed that where there are multiple
claims, each must come within one or more of the paragraphs
of Rule 1A(1) and,
at p.558, he continued:-
<P>

	<b>"For present purposes the standard of proof required of News is
sufficiently expressed in terms of the prima facie or arguable case,
but
bearing in mind, as noted by Rogers J in <i>Pendal Nominees Pty Limited v M
&amp; A Investments Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20383" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 383</a> at 394-5, that `where
the apparently qualifying condition for service is an issue that will not
thereafter be reagitated, one may
well look for a greater degree of assurance
than in a case .. where the question will not only be argued at the hearing but
will
be the ultimate issue'.  I have considered how the standard of proof might
be satisfied in <i>Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Wordplex Information
Systems Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 146</a> and <i>Williams v Lips-Heerlen BV</i>,
building upon <i>Pendal Nominees</i> .., but a prima facie or arguable case is
still required: <i>Bank of America v Bank of New York</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20ATPR%2041%2d390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) ATPR 41-390</a> at
40,340, 40,341."</b>
<P>

Thus, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie or arguable case and, in
<b>C.E. Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Limited &amp; Anor v
Barden &amp; Ors</b> (Rolfe J - 19 October 1994 - unreported), I said, at
p.1:-
<P>

	<b>"On such an application the plaintiffs have the onus of establishing that
the causes of action pleaded have at least one jurisdictional
nexus demanded by
Part 10 rule 1A and that in respect of those causes of action the evidence
shows a prima facie or arguable case."</b>
<P>

I referred to the authorities and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"In so far as it may be thought that `arguable' provides for a higher test
than `prima facie' I prefer `prima facie'.</b>
<P>

10	I do not have to concern myself with forum non conveniens grounds because Mr
Jackman expressly conceded that if I came to the
view that the plaintiff had
established a jurisdictional nexus, it could not be said that this Court is a
clearly inappropriate forum.
 In relation to the "choice of court" provision
the question of onus arises if it is found that the English High Court of
Justice
has been invested with jurisdiction by the parties' agreement.  Mr
Jackman submitted that the plaintiff had not established the strong
grounds
necessary to exercise the discretion to override that provision.
<P>

11	In <b>Akai Pty Limited v People's Insurance Co Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20126%20FLR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 126 FLR
204</a>, the Court of Appeal held that the proper exercise of discretion in such a
case required that a stay should be granted, if such a
clause existed, unless
strong cause for not doing so was shown by the party bringing proceedings in
another court, the burden of
proving such a cause being on that party, namely
the plaintiff in the present case. Although Kirby P dissented in the ultimate
result,
I do not understand his Honour to have taken a different view on this
point. The Court of Appeal's decision was reversed by the High
Court: <b>Akai
Pty Limited v People's Insurance Co Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20188%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 188 CLR 418</a>, but this
part of its judgment was not, as I understand it, overruled.  In that case the
relevant clause provided:-
<P>

	<b> "Governing Law</b>
<P>

<b>	This policy shall be governed by the laws of England.  Any dispute arising
from this policy shall be referred to the Courts of England."</b>
<P>

The respondent sought a stay, which O'Keefe CJCommD granted, and which decision
the Court of Appeal, by a majority, upheld.  In
the High Court the majority,
Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, stated that the appeal turned on the proper
construction of the <b>Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a></b> 1984 (Cth), and concluded
that the second sentence of clause 9 was rendered void by the terms of that Act
and thus determined the
appeal on that basis.  At p.444 their Honours accepted,
as I understand it, the more general proposition relating to "choice of court"
clauses in the absence of a specific statutory provision and, after referring
to the judgment of Fullagar J in <b>Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes v
Wilson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/62.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 62</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2094%20CLR%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 94 CLR 577</a>, continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The stay in the present case was sought essentially in aid of such an
implied negative stipulation that no other Court has jurisdiction
to determine
disputes.  This stipulation, which may be described as a foreign jurisdiction
clause, does not operate to exclude the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of
New South Wales, although it may constitute a ground for that Court to refuse
to exercise its
discretion."</b>
<P>

The footnote to that statement included a reference to <b>Wilson</b> and
<b>Ocean Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 197.</a>
<P>

12	The minority, Dawson and McHugh JJ, said, at pp.424-425:-
<P>

	<b>"A choice of law clause does not constitute a submission to the
jurisdiction of the courts of a chosen legal system.  A choice of
courts clause
does.  The second sentence or part of clause 9 is clearly a choice of courts
clause.  The question then arises whether
it constitutes a submission to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts which it specifies."</b>
<P>

13	Their Honours considered that question was determined by a construction of
the clause and irrespective of whether the word "exclusive"
was used.  They
held that the "choice of court" clause amounted to a submission to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.
 They referred to various
authorities demonstrating that "the law has always been solicitous that when
parties do contract to submit
their disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of another country they should be held to their bargain": p.427:
<b>Huddert Parker Limited v The Ship "Mill Hill"</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1950/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2081%20CLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 81 CLR 502</a> and
<b>Oceanic Sun Line</b>.  This led them to refer to the requirement that if
there was an agreement as to the choice of court, it will require strong
reasons
before the Court will not enforce the bargain, although a discretion
remains to refuse a stay "if sufficient cause is shown".
<P>

<b>The Proper Construction Of Clause 10.1</b>
<P>

14	Clause 10.1was drafted in England by the first defendant, or those acting on
its behalf, as part of a draft Distribution Agreement.
 It was furnished to the
plaintiff in circumstances in which Mr Slattery contended that the first
defendant was seeking an offer
from the plaintiff as to the basis of which the
plaintiff was prepared to deal with it.  Mr Slattery submitted that the
execution
of the last page of this draft by Mr Mendels on 15 November 1996 and
the return of that page to the first defendant constituted the
offer, but that
clause 10.1, essentially because of the words "in AJA", was meaningless.
<P>

15	There is no doubt that the draft was intended to record, at least, the terms
of an agreement between the first defendant and
the plaintiff.  It clearly
provided by the choice of law clause that the applicable law was English or
United Kingdom law.  In my
opinion there can be no doubt that the choice of
court provision related to the English High Court of Justice. The words "the
High
Court of Justice", in the context not only of clause 10.1 but of the whole
draft agreement, clearly refer to the English High Court
of Justice and the
additional words thereafter add nothing to it.  As a matter of construction
they are superfluous and, in my view,
should be ignored.
<P>

16	In <b>Fitzgerald &amp; Anor v Masters </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2095%20CLR%20420" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 95 CLR 420</a> at pp.426-427,
Dixon CJ and Fullagar J dealt with a somewhat similar problem.  Their Honours
said:-
<P>

	<b>"There is a superficial difficulty in clause 8 because it purports to
incorporate a set of conditions so far as they are inconsistent
with what has
been specifically agreed upon.  No real difficulty, however, is created.  Words
may generally be supplied, omitted
or corrected, in an instrument where it is
clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity of inconsistency.  Here it would
be indeed
absurd to suppose that the parties having expressed their agreement
on a number of special and essential matters, should intend to
incorporate by
reference terms inconsistent with what they had specially agreed upon.  What
they must clearly have intended is to
incorporate a set of general conditions
except so far as they were inconsistent with what they had specially agreed
upon, and clause
8 must be read as if it said `consistent' or `not
inconsistent'."</b>
<P>

17	In <b>Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right
Association Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a>, at p.109, Gibbs J said, in a passage
often relied on:-
<P>

	<b>"It is trite law that the primary duty of a court in construing a written
contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the
parties from the
words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied.  Of course the whole
of the instrument has to be considered,
since the meaning of any one part of it
may be revealed by other parts, and the words of every clause must if possible
be construed
so as to render them all harmonious one with another.  If the
words used are unambiguous the Court must give effect to them, notwithstanding
that the result may appear capricious or unreasonable, and notwithstanding that
it may be guessed or suspected that the parties intended
something different.
The Court has no power to make or amend a contract for the purpose of avoiding
a result which is considered
to be inconvenient or unjust.  On the other hand,
if the language is open to two constructions, that will be preferred which will
avoid consequences which appear to be capricious, unreasonable, inconvenient or
unjust `even though the construction adopted is not
the most obvious, or the
most grammatically accurate' ..."</b>
<P>

18	In <b>Continental Bank NA v Aeakos Compania Naviera SA &amp; Ors </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20WLR%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994]
1 WLR 528</a>, at 592, Steyn LJ said:-
<P>

	<b>"But what disputes does it cover?  The answer is not to be found in the
niceties of the language of clause 21.02.  It is to be found
in a commonsense
view of the purpose of the clause.  We are emboldened to adopt this approach by
the observation of Lord Diplock
in <i>Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen
Rederierma AB</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] AC 192</a>, 201:</b>
<P>

<b>	`if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial
contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business
commonsense, it
must be made to yield to business commonsense'.</b>
<P>

<b>	The only sensible construction of clause 21.02 is that it is a submission
of disputes in connection with the loan facility to the
jurisdiction of the
English Courts."</b>
<P>

19	Mr Slattery also submitted that the contra proferentem rule should be
applied as the document was submitted by the first defendant.
 However, it must
be borne in mind that it was his basic submission that it constituted an offer
made by the plaintiff to the first
defendant.  There are other portions of the
document, which have, apparently, been altered by the plaintiff and, in all
these circumstances,
in so far as the contra proferentem rule has any real
impact in a case such as the present, I do not regard it as leading to the
conclusion that clause 10.1 should be rendered meaningless.
<P>

20	In my opinion all these authorities lead to the result that the Court, in
interpreting clause 10.1, must approach it in a commonsense
way.  It would defy
that concept to conclude that reference was being made to some court other than
the English High Court of Justice,
or that it was not being made to the English
High Court of Justice.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Basic Submissions</b>
<P>

21	The plaintiff's primary submission was that each of the causes of action
pleaded in the Summons falls within one of the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> rule 1A,
and that even if it is ultimately found that one or some of them do not, the
Court should not exercise its discretion to
set aside service or stay the
proceedings generally.  He submitted that the decisions in <b>WFM Motors Pty
Limited v Maydwell</b> (Bryson J - 23 April 1993 - unreported) and <b>C.E.
Heath </b>are not authority for the proposition that a Summons which contains
claims, some of which fall within certain of the paragraphs in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> rule 1A
and some of which do not, may not be served out of the jurisdiction.  My
understanding, subject to certain further submissions
made by Mr Slattery, is
that one is entitled to proceed on claims which fall within at least one of the
sub-rules in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> rule 1A, but that one cannot "tack" on to any one or more
of those claims ones which do not fall within one of the relevant
provisions.
<P>

22	Mr Slattery, however, submitted that there is a conflict of opinion within
this State, and that whilst the view I have just expressed
is supported by the
decision in <b>Australian Iron and Steel v Jumbo Scheepvaart</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14
NSWLR 507</a>, <b>C.E. Heath </b>and <b>News Corp</b>, it is contrary to the
decision in <b>Ramcorp Limited &amp; Ors v DFC Financial Services Limited &amp;
Ors</b> (Waddell CJinEq - 30 April 1990 - unreported).
<P>

23	He submitted that in none of the cases does it appear that precise argument
was put to the Court as to the proper construction
of the words "originating
process", "the proceedings" and "founded upon" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> rule 1A or its
equivalents in other jurisdictions; that there is a plain distinction in Rule
1A between the concept of the whole
originating process and the causes of
action in it; and that on its true construction the rule permits pleaded causes
of action which
do not have the necessary jurisdictional nexus to proceed
provided causes of action which satisfy that test are also pleaded and,
more
particularly, when the causes of action without the necessary nexus arise out
of essentially the same facts as those which do
have it.  He concluded that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> rule 1A(x) does not contradict this construction.
<P>

24	Mr Slattery's submission is that the "originating process" is the document
whereby the proceedings are instituted and Rule 1A
provides that that may be
served outside Australia in certain circumstances.  Inherent in the submission
is the argument, to which
I have just referred, that a number of causes of
action may be pleaded in an originating process, one or some of which must and
one
or some of which may not fall within the various sub-rules of rule 1A, but,
provided that at least one cause of action falls within
one sub-rule service is
authorised.
<P>

25	I think it important to note that the words "where the proceedings are
founded on" are used in relation to only some of the sub-rules:
(a), (b), (d)
and (e).  The various other sub-rules show that these are but instances in
which the originating process may be served
outside Australia.  A consideration
of all the sub-rules shows, clearly enough in my view, that in respect of any
cause of action
sought to be litigated in this State the jurisdictional
requirement is that there be a connection with the State in one or other
of the
ways specified in the various sub-rules, either by reason of the cause of
action or its constituent elements, or of the position
of the person sought to
be served.  The restriction to matters falling within the sub-rules is
reinforced by sub-rule (x) contrary
to Mr Slattery's submission. 
<P>

26	In <b>C.E. Heath</b>, in considering a similar submission at p.24, I
said:-
<P>

	<b>"As I am satisfied the necessary jurisdictional nexus does not exist to
allow the causes of action based on breach of contracts to
go forward, the
question of discretion does not arise.  If I find other causes of action do
have the necessary jurisdictional nexus
and, in the exercise of discretion
should be allowed to proceed, the authorities, with one possible exception,
preclude the `tacking'
of a cause of action not having the jurisdictional nexus
onto one which does: <i>Gosman v Ockerby</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1908/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1908] VicLawRp 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%20VLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] VLR 298</a>, <i>Siskina (Cargo

NSWLR 507</a> and <i>Lloyds</i>.  I think, with respect, that this result is thrown
up by a construction of the Rules.  In so far as the decision of Waddell CJinEq
in <i>Ramcorp Limited &amp; Ors v DFC Financial Services Limited &amp; Ors</i>
(30 April 1990 - unreported) may be thought to be authority for allowing causes
of action, which do not have a jurisdictional nexus
to be joined with causes of
action which do, because they arise out of the same factual substratum, I do
not think it should be followed.
 However in the way in which the matter seems
to have been argued, as set forth in the judgment, no point was taken about the
necessity
to find a jurisdictional nexus.  Thus it was not a matter his Honour
was required to consider."</b>
<P>

The reference to "Lloyds" in that citation is <b>Williams v The Society of
Lloyds &amp; Ors</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1994/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] VicRp 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%201%20VR%20274" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 1 VR 274.</a>  As I have said, Giles J took a similar
approach in <b>News Corp</b> at pp.557-558 in terms which did not suggest any
doubt about the matter.
<P>

27	In my opinion the law is that it is not permissible to allow causes of
action which do not fall within one of the sub-rules of
Rule 1A to be joined
with causes of action which do. I do not consider that the various Courts, in
coming to that decision, have
overlooked the precise words of the Rules, but
rather that they have applied them.  Mr Slattery further submitted that where
various
causes of action, some of which fall within the sub-rules under rule 1A
and some of which do not, all arise out of the same factual
substratum, there
can be no prejudice to the defendant in allowing the latter to go ahead because
it will be necessary to litigate
the factual issues in relation to a cause of
action which is permitted.  However, it is necessary to keep firmly in mind
that the
Rules are providing for circumstances in which a litigant, not
otherwise amenable to the jurisdiction, may be made so, and state
with
precision the circumstances in which that may occur.  Essentially, and I
appreciate this is speaking a little generally, it
must be established that the
cause of action or the defendant has a nexus with this State, they being the
circumstances in which
it is considered appropriate that a foreigner should be
made amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court.  In these circumstances
I do
not consider it is an answer to the terms of the Rules to assert an absence of
"prejudice" as "in effect" giving the Court power
to extend the words used, and
thus to extend the exorbitant jurisdiction of the Court to make a foreigner
amenable to the Court's
jurisdiction.  
<P>

28	The defendants submitted that a Summons, which contains claims which fall
only partly within the sub-rules of Rule 1A, may not
be served out of the
jurisdiction if it contains another claim which is not within the Rule, and
that sub-rule (x) shows that the
Rule does not authorise the joinder of a claim
which does not fall within one of the other sub-rules.
<P>

29	I do not accept the first part of the submission.  The view to which I came
in <b>C.E. Heath</b> was that certain of the causes of action should be stayed
permanently and certain should not, and that it was for the plaintiffs
to
decide whether they wished to proceed on the latter causes of action only.
<P>

30	It is now necessary to consider the various claims pleaded.  
<P>

<b>The Summons</b>
<P>

31	In dealing with an application such as this it is necessary, firstly, to
examine the matters pleaded.  In the part of the Summons
dealing with the
Nature of Dispute it was asserted:-
<P>

<b>"1.	By an oral agreement made in May 1998 the Plaintiff (`Hilad') was made
by the First Defendant (`SCI') the exclusive distributor
in Australia and New
Zealand of SCI's computer software product `Carmageddon 2' (`the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement').</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	Alternatively to the contention in paragraph 1 above, by written
agreement between them Hilad was from October 1996 the exclusive
distributor of
the computer software products of SCI in Australia and New Zealand (`the
General Distribution Agreement').</b>
<P>

<b>  3.	Under the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement and the General
Distribution Agreement SCI's obligations are both contractual
and of a
fiduciary character.</b>
<P>

<b>  4.	By its express terms, the General Distribution Agreement was
automatically renewed each October for a further 12 month period
unless
terminated in writing at least 45 days before the end of the current
period.</b>
<P>

<b>  5.	Hilad remained SCI's exclusive distributor of SCI's Products in the
Territory of Australia and New Zealand (as defined in the
General Distribution
Agreement) up to and including October 1998, when the General Distribution
Agreement automatically renewed for
a further 12 months through to October
1999.</b>
<P>

<b>  6.	Further, by a separate agreement (`the Purchase Agreement') Hilad
agreed to purchase and SCI agreed to sell to Hilad 40,000 units
of SCI's
product known as `Carmageddon 2' as soon as it became available for commercial
distribution.</b>
<P>

<b>  7.	Hilad alleges that SCI has committed breaches of the Purchase
Agreement, the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement and, or alternatively,
the
General Distribution Agreement, in that it:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	wrongfully purported to terminate the Carmageddon 2 Distribution
Agreement and/or the General Distribution Agreement in or about
October
1998;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	purported to appoint another distributor (`Sega Ozisoft') as the
distributor of SCI's Product `Carmageddon 2' in the Territory
in and from
October 1998; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	refused to supply the agreed units of `Carmageddon 2' to Hilad.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	Alternatively, Hilad says that by reason of its conduct SCI is estopped
from denying the existence of the Purchase Agreement,
the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement and, or alternatively, the General Distribution
Agreement on the principles of <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited -v-
Maher</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387.</a></b>
<P>

<b>  9.	Hilad claims damages for the said breaches of contract by SCI.</b>
<P>

<b>  10.	Alternatively, by reason of the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement
and clause 5 of the General Distribution Agreement and
the conduct of the
parties, SCI is a fiduciary of Hilad in the relationship of Principal and
Distributor: <i>Hospital Products Ltd -v- United States Surgical Corp</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41.</a>  In committing the breaches referred to in paragraph 7(b)
above, SCI is also in breach of fiduciary duty.  SCI failed to inform Hilad
of
its negotiations to secure an alternative distributor for its products, namely
Sega Ozisoft, in or about October 1998.  Hilad
seeks equitable damages or
alternatively an account with respect to the said breach of fiduciary
duty.</b>
<P>

<b>  11.	Yet further and alternatively, Hilad claims damages for misleading
conduct pursuant to the <i>Trade Practices Act (Cth), 1974</i> or alternatively
the <i>Fair Trading Act (NSW), 1987</i>.  The misleading conduct arises from
representations made by SCI to Hilad concerning Hilad's continuing right to the
distribution
of SCI's Products, and in particular the product `Carmageddon 2',
and further in relation to SCI's failure to inform Hilad that SCI
at all times
was purporting to reserve for itself the right to withhold distribution of
SCI's Products from Hilad.</b>
<P>

<b>  12.	Hilad also seeks damages against the Second Defendant, a Director of
SCI, as an aider and abetter of, or alterntiavely, a person
knowingly concerned
in, the misleading conduct of SCI pursuant to the <i>Trade Practices Act (Cth),
1974</i> or alternatively the <i>Fair Trading Act (NSW), 1987</i>.</b>
<P>

<b>  13.	Hilad also seeks equitable compensation against the Second Defendant
as a person who knowingly participated in the breach of
fiduciary duty by SCI
described in paragraph 10 above."</b>
<P>

32	In its Contentions the plaintiff pleaded its incorporation in Australia, the
first defendant's incorporation in the United Kingdom,
the plaintiff's
principal business activities as the importation and distribution of computer
software for home entertainment purposes,
and the first defendant's principal
business as the supplier and seller to distributors of computer software for,
inter alia, home
entertainment purposes.
<P>

33	In paragraph 5 it was pleaded that by an agreement made at Atlanta in the
United States on or about 28 May 1998 between the second
defendant, who is a
director of the first defendant, and Mr Mendels, ("the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement"):-
<P>

	<b>".. and in consideration of Hilad agreeing to purchase quantities of
certain current but less marketable computer software programmes
distributed by
SCI, SCI appointed Hilad as SCI's exclusive distributor of its computer
software product known as `Carmageddon 2'
within Australia and New
Zealand.</b>
<P>

<b>	PARTICULARS</b>
<P>

<b>	The quantities of the then current but less marketable computer software
programmes of SCI were:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	One thousand five hundred units of `Frenzy' on Sony Playstation.</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	One thousand units of `SpellCross';</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	Eight thousand units of `Live Wire' on Sony Playstation and three
thousand units of `Live Wire' on personal computer."</b>
<P>

34	It was pleaded in paragraph 6 that the express and implied terms of the
Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement were that the first
defendant would
distribute "Carmageddon 2" in Australia and New Zealand exclusively through the
plaintiff and through no other distributor
within those countries; that the
duration of that agreement would be coincident with the period during which
"Carmageddon 2" was
commercially distributed by the first defendant; that the
plaintiff would diligently promote and market "Carmageddon 2" to a marketing
standard no less than that demonstrated by the plaintiff previously in relation
to its distribution of other products of the first
defendant; that the first
defendant would grant and the plaintiff would have the benefit of the same
credit and financial arrangements
as had been extended by the first defendant
to the plaintiff with respect to products previously distributed by the first
defendant
through the plaintiff, namely at least thirty days credit; and that
the first defendant would otherwise carry out all its obligations
under clause
5 of the form of written Distribution Agreement, ("the General Distribution
Agreement"), subsequently pleaded.
<P>

35	Mr Slattery submitted that the provisions of clause 5 of the General
Distribution Agreement were impliedly incorporated in the
"Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement".  This raised the further question, viz if they were
what other provisions of that agreement,
if any, were implied in the
"Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement".
<P>

36	The particulars of the agreement were pleaded thus:
<P>

	<b>"The terms referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) above were
express terms of the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement discussed
between Mr
Ennis on behalf of SCI and Mr Mendels on behalf of Hilad on 28 May, 1998 in
Atlanta USA.  The term referred to in sub-paragraph
(b) above is a term implied
from the nature of the product agreed to be distributed.  The term referred to
in sub-paragraph (e) above
is implied from the nature of the promise of
distribution rights made on 28 May 1998 by Mr Ennis to Mr Mendels."</b>
<P>

37	In paragraph 7 the General Distribution Agreement is pleaded both "further
and in the alternative".  It was pleaded that by an
agreement made in Australia
on or about 15 November 1996 between the first defendant as "the Principal" and
the plaintiff as "the
Distributor", the first defendant appointed the plaintiff
its exclusive distributor of computer software products within the Territory
of
Australia and New Zealand. 
<P>

38	The Agreement was particularised by reference to a document headed "Draft
Distribution Agreement", which appears at pp.30 to
33 of Exhibit A.
<P>

39	In paragraph 8 various terms of that document were pleaded.
<P>

40	It is convenient to pause at this point to note that on 25 October 1996 the
first defendant sent a facsimile transmission to
the plaintiff stating that the
option for computer software known as "SWIV" was available and requesting an
offer from the plaintiff
if it was interested.  On 4 November 1996 the first
defendant sent a further facsimile transmission to the plaintiff seeking
confirmation
that it would like to have exclusive distribution rights for
"SWIV" and requesting that the plaintiff fax an "offer as soon as possible".
On 14 November 1996 the first defendant sent a further facsimile transmission
to the plaintiff enclosing a copy "of your Distribution
Agreement as requested
from Bill".  That was the Draft Distribution Agreement and, on 15 November
1996, Mr Mendels returned the execution
page, which had on it clause 10.1,
signed by him on behalf of the plaintiff, and documentation lodging an order
with the first defendant.
 He in fact signed at the place provided for the
signature of the first defendant and the document was never signed on its
behalf.
<P>

41	Mr Slattery submitted that the legal effect of what Mr Mendels did was to
make an offer to the first defendant in the terms of
the draft agreement, which
offer was accepted by the subsequent forwarding of software goods to the
plaintiff and the advising of
the plaintiff, such advice being given in
Australia, that that was being done.  In that way Mr Slattery sought to have
the acceptance
of an offer made in Australia.  He submitted that had Mr
Mendels' signing of the draft constituted the acceptance of an offer contained
in the draft, that would have constituted an acceptance where it was
communicated, namely in England, such that the contract for
which he contended
would have been entered into there.
<P>

<b>The Purported Effect Of The General Distribution Agreement</b>
<P>

42	Because of the reliance placed by the plaintiff on the General Distribution
Agreement in respect of a number of matters, it is
necessary to examine it in
some greater detail.  The parties were the first defendant, which is named as
"the Principal", and the
plaintiff, which is named as "the Distributor", and it
recited that the Principal manufactures goods including "the Products" which
the Distributor wished to sell in the Territory.  The Commencement Date was
October 1996 and the Expiry Date October 1997, the "Term"
being defined as
twelve months rolling (automatically renewed) unless terminated in writing at
least forty five days before the Expiry
Date.  The "Territory" was defined in
the typescript as "Australia" and there was added, apparently by Mr Mendels,
"&amp; NZ".  "Rights"
were defined as "the exclusive rights to carry on the
business in the Territory for the Term",  "business" having been defined as
"the promotion and sale of the products by the distributors and all matters
related".
<P>

43	"Products" were defined as:-
<P>

	<b>"Video game programmes as produced on any form of cartridge, disc, compact
disc (CD) or other similar media, as shown in the Principal's
published price
list (Schedule A) relative to the Products, which will be up-dated from time to
time."</b>
<P>

44	The Schedule showed the product as "SWIV" 3D PC-CD Rom Finished Product,
with a unit price of Twelve pounds and minimum quantity
guaranteed of one
thousand units.
<P>

45	Clause 4 granted the plaintiff exclusive rights, and clause 5 set out the
first defendant's obligations, which included prohibitions
upon its infringing
or derogating from the rights and the requirement that it should support the
plaintiff in its efforts to promote
the business and, inter alia, to supply
samples of the products and promotional and advertising material related to
them; to provide
and promptly update information about the products; and to
supply details of production schedules, release dates, press releases
and other
information as may be reasonably necessary in relation to new products.
Clauses 5.4 and 5.5 obliged the first defendant
to supply to the plaintiff the
Products in accordance with orders received from it and, subject to
availability, with all reasonable
despatch, and to pass on to the plaintiff any
enquiries, orders or other leads within the Territory.
<P>

46	Clause 6 imposed obligations on the plaintiff, and clause 8 was a warranty
and representation by the first defendant to the plaintiff
that it was
empowered to grant the rights.  Clause 9 provided for termination either for
serious or persistent breach of the provisions
of the agreement and a failure
to remedy them within thirty days of being required to do so in writing, and in
other circumstances,
which included the right to terminate at least forty five
days before the Expiry Date, as provided under the definition of "Term".
<P>

47	Clause 10.1 was in the terms to which I have referred and, accordingly the
parties agreed, on the assumption there was an agreement,
that the law
applicable was that of the United Kingdom. There was the further issue I have
identified.
<P>

48	There was no real issue between the parties that the General Distribution
Agreement was concluded.  Each wished to rely on portions
of it.  This
agreement marked the commencement of contractual arrangements between the
parties and, in particular, the exclusive
dealership provisions.  In  my
opinion, the two subsequent agreements have to be viewed together with the
General Distribution Agreement.
<P>

<b>A Return To The Summons</b>
<P>

49	In paragraph 9 of the Summons it was pleaded that a number of matters
existed in the relationship of the plaintiff and the first
defendant from at
least May 1998:-
<P>

	<b>".. whether such matters arose from the terms of the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement or the General Distribution Agreement or
the conduct of
each of SCI and Hilad."</b>
<P>

This points up the significance of the General Distribution Agreement to the
plaintiff.
<P>

Those matters were stated as the existence of a valuable market in Australia
for the plaintiff's distribution of the first defendant's
software products
and, in particular, "Carmageddon 2"; in the case of the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement the discretion of
the first defendant to promote and
market and, in the case of the General Distribution Agreement, the existence of
the discretion
in the first defendant to promote and market and an obligation
to support the plaintiff's efforts to promote and market; and the
manner and
extent of the first defendant's support of the plaintiff's promoting and
marketing efforts being within the general discretion
of the first defendant.
It was further pleaded that the first defendant had, from time to time,
knowledge of the availability and
scheduled availability of forthcoming and
planned products, possession of samples of and promotional materials relating
to those
products, knowledge of production schedules, planned or proposed
release dates and general information about new products, control
of the
release and supply of new products subject in the case of the General
Distribution Agreement to a contractual obligation of
reasonable despatch, and
knowledge of enquiries, orders or other leads and opportunities for
distribution of its products.
<P>

50	The pleading continued that the first defendant had various discretions it
was able to exercise, whereas the plaintiff had little
or no way of checking
whether they were being exercised in the best interests of both the plaintiff
and the first defendant.  It
was further contended that the plaintiff was
"vulnerable" to any failure by the first defendant to exercise the discretions
and use
its knowledge and control in the best interests of both parties, so
that a failure to do so would constitute damage to the plaintiff's
distribution
goodwill in the first defendant's Products, and that in the circumstances the
plaintiff relied upon the first defendant
to protect and develop the
plaintiff's distribution goodwill in the Products in Australia and New
Zealand.
<P>

51	It was pleaded that by reason of those matters the first defendant was under
a fiduciary obligation where its interests conflicted
with those of the
plaintiff to act bona fide and reasonably and with due regard to the separate
interests of the plaintiff, and where
its interests came into conflict with
those of the plaintiff, not to profit from that conflict by failing to act bona
fide and reasonably
and with due regard to the separate interests of the
plaintiff.  It was not pleaded that these requirements constituted implied
terms
of the agreement.
<P>

52	In paragraph 11 it was pleaded that pursuant to the terms of the General
Distribution Agreement, the plaintiff purchased certain
products from the first
defendant in or about November 1996 and, in paragraph 12, that pursuant to the
terms of the General Distribution
Agreement the first defendant provided to the
plaintiff, free of charge, certain promotional and product information.  The
Products
purchased were one thousand units of "SWIV" and four thousand units of
"Carmageddon".
<P>

53	Thereafter a number of representations were pleaded.  The first
representation appears in paragraph 14 of the Summons, which
alleged that in or
about 18 to 21 June 1997 the second defendant, on behalf of the first
defendant, orally represented to Mr Mendels
that the first defendant was
excited about the job the plaintiff was doing for it and the publicity it had
created; that the first
defendant had a lot of new titles under development;
that the new titles included "Carmageddon 2"; and that the first defendant
would
provide the plaintiff with a release schedule for the new titles,
including "Carmageddon 2".  These were referred to as "the First
Representations" and the evidence of them is contained in paragraphs 44 and 45
of Mr Mendels' affidavit, which established that they
were made in Atlanta in
the United States.
<P>

54	In paragraph 15 it was pleaded that on or about 23 June 1997 "in reliance
upon the First Representations" the plaintiff agreed
to vary the General
Distribution Agreement with respect to further purchases of "Carmageddon".  The
variation was alleged to be oral
in a conversation between Mr Mendels and the
second defendant on 23 June 1997, (paragraph 46 of Mr Mendels' affidavit),
which took
place whilst Mr Mendels was in California.  Mr Mendels deposed,
although he attributed the date as "23 June 1996" I think incorrectly,
that the
second defendant asked how many units of "Carmageddon" Mr Mendels wanted, to
which he replied four thousand.  Mr Mendels
said that the second defendant
asked him whether, if he was given another ten thousand units, he would take
them "with extended terms",
to which he replied he would, although the
plaintiff would not be able to pay for them until September or October.  He
said the second
defendant replied "Very well.  I'll give you until
September".
<P>

55	It was pleaded that this amounted to a variation of the General Distribution
Agreement so that the plaintiff would purchase on
extended credit terms of
sixty days from the date of receipt of shipment, presumably in lieu of ten days
before shipment, and, in
paragraph 17, that "pursuant to the General
Distribution Agreement" the plaintiff purchased a further fourteen thousand
units of
"Carmageddon".  The pleadings showed the extent to which the plaintiff
relied on the terms of the General Distribution Agreement,
a reliance which was
reinforced in Mr Slattery's submissions.
<P>

56	In a facsimile transmission from the first defendant to the plaintiff dated
25 June 1997 it was stated that the first defendant
was confirming, pursuant to
an earlier conversation:-
<P>

	<b>"We have arranged for the delivery of your next four thousand units to be
delivered along with your new order of ten thousand units
to be collected from
our warehouse on the 30th June 1997.</b>
<P>

<b>	You have already paid for the four thousand units on their way to you, but
are being given sixty days credit terms for the fourteen
thousand.</b>
<P>

<b>	If you need any further assistance please do not hesitate to give me a
call."</b>
<P>

Although Mr Jackman submitted that the variation in relation to payment was
only in respect of the one consignment, I am satisfied
that it was intended to
vary the basic requirement under the General Distribution Agreement that
payment should be made ten days
before shipment.
<P>

57	In paragraph 18 of the Summons it was pleaded that on or about 15 July 1997
the plaintiff received in Australia by facsimile
transmission a Release
Schedule from the first defendant, which contained an express representation
that "Carmageddon 2" would be
released in 1998.  This was defined as "the
second representation" and, in paragraph 19, it was pleaded that between 7
September
1997 and 9 September 1997, in reliance upon the first and second
representations, the plaintiff made arrangements to attend and did
attend a
computer software trade show in Los Angeles.
<P>

58	In paragraph 20 it was pleaded that on or about 7 September 1997, in
reliance upon the first and second representations, Mr Mendels
on behalf of the
plaintiff attended a dinner at the invitation of the first defendant during
which its managing director represented
to him that the first defendant was
pleased with the work the plaintiff was doing as its distributor in Australia
and New Zealand,
and with the way the plaintiff had "hyped" the title
"Carmageddon" in that Territory and with the sales of "Carmageddon" achieved
in
the Territory, and looked forward to a long relationship with the plaintiff
"with all future SCI titles".  This was referred to
as the third representation
and the terms of the conversation are set forth in paragraph 53 of Mr Mendels'
affidavit, which disclosed
that the dinner was held in London.
<P>

59	In paragraph 21 it was pleaded that on or about 10 September 1997,
apparently at a meeting held at the first defendant's offices
in London, the
second defendant represented to the plaintiff that the first defendant hoped to
provide it with demonstration discs
of "Carmageddon 2" by November 1997.  This
was defined as the fourth representation and, in paragraph 54 of his affidavit,
Mr Mendels
stated that it was made at a meeting at the first defendant's
offices, presumably in London.  This is made clear by the statement
in
paragraph 56 that Mr Mendels returned to Australia on 12 September 1997.
<P>

60	It was pleaded in paragraph 22 that in or about October 1997 the General
Distribution Agreement was automatically renewed for
a further twelve months
until October 1998 and, in paragraph 23, that in or about November 1997, in
reliance upon the representations,
the plaintiff purchased five thousand units
of "the Carmageddon Splat Pack" from the first defendant and, in paragraph 24,
that on
or about 3 December 1997, in reliance upon the representations, the
plaintiff purchased a further five hundred units of "Carmageddon".
<P>

61	The fifth representation upon which reliance is placed was pleaded in
paragraph 25 of the Summons.  It is alleged that in or
about early December
1997 in Australia the second defendant, on behalf of the first defendant,
orally represented to the plaintiff
that it had done a great job in
distributing "Carmageddon"; that the first defendant was extremely happy with
it; that there was
no way that the first defendant would work with any other
distributor in the Territory of Australia and New Zealand; that the plaintiff
had shown loyalty to the first defendant and the first defendant would show
loyalty to it; that the first defendant looked forward
to a strong relationship
in the future with the plaintiff on the first defendant's new titles; that the
plaintiff had done a top
job in promoting "Carmageddon" and made it and the
first defendant's name successful in Australia and New Zealand; that the
plaintiff
would make "Carmageddon 2" very successful in Australia and New
Zealand; that as soon as demonstration discs of "Carmageddon 2" were
available
the first defendant would supply them to the plaintiff; and that the first
defendant would start supplying the plaintiff
with promotional materials in
respect of "Carmageddon 2" so that the plaintiff could commence publicity on
its release in March 1998.
<P>

62	The evidence in support of these representations is set forth in paragraphs
61 to 69 of Mr Mendels' affidavit, and it was submitted
by Mr Slattery that
these representations "showed a high degree of dependence" by the plaintiff.
<P>

63	In paragraph 26 it was pleaded that in or about February 1998, in reliance
upon the representations, Mr Mendels attended the
first defendant's offices in
London, during which the second defendant represented that "Carmageddon 2" was
in its first stages of
development and was looking very good and would be
available in the second half of 1998.  It was further pleaded that in the
meantime
the first defendant would be releasing other new titles including
"Frenzy", and that it would give the plaintiff an update on release
dates when
they were known.  This is referred to as the sixth representation and the
evidence in relation to it appears in paragraph
71 of Mr Mendels' affidavit. Mr
Slattery submitted that there was no cause of action until the representation
was acted on and, in
paragraph 27, it was pleaded that in or about April 1998,
in reliance upon the representations, the plaintiff committed management
time
and expertise and expended funds to undertake and did undertake investigations
of the potential market in Australia and New
Zealand for the sale of
"Carmageddon 2" in various formats.  As a result the plaintiff submitted a
commercially valuable forecast
of its likely orders for "Carmageddon 2"
assuming its release in early November 1998.  In paragraph 28 it was pleaded
that in reliance
on the representations and in its capacity as distributor of
the first defendant's products in Australia and New Zealand, Mr Mendels
and his
product manager, Ms Machado, attended a computer software trade show in Atlanta
between 28 and 30 May 1998.
<P>

64	In paragraph 29 it was pleaded that during that computer software trade show
a meeting was held between the second defendant
and Ms Barrett, on behalf of
the first defendant, and Mr Mendels and Ms Machado, on behalf of the plaintiff,
at which the first defendant
orally represented to the plaintiff "certain
matters that also constituted the making of the Carmageddon 2 Distribution
Agreement".
 It was pleaded that it was represented that the first defendant
would not work with distributors other than the plaintiff in Australia
and New
Zealand; that the first defendant would be releasing four new titles, including
"Carmageddon 2"; that the first defendant
expected the plaintiff to purchase
all new titles to be released by it; that "Carmageddon 2" would be released on
personal computer
in October/November 1998, on Sony Playstation in March/April
1999 and on Nintendo 64 in March 1999; and that the second defendant
demonstrated a "Beta Version" of "Carmageddon 2" to Ms Machado on behalf of the
plaintiff.  These were referred to as the seventh
representations and it was
submitted by Mr Slattery that they provided the conduct which is alleged to be
"tortious".
<P>

65	It was pleaded in paragraph 30 that in reliance on the representations and,
in particular, the seventh representation, the plaintiff
placed orders with the
first defendant for the purchase of each of the new software products.  The
particulars of the placing of
the orders were that they were placed orally by
Ms Machado with the second defendant during the meeting, and were confirmed by
an
E-mail message from Ms Machado to the second defendant dated 11 June
1998.
<P>

66	In paragraph 31 it was pleaded that at the request of the second defendant
in performance of the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement
and in reliance upon
the representations, the plaintiff, on 18 June 1998, agreed to increase its
order of the new title "Frenzy"
to two thousand units and to confirm its order
for 2,000 units of "Carmageddon" upon terms, inter alia, that the total value
of the
purchase was 38,000 and that delivery would take place from 1 July 1998.
The particulars alleged that the request from the second
defendant was oral and
made in a telephone conversation between him and Mr Mendels on 11 June 1998,
and that the plaintiff then placed
an order on the first defendant dated 18
June 1998 in the sum of 38,000.
<P>

67	In paragraph 32 it was pleaded, once again further and alternatively, that
between 28 May 1998 and 11 June 1998, in consideration
for the plaintiff's
agreement to purchase the first defendant's less marketable computer software
programmes, the first defendant
agreed to sell and deliver to the plaintiff,
and the plaintiff agreed to purchase, inter alia, forty thousand units of
"Carmageddon
2" of various configuration at the first defendant's then list
price.  The particulars alleged that the Purchase Agreement was partly
oral and
partly written and, to the extent that it was oral, the same particulars as
those given in relation to paragraph 30 were
applicable, and to the extent that
it was in writing it was contained in an E-mail transmission from the plaintiff
to the first defendant
dated 11 June 1998.
<P>

68	In paragraphs 33 and 34 it was pleaded that on 29 June 1998, and before the
period during which delivery was permitted under
the order referred to in
paragraph 31(2), Mr Mendels orally requested the second defendant to agree to
vary the terms of the Purchase
Agreement so that the shipment of the goods in
that order would not take place until August 1998.  The evidence of this
conversation
is contained in paragraph 92 of Mr Mendels' affidavit and,
although it is not pleaded that the first defendant agreed, it appears
from the
evidence, which of course must be treated as prima facie only, that the second
defendant agreed and, in paragraph 93, Mr
Mendels deposed that at no time did
the second defendant indicate to him that the first defendant would not abide
by its agreement
as to delayed shipment of "Frenzy".
<P>

69	In paragraph 34 it was pleaded that despite the variation in paragraph 33
the first defendant did not delay shipment, but delivered
the goods to the
plaintiff in mid July 1998 together with an additional five hundred units of
"Carmageddon".
<P>

70	In paragraphs 35 and 36 the eighth representation was pleaded, it being
alleged that by an E-mail transmission dated 9 July 1998
the first defendant
represented to the plaintiff, inter alia, that the release schedule for
"Carmageddon 2" was November 1998 and,
on or about 27 July 1998, the plaintiff
received art work from the first defendant relating to "Carmageddon 2":-
<P>

	<b>".. and thereafter in reliance upon the Representations commenced using the
same for the purposes of promoting `Carmageddon 2' in
the Territory of
Australia and New Zealand".</b>
<P>

71	In paragraph 96 of his affidavit Mr Mendels stated that during June, July,
August and September 1998 there was continued correspondence
between the
plaintiff and the first defendant in relation to the release of the new titles
and promotional material for "Carmageddon
2".
<P>

72	In paragraph 38 it was pleaded that by reason of the early shipment and
pursuant to the General Distribution Agreement the purchase
price did not fall
due for payment before 1 October 1998, being sixty days after the earliest
agreed date for receipt of shipment,
namely 1 August 1998, and, in paragraph
39, that wrongfully and in breach of the General Distribution Agreement, the
first defendant
purported to demand payment prior to the due date and, in
paragraph 40, that notwithstanding that payment was not due the plaintiff
arranged additional financing to effect early payment.  It was further pleaded
that the plaintiff transferred part of the moneys
raised to the first
defendant's bank account by telegraphic transfer on 18 September 1998 "and was
ready, willing and able to pay
the balance" on 25 September 1998.  In this
regard it was submitted that the plaintiff had acted to its detriment by
arranging for
the provision of finance through its bank.
<P>

73	In paragraph 42 it was pleaded that on 24 September 1998 the second
defendant, on behalf of the first defendant, orally represented
to Mr Mendels
in Australia that the first defendant had not appointed anyone else to be a
distributor for its products in Australia,
and that the plaintiff was the only
distributor.  In paragraph 113 of his affidavit Mr Mendels set out the
conversation he alleged
he had.
<P>

74	In paragraph 43 it was pleaded that to the knowledge of the first defendant
this representation was false in that on and prior
to 24 September 1998, Sega
Ozisoft Pty Limited, ("Sega"), held itself out as being the distributor in
Australia of "Carmageddon 2"
on behalf of the first plaintiff; that on and
prior to that date the first defendant had agreed with Sega to appoint it as
its distributor
with respect to "Carmageddon 2"; and that alternatively on or
prior to that date the first defendant was in the course of negotiations
with
Sega with a view to appointing it as its distributor in Australia and New
Zealand of "Carmageddon 2", which appointment was
subsequently made.  Mr
Jackman conceded that there was evidence that this representation was false.
He submitted that there was no
evidence that the plaintiff acted in reliance on
it or suffered any financial loss in consequence of it.
<P>

75	In paragraph 44 it was pleaded that in or about October 1998 the General
Distribution Agreement was automatically renewed for
a further twelve months
until October 1999 and, in paragraph 45, that on or about 1 October 1998 the
first defendant purported to
terminate the General Distribution Agreement and
the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement by refusing thereafter to supply
"Carmageddon
2" to the plaintiff.  Once again this showed the close
relationship the plaintiff attributed to those two agreements.  In paragraph
46
it was pleaded that the termination was wrongful and in breach of the various
agreements.  This was repeated in various ways.
 It was also pleaded that the
first defendant breached its fiduciary duties, is estopped in various ways, and
has engaged in misleading
and deceptive conduct or conduct likely to mislead or
deceive, pursuant to the provisions of the Acts. The second defendant is sought
to be joined, inter alia, on the basis that he was a person who had aided,
abetted, counselled or procured, or alternatively was
knowingly concerned in,
the said misleading conduct pursuant to s.75B of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b>
and, further, that he knowingly participated in the breaches of fiduciary duty
by the first defendant.
<P>

<b>The United Kingdom Proceedings</b>
<P>

76	In her affidavit of 25 March 1999 Ms Donohue stated that on 11 November 1998
the first defendant commenced proceedings in the
High Court of Justice in
England to recover a debt of 27,800 from the plaintiff for unpaid invoices
relating to deliveries of "Frenzy".
 Annexure "A" to her affidavit is a copy of
the Writ of Summons in those proceedings.  In paragraph 3 of the Statement of
Claim it
was pleaded that in or around October 1996 the parties entered into an
agreement pursuant to which the defendant would distribute
the game "SWIV" in
Australia for a minimum period of twelve months, such agreement being evidenced
by a draft unsigned Distribution
Agreement containing in clause 9 provision for
termination in the event of serious or persistent breach of its provision and a
failure
to remedy such breach within thirty days of written notice requiring
that to be done.  The Statement of Claim also pleaded clause
10.1 dealing with
the applicable law and exclusive jurisdiction.
<P>

77	In paragraph 4 it was pleaded that from time to time the parties agreed that
the plaintiff should distribute other of the first
defendant's computer games
in Australia, but that no agreement was reached in relation to the distribution
of "Carmageddon II". 
In paragraph 5 it was pleaded that prior to the
institution of the proceedings the plaintiff made false claims to the effect
that
the first defendant had granted it the exclusive right to distribute
"Carmageddon II" in Australia and New Zealand.
<P>

78	The balance of the Statement of Claim is concerned with the recovery of the
debt in respect of the game "Frenzy".  The relief
claimed was a declaration
that the plaintiff does not have the right to distribute "Carmageddon II" in
Australia and New Zealand
and for payment of the amount allegedly owing.
<P>

79	In the affidavit in support of the application for leave to serve out of the
jurisdiction the solicitor for the first defendant
referred to the jurisdiction
clause and, after quoting it, stated:-
<P>

	<b>"Whilst this clause is unhappily drafted, I suggest that the clear
intention of the parties must have been for the agreement to be
interpreted in
accordance with English law and for the parties to submit to the jurisdiction
of the High Court in England."</b>
<P>

80	By its Points of Defence the plaintiff admitted the entry into an agreement
in October 1996 and asserted that it had various
rights thereunder and, in
relation to the monetary claim, denied for various reasons the obligation to
pay.  In paragraph 10 of its
Defence it pleaded that it was entitled to damages
by way of equitable set-off for breach of various terms of the 1996
agreement.
<P>

81	Exhibit B was a letter from the solicitors for the first defendant in London
to the solicitors for the plaintiff in London dated
10 May 1999, the second
paragraph of which reads:-
<P>

	<b>"The claim for a declaration that your client did not have any rights to
distribute `Carmageddon II' followed approaches made by your
client to other
distributors in Australia asserting rights in `Carmageddon II' and threatening
to sue any other distributor that
purported to distribute the game.  Our client
therefore had every right to seek the declaration that it did.  It does now
appear
to be common ground, however, that your client does not have any rights
in `Carmageddon II' and accordingly that part of our client's
case can be
withdrawn."</b>
<P>

The final paragraph stated:-
<P>

	<b>"That leaves the question of forum.  The agreement between our clients
provides for the agreement to be governed by UK law with the
parties submitting
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice.  We cannot see any
reason in these circumstances why
our client should consent to the substantial
dispute between our clients, namely whether or not our client was entitled to
terminate
the agreement being litigated in New South Wales.  If your client
will agree to withdraw the New South Wales proceedings, our client
will agree
that the costs of these proceedings should be treated as being in the cause of
the English proceedings and will consent
to whatever form of amendment your
client considers necessary so that its claim can be brought here, again with
costs in the cause.
 Otherwise, unless our client succeeds in its forum
application in New South Wales, then the actions will have to proceed in
tandem."</b>
<P>

82	Exhibit C is a letter from the plaintiff's solicitors in London to their
solicitors in Sydney stating:-
<P>

	<b>"You have asked me whether there is equivalent legislation in England to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>, which provides that a corporation
shall not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct.  I can confirm that there
is no primary legislation
in England equivalent to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52.</a> </b>
<P>

<b>	There is secondary legislation which, inter alia, prohibits misleading
advertising and the like.  However, there is no legislation
prohibiting

52."</a></b>
<P>

<b>The Carmageddon 2 Agreement And The Purchase Agreement</b>
<P>

83	Mr Slattery submitted that the plaintiff's primary contractual claim is
based upon the Carmageddon 2 Agreement pleaded in paragraph
5 of the Summary of
Contentions, the entry into which was preceded by a series of representations
made by the first defendant through
the second defendant to the plaintiff "in
the forum".  It is submitted that "these causes of action" fall within
sub-rules (a), (b),
(c)(iii) and (iv).  He also submitted that portion of the
General Distribution Agreement was implied in that agreement.
<P>

84	As pleaded the contract was made in Atlanta and not in New South Wales.
Accordingly, sub-rules (a) and (c)(i) do not avail the
plaintiff and, indeed,
Mr Slattery does not rely upon the latter.
<P>

85	Mr Slattery relied nextly upon sub-rule (b), which provides:-
<P>

	<b>"where the proceedings are founded on a breach in the State of a contract
wherever made, whether or not the breach is preceded or
accompanied by a breach
wherever occurring that renders impossible the performance of any part of the
contract which ought to be
performed in the State."</b>
<P>

86	By two E-mail transmissions of 1 and 2 October 1998, which were received by
the plaintiff in Sydney, the first defendant purported
to terminate the
Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement for breach, namely the failure to pay.
These breaches, it was submitted by
Mr Slattery, occurred in New South Wales.
Mr Jackman's submission was that the place of the breaches alleged in
paragraphs 45 to
47, being the allegation of a wrongful termination and a
refusal to supply, was England as that was "the place where the decision
as to
the alleged termination was made, and where supply was to be effected".  He
elaborated by submitting that the appointment of
another agent was made in
England and that it was this breach which prevented the first defendant from
honouring its obligations
under the pleaded agreements and, hence, it was not a
breach which occurred in New South Wales.
<P>

87	The difficulty I have with this submission is that whilst the decision may
have been taken in England it was not the decision-making
process, which led to
the termination and refusal to supply, but the communication of that decision
to the plaintiff.  Until the
decision was acted upon, it cannot, in my view, be
asserted that there was a breach.  It was acted upon by advising the plaintiff
in New South Wales of the termination and thus, in my opinion, the breach
occurred at that point and in New South Wales.  If the
view is taken that it
was the taking of the decision and/or the appointment of another agent, which
all occurred in England, that
does not overcome sub-rule (b) if, as happened,
there was a breach in New South Wales by the communication of the termination
said
by the plaintiff to have been wrongful.  This invokes the second part of
the sub-rule (b).
<P>

88	Mr Slattery also submitted that the breaches necessarily entailed breaches
of a number of the provisions of clause 5 of the General
Distribution
Agreement, which, of necessity, had to be performed by the first defendant in
New South Wales.
<P>

89	In all these circumstances I am satisfied that breaches occurred in New
South Wales and that, accordingly, the necessary jurisdictional
nexus has been
established in relation to the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement and the
General Distribution Agreement.  However,
this conclusion throws up for
consideration the inter-relationship between those two agreements and the
effect, if any, of clause
10.1.
<P>

90	I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to draw a distinction
between the Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement,
on the one hand, and the
General Distribution Agreement, on the other.  Indeed, Mr Slattery's
submissions did not attempt to do so.
 He maintained that some of the terms of
the General Distribution Agreement were implied into the Carmageddon 2
Distribution Agreement,
and that there were variations of the former agreement,
which impacted on the latter.  The pleading asserted that the one act
constituted
a breach of both.  In my opinion the pleaded and evidentiary
relationship between these two agreements is such that one cannot tease
out
some provisions that only apply to the General Distribution Agreement, and some
which apply to both.  I consider that the preferable
view is that the
Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement was a refinement or extension of the
General Distribution Agreement and that
the proper conclusion is that its terms
were, therefore, part of it.  Thus it picked up clause 10.1, or, alternatively,
the Carmageddon
2 Distribution Agreement was merely a further implementation of
the General Distribution Agreement, so that all its terms were applicable.
<P>

91	I am also of the view that in so far as the Purchase Agreement may be said
to be a separate agreement, it was similarly an extension
of the General
Distribution Agreement, in the sense that it emanated from it with the same
conclusions.
<P>

92	In the result the view to which I have come is that all the agreements
pleaded are subject to clause 10.1 of the General Distribution
Agreement.
There is no doubt, in my opinion and for the reasons I have stated, that clause
10.1 is an exclusive "choice of court"
provision and that, accordingly, any
proceedings based on the alleged breach of any of the agreements should be
stayed, at least
pending their resolution in the High Court of Justice. The
conclusions apply whatever the jurisdictional nexus unless, of course,
the
plaintiff can show strong cause why a stay should not be granted.  I am not
satisfied that there are.  Mr Slattery submitted
that the plaintiff would lose
the juridical advantage of not being able to rely on the Acts, but that has
never been treated as sufficient
to show strong cause.  It is merely a
consequence of the parties' agreement, which is otherwise enforced. However,
lest I am wrong
in this conclusion I shall consider other submissions.
<P>

<b>The Proper Law Of The Contract</b>
<P>

93	In addition Mr Slattery contended and Mr Jackman disputed that the law of
New South Wales is the proper law of the Carmageddon
2 Distribution Agreement,
essentially on the basis that New South Wales is the system of law with which
that agreement has its closest
and most real connection: <b>Bonython  v The
Commonwealth</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/UKPCHCA/1950/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] UKPCHCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2081%20CLR%20486" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 81 CLR 486.</a>
<P>

94	Mr Jackman submitted that the proper law was English law by virtue of clause
10.1 and, in any event, it was that law with which
the agreement had its
closest and most real connection, because the goods were supplied by an English
company in England to freight
forwarders in England to be paid for in that
country; title to the goods passed in England; and because the Territory of the
alleged
exclusive right of distribution comprised both Australia and New
Zealand, thus making it inappropriate, notwithstanding the principal
place of
the plaintiff's business, to choose Australia rather than New Zealand.
<P>

95	I am not satisfied that the law of New South Wales is the proper law of the
Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement in the sense
that it is the jurisdiction
with which the agreement has its closest and most real connection.  The
agreement was entered into in
the United States and obliged the parties to
perform activities in both England and Australia.  Those to be carried out in
England
were as essential to it as those required to be performed in New South
Wales.  There cannot, for the reasons I have stated, be any
preference for New
South Wales law, particularly when one adds the provisions of clause 10.l.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

96	Mr Slattery relied initially on damages for breach of contract having been
occasioned in New South Wales, which he submitted
satisfied sub-rule (a).  Mr
Jackman submitted that damage is not the gist of an action for breach of
contract and, accordingly, the
cause of action did not arise where the damage
occurred.  He also relied on authorities defining "cause of action" as meaning
"the
act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff cause of
complaint": <b>Distillers Co (Biochemicals Limited) v Thompson</b> [1971] AC458
and <b>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538.</a>  It is
not necessary to pursue this matter further because in his final submissions,
notwithstanding the written submissions, Mr
Slattery conceded that his
submission could not be correct and he withdrew it.
<P>

<b>The Purchase Agreement</b>
<P>

97	The next agreement to which regard must be had is the Purchase Agreement
pleaded in paragraph 32.  That agreement was not entered
into in New South
Wales.  I am not satisfied that the breach of it occurred in New South Wales.
The breach pleaded in paragraph 34
is that shipment was not delayed.  This
overlooks that delivery was to be made in England to the plaintiff's freight
forwarder, which
would arrange shipment.  However, if this be thought to be
over-technical,  the breach, therefore, occurred when the goods were delivered
to the first defendant for shipment without delay and, in my opinion, each
breach, if there were two, occurred in England.  Either
breach, of course, had
the consequence that the goods were delivered in New South Wales earlier than
it is alleged they were agreed
to be.  However, that was a consequence of the
breach rather than its occurrence.  In the result I do not consider that the
Purchase
Agreement is one in respect of which the plaintiff has established the
necessary jurisdictional nexus.  Essentially for the reasons
I have given I do
not consider that it has been established that the law of New South Wales is
the proper law of this agreement nor
of the General Distribution Agreement.
<P>

<b>The General Distribution Agreement</b>
<P>

98	The General Distribution Agreement was allegedly entered into on 15 November
1996, in the circumstances to which I have referred.
 I have noted the
plaintiff's submissions as to how that occurred.  Mr Jackman has submitted that
it is artificial to regard Mr Mendels'
facsimile transmission of 15 November
1996 as an offer, which the first defendant accepted by the supply of goods.
He has submitted
that Mr Mendels was accepting the terms offered to him by the
first defendant's facsimile transmission of 14 November 1996.  In my
view this
submission should not be accepted.  It is clear from the correspondence to
which I have referred that the first defendant
was seeking an offer from the
plaintiff.  In my opinion it would be straining the words emanating from the
first defendant too far
to find that the proffered draft agreement amounted to
an offer.  At best the first defendant was indicating that it was prepared
to
treat on the basis of the terms of that draft agreement if the plaintiff made
an offer pursuant to it.
<P>

99	The difficulty, so far as the acceptance of the offer by conduct is
concerned, is that the plaintiff proffered order forms requiring
delivery to
JAS Freight Forwarders at an address in England: pp.27, 50 and 80 of Exhibit A.
Further clause 3.8 of the draft Distribution
Agreement provided that the price
was to be "FOB UK", which means, as was not disputed by Mr Slattery, that the
property in the goods
passed in England: Exhibit A p.30.  In Exhibit A at p.35
there is a facsimile transmission from Mr Mendels to the first defendant
stating:-
<P>

	<b>"Would you please ensure that these goods are shipped to JAS by Friday the
22nd November in order to make our consolidation on Saturday.
 Delivery details
on our order (copy attached)."</b>
<P>

In my view this shows that the acceptance was to be by performance in England
and, therefore, the contract was not entered into
in New South Wales.
<P>

<b>Estoppel</b>
<P>

100	The plaintiff relies upon an estoppel of the type identified in <b>Waltons
Stores (Interstate) Limited</b>.   The six elements required to be proved by
the plaintiff to give rise to such an estoppel, which were identified by
Brennan J at
pp.428-429, were cited,  namely:-
<P>

	<b>"In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a
plaintiff to prove that: </b>
<P>

<b>	(1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed
between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that
a particular legal
relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the
defendant would not be free to withdraw
from the expected legal relationship;
</b>
<P>

<b>	(2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or
expectation;</b>
<P>

<b>	(3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the
assumption or expectation;</b>
<P>

<b>	(4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so;</b>
<P>

<b>	(5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the
assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and</b>
<P>

<b>	(6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by
fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." </b>
<P>

101	It must be borne in mind that in that case there had not been an exchange
of contracts necessary to bring into existence a binding
agreement for a lease,
but that, none-the-less, the appellant was estopped from denying that it was
bound by reason of its conduct.
 However, in my opinion, that is very different
from the present case where the parties clearly had entered into contractual
relations
and, as Mr Slattery has submitted, the plaintiff's primary case is
based on the existence of a contract.
<P>

102	It seems to me that in the present case the existence of the contracts is
highly significant, because the relief sought by the
plaintiff is that the
first defendant is estopped from denying the existence and terms of the
Carmageddon 2 Distribution Agreement,
the Purchase Agreement, or,
alternatively, the General Distribution Agreement.  I am satisfied, for the
reasons I have given, that
the plaintiff has established, to the extent
required at this stage, that such agreements existed and, viewing the evidence
as a
whole, there can be no doubt that the parties considered that they were in
contractual relations.  Therefore, in my opinion, it becomes
artificial to be
seeking to raise an issue of estoppel.  Put another way I do not understand the
first defendant to be denying that
the parties entered into contractual
relations.  The issues are where the contracts were entered into, their terms
and where, if
at all, they were breached.  In the event of it being found that
any of the contracts were breached the further questions  arise
as to damages
and where any proceedings should be brought.
<P>

103	Mr Slattery submitted that it may be that the defendants will seek to raise
defences that no contract or contracts were entered
into and that, in those
circumstances, he should not be precluded from pleading an estoppel at this
stage.  I disagree.  The question
whether a contract was entered into requires
consideration of a number of questions.  Many matters relevant to that issue
could not,
in the ordinary run of cases, give rise to a question of estoppel.
The evidence does not satisfy me that in the present case that
may happen.
<P>

104	In <b>News Corporation</b>, Giles J considered the question of estoppel at
length and, at p.571, expressed the view:-
<P>

	<b>"I consider that the better view is that the cause of action arose in
America or England, where there took place the conduct which
generated the
assumption (the telephone conferences), the adoption of the assumption (Mr
McWilliam's reliance), and the second element
of that which could make
departure from the assumption unconscionable (failure to give notice to News).
The argument for the cause
of action arising in New South Wales is, in my view,
far from strong, and I do not think it achieves a prima facie or arguable case
of sufficient satisfaction that News has established that the estoppel claim
comes within paragraph (a) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> rule 1A(1)."</b>
<P>

This confirmed that estoppel may be a cause of action but, in the view to which
I have come, the estoppel claim is irrelevant and
inappropriate.
<P>

<b>Fiduciary Duty</b>
<P>

105	The next claim concerns breach of fiduciary duty, it being alleged that the
first defendant owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiff.
 The circumstances in
which fiduciary duties may arise in a commercial context have been essentially
laid down by the High Court
in <b>Hospital Products Limited v United States
Surgical Corporation &amp; Ors</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41.</a>  In that case it was held
that a fiduciary relationship did not exist between a supplier and its supply
agent at the suit of the
supplier.  Mr Slattery accepted this, but he said that
the facts of each case must be looked at and that one could not say that merely
because a commercial relationship existed between the parties there was not a
fiduciary duty.  I shall assume, for present purposes,
that that is correct.
However, when one looks at the facts of the present case I am not satisfied,
having regard to the onus carried
by the plaintiff, that it has established any
facts which relevantly distinguish the case from <b>Hospital Products</b>.  I
should also note that Mr Slattery expressly abandoned the submission that
breach of a fiduciary duty constituted a tortious act
or omission.
<P>

<b>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> And The Fair Trading Act</b>
<P>

106	Finally the plaintiff relied, as against the first defendant, upon
sub-rules (m) and (s) in addition to sub-rule (a), the first
two of which
provide respectively:-
<P>

<b>"(m)	where the proceedings concern the construction, effect or enforcement
of an Imperial Act or Commonwealth Act, or a regulation
or other instrument
having or purporting to have effect under such an Act, affecting property in
the State;</b>
<P>

<b>  ...</b>
<P>

<b>  (s)	where the proceedings concern the construction, effect or enforcement
of an Act or a regulation or other instrument having or
purporting to have
effect under an Act."</b>
<P>

	
<P>

107	The claims under the Acts assert that the representations and each of them
were and was made in trade or commerce, that they
were misleading and deceptive
or likely to mislead or deceive, that the defendants intended to reserve the
right not to appoint the
plaintiff its distributor of "Carmageddon 2" in
Australia and New Zealand or to supply "Carmageddon 2" to it in the future and
failed
to inform the plaintiff of this intention:-
<P>

	<b>".. which in the circumstances hereinbefore pleaded by reason of s.51A of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> and s.41 of the Fair Trading Act was misleading or
deceptive, or was likely to mislead or deceive."</b>
<P>

108	In paragraph 55 it was pleaded that "by reason of its reliance upon the
misleading conduct referred to in paragraphs 53 and
54" the plaintiff has
suffered loss and damage.  It is not in issue, as I understand it, that the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a></b> does not have extra-territorial operation, and
that the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> only has that operation to the extent
provided in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5</a>, which has no applicability to the first defendant.  Nor was it
in issue that the first defendant was neither incorporated in nor
carried on
business in Australia.  In these circumstances it is necessary, in my opinion,
to have regard to any representations,
which were made in Australia.  In
paragraph 18 the second representation is pleaded as one having been made in
Australia that "Carmageddon
2" would be released in 1998.  The fifth
representations are pleaded in paragraph 25 as having been made in Australia
between 1 and
3 December 1997, the relevant representation (in the sense of
providing a foundation for a cause of action), in my opinion, being
that
pleaded in sub-paragraph (c), namely:-
<P>

	<b>"There was no way that SCI would work with any other distributor in the
Territory of Australia and New Zealand."</b>
<P>

There is no direct evidence from Mr Mendels that, in reliance on this
representation, he caused the plaintiff to act in any way
differently from the
way in which it otherwise would have acted.  There is no doubt that the
plaintiff continued to do business with
the first defendant, and the reasonable
inference is that if it had been told something to the contrary it would not
have done so.
 But that is a somewhat different proposition and, on the whole
of the evidence, I am not satisfied that this representation caused
the
plaintiff to continue to trade with the first defendant.  I consider it would
have continued to do so. Nor, in consequence thereof,
am I satisfied that it
suffered any financial loss.  Damages are the only remedy sought under the
Acts.
<P>

109	The eighth representation, which is pleaded in paragraph 35, relates to the
fact that the release schedule for "Carmageddon
2" was November 1998, and the
ninth representations, which are alleged to have been made in Australia on 24
September 1998, assert
that the first defendant had not appointed anyone else
to be a distributor for its products in Australia, and that the plaintiff
was
the only distributor of its products in Australia.
<P>

110	Section 51A(1) provides:-
<P>

	<b>"For the purposes of this Division, where a corporation makes a
representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing
of, or
the refusing to do, any act) and the corporation does not have reasonable
grounds for making the representation, the representation
shall be taken to be
misleading."</b>
<P>

111	It was not contended by Mr Jackman that the representations to which I have
referred were not, as the evidence presently stands,
made in Australia.  Rather
he submitted that the evidence does not establish a prima facie case for
damages for misleading and deceptive
conduct in relation to those
representations and that there is no evidence to suggest that the second, fifth
and eighth representations
were false either as to matters of fact or as to the
first defendant's intentions.
<P>

In my opinion the second and eighth representations cannot give rise to any
cause of action, there being no suggestion of any falsity
in relation to them.
I think that the fifth representations, and particularly the one to which I
have referred, do constitute representations
on which the plaintiff could sue
if it had established a prima facie case of reliance and damage.  In my
opinion, the onus would
have been on the first defendant to show that it had
reasonable grounds for making the representation.  However, as I have said,
the
evidence does not satisfy me that there was reliance or damage.
<P>

112	Mr Jackman conceded that there was evidence that the ninth representation
was false.  He submitted that the evidence did not
establish that the plaintiff
acted to its detriment in reliance on that representation, nor that it suffered
any damage in consequence
of it.  I am satisfied that these submissions must be
accepted.  On 25 September 1998 Mr Mandels was advised that there was another
agent and he immediately acted.  Thereafter the E-mails of 1 and 2 October 1998
were received.  The plaintiff did not act in reliance
on the representation and
suffered no damage by virtue of its falsity.
<P>

113	So far as the claims under the Acts are concerned, I have proceeded on the
basis most favourable to the plaintiff, viz that
in so far as representations
were made in Australia it would be entitled to sue on them if it could show a
prima facie case for the
elements of the claim.  I do not think that the
exclusive law or jurisdiction clause would relate to those claims and, if
otherwise
satisfied of the necessary requirements, I would have allowed these
claims to proceed in New South Wales.  But I am not so satisfied.
<P>

<b>The Claim Against The Second Defendant</b>
<P>

114	My rejection of the claims under the Acts against the first defendant
necessarily means that the claims against the second defendant
cannot be
allowed to proceed.  However, lest others take the view that my decision in
this regard is wrong, I shall deal briefly
with those claims.
<P>

115	The claim based upon s.75B of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> requires it to
be strictly proved that the person was an intentional participant, the
necessary intent being based upon knowledge
of the essential elements of the
contravention: <b>Yorke &amp; Anor v Lucas</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20158%20CLR%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 158 CLR 661.</a>
<P>

116	I am not satisfied that the second defendant had the necessary intent or
knowledge in relation to the fifth representations,
notwithstanding that he
made them.  I have pointed out that the relevant representation in those
representations relates to future
conduct upon which the onus of proof of
reasonable cause would lie on the first defendant.  In my view it is very
difficult to attribute
the necessary knowledge and intent to a person alleged
to be guilty of accessory liability in those circumstances.
<P>

117	As to the ninth representations, however, I am satisfied that the proper
inference to be drawn from all the facts is that the
second defendant, at the
prima facie level with which I am dealing with the matter, had the necessary
knowledge and intent on the
basis of which I would have permitted the
proceedings to go ahead against him, but for the reasons to which I have
referred.
<P>

118	Finally, the plaintiff sought damages against the second defendant in that
he knowingly participated in the breaches of fiduciary
duty.  Once again it is
possible to dispose of this matter on the basis that the principal claim has
not been made out.  Once again,
as others may take the view that it has been, I
shall deal with it.  Mr Jackman submitted that this allegation requires proof
of
dishonesty: <b>Royal Brunei Airlines SDN BHD v Tan</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378.</a>  In
delivering the opinion of the Privy Council Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said,
at p.392:-
<P>

	<b>"Drawing the threads together, their Lordships' overall conclusion is that
dishonesty is a necessary ingredient of accessory liability.
 It is also a
sufficient ingredient.  A liability in equity to make good resulting loss
attaches to a person who dishonestly procures
or assists in a breach of trust
or fiduciary obligation.  It is not necessary that, in addition, the trustee or
fiduciary was acting
dishonestly, although this will usually be so where the
third party who is assisting him is acting dishonestly.  `Knowingly' is better
avoided as a defining ingredient of the principle, and in the context of this
principle <i>The Baden</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 509</a> scale of knowledge is best
forgotten."</b>
<P>

119	When one goes back to paragraph 49 of the Summons I am unable to conclude
that all the allegations are ones in respect of which
the necessary test can be
said to apply to the second defendant.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

120	In the result I am of the view that the service of the Summons on the
defendants should be set aside in whole and that the proceedings
should be
stayed generally.  The consequence of coming to this view is that the
plaintiff's Notice of Motion should be dismissed.
<P>

121	The parties did not address me on costs, but I see no reason why costs
should not follow the event.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

122	I order that:-
<P>

(1)	The service of the Summons filed on 28 January 1999 on each of the
defendants be set aside in whole.
<P>

(2)	The proceedings commenced by that Summons be stayed generally.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed on 19 April 1999 be dismissed.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings including both
Notices of Motion.
<P>

(5)	Exhibits be returned.
