12914/97  -  THE PROTHONOTARY  v  WILSON
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This matter comes before the court by way of a
summons, filed by The Prothonotary, seeking declarations in the
following
terms:
<P>

"1.  A declaration that the defendant is guilty of contempt of court in that on
5 September 1997 after judgment was handed down
by the Hon. Acting Justice
Murray in the matter of John Wilson v Terence Greenwood and six others in the
Supreme Court of New South
Wales, the defendant did throw a plastic bag filled
with paint at Acting Justice Murray and did thereby conduct himself in a manner
which tended to interfere with the administration of justice.
<P>

2.  A declaration that the defendant is guilty of contempt of court in that on
5 September 1997 after judgment was handed down by
the Hon. Acting Justice
Murray in the matter of John Wilson v Terence Greenwood and six others in the
Supreme Court of New South
Wales, the defendant did throw a further plastic bag
filled with paint at Acting Justice Murray and did thereby conduct himself in
a
manner which tended to interfere with the administration of justice."
<P>

2  	The summons further seeks orders that the defendant be punished
or otherwise dealt with for contempt of court.  The Statement
of Charges
annexed to the summons is in the following terms:
<P>

"1.  It is alleged that the defendant is guilty of contempt of court in that on
5 September 1997 after judgment was handed down
by the Honourable Acting
Justice Murray in the matter of John Wilson v Terence Greenwood and six others
in the Supreme Court of New
South Wales, he did throw a plastic bag filled with
paint at Acting Justice Murray and did thereby conduct himself in a manner
which
tended to interfere with the administration of justice.
<P>

2.  It is alleged that the defendant is guilty of contempt of court in that on
5 September 1997 after judgment was handed down by
the Honourable Acting
Justice Murray in the matter of John Wilson v Terence Greenwood and six others
in the Supreme Court of New
South Wales, he did throw a further plastic bag
filled with paint at Acting Justice Murray and did thereby conduct himself in a
manner
which tended to interfere with the administration of justice."
<P>

3  	The particulars of contempt alleged in the summons are as
follows:
<P>

"1.  On 24 July 1997 the defendant filed a Statement of Claim in the Supreme
Court Registry, Common Law Division, against seven
defendants namely Terence
Greenwood, the Hon. Justice John Hamilton, the Hon. Matthew Clarke, the Hon.
Justice Alan Abadee, the Hon.
Sir Darryl Dawson, the Hon. Justice Michael Kirby
and the Hon. Justice John Toohey.
<P>

2.  On 4 August 1997 a Notice of Motion was filed in court on behalf of the
defendants seeking that the proceedings be dismissed,
alternatively, that the
statement of claim be struck out.
<P>

3.  On 25 August 1997 the Notice of Motion was argued before the Hon. Acting
Justice Murray in the Supreme Court.  Judgment was
reserved.
<P>

4.  On 5 September 1997 the matter was listed for judgment to be delivered.
The defendant appeared in person.  The defendant brought
into court a black
folder inside which was a hidden cavity containing three plastic bags filled
with yellow paint.
<P>

5.  Before judgment was delivered, the defendant asked his Honour:  
<P>

4  	
<P>

'May I record or will there be a transcript?'
<P>

At this time the defendant was observed to be holding a dictaphone in his
hand.
<P>

5  	
<P>

His Honour replied:
<P>

'I will be handing down a copy of my reasons
<P>

so there won't be anything to record, other than that the proceedings are
dismissed.  I order the respondent to pay the applicants'
costs.  I publish my
reasons.'
<P>

6  	Immediately upon these words being uttered by his Honour, the
defendant threw one of the bags of paint towards him.  The bag
hit his Honour
and landed on the bench before him, causing yellow paint to splash onto his
Honour's coat.  The defendant then threw
a second plastic bag of yellow paint
towards his Honour.  The second bag landed between the judge's Associate and
the Court Reporter,
splashing paint on impact.  The court staff thereafter
restrained the defendant.
<P>

7  	
<P>

8  	6.  The actions of the defendant referred to in the paragraph 5
of these particulars tended to interfere with the administration
of justice in
that:
<P>

9  	
<P>

(a)  they were intended or were likely or calculated to intimidate his Honour
and discourage him from performing his judicial function:
<P>

(b)  they were intended or were likely or calculated to intimidate judicial
officers and discourage them from performing their judicial
function; and
<P>

(c)  they were intended or were likely or calculated to impair public
confidence in and respect for the courts.
<P>

7.  On 12 September 1997 the Honourable Mr Justice David Hunt, Chief Judge at
Common Law, ordered the Acting Prothonotary of New
South Wales to commence
proceedings against the defendant for contempt."
<P>

10  	When the matter came on for hearing this morning the defendant,
Mr Wilson, pursued his claim to trial by jury and objected
to the jurisdiction
of the court.
<P>

11  	Having heard various objections formulated by him in this
regard, it was my decision that the matter should proceed in a summary
fashion
without a jury.  Evidence was called from various witnesses in the form of
affidavits.  None of those deponents was required
for cross-examination and
none of their evidence was challenged in any form.
<P>

12  	In substance, the events of the day upon which the offences are
alleged to have occurred were recalled by Catherine Olsen,
the Associate to
Acting Justice Brian Murray, in the following terms:
<P>

"5.  At about 10am on 5 September 1997 Murray AJ came onto the bench in Court 1
in the King Street Court building.  I called the
case and handed to the Judge
the written judgment.  After I called the case Mr Wilson came forward to the
bar table and said to Murray
AJ words to the following effect:
<P>

'Can I record the proceedings?'
<P>

At this time I saw that he had in his hand a small recording machine.
<P>

Murray AJ said words to the following effect:
<P>

'That will not be necessary as I am about to hand down a written judgment.'
<P>

6.  Murray AJ then said words to the following effect:
<P>

'In this matter the proceedings are dismissed.  The respondent is to pay the
applicants' costs.'
<P>

As Murray AJ was saying these words, I saw that John Wilson was still standing
at the bar table with a black Lever Arch folder on
the table.  I saw John
Wilson's arms move and then wave about in a throwing motion.  I saw an object
hurl very quickly towards Murray
AJ.  I then turned around and saw that Murray
AJ's suit coat was splashed with a yellow substance.  There were also splashes
of the
same substance on the bench in front of him.  A plastic bag which looked
as if it had burst had landed on the bench above me.  At
first I did not know
what the yellow substance was.  It looked as if the substance may be an acid of
some type and quickly pulled
it off the bench onto the floor between the Court
Reporter and myself.  While I was doing this, another missile was thrown.  This
second missile landed between myself and the Court Reporter.  At this time the
Court Officer grabbed Mr Wilson who struggled with
him.  The Judge's Tipstaff
Bernard Roach then went to assist.  The Court adjourned and I went to the ante
room to help Murray AJ.
 I then saw Bernard Roach telephone security.  I
subsequently examined the Murray AJ's coat and found that the substance
appeared
to be yellow paint.  This paint was on the left breast and lapel area
of Murray AJ's suit.  I also saw the Court Reporter's dress
was splattered with
yellow substance.  There was also some yellow paint on my jacket."
<P>

13  	The account given by Ms Olsen has been supplemented by a further
affidavit to which were annexed a series of photographs showing
the paint which
landed on the bench and on the floor in the vicinity of the bench.  Those
photographs further show the black folder
which was found on the Bar table in
the immediate presence of Mr Wilson, which contained a further plastic
container within the hollowed
out cavity.
<P>

14  	Ms Olsen's account has been corroborated in the affidavit of the
Tipstaff, Bernard Lee Roach, who was similarly present on
5 September 1997 when
the incident described occurred.  
<P>

15  	Mr Roach described how he and Walter Baer, the Court Officer,
took hold of Mr Wilson after the paint was thrown and restrained
him pending
arrival of security.  That account is corroborated by the Court Officer, Walter
Baer, who described seeing Mr Wilson
open up a folder which he had placed on
the Bar table, remove a yellow packet from the folder and throw it at Acting
Justice Murray.
 This witness said that he saw the packet hit Acting Justice
Murray in the region of his left chest shoulder area, after which he
saw Mr
Wilson remove a second yellow package from the folder which was then thrown
towards the bench.
<P>

16  	The accounts of these witnesses have been supplemented by
affidavits sworn by Gregory Peter McNally of counsel, who was waiting
in court
for the matter of <b>Duggan v Parrett</b> to be called on, after judgment was
delivered in the reserved matter concerning Mr Wilson.  This witness said that
he examined the
folder which had been placed on the Bar table.  He confirmed
that, when seen by him, it appeared to contain a number of court documents
which had been cut out, to create a cavity.  Within that cavity were contained
the plastic bags filled with paint.
<P>

17  	Similar observations were made by Maina Gordon, a Solicitor
instructing Nicole Abadee of counsel, who was similarly briefed
to appear in
the matter of Duggan v Parrett.
<P>

18  	The final piece of evidence in the proceedings concerns a
facsimile transmission and press release, which Natalie Jane Adams,
a Solicitor
employed in the office of I V Knight, Crown Solicitor, has said was received by
her on 14 November 1997.  This document
purports to be under the hand of Mr
Wilson and, so far as it constitutes a press release, contains a clear
admission that he had
thrown paint at Acting Justice Murray.
<P>

19  	Relevantly, the document contains various complaints made by Mr
Wilson concerning the judicial system and concludes with the
following
paragraph:
<P>

"Frustration at the total corruption of our system of law and justice meant
that something had to be done to break out of the clutches
or stranglehold
maintained by the judges who were not only protecting fraud but each other.
But this judge caused me to hold out
a glimmer of hope because, at the first
hearing when I presented my verbal argument, he did not immediately dismiss my
claims but
reserved his judgment to go away and consider the situation saying
he would let me know when he had made up his mind.  However, when
I was called
to return for his ruling eleven days later, no representative was there from
the solicitors for the seven judges to
hear the decision which indicated
collusion (a secret understanding).  When the judge smiled and dismissed the
claim, I threw a plastic
bag containing yellow paint which made a 7 mm stain on
the judge's suit.  If the judge was doing 'a lawful thing', causing an injury
or detriment to him and an indictable offence and I am liable to a penalty of
ten years' imprisonment and the destruction of my own
life. But the banks have
destroyed countless numbers of Australian lives by their fraudulent contracts
and those crimes are being
covered up by judges whom are supposed to be
administering law and justice but who are, in fact, accomplices.  The entire
situation
is gravely serious and the way of a jury trial is our last hope."
<P>

20  	It is clear from this recital of the evidence that the
particulars contained in the summons have been made good upon an evidentiary
basis.
<P>

21  	The principles applicable to a case such as the present are
clear:
<P>

(a)  The form of contempt in question is that which involves conduct in the
face of the court or in the course of proceedings and
which obstructs or
interferes with the due administration of justice or is calculated to do so -
as that concept has been explained
in decisions such as <b>Parashuram Detaram
Shamdasani v King-Emperor </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1945%5d%20AC%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1945] AC 264</a> and <b>Ex parte Bellanto re
Prior</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20SR%20NSW%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] SR NSW 190</a> especially at pp 199 to 204.
<P>

(b)  The gravamen of the offence lies not in protecting the personal dignity of
the judge who may be the object of an assault or
personal attack but of
protecting the public from the mischief that will incur if the authority of the
courts is undermined or impaired.
 The point is well made in the judgments of
the Court of Appeal in <b> Re Johnson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2020%20QBD%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 20 QBD 68</a> where Bowen LJ
said:
<P>

"What is the principle which we have here to apply?  It seems to me to be this.
The law has armed the High Court of Justice with
the power and imposed on it
the duty of preventing brevi manu and by summary proceedings any attempt to
interfere with the administration
of justice.  It is on that ground, and not on
any exaggerated notion of the dignity of individuals that insults to judges are
not
allowed.  It is on the same ground that insults to witnesses or to jurymen
are not allowed.  The principle is that those who have
duties to discharge in a
court of justice are protected by the law, and shielded on their way to the
discharge of such duties, while
discharging them, and on their return
therefrom, in order that such persons may safely have resort to courts of
justice."
<P>

22  	Lord Esher MR similarly emphasised that the gravamen of the
offence is an attack on a judge in his judicial capacity and in
the exercise of
his office, the contempt not being of the judge, but of the court in which he
is acting.
<P>

23  	These observations were cited with approval by the court in
<b>Ex parte Bellanto re Prior</b> at 203.  Observations to similar effect may
be seen in <b>Bell v Stewart</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2028%20CLR%20413" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 28 CLR 413</a> at 428 to 429; <b>R v
Dunbabim</b>;<b> Ex parte Williams</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1935/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2053%20CLR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 53 CLR 434</a> at 442 to 443 and
<b>Ex parte Tuckerman re Nash</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%203%20NSWR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 3 NSWR 23.</a>  
<P>

(c)  Conduct which qualifies as contempt of this kind is not confined to
something said or done while the proceedings are pending,
or even in the course
of being heard.  As Donovan LJ said in <b>Attorney General v Butterworth</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20QB%20696" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 QB 696</a>, in a passage at 723, applied in <b>R v Wright (No 1)</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1968/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] VicRp 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20VR%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] VR 164</a> at 166:
<P>

"The question to be decided here, as in all cases of alleged contempt of court,
is whether the action complained of is calculated
to interfere with the proper
administration of justice.  There is more than one way of so interfering.  The
authority of a court
may be lowered by scurrilous abuse.  Its effectiveness to
do justice may be diminished or destroyed in a pending case by frightening
intending witnesses from the witness box.  After giving evidence a witness may
be punished for having done so, thereby deterring
potential witnesses in future
cases from risking a like vengeance.  I see no such difference between any of
these three methods as
makes the first two contempt of court, and the third
not.  Each is calculated to do the same thing, namely, to interfere with the
proper administration of the law in courts of justice."
<P>

24  	To similar effect were the observations of Lord Denning MR at
719 and of Pearson LJ at 728.
<P>

25  	This principle has similarly been recognised in decisions such
as <b>In the matter of Samuel Goldman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%203%20NSWR%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 3 NSWR 325</a> at 328 and <b>Re
Johnson</b> per Bowen LJ at 74.
<P>

(d)  The principle expressed in these cases concerning witnesses and parties is
equally applicable to conduct that can be seen as
calculated to deter judicial
officers from doing their duty.  The concern is similarly with the harm done to
the present and future
administration of justice, a system in which judicial
officers possess an integral role. 
<P>

(e)  Contempt of the kind here charged is criminal in nature.  The ingredients
of the charge must be proved to the criminal standard;
that is, beyond
reasonable doubt:  see <b>Witham v Holloway</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 525</a> at 550.
<P>

(f)  Proof of an intention to interfere in the administration of justice is not
an ingredient of the charge (<b>Attorney General of New South Wales v Dean</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20650" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 650</a> at 655.)  The relevant principles was stated in this
decision by the Court in the following terms at p 656:
<P>

"The matter of overriding importance is to prevent interference with the proper
course of trials; that interference is just as real,
and needs to be prevented,
whether it is intentional or not.  At all events, the law binding on and
applied by this Court is clear.
 It is sufficient that the prosecution show
that the alleged contemptor had the intention to make the statements which,
objectively,
had the requisite tendency to interfere in the fair trial of the
accused.
<P>

26  	The statements must be looked at objectively to determine
whether they were calculated to interfere with the course of justice.
 It is
necessary for the prosecutor to prove that tendency beyond reasonable doubt.
The absence of the specific intent, by those
words, to interfere in the
administration of justice is no answer or defence to a charge of contempt.  On
the other hand, the presence
or absence of such an intention will be relevant
to the Court's decision as to penalty."
<P>

(g)  Summary trial is now the ordinary procedure for the determination of
contempt charges.  (<b>The Registrar of Court of Appeal v Willesee</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20NSWLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2
NSWLR 378</a> and <b>United Telecasters Sydney Ltd v Hardy </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 323</a>
at 330.)  Any suggestion to the contrary in earlier decisions has to be
understood as confined to the circumstance that the remedy
should not be
misused and is reserved for clear cases.
<P>

(h)  Criminal contempt is an offence punishable by imprisonment or fine or
release on recognisance.  Other sentencing options such
as community service
are open within the inherent jurisdiction of the court (<b>Registrar, The Court
of Appeal v Manian (No 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20309" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 309).</a>  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a>
applies to any sentence of an imprisonment that may be imposed (<b>Young v
Jackman</b>, Court of Appeal New South Wales, 2 June 1993, unreported).
<P>

It is obvious beyond question that a physical assault upon a judicial officer
in connection with the performance of his or her duty
constitutes not only a
contempt in the face of the court but a very serious contempt.  It would be
extraordinary if it were otherwise.
 If support were needed for such a
proposition it can be seen in Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, vol 9, pp 4
to 5 and in the
decision of Acting Justice Slattery in <b>R v Keith David
Herring</b>, 3 October 1991, unreported.
<P>

The conduct of the defendant in the present case is of that kind.  His acts, I
find, were intended, in the sense that he deliberately
threw a plastic bag of
paint at Acting Justice Murray, some of which struck his clothing and then
threw a second container in the
direction of the bench.  These acts occurred
while his Honour was announcing his decision in a proceeding, in which the
defendant
was a party, and while he was publishing his reasons for that
decision before proceeding to the other matters listed for hearing
that day.
It occurred in the presence of other litigants.  It was of a kind that was
likely to occasion serious alarm, and it was
such as to interfere with the
administration of justice, and to undermine the authority of the Courts.
<P>

27  	I am satisfied that the actions of the defendant were
premeditated and that he came to court with the paint concealed in a
folder
containing a number of documents which had been cut out in order to create a
cavity to contain the bags of paint.  The only
rational inference open is that
he came to court prepared to throw the paint at Acting Justice Murray in the
event of the proceedings
being decided adversely to himself.  
<P>

28  	Each of the acts described above in these circumstances
constitutes a separate and clear  contempt of court.
<P>

29  	I make declarations in accordance with pars 1 and 2 of the
summons.  The defendant is convicted of the two counts of contempt
which have
been preferred, as particularised in the summons.  I will hear submissions on
sentence.
