<b></b><p>
<b></b>Balmoral Beach and its environs, including the building known as the
Bathers Pavilion is zoned<i> </i>community land under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government
Act </i>1993</a> (the Act).  Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(1)</a> of the Act, the first respondent was
required to prepare a draft plan of management in respect of community land.  A
draft plan was
prepared in early 1995.  However, as it incorrectly categorised
the land, council's resolution adopting the Plan was declared invalid.
 On 29
August 1995, the first respondent resolved to adopt an amended version of the
original plan of management.  Although some
of the amendments were exhibited,
two further sets of amendments were made to the plan, and were not exhibited.
The first respondent
is currently proposing to grant a lease to 7the second
respondent of the Bathers Pavilion building pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 46</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s47.html" class="autolink_findacts">47</a> of
the Act.  The first respondent has also granted Development Consent to proposed
alterations to the Pavilion.<p>
<p>
The appellant appealed from the decision of Stein J, arguing that the Plan of
Management adopted by the first respondent on 29 August
1993 did not comply
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36.</a>  Secondly, if it did comply with the requirements of the Act, the
appellant argued that the lease that the first respondent proposes
to grant to
the second respondent is not authorised by or is in not in accordance with the
Plan of Management.  Thirdly, the appellant
argued that a development consent
granted by the first respondent to the second respondent on 14 July 1995 was
invalid.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>HELD: </b><p>
<b>(1)</b>	The Plan of Management, in specifying the objectives and performance
targets of the plan, complied with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(b).</a>  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>(2)</b>	The Plan of Management did not comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(c)</a> as it
substantially failed to specify the "<i>means</i>" by which the first
respondent proposed to achieve the stated objectives and performance targets.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>(3)	</b>The area of Balmoral Beach and Environs, as an integrated whole, was
appropriately categorised as "<i>park</i>" in the Plan of Management.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>(4) </b>	The second and third sets of amendments to the Plan of Management
were not substantial, and were not required to be re-exhibited
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40.</a> <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>(5)	</b>The proposed lease by the first respondent to the second respondent
is not authorised by the Plan of Management.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>(6)</b>	The phrase "<i>nature and use"</i> in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> is not a composite phrase
and is to be read disjunctively.  An increase in use may amount to a change in
the use of the land.  The
proposed increase in the restaurant seating capacity
of 40% amounted to a change in use within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44.</a>  The development consent was
thereby invalid.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ORDERS</b><p>
<p>
The Court orders:<p>
<p>
1.	The appeal be allowed;<p>
2.	The respondent pay the appellant's costs of the appeal and of the
proceedings below.<p>
<p>
The Court declares that:<p>
3.	The resolution of the first respondent dated 29 August 1995 adopting the
Plan of Management is invalid.<p>
4.	The development consent for alterations and additions to the Balmoral
Bathers Pavilion granted by the first respondent on 14 July
1995 is invalid.<p>
<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><u></u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u><center></u><b>PRIESTLEY JA:</b> I have had the benefit of reading in draft
Beazley JA's statement of the facts and her reasons on the various issues in
this appeal.<p>
</center>	Except for a reservation on one issue, which does not affect the
outcome of the case, I agree with Beazley JA's reasons and conclusions
and do
not wish to add to what she has said.<p>
	The issue about which I have a reservation is the one Beazley JA deals with
under the heading "<i>Were the second and third amendments substantial?</i>". I
find this question a difficult one and because, in view of my agreement with
the balance of Beazley JA's reasons, it is unnecessary
for me to answer it, I
refrain from doing so.<p>
	I agree with the orders and declarations proposed by Beazley JA.<p>
<p>
			<p>
<b>MEAGHER JA:</b> I agree with Beazley JA.<p>
<p>
<center><b>BEAZLEY JA:</b>  This is an appeal from a decision of Stein J in the
Land and Environment Court in respect of Class 4 proceedings.  The appeal to
the Court is a full appeal on both fact and law: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/laeca1979274/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 58</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/laeca1979274/" class="autolink_findacts">Land and
Environment Court Act 1979</a> (NSW): see <i>Fatsel Pty Ltd v ACR Trading Pty Ltd
(No 3) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2064%20LGRA%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 64 LGRA 177</a> at 179.  The essential issue on the appeal is
whether the first respondent presently has the capacity to grant a lease of a
building
known as the Bathers Pavilion at Balmoral Beach.  That issue requires
the resolution of three questions.  First, whether the Plan
of Management
adopted by the first respondent on 29 August 1995 complied with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act </i>1993</a> (the LGA 1993).  Secondly, if the Plan
complied with the LGA 1993, whether a lease proposed to be granted by the first
respondent
to the second respondent in respect of the Bathers Pavilion is
authorised by or is in accordance with the Plan of Management.  Thirdly,
whether a development consent granted by the first respondent to the second
respondent on 14 July 1995 is valid.<p>
</center><u></u><p>
<u>Background</u><p>
Balmoral Beach is a popular harbourside beach within the municipality of
Mosman.  It is described in the first respondent's Plan
of Management (being
the plan under challenge) as "<i>a symbol of the `Mosman' lifestyle"</i>.  For
the purposes of the Plan of Management, the first respondent treated Balmoral
Beach and its environs, comprising 17.05 hectares
of land in 27 separate
parcels, as an integrated whole.  Its major features as described in the Plan
of Management include:<p>
<i>". . .the panoramic views over Middle Harbour; the boatshed and the boating
activities; the beach with its different formal and informal
facilities; the
lawns and associated exotic trees, picnic and shelter facilities; the playing
fields and their support facilities;
the sailing club; the promenade and
historic sea wall; the historic beach pavilion and rotunda; the restaurants and
other food outlets;
the surrounding bush; the pathways and scenic streets
linking to the beach; the history and the evidence of past uses."</i><p>
<p>
The historic beach pavilion referred to in this description is the Bathers
Pavilion which is the focus of these proceedings.  The
Pavilion was constructed
during 1928-1929 on a separate parcel of land owned partly by the first
respondent and partly by the Department
of Lands.  As its local name implies,
it was built for the purposes of, and used as a change and toilet facility for
users of Balmoral
Beach.  By 1967, its use by the public as changing facilities
had declined and the first respondent called for tenders for alternative
uses
of the building.  The chosen use was as a restaurant and a 15 year lease was
granted for this purpose.  The Pavilion eventually
became the site of a well
known Sydney restaurant, "<i>Mischa's</i>".<p>
The current lease of the premises is a 20 year lease commencing on 7 July 1979
and terminating on 30 June 1999.  The current lessee
is the second respondent
in these proceedings and has submitted to any order the Court may make on the
appeal.<p>
<p>
In 1989, the second respondent lodged a development application seeking
approval for the conversion of the Bathers Pavilion into
a ground floor
restaurant and private hotel.  Local controversy surrounded the application.
Development consent had not been granted
when, on 23 January 1995, the second
respondent lodged an amended development application (the DA), which is the DA
relevant to these
proceedings.  The DA abandoned the private hotel proposal and
instead, proposed an extended restaurant facility.  This proposal made
provisions for male and female change rooms and toilet facilities for the use
of the public.  The female facilities comprised five
toilets, two washbasins
and a separate shower and change area.  The male facilities comprised two
toilets, a urinal, washbasin and
a separate shower and change area.  In total,
the facilities constituted an area amounting to 2% of the overall
development.<p>
<p>
Under the Mosman Local Environmental Plan No. 1 (the LEP), gazetted on 22
January 1982, Balmoral Beach and its Environs was zoned
6(a) Existing
Recreation.  Upon the introduction of the LGA 1993, the land became community
land.  As such, the first respondent
was required to prepare a Plan of
Management:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(1).</a><p>
<p>
The first respondent prepared a draft plan for the area which it exhibited
between 16 February and 16 March 1995.  On 4 April 1995,
the first respondent
resolved to adopt the plan (the original Plan of Management) as the plan of
management for Balmoral Beach and
Environs.  Under the original Plan of
Management, the first respondent categorised the area as "<i>significant</i>".
That category finds no expression in the LGA 1993.  The appellant brought
proceedings in the Land &amp; Environment Court challenging
the validity of the
resolution adopting the original Plan of Management.  The first respondent
eventually conceded that its resolution
was invalid and of no effect.  A
declaration to that effect was made by the trial judge.<p>
<p>
Subsequent to this challenge, the first respondent amended the original Plan of
Management.  Under the amended Plan of Management,
Balmoral Beach and its
Environs was categorised as "<i>park</i>": see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(4)(c).</a>  The amended Plan of
Management was exhibited on 13 July 1995.  After exhibition, two further sets
of amendments were made.  On 29
August 1995, the first respondent resolved to
adopt the Plan, in its finally amended form, which is the subject Plan of
Management
(the Plan of Management) in these proceedings.<p>
<p>
<u>Authorisation of lease to second respondent</u><p>
Schedule 3 to the Plan of Management provided, relevantly, that the Plan
"<i>expressly authorises the lease or licence of community land as follows:
Balmoral Bathers Pavilion to enable use thereof as outlined
under `Use' . .
.and in accordance with the Conservation Plan dated July 1994, and prepared by
Robert A. Moore Pty Limited".</i><p>
<p>
<i>"Use</i>" of the Bathers Pavilion as specified in the Plan of Management
stated :<p>
<i>". . .the need to upgrade the surrounds of the pavilion has already been
noted, of equal importance is the need to improve community
access to the
building.  The use of sections of the building for commercial purposes which
are in keeping with the quality and atmosphere
of the whole precinct is not
inappropriate.  However, commercial use should not totally exclude community
use.  Thus, efforts should
be made to redevelop and provide community access to
sections of the pavilion for a range of uses, including change/toilet
facilities.
 Other uses could include a local artist's gallery and/or sales
area;  a local history museum; meeting areas; youth, family and senior
citizen's program areas, and adult eduction [sic] and U3A (University Third
Age) program spaces .."</i><p>
<p>
The 1994 Conservation Plan referred to in Schedule 3 of the Plan of Management
had been commissioned by the first respondent.  The
brief for the preparation
of the plan was not in evidence.  However, the title, "<i>Conservation Plan and
its Recommendations</i>", indicates that its authors were requested to make
recommendations as to the conservation and continued use of the Bathers
Pavilion,
having regard to matters such as its history, architecture,
construction and state of repair.  The Conservation Plan's "<i>Conclusion and
Recommendations</i>" were:<p>
<i>"The Bathers Pavilion is an important community heritage item and asset,
inviting careful management to enhance the enjoyment of an
important recreation
reserve, of which it is a major contributory component. It has reached a
crucial point in its life cycle at
which the building's repair and adaptation
for better continued use have to be planned and appropriately
implemented.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The building is still owned by the Council which built it as a facility that
has now, in essence, outlived its usefulness.  The physical
landmark status of
the building, and the regard with which it is held by its users, both former
and current, support the building's
careful retention.  The success with which
its present lessee has maintained a successful business and established an
international
reputation is indicative not only of the commitment that such a
building can draw from people, but of the future which the building
could also
have, given the application of equal skill, intelligence and hard work.  The
building has become a special place of many
different meanings to a wide range
of people, and could go even further.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Almost all the community around it are agreed upon its potential for
continued use, so as to enhance the special place that it occupies
in Balmoral
Reserve.  Just how this is to be achieved is the problem that Council must
solve.</i><p>
<i>In difficult economic times, it is unlikely that a simple, unencumbered
solution will be found for the building's predicament.  Like
all historic
structures, its survival can only be supported by an economic use, one which
may not solve all aspirations for the building's
future.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>However, if a clear view can be maintained of the building's importance, and
if that view can guide and direct what will be, after
all, the next phase in
its life, the building will be supported through this difficult period, and
remain to meet with further reassessment
and perhaps further adaptation, as it
endures.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>It is therefore recommended:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That Council adopt this Plan as a Draft Conservation Plan for the Bathers
Pavilion, and invite submissions (including from the Heritage
Council of NSW)
in relation to its findings, and recommendations;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That having considered submissions on the Plan, Council amend and adopt the
Plan, as its Policy for the future of the Bathers Pavilion,
the Policy to be
subject to regular review or upgrading as may be felt necessary;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That Council secure further consulting engineers' advice as to the
feasibility of the structural repair and capacity of the interior
to support
re-use of the building, so as to be able to better advise tenderers of the
preferred approach to the building's adaptation;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That having prepared a briefing document of advice and information to
tenderers, Council invite expressions of interest for the conservation
and
adaptive reuse of the Bathers Pavilion, in accordance with the Policies of this
Plan as adopted by Council;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That having adopted this Plan and determined to seek expressions of interest
for the building's conservation and reuse, the Council
advise the present
lessee of its new Policies for the building, and invite from the lessee a
revised submission for the building's
adaptive reuse;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That Council ensure that the brief for prospective tenderers requires them
to propose and install within the development an interpretation
facility
explaining the cultural significance of the Pavilion to its visitors, to the
approval of Council, and that the requirements
within the lease conditions
include the preparation and adoption of a maintenance programme for the
completed building;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That having received tenders or proposals in response to its invitation
Council exhibit the submissions for public comment; and</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That having considered all submissions and determined a preferred tenderer,
Council negotiate contractual conditions to secure an
early commencement and
completion of the works."</i><p>
<p>
On 14 July 1995, the first respondent granted conditional development consent
of the DA under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 92</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</i>
1979</a>.  On the same day, the Minister for Local Government gave his consent to a
proposed 21 year lease of the Bathers Pavilion to the
second respondent under s
47 of the LGA 1993.<p>
<p>
<u>The LGA 1993</u><p>
Before dealing with the issues raised on the appeal, it is convenient to refer
to the relevant provisions of the LGA 1993.  They
are:<p>
<i>36.	<b>Preparation of draft plans of management for community land</b></i><p>
<i>"(1)	A council must prepare a draft plan of management for community
land.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(2)	A draft plan of management may apply to one or more areas of community
land.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(3)	A draft plan of management for community land must identify the
following:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(a)	the category of the land,</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(b)	the objectives and performance targets of the plan with respect to the
land,</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(c)	the means by which the council proposes to achieve the plan's objectives
and performance targets,</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(d)	the manner in which the council proposes to assess its performance with
respect to the plan's objectives and performance targets,</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>and may require the prior approval of the council to the carrying out of any
specified activity on the land.</i><p>
<i>. . .</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>38	<b>Public notice of draft plans of management</b></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(1)	A council must give public notice of a draft plan of management.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(2)	The period of public exhibition of the draft plan must be not less than
28 days.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(3)	The public notice must also specify a period of not less than 42 days
after the date on which the draft plan is placed on public
exhibition during
which submissions may be made to the council.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(4)	The council must, in accordance with its notice, publicly exhibit the
draft plan together with any other matter which it considers
appropriate or
necessary to better enable the draft plan and its implications to be
understood.</i><p>
<p>
<i>40	<b>Adoption of plans of management</b></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(1)	After considering all submissions received by it concerning the draft
plan of management, the council may decide to amend the
draft plan or to adopt
it without amendment as the plan of management for the community land
concerned.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(2)	If the council decides to amend the draft plan, it may publicly exhibit
the amended draft plan in accordance with this Division
or, if the council is
of the opinion that the amendments are not substantial, it may adopt the
amended draft plan without public
exhibition as the plan of management for the
community land concerned."</i><p>
<p>
A council has no power to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of community
land:  s 45(1).  It may lease or license such land, but
only in accordance with
ss 46 and 47: s 45(2).<p>
<p>
Section 46 provides:<p>
<i>"	<b>Leases and licences of community land - generally</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i>(1)	A council may grant a lease or licence of community land if:</i><p>
<i>(a)	the grant of such a lease or licence is expressly authorised by a plan
of management for the community land, and</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(b)	it does so in accordance with such provisions of the plan of management
as apply to the granting of the lease or licence.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(2)	An authorisation in a plan of management for the granting of a lease or
licence may be limited to the granting of a lease or licence
for a public
purpose or by reference to other matters.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(3)	A council must not grant a lease or licence for a period (including any
period for which the lease or licence could be renewed
by the exercise of an
option) exceeding 21 years.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(4)	A council must not grant a lease or licence for a period (including any
period for which the lease or licence could be renewed
by the exercise of an
option) exceeding 5 years unless it has also complied with section 47."</i><p>
<p>
If a council proposes to grant a lease or license exceeding 5 years (including
any period of renewal), there must be public notice
and exhibition and a period
for the making of submissions:  subs 47(1) and (3).  The council must consider
all submissions:  subs
47(4).  If there is any objection to the lease or
license, the same may not be granted without the Minister's consent: s 47(5).
If
the Minister's consent is required, there are certain procedural
requirements, not presently relevant, with which the council and
the Minister
must comply:  subs 47(6) and (7).  The Minister's decision is discretionary:
subs 47(8).<p>
<p>
Although not a feature in this case, it is also useful to refer briefly to a
council's responsibility to prepare a Management Plan.
 During each year, a
council must prepare a draft management plan with respect to its activities for
at least the next 3 years: s
402.  The content of a draft management plan is
specified in s 403.  A draft management plan must include a statement of the
principal
activities which the council proposes to conduct and a statement of
the objectives, performance targets and the means of achieving
the targets of
each of the principal activities: s 403.  The council must, each year, adopt a
management plan, prepared and exhibited
in accordance with Ch 13 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a>, and
the draft management plan must be publicly exhibited: s 405.  The requirement
to prepare, exhibit and adopt a Management Plan
on a yearly basis is one of the
means by which a council is made publicly accountable for its actions.<p>
<p>
I have already referred to the three major questions which call for resolution
in the appeal.  It is now necessary to turn to those
questions in more
detail.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Did the Plan of Management comply with the LGA 1993</u>?<p>
The appellant contended that the Plan of Management failed to comply with the
LGA 1993 in the following respects:  first, the Plan
of Management was no more
than a proposal to prepare a more detailed plan, which the first respondent
called a Management Plan (see
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(c))</a>; secondly, the Bathers Pavilion had
been impermissibly categorised as `park' (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(a))</a>; thirdly, the Plan of
Management failed to identify objectives and performance targets and the means
proposed to achieve them (see
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(b)</a> and (c)); and fourthly, that the first
respondent failed to advertise the amendments to the Plan as required by s 40
of the LGA 1993.
 It is necessary to refer to the Plan of Management in some
detail in order to determine these issues, which I propose to deal with
in a
slightly different order to the order in which they were argued.<p>
<u>Compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(b)</a></u><p>
Section 3 of the Plan of Management is headed<i> "The Management of Balmoral
Beach and Environs</i>".  Eight "<i>Objectives</i>" are identified.  They
are:<p>
*	<i>"ensure visitor experience is of the highest quality;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>retain the diversity of recreational, tourism and conservation roles while
seeking to resolve conflicts between these roles of the
parkland and
users;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>maintain the area to the highest standards of appearance and safety;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>sustain the environmental and cultural heritage of the area;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>improve pedestrian access to the Beach from throughout the municipality
and region;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>retain the ability to accommodate special and intermittent uses;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>improve landscaping and disabled access; and</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>establish clear guidelines for future use, development and design as part
of the management planning process."</i><p>
<p>
<p>
Prior to the Plan of Management being amended the second time, this section was
headed "<i>Management Objectives</i>".  The word "<i>Management</i>" was
deleted as part of the amendments, but the section otherwise remained in its
original form.  Counsel for the appellant submitted
that the deletion of the
word "<i>Management</i>" was a failed attempt to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(b).</a>  The
mere deletion of the word could not, of course, convert the substance of this
section of the Plan of Management into a section
which thereby complied with
the statute.  However, I am of the opinion that the Plan of Management complied
with the requirements
that the objectives of the plan be specified.  An
"<i>objective</i>" is<i> "an end towards which efforts are directed; something
aimed at</i>": Macquarie Dictionary; "<i>something sought or aimed at</i>": The
Concise Oxford Dictionary.  The eight specified objectives properly fulfil the
concept of something being<i> "aimed at"</i>.<p>
<p>
<i>"Performance Targets</i>" are separately identified in the Plan of
Management and categorised under five major strategic areas as follows:
"<i>ownership, design, infrastructure, use and use impacts</i>".  Under each
major performance target, a number of issues or more specific performance
targets are identified.  They are summarised
at p 9 of the Plan of Management
as follows:<p>
<i>"In summary, the immediate performance targets of this plan can be
identified as:-</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(i)	Ownership</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(a)	amalgamate or consolidate titles to the land</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(b)	Secure open space links to the beach environment</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	(ii)	Design</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(a)	Review and redevelop overall character of open space by landscaping and
detailed site design</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(b)	Ensure design and placement of facilities complement and support use of
the open space. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(c)	Design and promote open space links to Balmoral Beach. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	(iii)	Infrastructure</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(a)	Review and manage traffic</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(b)	Review and manage parking</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(c)	Attend to services such as rubbish management systems, lighting, seating
and information. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	(iv)	Use</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(a)	Higher standard of maintenance of existing resources</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(b)	Extend recreational uses</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(c)	Monitor and control change of recreation activities. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	(v)	Use Impacts</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(a)	Maintain and manage natural resource assets."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
The <u>Macquarie Dictionary</u> meaning of "<i>performance</i>" and
"<i>target</i>" are:<p>
<i>"performance:  the execution or doing;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>target: a goal to be reached."</i><p>
<p>
The <u>Concise Oxford Dictionary</u> meanings are:<p>
<i>"performance: the act or process of performing or carrying out; the
execution or fulfilment;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>target: an objective or result aimed at."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<p>
I am of the opinion that the five major strategic areas and the sub-categories
identified thereunder fall within the description
"<i>performance targets</i>"
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(b).</a>  They each specify an objective or goal to be
performed.<p>
<p>
<u>Compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(c)</a></u><p>
The next question is whether subs 36(3)(c) has been satisfied.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection
36(3)(c)</a> requires that the Plan of Management <i>"must identify. . .the means
by which the council proposes to achieve the plan's objectives and performance
targets</i>".  Counsel for the first respondent submitted that his client had
complied with this provision, both in the body of the Plan of Management
and by
means of the proposed Management Plan.  He submitted that the section in the
Plan of Management: "<i>Landscaping needs and opportunities</i>", provided an
example of how the first respondent had specified the means by which it was to
achieve its performance target relating
to "<i>Landscaping</i>".  The relevant
part of the Plan of Management was in these terms:<p>
<i>"Considerable opportunities exist to enhance the quality of visitor
experiences and the attractiveness of Balmoral Beach through landscaping
and
detailed site design.  Those sections of the beach to the north of the pavilion
and south of the boatshed would benefit substantially
from landscape treatment.
There are also significant opportunities to improve the attractiveness and
usefulness of Hunter Park through
plantings, paths, seating and other design
inputs."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>It was submitted that the second and third sentences of this passage
were a sufficient identification of "<i>means</i>" for the purposes of subs
36(3)(c).  I do not agree.  The concept of "<i>means</i>" in subs 36(3)(c)
involves the identification of the method intended to be used to achieve an
objective or performance target.  At
the most, the second sentence identifies a
performance target - namely, the enhancement of the designated area of the
beach by landscape
treatment.  The last sentence may also be a performance
target, although the mere identification of matters which might be desirable
or
which could be done may be more correctly described as a recognition of
possible management considerations than performance targets
within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(b).</a>  However, it is unnecessary for me to express a concluded view
on this issue having regard to the conclusion I have reached on compliance
with
subs 36(3)(c).  I shall assume, for present purposes, that this part of the
Plan of Management involves a proper identification
of a performance target.
However, neither of these sentences specifies the means by which the objectives
which are related to this
performance target or the target itself are to be
achieved.  This is not unexpected.  This section is found in a part of the Plan
of Management dealing with performance targets.  A Plan of Management may, of
course, deal with "<i>objectives</i>", "<i>performance targets</i>" and
"<i>means</i>" together (or as a combination of some of them) and a heading
used in such a plan does not necessarily delimit the content of any
particular
part of the plan.  It is clear, however, that in this part of this Plan of
Management, the first respondent was dealing
with the subject matter of its
heading - namely "<i>Performance Targets</i>".  Counsel's attempts to construe
certain aspects as also specifying "<i>means</i>" for the purpose of subs
36(3)(c) were, therefore, strained, artificial and ultimately unsuccessful.<p>
<p>
Counsel for the first respondent identified the section of the Plan of
Management dealing with the performance target, <i>"Use</i>", as another
example where the Plan of Management identified the means by which the
performance target was to be achieved.  The relevant
performance target
identified in this section was<i> "maintenance and extension of recreational
uses</i>".  Counsel submitted that the segment under the subheading<i> "The key
user areas requiring upgraded maintenance. . .</i>"  identified the
"<i>means</i>" of achieving the performance targets.  The first three items
under this heading were dealt with in these terms:<p>
<i>".	Lawn areas and beachfront south of the boatshed - bare patches of soil,
erosion of the ground surface under the Moreton Bay fig
trees, erosion of the
lawn-beach interface are significant problems in this area;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	Rocky Point - surface cover and vegetation".</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	Hunter Park - the poor quality of the play facilities, inability to cater
for a diversity of ages and the lack of good support facilities
and services
for parents and other carers".</i><p>
<p>
In my opinion, there is no identification of "<i>means</i>" in these items.
Nor can it be said that the reference to "<i>upgraded maintenance</i>" in the
subheading specifies the means by which the performance target relating to the
use of these areas is to be achieved.  Rather,
the reference to "<i>upgraded
maintenance</i>" is part of the performance target.  If there is any doubt, the
matter may be tested in a number of ways.  First, the question can
be asked
whether there is any identification of how upgraded maintenance is to be
achieved.  The answer is in the negative.  Secondly,
if Hunter Park is taken as
an example, a supposed means of "<i>upgraded maintenance</i>" bears no
relationship to a performance target of<i> "the poor quality of the play
facilities, inability to cater for a diversity of ages, etc</i>". <i> </i>It
follows that "<i>upgraded maintenance</i>" cannot be a "<i>means</i>" for this
item.  Thirdly, again using Hunter Park as an example, an identification of
"<i>the poor quality of the play facilities" </i>is no more than a
specification of something which warrants attention.<p>
<p>
However, the topic, "<i>Balmoral Oval</i>", also dealt with under this heading,
may arguably identify a means.  It is in these terms:<p>
<i>"Balmoral Oval - the playing surfaces of Balmoral Oval need substantial
upgrading through improved drainage and surface cover (the
quality of the
support facilities for users also leaves much to be desired and the
appropriateness of leasing the former rugby club
building for a commercial use
should be reviewed - see grounds maintenance issues in the Sportsground Plan of
Management."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
The next two and the final items are:<p>
<i>".	North of the Pavilion - the lawn-beach interface area to the north of the
pavilion;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	Balmoral Baths - the baths warrant a higher maintenance input if they are
to continue to serve users and be retained as an important
part of the heritage
of the foreshore; . . .</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	Sharkproof net - the maintenance of the shark-proof net at the northern
end of the beach was also noted."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The same comments may be made about these items as has been made in
respect of the first three items.<p>
<p>
That leaves the item relating to the Bathers Pavilion, the text of which is
reproduced at pages 4-5 above.  There is nothing in this
segment which
identifies the means by which the performance target or targets referred to are
to be achieved. <p>
<p>
It is thus necessary to look at the section of the Plan of Management headed:
<i>"Means of Achieving Objectives and Performance Targets"</i> to determine
whether there has been compliance with subs 36(3)(c)<i> .</i>  It is in this
section that the first respondent's proposal to substantially satisfy its
obligations under subs 36(3) by means of
a Management Plan is revealed.  In
all, three "<i>means</i>" are identified:  <p>
<p>
(i)	that the performance targets are themselves "<i>means</i>" of achieving the
objectives of the plan;<p>
<p>
(ii)	that council should pursue the design, development and management
strategies outlined in Schedule 2 to achieve the objectives
and performance
targets; and<p>
<p>
(iii)	that a detailed Management Plan for the carrying out of the strategies be
prepared providing for, inter alia, the work outlined
in Schedule 2, in any
recommended studies".<p>
<p>
I have already addressed the question whether the first of the "<i>means</i>"
identified above satisfies subs 36(3)(c).  It does not, or at least, in
substantial part, does not.  The second and third of the
means identified above
are both included in Schedule 2.<p>
<p>
Schedule 2 is headed: "<i>Management Strategies for Balmoral Beach &amp;
Environs</i>".  The first two items under this heading are:<p>
<p>
"<i>Consolidation of titles or agreement to allow for effective management as
one open space management unit".</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>"Securing open space links as community land".</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>In my opinion, these matters are a sufficient specification of the means
for achieving the purposes of objectives 1 and 2 and for
the performance target
identified as "Ownership and Management", having regard to the content of that
performance target.  That leaves
the balance of Schedule 2 which deals with the
Management Plan.<p>
<p>
As I have said, the proposed preparation of the Management Plan is directed to
the Balmoral Beach area.  In this regard, Schedule
2 specifies that the
Management Plan "<i>should include such work as:-</i><p>
<i></i>*	<i>preparing a traffic and parking strategy;</i><p>
	<p>
*	<i>establishing development, design and landscaping guidelines;</i><p>
	<p>
<i>*	review of park infrastructure and services;</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>*	addressing maintenance problems;</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>*	responding to user group pressures and impacts; and</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>*	program of action to monitor, evaluate and resolve use impacts on the
natural and built environments."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<p>
It is clear from the inclusive language introducing these 6 items of work that
the proposed Management Plan could cover a range of
work which has no
relationship to any of the items of work specified.  It is thus entirely
unknown, except to the extent of the specified
items, what might be included in
the Management Plan.  However, these items are best described by their
generality and for the most
part contain no more particularity than is found in
the identification of the objectives and performance targets.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 36(3)(c)</a>
clearly requires more than this.<p>
<p>
Counsel for the first respondent informed the Court that the first respondent
did not contend that the Management Plan, referred
to in the Plan of
Management, was a Management Plan for the purposes of chapter 13 of the LGA
1993.  Rather, it was a convenient
name given to a document which the first
respondent proposed to prepare for the purposes of carrying its objectives and
performance
targets into effect.  In other words, it was the means by which the
first respondent proposed to satisfy <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(c).</a>  This was a significant
concession.  Unless it can be said that the Plan of Management, by its own
terms (without reference to the
Management Plan), satisfies <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36</a>, the first
respondent's proposed means of managing this area of community land, by
preparation of an internal council document, lacks
the public accountability
mechanisms which lay at the heart of Chapters 6 and 13 of the LGA.<p>
<p>
This emphasis on public accountability in both Chapters 6 and 13 provides
guidance as to what is required in a Plan of Management
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
36(3)(c).</a>  Public accountability carries with it the notion of exposure.  The
requirements in Chapters 6 and 13 relating to the contents of
Plans of
Management and Management Plans respectively and to their public exhibition is,
in effect, the statutory prescription of
the level of exposure which the
legislature requires in each case.  Thus, when <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)</a> calls for the
<u>identification</u> of certain matters - "<i>objectives and performance
targets"</i> in the case of para (b) and "<i>means"</i> in the case of para
(c), it calls for a statement which exposes what a council intends in relation
to those matters.  Thus, when
para (c) calls for the identification of
`"<i>means"</i> whereby objectives and performance targets are to be achieved,
it is not sufficient to state that a document, the contents of which
are yet to
be determined, or which, once prepared, may deal with matters not previously
identified, will be prepared.<p>
<p>
In addition to the foregoing, the following passages further demonstrate the
Plan's lack of compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(c):</a><p>
<i>"During the public consultation program a number of suggestions were made
for extending and improving recreation use.  These included
the provision of a
separation area for roller blading; provision of a skateboard facility on a
temporary basis; provision of a second
playground in the vicinity of the picnic
area at the southern end of the beach; provision of a fitness trail in the
park; outdoor
art shows; and the provision of a second path around the ovals so
[as] to overcome use conflict between cyclists, walkers and joggers
or the
signposting of the path to indicate the junior cyclists have priority use.  The
issues involved with these activities need
to be addressed within the context
of the Management Plan as these could lead to other conflicts. . . ."</i><p>
<p>
The Plan of Management does not state whether these issues, raised in the
public consultation process, are even considered to be
performance targets let
alone specify any means relating to them.  The only matter which is clear from
this passage is that there
were significant matters left unresolved by the Plan
of Management.<p>
<p>
It follows from what I have said that the Plan of Management fails to comply
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(c)</a> in substantial respects.  It was not within the first
respondent's power to adopt a Plan of Management which does not comply with
the
Act.  Because the non-compliance is substantial, I am of the opinion that the
appellant is entitled to a declaration that the
first respondent's resolution
adopting the Plan of Management is invalid.<p>
<p>
<u>Categorisation of the land as "</u><cite>park</cite><u>"</u><p>
The Plan of Management categorises the whole of Balmoral Beach and its Environs
as park.  "<i>Park</i>" is defined in the LGA to mean<i> "an area of open space
used for recreation not being bushland</i>".  "<i>Bushland</i>" is defined to
mean:<p>
<i>" land on which there is vegetation which is either a remainder of the
natural vegetation of the land or, if altered, is still representative
of the
structure and floristics of the natural vegetation."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The appellant submitted that the first respondent, in order to comply
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(a)</a>, should have categorised the area according to its separate
uses.  It was submitted that it was not open to categorise the Bathers
Pavilion
as park and that it should therefore have been categorised as "<i>general
community use</i>".<p>
<p>
Categorisation of land is a mandatory requirement of the new legislative scheme
governing a local council's control of community
land.  The purpose of
categorisation is to facilitate a local council's proper planning and
management of community land.  This is
important in several respects, not the
least of which is the relevance of proper categorisation to community
involvement.  Once land
is categorised in a particular way, the community's
attention is thereby directed to planning and management according to that
categorisation.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 36</a> further contemplates that land may be categorised
in more than one way.  It can thus readily be appreciated that categorisation
is
not only mandatory.  It is an integral component of control of community
land.  As Gleeson CJ observed in <i>Friends of Pryor Park Inc v Ryde City
Council and Anor</i> (unreported, Court of Appeal, 24 July 1996) at 27:<p>
<i>"It is not possible to treat a categorisation under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36</a> as though it were
some kind of additional or alternative zoning.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>. . .</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The function of categorisation is related to the system of accountability
involved in requiring councils to spell out in detail, and
expose to the
public, their plans for the use and management of community land."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>However, as was pointed out in <i>Friends of Pryor Park</i>, the LGA
1993 does not specify the consequences of inappropriate categorisation.  It
does not, for example, specify that the Plan
of Management is thereby invalid.
It may be, as Gleeson CJ observed in that case, that a lease or license
authorised by a Plan of
Management could be manifestly inconsistent with the
categorisation of the land in the plan so as to give rise to an entitlement
to
relief by way of judicial review of administrative action.<p>
<p>
In this case, whilst the Bathers Pavilion, taken as a unit or section on its
own, could have been appropriately categorised as community
use, the area of
Balmoral Beach and Environs as an integrated whole, was appropriately
categorised as "<i>park</i>", it being sufficient for the Plan of Management to
recognise the existence, circumstances and present function of the Pavilion.
It follows that the proposed lease to the second respondent is not manifestly
inconsistent with the categorisation of the area as
park.<p>
<p>
<u>Failure of Council to advertise the proposed amendment to the plan</u><p>
The original Plan of Management was adopted on 4 April 1995.  It was
subsequently amended three times.  The first amendment involved
amending the
categorisation of the area from "<i>significant</i>", a concept not found in
the statute, to "<i>park</i>".  There were other amendments directed to
satisfying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36(3)(d).</a>  The first amendment was substantial.  Section 41
dictated that there be full public exhibition before the amended plan was
adopted.
 This was done.<p>
<p>
The second amendments were incorporated into the Plan of Management on 24
August 1995 upon the advice of the first respondent's Director
of Environment
and Planning.  The third amendments were incorporated on 29 August 1995, prior
to the plan's adoption, upon the further
advice of the first respondent's
Director of Environment and Planning.  The sole question raised under this
ground was whether the
amendments were "substantial".  The appellant contended
that the second and third amendments were substantial so that the Plan was
required to be exhibited in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38</a> before the Plan of Management
was adopted by the first respondent.  Counsel for the first respondent
submitted that the question
whether an amendment was substantial was a matter
for the opinion of council and therefore only challengeable on the basis of
<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness.<p>
<p>
This ground focused, in the main, on the second amendments although there is
one aspect of the third amendments which calls for consideration.
 In order to
deal with this submission it is again necessary to return to the Plan of
Management in some detail.<p>
<p>
<u>The second amendments</u><p>
A numbering system and headings were inserted by the second amendment.  This
was not a substantial change.  There were also a number
of additions made to
the Plan of Management.  It is convenient to set out the additional material in
the context of the passage or
section to which the amendment was added.  The
bold type is the additional or amended material.  I will number the amendments
for
ease of reference.<p>
<i>"1.	For the purposes of open space planning, Balmoral Beach and its Environs

those owned by CaLM)
surrounding Hunters Bay as shown on Map <b>1</b>.  All <b>community land of

areas)</b>, for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 36(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act, 1993</a>
(<b>The Act</b>). <b> Council regards land owned by CaLM similarly.  In so
doing Council has regarded Balmoral Beach and its Environs as one integrated
area notwithstanding that there may be within the area individual components
which are not community land and/or have dual purposes.</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i><b>2.	3.0 The Management of Balmoral Beach and Environs</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i><b>For the purposes of Section 36 of the Act, objectives have been
identified together with performance targets which are in themselves
means by
which the objectives will be achieved.  Further means of achieving the
performance targets (and objectives) are outlined
under "Means of Achieving
Objectives and Performance Targets" below.</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i><b>3.	</b>Each of the <b>performance targets</b> is discussed in the
following paragraphs.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>4.	Securing open space linkages</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Closely related to the <b>performance target area</b> of ownership is that
of securing open space links to the Beach environment.  While Council owns a
number of pedestrian links, many
others remain under the Crown.  Efforts must
be made to ensure these remain in public use.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>5.	Traffic and parking management are two of the major planning issues
<b>for this area of performance targets</b> facing Balmoral Beach and unless
resolved, will continue to impact negatively on visitor experiences, the
quality of the resource
and the surrounding residential areas.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>6.	Use impacts</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i><b>The purpose of this area of performance targets is to ensure that the
benefits and opportunities provided by Balmoral Beach and Environs
are
available for future generations.</b></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Any use of Balmoral Beach will affect the natural resources and built
environment of the reserve.  Asset maintenance and asset management
are thus
essential if the benefits and opportunities provided by the parkland are to be
available to future generations.  Issues
which need to be addressed and
resolved in this context are:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	measuring the extent of visitor impacts on the different components of the
built and natural resources;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	development strategies for minimising or eliminating those impacts;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	the protection and interpretation of heritage features including the
Pavilion, the sea wall, the old tram route and terminus, and
other site
features of heritage significance;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>.	bushland protection, regeneration, weed control and fire management and
the management of bushland-park-residential interfaces.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>7.	</i>This amendment is reproduced above at page 19.<p>
<p>
<b><i>8.	Means of Achieving Objectives and Performance Targets</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i>As stated, the performance targets outlined above are in themselves means
of achieving the objectives of this plan.  In addition,
Council should pursue
the design, development and management strategies outlined in Schedule 2 to
achieve the stated objectives and
performance targets and thereby bring about
effective management and use of Balmoral Beach and Environs.</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i>For the carrying out of the strategies, there should be prepared a
detailed Management Plan providing for, inter alia, the work outlined
in
schedule 2 and the work detailed in the Management Plan and in any recommended
studies and/or reviews should be carried out properly
and with reasonable
expedition taking account of the resources which are
available.</i></b><i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>9.	<b>Manner of assessment of performance with respect to objectives and
performance targets.</b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i><b>For the purposes of Section 36(3) of the Act, </b>the Management Plan
should stipulate reasonable dates by which various works or stages thereof
should be completed taking account
of the resources (financial, personnel and
otherwise) which are available and assessment of Council's performance with
respect to
the objectives and <b>performance</b> targets set out in this plan
is to be made on the basis of Council's ability or inability to have completed
such works or stages
by the set dates.  <b>In particular, completion dates
should be stipulated for landscaping and/or upgrading the sections of the beach
to the north of the
pavilion and south of the boatshed, the area around
Balmoral Bathers Pavilion and Hunter Park; preparation of a traffic and parking
study; a review of the park infrastructure and services; performing the
maintenance tasks outlined under the performance target `Use'
above; provision
of any recommended recreational facilities; and upgrading/installation of any
specified drainage or waste facilities.</b>  Council's performance should also
be assessed on the quality of work which will be measured by <b>public</b>
reaction (eg. the amount of public use) the length of time for which works
endure and the operational ability of works.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The responsibility, priority, estimated cost and performance measures for
each strategy are also provided where it is appropriate
to do so</i>."<p>
<p>
<p>
There were also amendments to Schedules 1 and 2.  Schedule 1 contained details
of the 27 parcels of land subject to the Plan of Management.
 Two parcels which
were subject of the original Plan of Management were deleted, and a new
parcel<i> "Unmade Road Amaroo Crescent, comprising 4800 metres<sup>2</sup>"
</i>was included and categorised as<i> "natural area bushland</i>".  Five
parcels were recategorised from "<i>park</i>" to "<i>natural area
bushland</i>".  The total area of these five parcels was 6512
metres<sup>2</sup><i> </i>out of a total area of 170,540 metres<sup>2</sup>, of
which 105,742 metres<sup>2</sup> was owned by the first respondent.<p>
<p>
Schedule 2 was amended so as to change two completion dates from December 1994
to December 1995 and to designate a different section
of council as being
responsible for a specified objective and performance target.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>The third amendments</u><p>
Further amendments were made on 29 August 1990.  Counsel for the appellant
properly conceded most were immaterial.  The one amendment
which calls for
consideration was an addition to that part of the Plan of Management on
"<i>Use</i>".  The addition stated:<p>
<i>"Also, leases and licences of community land such as Balmoral Beach and
Environs are provided for by the Act if authorised by a Plan
of Management.
Schedule 3 authorises certain leases/licences for the purposes of and/or by
reference to the matters set out in Schedule
3."</i><p>
<i></i><u></u><p>
<u>Were the second and third amendments substantial</u>?<p>
The word "<i>substantial"</i> is a word of ordinary English meaning, not used
in any technical sense in s 40.  It means <i>"of real worth or value;
essential, material or important</i>": <u>The Macquarie Dictionary</u>;  "<i>of
real importance or value"</i>:<i> </i><u>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</u>.  It
is convenient in determining whether the amendments were substantial to
consider the amendment which I have numbered "1" in
the second set of
amendments.  This amendment does two things.  It notifies a reader that
Balmoral Beach and its Environs have been
regarded as an integrated whole for
the purposes of the Plan of Management, notwithstanding that some components
are not community
land or have dual purposes.  In my opinion, this was obvious
from the Plan of Management before this amendment.  The amendment, whilst
a
helpful clarification, is not substantial in itself.  It also highlights the
fact that some land is not categorised as park.  A
reference to Schedule 1
reveals the areas now classified as natural area and which comprise about 4% of
the total area subject of
the Plan.  In the normal course, a change of
statutory categorisation would involve a substantial amendment.  However, given
the
small overall percentage of land involved, and without any evidence as to
its significance in the overall area subject of the Plan,
I do not consider
this amendment to be substantial or at least such that warrants the grant of
any relief.<p>
<p>
The balance of the second amendments are also best characterised as
clarification of particular sections of the Plan of Management.
 As such, there
is no benefit in analysing each change.  Overall, they are an attempt to make
the Plan appear more obviously to satisfy
the requirement of a `plan of
management' under s 36, by using the statutory language of "<i>objectives",
"performance targets" </i>etc and by making reference to the relevant statutory
provisions.  As I have said, none of the amendments go beyond matters of
clarification.<p>
<p>
The relevant change in the third amendment states that the first respondent may
grant a lease or license if authorised by a plan
of management and notifies a
reader of the Plan of Management that a lease/licence has been authorised by
Schedule 3.  This is an
important matter.  However, the proposed lease to the
third respondent was always the subject matter of Schedule 3.  There was
nothing
in the amendment to the body of the Plan of Management which altered or
qualified Schedule 3.  Accordingly, I am of the opinion that
the reference to
the lease in the body of the Plan of Management did not involve a substantial
amendment.<p>
<p>
It follows from what I have said that the second and third amendments were not
of such a nature as required the Plan of Management
to be re-exhibited.<p>
<p>
<u>Is the proposed lease of the Bathers Pavilion authorised by the Plan of
Management</u>?<u></u><p>
<u></u>Counsel for the appellant submitted that even if the Plan of Management
complied with the provisions of s 36, the proposed lease was
not authorised by
it.  There were 2 limbs to this argument.  First, it was submitted that the
purported authorisation was so vague
and meaningless as to be no authorisation
at all.  Secondly, it was submitted that the proposed lease did not provide for
improved
community access to the building.<p>
<p>
The lease authorised by Schedule 3 was as follows:<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>"This Plan of Management -</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>expressly authorises the lease or licence of community land as
follows:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>*	Balmoral Bathers Pavilion to enable use thereof as outlined under<b>
`Use'</b> above and in accordance with the Conversation Plan dated July, 1994,
and prepared by Robert A. Moore Pty. Limited.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>. . ."</i><p>
<p>
The "<i>Use</i>" specified in the Plan of Management is reproduced at page 4
above.  The relevant sections of the Conservation Plan are:<p>
<b><i>"The Use of the Building</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><i></i><p>
<i>Proposed uses for the Pavilion should not require any unsympathetic impact
upon the significance of the building, externally and internally,
and should if
possible be compatible with public access to the building.  Use of the building
must also be compatible with the significance
of the Reserve in which the
building is located."</i><p>
<p>
Public access had earlier been dealt with in the Conservation Plan in these
terms:<p>
<b><i>"Public Access</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><i>The importance of public accessibility to the interiors of the
building for some residents of the Beach has been discussed.  It remains
an
important criterion for any adaptation proposal.  However, it must also be
remembered that the building is in Council ownership
and if leased under
lessee-to-renovate conditions, the building will eventually revert to Council.
This longer term view of the Pavilion's
circumstances is an essential element
of the present process, and it will necessarily influence negotiations over any
proposed schemes
for the building, and the details of related architectural
designs."</i><p>
<p>
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the following further parts of the
Conservation Plan were relevant to determining whether
the proposed lease was
"<i>in accordance with</i>" the Conservation Plan.<p>
<b><i>"Constraints upon Use</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><i></i><p>
<i>Investigations for this report suggest that it is not realistic to expect
that the survival of the Pavilion can be achieved through
its repair and
restoration solely for its original purpose - it would simply not be affordable
given the returns from the use.  Accepting
that its interior may be
substantially "revised" in an adaptive re-use programme, the building could be
argued to impose few constraints
upon the selection of uses to which it might
be put - except for the regard and esteem in which it is held by most visitors
to the
Beach, and certainly the visitors to its Restaurant.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>. . .</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b><i>Opportunities for Interpretation</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><i></i><p>
<i>The Pavilion, as the older and most substantial of the Council buildings in
the Reserve, should and obviously could incorporate a
display of interpretative
material about itself and the Reserve, and such a facility should form a part
of any brief for the rehabilitation
and re-use of the building.  In a sense,
the Pavilion might operate as the "visitor centre" for the important heritage
site of Balmoral
Beach Reserve.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The loss of the remaining original internal fabric of the building - if
indeed it proceeds, will place further emphasis on the need
to explain what the
Pavilion was built for originally, and how its interior was arranged.
Consideration might be given to the use
of video recording of the building for
archival and interpretation purposes, before any construction work was to
begin.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>. . .</i><p>
<p>
<i>That having prepared a briefing document of advice and information to
tenderers, Council invite expressions of interest for the conservation
and
adaptive reuse of the Bathers Pavilion, in accordance with the Policies of this
Plan as adopted by Council;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>That having adopted this Plan and determined to seek expressions of interest
for the building's conservation and reuse, the Council
advise the present
lessee of its new Policies for the building, and invite from the lessee a
revised submission for the building's
adaptive reuse;"</i><p>
<i></i><p>
The "<i>Use</i>" section of the Plan of Management does not state that the
Bathers Pavilion will be put to any specific community use.  Rather, it
gives
an indication of a broad range of community use to which it might be put and
certainly indicates that any proposed use should
extend beyond the provision of
change/toilet facilities.  Nor does the Conservation Plan specify any
particular use to which the
Pavilion should be put.  At most, it gives a guide
as to appropriate use.<p>
<p>
The proposed lease is of:<p>
<i>"[Lot] 3/831359, being land at 4 The Esplanade, Balmoral and the building
erected thereon known as Balmoral Bathers Pavilion but excluding
those sections
made available to the public herein referred to."</i><p>
<p>
The First Schedule to the Memorandum of Lease defines "<i>the building</i>" and
excepts from the definition "<i>public toilets, showers and change rooms on the
ground floor of the building</i>".  The combined effect of the description of
the land leased and the First Schedule is that the toilet and change facilities
are
not part of the proposed lease.  Under the terms of the proposed lease, the
permitted use of the building is as "<i>restaurant, public cafe and refreshment
room in accordance with Development Consent No. 141/89 issued by the [first
respondent]".</i>  Relevantly, the development consent is for two larger size
restaurants, which could also be used for functions, with a maximum combined
seating of 152 people and two cafe/coffee shops (one with a bar) with a maximum
seating capacity of 98 persons.<p>
<p>
In my opinion, leaving aside the question whether the possible uses for which a
lease of the Pavilion is authorised by Schedule 3
are vague or uncertain, it
cannot be said that the proposed lease is one for the uses specified under the
heading "<i>Use</i>" in the Plan of Management, nor for any of the uses or
types of use indicated in the Conservation Plan.  In this regard, there is
no
need to have resort to any argument that the public toilets, change and shower
facilities are not part of the proposed lease.
 Even if they were, on any view
of the matter, a reservation of 2% of the building for these purposes falls far
short of anything
indicated in the Plan of Management or the Conservation
Plan.<p>
<p>
Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the proposed lease does <i>not "enable
use [of the Bathers Pavilion] as outlined under `Use'"</i> in the Plan of
Management.  Nor is it "<i>in accordance with" </i>the Conservation Plan.<p>
<p>
It was also submitted that the only lease authorised by Schedule 3 was one
granted after the procedures specified in the Conservation
Plan had been
followed - that is, after tenders for its proposed use had been called.  This
submission was based upon the wording
"<i>in accordance with</i>" in Schedule
3.<p>
<p>
The expression "<i>in accordance with</i>" is an ordinary English expression.
It means<i> "in agreement or in conformity with</i>": The <u>Macquarie
Dictionary</u>; or<i> "in a manner corresponding to</i>": <u>The Concise Oxford
Dictionary</u>.  See also<i> Re Federated Furnishing Trade Society of
Australasia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/62.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 62</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20113%20ALR%20137" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 113 ALR 137</a> at 145; <i>Sydney Cove Redevelopment
Authority v Chief Commissioner of Land Tax (NSW) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2030%20ATR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 30 ATR 517</a> at 528.
The question of what the specified matter or issue, in this case use of the
Pavilion, is to be in agreement or conformity
with, depends upon the context in
which the phrase appears.  The lease of the Bathers Pavilion authorised by
Schedule 3 was:<p>
"<i>to enable use thereof as outlined under `use' [in the Plan of Management]
and in accordance with the Conservation Plan dated July
1994."</i><p>
<i></i>The phrase "<i>to enable use thereof</i>" both means what it says and is
to be read distributively throughout the passage.  In other words, the lease
authorised by Schedule
3 was one which was to enable use of the Pavilion as
outlined under `use' in the Plan of Management and to enable use thereof as
outlined in accordance with the Conservation Plan.<p>
<p>
There is nothing in this part of the Plan of Management authorising the lease
of the Bathers Pavilion which refers to the manner
or procedures by which use
of the Pavilion should be decided upon.  Accordingly, I reject this
submission.<p>
<p>
Counsel for the first respondent submitted that, regardless of any submission
put on behalf of the appellant, the challenge to the
proposed lease was
misconceived, as any determination of the validity of the lease must be made at
the date of grant.  As at the
present time, there has been <i>no "grant [of] a
lease or license of community land</i>" within s 46(1), although counsel for
the first respondent informed the Court that the terms of the proposed lease
which were in
evidence in the proceedings are those upon which the first
respondent intends to ultimately grant the lease to the second respondent.
However, the power to grant declaratory relief in respect of future conduct or
rights is well-recognised.  It is available where
"<i>rights which though not
yet in existence are treated by the courts as reasonably certain to come into
effect, either on a certain
date or on the occurrence of a specified
event"</i>:  De Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell: <i>Judicial Review of Administrative
Action</i> 5th Ed at 750; <i>Mercury Ltd v Director-General of
Telecommunications</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 WLR 48</a> at 59.  A declaration in this matter
would resolve a very real dispute of considerable public importance and would
avoid the re-litigation
of many of the issues dealt with in this appeal.  In my
opinion, the appellant is entitled to declaratory relief.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Is the development consent valid</u>?<p>
The appellant further contended that the development consent granted for
additions and renovations to the Bathers Pavilion on 14
July 1995 was invalid
as s 44 of the LGA 1993 provides that pending adoption of a Plan of Management
for community land, the nature
and use of the land must not be changed.<p>
<p>
The development consent permits an extension of the restaurant and coffee shop
facilities, involving opening up the first floor of
the premises for this
purpose, an increase in seating capacity of approximately 40% and the ability
to hold conferences and functions
on the premises.  Counsel for the appellant
submitted that such a substantial increase in seating capacity within the
building, the
expenditure of over $1 million on alterations and use of
significant areas of the building for different purposes to that previously
permitted, (that is for functions and conferences), involves a change in the
nature and use of the land.  The amount of expenditure
involved in a proposed
development cannot constitute a change in the nature and use of the land.  At
the most, it might provide some
evidentiary support where a change in the
nature and use of land is alleged.  The question therefore is whether an
increase in use,
involving some change in use to one which may be considered of
a like or similar nature, involves a "change in nature and use" within
the
meaning of s 44.<p>
<p>
The trial judge appears to have construed the phrase "<i>nature and use"</i> in
s 44 as a composite phrase<i>.  </i>His Honour stated, at 15:<p>
<i>"Did the nature and use of the land change with the granting of development
consent?  Clearly its `use' did not change.  It was and
will continue to be a
restaurant.  I understand its `nature' to comprehend the qualities or character
of the land.  Thus understood
the `nature' of the community land did not change
by reason of the consent.  It should be noted that s 44 does not refer to a
change
in the nature </i><cite>of</cite><i> the use, but the nature and use of
the land. For that reason, I reject the submission that `nature' entails an
increase in `intensity'
of the use.  The section refers to the nature of the
land not changing.  The consent does not effect any such change ".</i><p>
<p>
I do not agree with the trial judge's construction of s 44.  The purpose of s
44 is to maintain the status quo until such time as
a council has prepared and
adopted a plan of management for community land under its control.  Any
proposed change in the nature
and use of that community land would be reflected
in the Plan of Management and thus subject to public scrutiny.  Either a change
in the nature of land or in its use could have a serious impact upon such land.
Any such change could render any proposal in the
Plan of Management otiose and
the notion of public accountability which lies at the heart of the Plan of
Management would thereby
be undermined.<p>
<p>
It follows that to construe the words <i>"nature and use of</i>" in s 44 as a
composite phrase would clearly defeat the purpose of the section.  The word
<i>"and</i>" should therefore be read disjunctively: see <i>Re the Licensing
Ordinance </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%2013%20FLR%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 13 FLR 143</a> per Blackburn J at 146-7; <i>Gillespie v
Ford</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2019%20ALR%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 19 ALR 102</a> per Forster J at 107, <i>Sullivan v R</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2073%20ALR%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 73
ALR 31</a> at 35-36.<p>
<p>
Even if the trial judge did not construe the words as a composite phrase, his
Honour's focus on use as that of a restaurant and separate
focus on nature when
dealing with the question whether an increase in use involved a change in the
<i>"nature and use"</i> of the land led him into error. <p>
<p>
Both "<i>nature</i>" and "<i>use</i>" are concepts which can have both
qualitative and quantitative aspects.  In my opinion, an increase in use can
amount to a change
in use of land.  A slight change may not be sufficient for
the purposes of s 44, or alternatively, or at least, may not be sufficient
for
a court to grant any relief.  However, where, as here, the proposed development
involves a substantial increase in seating capacity,
I am of the opinion that
there has been a change in use within the meaning of s 44.  It follows that the
combined effect of the increase
in seating capacity and the provision of
function room facilities constitutes a change in use within s 44.  It is not
necessary to
consider separately whether a change so as to provide function
room facilities is a change which, by itself, would have contravened
the
section.  It follows that the development consent is invalid.  <p>
<p>
The appeal should be allowed with costs and declarations should be made in
relation to the Plan of Management and the development
consent.  Costs in the
court below were reserved.  If this case had been decided as in my opinion it
should have been, costs should
have followed the event.  I therefore propose
orders and declarations in the following form:<p>
<p>
The Court orders that:<p>
1.	the appeal be allowed;<p>
2.	the respondent pay the appellant's costs of the appeal and of the
proceedings below.<p>
<p>
The Court declares that:<p>
3.	the resolution of the first respondent dated 29 August 1995 adopting the
Plan of Management is invalid;<p>
4.	the development consent for alterations and additions to the Balmoral
Bathers Pavilion granted by the first respondent on 14 July
1995 is invalid.<p>
