<b>2640/1999 - AMBERDOWN PTY LIMITED v GOLDANA INVESTMENTS PTY LIMITED &amp;
TRUNG HUNG LUONG</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Background</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff has leased shop 9 at the Greystanes Shopping
Centre (the Shopping Centre) since July 1988 when the then lessee,
Clinical
Chemicals Pty Limited, transferred its lease to the plaintiff (the initial
lease).  The permitted use of shop 9 in the initial
lease was a <i>pharmacy
including a Post Office agency and photographics store and film
processing.</i>
<P>

2   	The initial lease expired on 30 June 1989 and the plaintiff
entered into a lease with Andhed Holdings Limited as lessor for
the period 1
July 1989 to 30 June 1994 (the second lease).  The permitted use in the second
lease was <i>a pharmacy including a post office agency and photographics store
and processing agency.</i>
<P>

3   	At the expiration of the second lease the plaintiff entered
into a further lease with Andhed Holdings Limited for the period
1 July 1994 to
30 June 1995 with an option to renew for a further period of five years.  The
permitted use in the third lease is
<i>a pharmacy including a post office
agency and photographic store and processing agency</i>. (the third lease) On
30 March 1999 the plaintiff exercised its option under the third lease by
serving a Notice of Exercise of Option
on the defendant on that day.
<P>

4   	The defendant purchased the Shopping Centre on 23 May
1997.
<P>

5   	From July 1988 when it became the lessee of shop 9 the
plaintiff has operated as follows:
<P>

5.1	it has dispensed prescriptions and medicines, sold cough and cold
medicines, general medicines, health care equipment, hair
shampoo and other
hair products, perfumes and make-ups, gifts and promotional items, vitamins and
associated products, dental care
products, sun glasses and sun care products,
eye preparations, contact lens preparations, baby foods, nappies, surgical aids
and
supports, first aid treatments and wound care products; 
<P>

5.2	it has operated as a Soul Pattinson agency selling products advertised by
Soul Pattinson;
<P>

5.3	the post office has been conducted from a separate counter from which site
services include the sale of stamps, posting of letters
and payment of
accounts;  and
<P>

5.4	the photographic store and film processing has operated from a separate
counter.  The photographic store has stocked and sold
cameras, films,
batteries, photo albums, photo frames, passport photos and the processing of
films.
<P>

6   	The manner in which films have been processed has changed
over the years.  During the period 1988 to 1995 the plaintiff only
offered an
overnight service whereby the customer would leave the film with the plaintiff
and it would be sent off-site for developing
by a third party.  The developed
film would then be returned to the plaintiff for delivery to the customer on
return the following
day.
<P>

7   	Since October 1995 the plaintiff has offered an additional
service whereby films are developed on site with the use of a minilab
which was
purchased by the plaintiff in late 1995.  The minilab was described in evidence
as being just over a metre long by half
a metre wide by about 1.2 metres high.
There is also a photograph of the minilab in evidence.
<P>

8   	The Shopping Centre consists of two supermarkets, Franklins
and Flemings and a number of smaller shops including the plaintiff's
shop no 9,
a video store, a Mitre 10 Hardware, a newsagent, two butchers, a takeaway food
store, a bakery, a barber, a drycleaning
store, an hairdresser, a seafood
store, a St George Bank and a Commonwealth Bank, a Liquorland outlet, a
healthfood store, a coffee
shop and a delicatessen.
<P>

9   	On 31 May 1999 Trung Hung Luong executed a lease over shop
no 22 which is diagonally opposite the plaintiff's store with a
coffee shop
between it and the shop directly opposite the plaintiff's shop.  The plaintiff
was unaware of the execution of that lease.
<P>

10   	However on 3 June 1999 the directors of the plaintiff
observed a person in shop 22 which at that stage was vacant and undergoing
renovation.  A conversation occurred with that person who Ms Therese Cooper, a
director of the plaintiff, has identified as Mr Luong
although he denies ever
speaking with her.  From that conversation it became apparent to the plaintiff
that Mr Luong intended to
commence trading in the near future. The photograph
in exhibit A shows the sign on the window of Shop 22 which read "Greystanes
Instant
Photo. Shop 22 Greystanes Shopping Centre. We will do all photographic
services. Opening Soon"
<P>

11   	The plaintiff filed a summons on 8 June 1999 seeking
relief against the first defendant and by reason of various undertakings
that
were given to the Court by the parties the matter was fixed for final hearing
on 23 June 1999.  The matter came before me in
the duty list on that day and
the defendant was not ready to proceed to final hearing but an interlocutory
hearing took place.
<P>

12   	Mr Luong's lease with the first defendant is a Retail Shop
Lease within that meaning in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a><b>.  </b>As the lease
is for a term of 5 years it is required to be in the approved form and to be
registered. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss41</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">53</a><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>)<b>  </b>
<P>

13   	I granted an injunction restraining the defendant from
registering the lease executed by Mr Luong.  Mr Luong was not a party
to the
proceedings at that time but gave evidence for the defendant in the
interlocutory hearing .  I then set the matter down for
final hearing on 8 and
9 July 1999.    
<P>

14   	On 8 July  1999 on the application of Mr Luong, supported
by the first defendant but opposed by the plaintiff, I joined Mr
Luong as the
second defendant in these proceedings.  The second defendant indicated that he
was ready to proceed and wished to be
joined to ensure finality of this
litigation.
<P>

<b>Main Issue</b>
<P>

15   	The main issue involved in these proceedings is the
interpretation of the third lease between the plaintiff and the first
defendant
and in particular whether the granting of the lease to Mr Luong is in breach of
the first defendant's covenant in the third
lease.  
<P>

16   	The relevant covenants in the third lease are as follows:

<P>

<i>Clause 6:   </i>
<P>

<i>The lessee will not without the consent in writing of the lessor first had
and obtained do or permit or suffer to be done any of the
following:</i>
<P>

<i>(a) 	use the premises of any part thereof otherwise than for a pharmacy
including a post office agency and photographic store and
processing
agency;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	sell or permit the sale of any intoxicating liquor on the
premises.</i>
<P>

<i>Clause 55:</i>
<P>

<i>The lessor shall not during the term hereby granted or during the term
granted pursuant to the option contained herein lease any other
premises within
the Greystanes Shopping Centre for the use permitted hereunder.</i>
<P>

17   	Clause 13.1 of the lease executed by the second defendant
provides:
<P>

<i>The Lessee will use the Premises only for the permitted use and will at all
times required by this Lease conduct its business for
the permitted use in
accordance with best practice and in a reputable manner.</i>
<P>

18   	The permitted use as contained in item 12 is:
<P>

<i>Retail sale of cameras and camera accessories (including duty and tax free),
frames, albums, batteries, photo processing, laser printing,
colour copying,
instant passport photos, laminating and fax bureau.</i>
<P>

<b>Plaintiff's approach</b>
<P>

19   	The plaintiff submits that on its true construction cl 55
prohibits the first defendant from granting a lease of a pharmacy,
a post
office agency, a photographic store or a processing agency within the Shopping
Centre.  It is submitted that the words "is
permitted hereunder" should be
construed as including all of the uses contemplated by cl 6.
<P>

20   	It is submitted that cl 6 expressly provides for more than
one use.  In support of the submission that "use" should be read
as "uses" in
the light of the context in which it appears, reliance was placed on cl 1 of
the lease which provides:
<P>

<i>Words importing the singular number shall include the plural number and vice
versa.</i>
<P>

21   	Additionally it is submitted that cl 6 is not drafted so
as to permit the operation of a pharmacy as the principal business
being
carried on with the other uses being part of it.   The plaintiff submits that
the word "including" should be construed as "in
addition to" and  the
restriction in cl 55 equally applies to a lease permitting any one of those
uses. (<b>Marsal Pty Limited</b> <b>v Comptroller of Stamps</b> (1982) ATC
4536)  
<P>

22   	The plaintiff submits that a contrary construction would
permit the lessor to derogate from its grant by permitting the establishment
of
businesses in competition with the businesses of the plaintiff.  It is
submitted that such a result is contrary to the intention
of the parties.
<P>

<b>First Defendant's approach</b>
<P>

23   	The first defendant submits that the only permitted use to
be found in cl 6(a) is a conglomerate pharmacy.  It submits that
the word
"including" is a word intended to expand the ordinary meaning of pharmacy and
to include within it concepts not embraced
by the ordinary meaning of the word.

<P>

24   	The first defendant placed reliance on the following
passage in <b>Dilworth v Commissioner of Stamps</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281899%29%20AC%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1899) AC 99</a> at 105:
<P>

<i>The word "include" is very generally used in interpretation clauses in order
to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring
in the body of the
statute; and when it is so used these words or phrases must be construed as
comprehending, not only such things
as they signify according to their natural
import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that
they shall
include.</i>
<P>

25   	The defendant also referred me to those cases in which
Dilworth v Commissioner of Stamps had been referred to with approval.
<b>Hemens
v Whitsbury Stud Limited </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20AC%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 1 AC 601</a> at 613; <b>Burgchard v Holroyd
Municipal Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20NSWLR%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 NSWLR 164</a> at 169; <b>YZ Finance Co Pty Limited v
Cummins </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20109%20CLR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 109 CLR 395</a> at 401; <b>Buckle v Josephs </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2047%20ALR%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 47 ALR
787</a> at 792 &amp; 796; and <b>Reynolds v Commissioner for Income Tax </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967)
1 AC 1</a> at 10.
<P>

26   	In reliance upon these authorities the first defendant
submitted that the use is that of a pharmacy albeit that the pharmacy
is not
restricted to the sale of drugs, medicines and the like but can include the
other elements of the photographic store, the
post office agency and the
processing agency.  However it is submitted that it must still answer the
description of a pharmacy. 

<P>

27   	In testing this submission the first defendant points to
the converse of the situation and submits that the plaintiff would
not be
permitted to use the premises only as a photographic store because it could not
in any sense be described as a pharmacy.
<P>

28   	It is submitted that the term photographic store within cl
6(a) should be interpreted as being part of the pharmacy which
sells
photographic equipment and accessories.  Additionally it is submitted that
according to its ordinary meaning the clause does
not permit processing of film
on the premises and that the contrary construction is militated against by the
presence of the word
"agency". 
<P>

29   	On the one hand the plaintiff submitted that each of the
businesses of pharmacy, post office agency, photographic store and
processing
agency are permitted uses within the lease and the first defendant is
prohibited from granting a lease for any of these
uses in the Shopping Centre
during the term of the third lease as extended by the exercise of the option.
On the other hand the first
defendant submitted that the only permitted use is
the conglomerate pharmacy and that it is not prohibited from granting a lease
for a permitted use of post office agency, photographic store or processing
agency.   
<P>

<b>Rules of Construction in Construing the Terms of the Lease</b>
<P>

30   	In construing the terms of this lease the fundamental rule
of construction requires the Court to give the words within it
the natural
meaning that they bear.  (<b>Hyde &amp; Skin Trading Pty Limited v Oceanic
Traders</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 310</a> per Kirby P (as His Honour then was) at
313.)
<P>

31   	An authoritative enunciation of the general principle to
be applied is contained in the following portion of the judgment
of Gibbs J (as
His Honour then was) in <b>Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian
Performing Rights Association Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a> at 109 - 110:
<P>

<i>It is trite law that the primary duty of the Court in construing a written
contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the
parties from the
words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied.  Of course the whole
of the instrument has to be considered,
since the meaning of any one part of it
may be revealed by other parts and the words of every clause must if possible
be construed
so as to render them all harmonious one with another.</i>
<P>

32   	The plaintiff submits that if there is ambiguity in the
wording of the lease then the clause should be construed against the
lessor.
Gibbs J in <b>Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australian Performing Rights
Association</b> also said at p 109:
<P>

<i>...if the language is open to two constructions, that will be preferred
which will avoid consequences which appear to be capricious,
unreasonable,
inconvenient or unjust.  </i>
<P>

33   	Lord Wilberforce in <b>L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool
Sales Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1973/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20AC%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) AC 235</a> said at 261:
<P>

<i>...ambiguity is not to be equated with difficulty of construction, even
difficulty to a point where judicial opinion as to meaning
has differed.</i>
<P>

34   	I have been referred to numerous cases in which lessees
have sought to prevent lessors from either leasing and/or permitting
the use of
premises similar to the permitted use of the lessee's premisesThe business of
an eating house in <b>Kemp v Bird</b> (1877) Vol V Ch 974;   a ladies outfitter

<P>

35   	The plaintiff relies upon the South African decision in
<b>Saheebolay &amp;</b> <b>Woolfson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281925%29%20AD%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1925) A.D. 38</a> as being on all fours
with the present case. The plaintiff's lease contained a covenant that the
lessor would not sub-let any portion
of the premises in the immediate
neighbourhood for use as a grocery store, or "tea and refreshment rooms". 
<P>

36   	The proposed lease under challenge prevented the use of
the premises as "tea and refreshment rooms" but permitted the use
of "retail
dealer and tea room". The question that arose for decision was whether the
restrictive provisions in the earlier lease
prevented the letting of the
neighbouring premises as a tea room only, or whether it prevented the letting
of the dual purpose of
tea and refreshment rooms.
<P>

37   	However that case turned on an interpretation of some
relevant local by-laws, in particular as to whether separate licences
could be
obtained for tea rooms or refreshment rooms.  Innes CJ said:
<P>

<i>This is not an ordinary case of overlapping businesses, and the meaning of
the prohibitive clause.. seems quite clear. It was manifestly
drawn with an eye
on the local by-laws.... A tea room business was regarded as distinct and
separate from a refreshment room business.
 There was and is no such licensed
business as that of carrying on a tea and refreshment room</i>.  <i>There could
have been no object therefore in the insertion of the words "tea and" in the
restrictive clause, except to indicate that
a tea room business alone was to be
prohibited as well as a refreshment room business which included the sale of
tea.</i>
<P>

38   	The first defendant relied upon <b>Stuart v Diplock</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2043%20Ch%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 43 Ch 343</a> as authority for the proposition that shop 22, the subject of
the executed lease between the first and second defendant, is clearly
not a
pharmacy and that merely because the business sells some articles which may
also be sold by the plaintiff does not make it
the same business as that of the
plaintiff so as to breach any covenant.  
<P>

39   	<b>Stuart v Diplock</b> was a case in which the
plaintiff's lease permitted the premises to be used for "ladies' outfitting,
juvenile outfitting, or sale
of baby linen".  The business of the defendant was
that of hosiers and drapers.  Lord Justice Bowen said at 352:
<P>

<i>The business of a ladies' outfitter is one business - the business of a
hosiery is a distinct business.   The two businesses overlap
each other by
having four classes of articles the sale of which is common to them both.  But
a covenant not to carry on the business
of a ladies' outfitting is not broken
by carrying on the business of a hosier, and the hosier commits no breach by
selling some articles
which are usually sold by a ladies' outfitter, if he does
it in the ordinary course of the business of a hosier.</i>
<P>

40   	Cotton LJ, after observing that the nature of the business
of a ladies' outfitter consisted of selling all articles of underclothing
for
ladies, and other articles which were not underclothing, said at p350-351;
<P>

<i>If it could be made out that the sale of these articles made up the business
of a ladies' outfitter it would be quite another question,
but it does not
follow, because it is necessary for a ladies' outfitter to sell certain
articles, that everyone who sells these articles
is carrying on the business of
a ladies outfitter.</i>
<P>

41   	Drawing upon these comparisons the first defendant
compares the  pharmacy - albeit a conglomerate pharmacy - in this case
with the
retail sale of cameras etc as contained in the lease executed by the second
defendant.  The first defendant submits that
the second defendant would be
merely selling some of the items that the photographic store component of the
conglomerate pharmacy
would be selling;  that the processing of film would be
merely providing some services that the conglomerate pharmacy is providing
and
that this overlap would not be in breach of the covenant in cl 55 of the
plaintiff's lease.
<P>

42   	I am of the view that this submission is good only if I
accept the interpretation of clause 6 for which the first defendant
contends.

<P>

<b>Settling an ambiguity</b>
<P>

43   	I am of the view that this case does not involve a mere
difficulty in construction of clause 6.  The clause is open to more
than one
meaning.  It is thus ambiguous.  In aid of settling the ambiguity and
endeavouring to discover the intention of the parties
cl 54 of the plaintiff's
lease may assist.  It provides:
<P>

<i>The lessor acknowledges that for the purposes of the lease the pharmacy,
photographic store and film processing agency shall be conducted
by Therese
Marie Cooper, Anne Maree McCabe and Robyn Anne Whitehead or their nominee or
assignee being a registered Pharmacist and
the post office agency shall be
conducted by Anne Maree McCabe or her nominee or assignee being a person
approved by Australia Post
provided however that nothing in this clause shall
effect the liability, duties or obligation on the part of the lessee under this
lease.</i>
<P>

44   	None of the parties referred me to this clause during the
hearing of the matter. After I reserved my judgment I wrote to counsel
for each
of the parties referring them to the clause and inviting any submissions they
wished to make as to the affect , if any,
of cl 54 on the interpretation of cl
6. The second defendant did not respond to that invitation. The final
submissions of the plaintiff
and the first defendant were received on 19 July
1999.
<P>

45   	The plaintiff submitted that this clause supports the
interpretation of cl 6 for which it contends. It submitted that cl 54
envisages
that the lessee will carry on the separate uses in the premises which, it
claims, is borne out by the acknowledgment in
cl 54 that particular persons
conduct the particular businesses permitted under the lease.
<P>

46   	The first defendant submitted that cl 54 does not really
assist in the construction of cl 6. It submitted that the evident
purpose of cl
54 is to be found in cl 10 of the third lease and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pa196498/" class="autolink_findacts">Pharmacy Act 1964</a>.
<P>

47   	Clause 10 of the third lease is a clause dealing with
assignment and prohibits the lessee from assigning, sub-letting or transferring
any portion of the premises except in certain circumstances with the prior
written approval of the lessor. It is submitted that the
plaintiff could not
carry on the business of a pharmacy because such had to be carried on by a
registered pharmacist within the meaning
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pa196498/" class="autolink_findacts">Pharmacy Act 1964</a>. Therefore as
the permitted use under the third lease must be conducted by licensed natural
persons, clause 54 was merely acknowledging
such a requirement.
<P>

48   	There is no such requirement in relation  to the conduct
of the photographic store or the processing agency. The first defendant
submitted that cl 54 may be explained by a perceived need flowing from the
Licence Agreement with Soul Pattinson for the registered
pharmacist to conduct
the "pharmacy, photographic store and film processing agency". The particular
licence relied upon for this
inference did not come into force until well after
the execution of the third lease. I am asked to infer that there were similar
provisions in place because the plaintiff has always operated as a Soul
Pattinson agency.
<P>

49   	This raises a matter which the plaintiff raised originally
as an alternative submission. It submitted that if I was against
it in relation
to separate uses then I should find that the concept of a pharmacy had always
included film processing. In support
of this submission I was referred to an
interim award of Arbitrator Phipps in Victoria in an Arbitration under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rta1986161/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Tenancies Act 1986</a> (Victoria) in <b>Tarooba Nominees Pty Ltd v Stanurban
Pty Ltd</b>.(unreported 30 April 1997)  
<P>

50   	In that case a dispute had arisen as to whether the tenant
who had a lease with a permitted use of a pharmacy was in breach
of that clause
by reason of the installation of a minilab for the development of photographic
film.  The Arbitrator found that the
traditional meaning of pharmacy included a
service for the processing of film.  
<P>

51   	I am not convinced that the process by which the
Arbitrator reached his conclusion is one that is so sound that I could rely
upon it for the purpose of interpretation of a clause in the present case.  The
Arbitrator refused to allow any evidence as to industry
usage but seemed to
reach the conclusion that it was simply his "view" that a pharmacy was commonly
understood to include photo processing.
<P>

52   	If I were to accept the submission that a pharmacy
business always includes a service for film processing then it may be that
the
words "processing agency" in cl 6 are mere surplusage. However if I were to
find that to be the case then the defendant's submission
in reliance upon
<b>Stuart v Diplock </b>(supra) would be successful.
<P>

53   	The plaintiff and the first defendant each relied upon the
history of cl 6 to support their respective positions. In the first
lease there
is a typewritten part of the clause that says "Pharmacy including a Post Office
agency." and after the full stop there
appears in handwriting the words "AND
photographics store and film processing." There is then apparently the word
"agency" which
appears to have a line through it.  There is some debate whether
the copy is just difficult to read and the word is not crossed out.
The second
lease is the same as the third except that the word "photographics" in the
second lease is "photographic" in the third
lease.
<P>

54   	I am not particularly assisted by this history although on
its own without the benefit of cl 54 it may tend to suggest to
me that if
anything was to be included in the pharmacy and not have a separate existence
it would have been the post office agency.
However I am of the view that cl 54
does assist with the interpretation of cl 6 and I need not dwell on this
history.
<P>

55   	In my view clause 54 supports the plaintiff's
interpretation of cl 6(a).   The three businesses, that of pharmacy,
photographic
store and film processing agency are to be conducted by the people
named and the other business, that of the post office agency,
is to be
conducted by another person or her nominee.  This clause does not refer to the
photographic store and the processing agency
being "included" in the pharmacy.
Neither does the clause refer to the post office agency as being "included" in
the pharmacy.
<P>

56   	I am of the view that the intention of the parties was
that each of these businesses was permitted to be conducted in the
premises. I
find therefore that a lease permitting any of those uses within the Shopping
Centre during the term of the third lease
as extended by the exercise of the
option would be in breach of cl 55 of the lease.
<P>

<b>Photographic store and processing agency</b>
<P>

57   	The question then arises as to whether the permitted use
in the lease executed by the second defendant is a use of "photographic
store"
or "processing agency".
<P>

58   	The first defendant raises what it claims to be an
important point of distinction between the plaintiff's lease which it claims
only permits the processing of film off-site and the second defendant's lease
which permits the processing of film on-site.
<P>

59   	The defendant submits that a "photographic store" cannot
according to its ordinary meaning involve processing of film on the
premises.
It also submits that the use of the word "agency" when coupled with the word
"processing" means that the plaintiff cannot
process films on-site.
<P>

60   	The plaintiff has been processing film on-site since
November 1995 when the minilab was installed. The defendant claims that
it was
not aware of the existence of the minilab. Mr Hua, the managing agent, although
inspecting the Shopping Centre approximately
twice per week for about two
years, gave evidence that he did not notice the minilab in the premises. He
also gave evidence that
he did not notice the advertisements on the window of
shop 9 for a one (1) hour service for photo development. Nor did he see the
sandwich board in the common area outside shop 9 advertising the one (1) film
development service. Although it may seem incredible
that a diligent managing
agent would not see such things I believe that Mr Hua did not notice these
matters.
<P>

61   	The first defendant served a s129 Notice upon the
plaintiff on 8 June 1999 citing the presence and use of the minilab as a
breach
of the plaintiff's lease. It claims that its written consent was required
before film processing on site could become a permitted
use under the lease.
There is no issue between the parties that the first defendant's written
consent was not obtained. The validity
of the Notice will depend upon whether I
find that the development of film on-site was outside the permitted use.
<P>

62   	What then is a "photographic store"? The word
"photographic" is a derivative of the word "photograph" which itself is defined
as a "picture made using a camera, in which an image is focused on to film or
other light-sensitive material and then made visible
and permanent by chemical
treatment".(The New Oxford Dictionary of English)
<P>

63   	There is nothing in the evidence to convince me that a
photographic store should be given a limited meaning of selling only
the
implements to take a photograph (cameras and films) or the items in which to
display photographs (albums and frames) as opposed
to the provision of the
service which completes the production of the photograph - its development.
<P>

64   	I am of the view that the use of "photographic store" in
the plaintiff's lease permits the development of film on-site by
the plaintiff.
The other service of sending film away for processing by Soul Pattinson is
permitted by the use "processing agency".
However I am also of the view that
the plaintiff would be entitled to develop such films on-site as agent for Soul
Pattinson. The
use of the term "agency" does not require the service to be
off-site.
<P>

65   	The definition of "agency" in the Macquarie Concise
Dictionary is "a commercial or other organisation furnishing some form
of
service for the public"; "the place of business of an agent"; "the business of
an agent entrusted with the business of another".
 The New Oxford Dictionary of
English defines "agency" as "business or organisation established to provide a
particular service,
typically one that organises transactions between two other
parties".
<P>

66   	There is the further interpretation available to the
plaintiff that by reason of the terms of cl 54 the persons named as conducting
the business of "film processing agency" are doing so as agent for the lessee -
the plaintiff. This interpretation would also accommodate
the processing of
films on-site.
<P>

67   	I am of the view that the permitted use in the lease
executed by the second defendant as contained in Item 12 is, but for
the
reference to fax bureau, the use of the premises for the same businesses as
those of the plaintiff of photographic store and
processing agency. I am
satisfied that they are not merely overlapping as referred to in <b>Stuart v
Diplock</b>.
<P>

68   	In all the circumstances I am of the view that the first
defendant would be in breach of cl 55 of the third lease if it leased
other
premises for the use as permitted in the lease executed by the second
defendant.
<P>

69   	In these circumstances I am also of the view that the s129
Notice is not valid as the presence of the minilab is part of the
equipment for
the permitted use in the lease.
<P>

<b>The second defendant</b>
<P>

70   	The second defendant gave evidence that he did not have a
conversation with the director of the plaintiff and that he was
not aware of
the dispute between the plaintiff and the first defendant before he completed
the fit-out of shop 22.
<P>

71   	The main thrust of the second defendant's submission, if I
understand it correctly, was that if the plaintiff was successful
there should
be no injunction granted and that damages is an appropriate remedy.
<P>

72   	I am satisfied that Mr Luong's recollection is not
accurate as to when he became aware of the dispute between the plaintiff
and
the first defendant. In particular I accept that he continued to renovate and
fit out shop 22 after he was aware of the dispute.
I accept the evidence of the
plaintiff and in particular I accept that the photograph in Exhibit A correctly
depicts the state of
repair and fit-out of shop 22 as at 17 June 1999.
<P>

73   	I am satisfied on the evidence that the second defendant
was aware of the dispute that had arisen between the plaintiff and
the first
defendant before he completed the fit-out of shop 22 and that he did so in the
knowledge that the first defendant may be
restrained from registering the lease
executed on 31 May 1999.
<P>

<b>Remedies</b>
<P>

74   	The first defendant relied upon <b>Brigg v Thornton</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%201%20Ch%20386" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904) 1 Ch 386</a> to suggest that the plaintiff  is not entitled to injunctive
relief because it has not brought any action against the second defendant.
<P>

75   	In that case the Court found that the second tenant (Mr
Grant) had been carrying on the business of a stationer in breach
of the
covenant between the defendant and the plaintiff.  Lord Justice Vaughan
Williams said at p 392:
<P>

<i>Now I think that, if information had come to the plaintiff while this
letting to Grant was threatened or in negotiation, probably
the plaintiff could
have applied to the Court for an injunction, not only to restrain Messrs
Thorton from letting to Grant, but to
restrain Grant from taking these premises
from Messrs Thorton in breach of this covenant;  and after the letter to Grant
by Messrs
Thorton had become an accomplished fact, the plaintiff could, in my
judgment, have asked the Court for a declaration that the letting
was a bad
letting and that declaration would have bound both Messrs Thornton and Grant;
but that is not what happened in this case..
  The truth  of the matter is,
that the plaintiff has been content to treat the letting to Grant as an
existing fact and not to impeach
it.</i>
<P>

76   	It is true that the plaintiff only seeks injunctive relief
against the first defendant registering the lease between it and
the second
defendant or any other lease for the permitted uses under the plaintiff's
lease. However the plaintiff did not treat the
lease as an existing fact which
was not to be impeached. The plaintiff claims that the second defendant does
not obtain an enforceable
lease under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a> until it is
registered. It does impeach it as it seeks the injunction preventing its
registration.
<P>

77   	The plaintiff was candidly conscious of the fact that it
did not have a lease in which the defendant had covenanted not to
"permit or
suffer" other premises in the Shopping Centre conducting the businesses
permitted in the plaintiff's lease. (<b>Holloway Bros. Limited v Hill</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281902%29%202%20Ch%20612" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1902) 2 Ch 612).</a>
<P>

78   	The plaintiff submits it is entitled to an injunction to
restrain the breach of the express negative stipulation within cl
55 (see
Meagher Gummow &amp; Lehane.Equity Doctrine &amp; Remedies 3rd Ed. Par
2138-2139). I agree.
<P>

79   	In the circumstances of my findings I will make the
declarations and orders as contained in the plaintiff's Amended Summons
in
paragraphs 1, 2(a), 2(b); 3, 4, 5, 6(a), 6(b),6 (c) and 6 (e).  I will also
make an order for an inquiry to be held as to damages
and refer such inquiry to
a Master of the Equity Division of this Court. The question of the plaintiff's
entitlement to interest
and quantification thereof should await the outcome of
that inquiry.
<P>

80   	The first defendant's cross claim is dismissed and I order
the first defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
The
parties should bring in short minutes reflecting these orders.
<P>

81   	The second defendant made application to be joined in the
proceedings so that there would be finality to the litigation. The
first
defendant in support of the second defendant's application submitted such
joinder was necessary to "control" the second defendant
and have "orders made
against him personally".
<P>

82   	In the light of the basis of the joinder of the second
defendant, failing agreement between the parties, I will re-list the
matter to
hear argument in relation to the appropriate orders, if any, to be made against
the second defendant.
