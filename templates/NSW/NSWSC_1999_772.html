<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  When I delivered judgment in this
matter on 9 June last,  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/436.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 436</a>, I invited the representatives of the
parties to make submissions on the question of costs.  Neither of them wished
to do so and
I accordingly made an order that the defendants pay the
plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, this order being made, as I understood
it, in effect by consent.
<P>

2   	Subsequently, a Notice of Motion was filed on 11 June
seeking orders that such orders as to costs be set aside and that I hear
argument upon and determine the costs of the proceedings.  This application was
supported by an affidavit by the solicitor for the
defendants, Mr Burke, who
said although he instructed Counsel to consent to the costs order being made,
on reading my judgment, he
believed there were a number of grounds on which the
question of costs could be argued.
<P>

3   	When the matter came on for hearing today it became
apparent that the plaintiff was also unhappy with the order for costs because
no special order had been made pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a>, r 33 so that as a result
of my earlier orders the plaintiff was only entitled to one half of the costs
that would otherwise be payable
and not entitled to the costs of briefing two
counsel; and the plaintiff also wished to have this aspect of my earlier costs
order
reviewed.  Because of an order I made on 15 June last no steps have been
taken into the Registry to enter judgment and so the order
for costs has not
been entered and there is undoubted jurisdiction to vary it.
<P>

4   	Section 76 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a></i></b>
provides that, subject to the Act and the Rules, costs shall be in the
discretion of the Court, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a>, r 11 provides that if the Court makes any
order as to costs the Court shall, subject to such Part, order that the costs
follow the
event except where it appears to the Court that some other order
should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.
<P>

5   	This is the general rule, although an exception is
sometimes made in cases where there are multiple issues and different parties
are successful on different issues, provided that the costs can reasonably be
separated or appropriated to the relevant issues, and
that such issues are not
inexorably intermingled.  The relevant cases in this State are referred to in
<b><u>Ritchie: Supreme Court Procedure (NSW)</u></b> at para [52A.11.2].
<P>

6   	As far as I am aware, and Counsel have not been able to
point me to any decision to the contrary, the practice in this State
has been
that where a plaintiff succeeds in a defamation action the plaintiff recovers
his or her costs without qualification, even
if he or she only succeeds on one
or some of a greater number of imputations notwithstanding that each imputation
constitutes a separate
course of action.  There is, it seems to me, a very good
reason for this, namely, that the plaintiff in a defamation action in bringing
the proceedings seeks to vindicate his or her reputation.  If a plaintiff
succeeds on only one or some of a number of imputations,
he or she nevertheless
vindicates his or her reputation and it is not generally of significance to
such vindication that the plaintiff
has failed in respect of other imputations,
although there can be exceptional circumstances where a finding of truth on a
particular
imputation would do more harm to the plaintiff's reputation than a
judgment in his or her favour on other imputations.
<P>

7   	This, it appears, was to a significant degree what happened
in <b><i>Thiess v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (No. 5)</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20QdR%20156" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] QdR 156</a> at
206-210, where the matter of costs was considered.  It is however important to
bear in mind a number of factors, firstly that
although there is a practice
akin to it, there is in our Rules no specific equivalent to the Queensland O
91, r 3 upon which the
Queensland court placed reliance; and furthermore,
whilst rejecting the approach of simply adding up the number of imputations
upon
which the plaintiff succeeded and those on which he failed, the Court
noted that it was a case where there were a number of separate
publications,
and that there were really three discreet areas of dispute or "units of
litigation", where the plaintiff had been wholly
unsuccessful on the first,
largely unsuccessful on the second, and wholly successful as to the third,
which was the least damaging
of the imputations.
<P>

8   	Here on the other hand there was only one publication,
there was only "issue of litigation", there is no equivalent to the
Queensland
Rule of Court and the circumstances were quite different.  More importantly, as
I have already observed, there is no practice
in this State, that I am aware
of, to differentiate as to costs in defamation cases between the imputations on
which the plaintiff
has succeeded and those on which he has failed.  I,
therefore, would not be prepared to adopt such a course in this case, but I
have
considered whether it would be practical or feasible to do so, if I were
so minded.
<P>

9   	On the first day of the hearing, 22 March 1999, there were
procedural arguments.  There was a short argument in relation to
imputations
(b) and (c) and I struck out imputation (b) but declined such application in
respect of imputation (c): see  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/291.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 291.</a>  The jury, having been
empanelled at about 10.30 am, and sent away whilst this and another argument on
the procedure to be followed
(see  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/290.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 290)</a>, were then brought into
court and Senior Counsel for the Plaintiff commenced his  opening address.  The
jury were involved the rest
of that day and all of the second day, 23 March, at
the end of which they returned verdicts in favour of the plaintiff on
imputations
(a) and (d) and in favour of the defendants on imputations (c) and
(e).
<P>

10   	On 24, 25 and 26 March evidence was led concerning the
plaintiff's reputation and his claim for damages, and Counsel addressed
in
respect of the defence of comment in relation to imputations (a) and (d).  At
the end of that time I reserved my decision and
in my judgment of 9 June,
([1999] NSWSC 436) I dealt with the defence of comment and the issue of
damages, and I directed the entry
of judgment for the defendants on imputation
(a) and for the plaintiff on imputation (d), and assessed at damages at $75,000
plus
interest.
<P>

11   	It would be impossible, in my view, to break-up the time
taken in the course of the hearing and apportion such time to the
different
imputations. It would be unrealistic to say that at the end of day two the
plaintiff had failed on two of the five imputations
and therefore should pay,
for example, a proportion of the defendants' costs, because the time to that
stage had been largely taken
up with the imputation on which the plaintiff
ultimately succeeded, namely imputation (d).  On days 3, 4 and 5 the evidence
relating
to the plaintiff's reputation and claim for damages went to both of
the imputations that were then remaining and would have been
but minimally
shorter if only imputation (d) was then left.  Therefore, although I would not
be prepared to break up the costs by
reference to the time taken on the
different imputations, I point out it would also be an impossible task to
attempt.  For these
reasons I adhere to my earlier orders that the defendants
pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

12   	Mr McClintock SC for the defendants also submitted that I
should order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs up to the
first day of
the hearing, 22 March 1999, because it was only on the filing in court on that
day of the Second Further Amended Statement
of Claim that the imputation on
which the plaintiff ultimately succeeded, namely, that "he is a heartless
person" was pleaded.  Some
of the earlier imputations alleged were abandoned
and as to the others the defendant succeeded and, therefore, it was submitted
that
as the plaintiff would have failed but for the amendment, the plaintiff
should pay the costs up to the date of such amendment, and
he referred me to
<b><i>Beoco Ltd v Alfa Laval Co Ltd</i></b> [1995] QB 137 at 154,156.  
<P>

13   	But, that principle only applies where a plaintiff makes a
later amendment which substantially alters the case the defendant
has to meet,
and without which the proceedings would have failed.  Here I do not regard the
later amendment as substantial in that
sense.  It is a recognised fact that
pleadings in defamation cases, particularly the imputations alleged, are
substantially honed
and refined time and time again before the matter actually
gets to the final hearing.  This may not be desirable but it is a fact
of life
and in this case, although no reference was made in any of the earlier
pleadings to the plaintiff being a "heartless person",
there was from the
original Statement of Claim an imputation which alleged that he was "a person
who had no compassion".  In my view
to say that a person has no compassion and
to say he is a heartless person are  substantially the same and, accordingly, I
do not
consider that the plaintiff should be deprived of his costs up to the
date of the amendment.  He should pay the costs thrown away
by the amendment,
but these would not include all the costs of the preparation of the case for
trial.
<P>

14   	I turn now to consider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a>, r 33.  The issue is whether
I should make a special order pursuant to subrules (4)(e) and (5).  I was
referred to <b><i>John Fairfax and Sons Limited v Palmer </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR
297</a> where the Court of Appeal held that matters relevant to the exercise of the
discretion included the existence of complex questions
of law and fact, the
presence in a verdict in proceedings for defamation of the element of
vindication of the plaintiff and his reputation,
and the existence in respect
of defamation proceedings of the practical facility of the Defamation List in
the Supreme Court, but
that matters not relevant included the plaintiff's
expectation of a likely verdict at the time of the commencing the proceedings
and the professional status and standing of the plaintiff.
<P>

15   	In this case the questions of law and fact were not
particularly complex, and could have been disposed of, one would hope,
without
undue difficulty in the District Court.  There is now a special Defamation List
in the District Court but that was not the
case at the time these proceedings
were commenced, and there certainly was a culture in this State to bring
proceedings for defamation,
particularly those involving the public media, such
as a metropolitan radio station with franchised relays to country and
interstate
stations, in this Court.  I do not consider that the plaintiff had a
reasonable expectation of obtaining more than he in fact recovered
at the time
he commenced the proceedings, but in any event, the question of the plaintiff's
expectation has been revisited since
<b><i>Palmer's</i></b> case by the
introduction of subrule (6).  It was held in <b><i>Palmer </i></b>that the
professional status and standing of the plaintiff was not a material
consideration and in that case the plaintiff was a prominent
physician.  Here
he was a barrister-at-law, an officer of the Court, and the case concerned his
conduct of a case in a court.  This,
I think, takes the case out of the general
rule that the professional standing is not relevant and I refer to <b><i>Toomey
v John Fairfax and Sons Ltd</i></b> noted at <b><u>Ritchie: Supreme Court
Procedure (NSW)</u></b> para [130350].
<P>

16   	In all the circumstances I consider this was an
appropriate case to be brought in this Court and that I should make an order
under subrule (5) for the plaintiff to recover his costs as though <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 33</a> did
not apply.  Those facts and also the fact that the defendant saw fit to engage
Senior Counsel, in my view, is sufficient ground
for an order under subrule (7)
for two counsel.
<P>

17   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	Costs occasioned by and thrown away by the filing of Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim to be paid by the plaintiff.
<P>

(2)	Costs occasioned by and thrown away by the filing of the defendants' last
Amended Defence to be paid by the defendants.
<P>

(3)	I confirm order for the costs of the proceedings made on 9 June 1999.
<P>

(4)	I order such costs be assessed as though SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a>, r 33 did not apply.
<P>

(5)	I certify for two counsel.
<P>

(6)	The defendants' Notice of Motion filed 11 June 1999 dismissed.
<P>

18   	In view of the fact that both parties have argued
questions of costs today, the defendant has failed and the plaintiff has
obtained an order which should have been sought on 9 June, I consider that
there should be no order for the costs of the motion and
that each party should
pay their own costs of the Notice of Motion and of today's hearing.
