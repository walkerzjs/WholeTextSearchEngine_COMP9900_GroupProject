<b><u>600022/98  -  SALLY PHILLIPS  v  WOOLWORTHS (QUEENSLAND) PTY
LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In this action the plaintiff seeks damages
from her former employer in connection with injuries sustained in an
accident
on 24 December 1996.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff is a young woman born on 19 November 1976.
She was educated at the Grafton High School where she completed her
education
sitting for the Higher School Certificate.  Apparently she did not attain a
very high mark in English, and this becomes
relevant as she apparently did not
achieve the level required to enter into a course for kindergarten teaching or
child minding which
was an ambition of hers.  I mention this at present because
whilst the ambition is the subject of reference in a number of places
throughout the evidence there is nothing to found a conclusion that the
plaintiff would eventually have achieved that ambition.
<P>

3   	After leaving school she commenced to work full-time for
the defendant in its supermarket, an occupation which she had pursued
part-time
whilst she was a school girl.  In the light of all the evidence it seems
reasonable to postulate any findings as to damages
on a career in the
employment of the defendant.  As noted, the action had occurred on Christmas
Eve.  Although the pleading gives
a different time I accept that it happened at
about four or 4.30 in the afternoon.  I am satisfied that the supermarket was
very
busy at that time.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff on that day was rostered to work in the
serving of customers in what is known as the delicatessen area.  The
store also
makes available to the public chickens cooked on a rotisserie, those chickens
also being available for sale in fresh form.
 The chickens are delivered to the
store but require preparation, that is to say, the tucking of the wings into
part of the carcass
of the bird and the placing of the legs in a position so as
to make rotisserie cooking possible.  Other staff of the defendant had
attended
to this in relation to a large number of chickens.  There is an estimate in the
evidence that some 800 kilograms of chickens
were stacked onto a three level
trolley.  The chickens are delivered in boxes containing about ten carcasses.
After preparation they
are returned into the boxes.
<P>

5   	It has been observed that juices, blood and other fluid,
leaks from the carcasses and although there is some plastic lining
within the
boxes it was a common experience for liquid to leak onto the floor.  On the day
in question this large  accumulation of
stock had apparently been standing in
an area for about an hour.  The preparation had been done and it was intended
to move the carcasses
back into the coolroom.
<P>

6   	This task was to be performed by an employee Mr Darren
Demmery.  The movement of the trolley could not effectively or conveniently
be
done by him alone and he acquired the assistance of the plaintiff and one other
female staff member to perform the move.  Mr Demmery
was pulling the trolley
from one end and the two women were pushing from the other.  The accident
happened when the plaintiff's foot
encountered leakage from the chickens which
had been stacked on the trolley and she slipped and fell to the ground striking
her knee.
<P>

7   	I accept the evidence of Mr Simpson that the hazard
encountered by the plaintiff could very simply have been avoided if the
trolley
had been fitted with a catch tray or any other simple gadget to prevent such
leakage.  Indeed the negligence of the defendant
in the circumstances I have
described is almost self-evident, as was recognised by counsel for the
defendant when with some understatement
he submitted that that the defence case
on liability was not his strongest point.
<P>

8   	After some objection I admitted a statement by Mr Darren
Demery.  That statement reveals that it was a common occurrence for
liquid to
drip through cartons onto the floor.  The matter had been reported to
superiors.  I accept that evidence.  Indeed it seems
to me that a mesh trolley
of the type depicted would inevitably allow such leakage onto the floor if it
was stacked with items such
as chicken carcasses.
<P>

9   	A more focused submission was made by the defendant in
relation to the assertion of contributory negligence.  The defendant's
case was
based upon two aspects of the evidence principally.  The first a concession in
cross-examination by the plaintiff that she
was not looking at the ground as
she was walking and, the second, an exercise in motion physics derived by the
defendant in cross-examination
of the plaintiff herself concerning the location
of her foot, the movement of the trolley and a consequent assertion, if one
accepted
her evidence precisely, that the single step forward she said she had
made could not have brought her foot into contact without any
leakage from
underneath the trolley.
<P>

10   	I do not accept that those concessions in
cross-examination should be taken as literal measurements of what occurred.
Quite
obviously a motion was going on at the time.  The existence of the spill
from the trolley and its connection with the fall was evident
in the
defendant's own report to its insurer.
<P>

11   	Mr Demmery saw what occurred.  I accept the plaintiff's
evidence in relation to it.  Despite the concessions in cross-examination
I am
comfortably satisfied what happened was that the trolley began to move and the
plaintiff stepped forward into the area where
the trolley had been and her foot
contacted the detritus on the floor causing her to fall.
<P>

12   	In relation to her concession that she was not looking at
the time, I do not find it a requirement of a prudent employee to
cast her eyes
to the floor in order to perform the task which she was asked to undertake on
this occasion.  I am not satisfied that
the defendant has demonstrated that the
plaintiff was herself a significant contributor to the accident or her
consequent damage.
 There will be a finding of negligence as has been
established but contributory negligence has not been established.
<P>

13   	There will therefore by a verdict for the plaintiff
undiminished by any discount for contributory negligence.
<P>

14   	I turn therefore to the issue of damage.  I should specify
at the outset I have formed the impression that the plaintiff was
a very
vulnerable young lady.  There is evidence that she was afflicted by what was
described as dizzy spells and she gave evidence
of occasions when she had, to
use her description, hyperventilated.  She consulted a medical practitioner and
was told she suffered
from stress.
<P>

15   	These matters give some explanation to the rather tragic
and extraordinary results from what must be described as a minor
injury, but is
of course of no benefit of the damages to the defendant which, it is trite to
say, must take a plaintiff as it finds
her.
<P>

16   	The injury to the knee seems to have been minor indeed.
The plaintiff's response to this minor injury seems to have been,
and this is
my description rather than that of any medical practitioner, almost hysterical.
Regrettably, the evidence does not give
me any psychiatric opinion as to this
extraordinary and extravagant response to her minor injury, although I note
that the defendant
arranged for consultation and the plaintiff was examined by
a psychiatrist called Dr Petroff, but no report from him was served.
 I infer
that anything that Dr Petroff would have said would not advance the defendant's
case.
<P>

17   	I have said that the injury itself was minor, as I shall
note in a few minutes time when I refer to the medical evidence,
apart from a
chrondromalacia nothing could be found that was wrong with the knee.  An MRI
scan showed total normality and indeed
the disastrous situation of the
plaintiff's knee is, in my finding, entirely due to her perception of pain and
her inability to appreciate
that there is no substantial injury in the physical
sense to the knee.  That is not to say that the syndrome that has developed has
not now led to a situation where there is damage to the leg.
<P>

18   	There is damage also to other parts of her body because to
favour that leg she has hopped on her left leg causing damage there.
 She has
back pain and contractures are developing.
<P>

19   	In substance there is no real dispute amongst the medical
examiners, the evidence of all of whom was received by way of reports
tendered
by consent.  It is appropriate to extract some of the material from the
reporting doctors.
<P>

20   	The history of injury was that the plaintiff after bumping
her knee during the fall worked on for about half an hour to the
end of her
shift.  She was off work for the next four days during the Christmas break.
She noticed her knee was swollen and she noticed
it did not improve.  She
returned to work but it was not improving.  She saw a locum of her general
practitioner and later her general
practitioner, Dr Terrey.  Her complaints
provoked him to refer her to Dr Hefner an orthopaedics surgeon and it was he in
February
 1997 who admitted her to private surgery for arthoroscopy.
<P>

21   	It is convenient to take up the story, as it were, from
the findings of Dr Hefner.  He said:
<P>

"I could move the knee through all perfectly normal range of movements without
any clunks and without any ligamentous problems.
 However I then went onto
perform arthroscopy and found that she had a pristine knee in terms of menisci,
cruciate ligaments and
articular surface of the tibia and femur.  There were no
loose bodies.
<P>

 
<P>

Behind the medial facet of the patella there was a divot, like a long gutter
with a flat tear in it on the articular cartilage.
 This obviously represented
a chrondromalacia and could be caused by direct trauma, so I then undertook to
use a chondrotome to smooth
this off."
<P>

22   	It might be observed that this finding was the only
initial physical indication of injury that was detected by any examination
until a later time when non-use led to the dystrophy.  Indeed Dr Hefner in 1997
predicted what was to occur.  Referring to his examination
of the plaintiff
during the ensuing year he added: 
<P>

"When I saw her at that stage I stated to her that her leg had that motley blue
colouring to it associated with non-use and I wondered
whether she may have had
a reflex dystrophy developing as a result of not using the leg."
<P>

23   	Then (in response obviously to a question from the
solicitors) he reported:
<P>

"It would appear from the fall that she had that she sustained some degree of
damage behind the patella, however she has gone onto
develop a reflex dystrophy
of the knee and the only treatment required is prolonged time and encouragement
to use it and walk upon
it."
<P>

24   	The tragedy to which I have made reference is that the
plaintiff has not used or walked upon the leg.  Her response has been
such that
she complains that even a drop of water falling upon the leg causes her pain.
She refuses to allow medical examiners to
touch her.
<P>

25   	There is evidence of a relationship of a sort which she
has with a young man called Smith who gave evidence corroborating
the matters
to which I have referred.  It should be stated however that it was not
suggested to the plaintiff that she was feigning
or malingering these
symptoms.
<P>

26   	As I have already remarked, it would have been possibly
helpful to have some psychiatric opinion, but it seems to me doing
the best I
can on the material before me that the plaintiff's reaction is likely to be
found in her own personality as manifest in
what I referred to as
vulnerability.
<P>

27   	The plaintiff has also been examined on a number of
occasions by Dr Ian Chan an orthopaedic surgeon to whom she was referred
to a
second opinion.  He confirmed that the plaintiff had suffered an autonomic
dystrophy secondary to the injury to her knee when
she slipped over at
Woolworths.  I note that in the course of his consultations with the plaintiff
he reported that he told her not
to stop using the leg, as to do so would
worsen her situation.
<P>

28   	Unfortunately, the plaintiff has not seemed to be able  to
comply with that advice.  In a report dated 29 May 1998 Dr Chan
said this:
<P>

"I said to Sally and her mother that definitely at this stage I have no reason
to subject her to another operation as it may worsen
her symptoms.  She is
still extremely tender in all areas of her lower leg.  It is a shiny leg.
There is some wasting of her calf
which is not surprising and a blueness to it.
She has however some tenderness in her back and as a back lesion may cause
right leg
pain and disability.  I feel it would be worthwhile to investigate
her spinal region to see if anything in particular may be found
which might be
causing her symptoms."
<P>

29   	As I have said in passing, the non-use of the leg has as a
secondary consequence provoked symptoms in other parts of the body
particularly
the other leg and the lower spine.
<P>

30   	There is a report from Dr Gregory Carr a rheumatologist.
This report was tendered both by the plaintiff and by the defendant.
 In the
light of that unanimity it is perhaps worth quoting the final observations of
Dr Carr.  He said:
<P>

"She truly has had gross pain in her right leg and extreme sensitivity and
temperature and colour alteration from this injury. 
She has not responded to
sympathetic blockade.  She is unfit for employment that involves any standing
work.  She would be fit to
do some work in a sitting position.  However of a
part-time nature, say, beginning with about 12 hours a week.  The prognosis is
guarded.  Only about 25 per cent cases of sympathetic dystrophy respond to any
medical treatment and it certainly does not look as
though Sally is going to
respond.  It may take seven to ten years for the effect on the nervous system
to slowly abate.  The ultimate
prognosis is uncertain.  There is a direct
relationship between her fall onto her right knee and her ongoing right leg
symptoms.
 There is an indirect nexus between her low back, left leg symptoms
and the aches and pains in the hands, shoulders and wrists as
these have
occurred as a compensation for long periods of weight bearing on one leg and
the use of crutches."
<P>

31   	Next I should refer to a report tendered by the plaintiff
of Dr Miller a specialist and general surgeon.  He noted it was
extremely
difficult to examine the plaintiff as she would not allow him to touch her leg.
She complained that even slight tactile
stimulation caused extreme pain. Dr
Miller reported in part this opinion:
<P>

"As a direct result of a fall at work this lady injured her right knee.  She
unfortunately developed the serious complication of
reflex sympathetic
dystrophy.  She has had all the known treatments for this condition and has
failed to respond to date.
<P>

 
<P>

From the appearance of her right lower limb now she appears to be developing a
fixed flexion deformity of her right ankle and right
knee and considerable
muscle wasting of the quadriceps and calf musculature.
<P>

 
<P>

Even if her reflex sympathetic dystrophy resolves in the future it is apparent
that she will be left with a useless right leg due
to the development of
contractures in her right  ankle and right knee joints.
<P>

 
<P>

It would appear that the compensatory overuse of her left leg and lower back
are leading to further symptoms.  In regard to her
back she has congenital
scoliosis and it is clear that the continued use of crutches and favouring of
the right leg is beginning
to cause her back symptomatology."
<P>

32   	The final medical opinion to which I will make reference
is a report from Associate Professor Jones which was tendered on
behalf of the
defendant.  A quotation from his report will confirm my earlier statement that
there is in essence no real issue about
the medical situation of the plaintiff.
Professor Jones stated in his conclusion:
<P>

"Miss Phillips suffered what would seem to have been a minor accident in an
industrial accident on 24.12.96 following which she
developed disuse atrophy of
her right leg and a reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  At this time she is not in
any treatment program,
her condition is not improving and there is little
functional use of her right leg which she holds in a position of flexion
contractures.
I believe her to be independent in personal care and many
activities of daily living principally as a one legged person and she would
have potential to undertake vocational pursuits of a clerical capacity.  Her
condition as described is one of reflex sympathetic
dystrophy - the cause of
which in this instance is difficult to determine.
<P>

 
<P>

Unless she comes to terms with her perceptions of impairment and uses her right
leg then it will become progressively atrophic,
contracted and useless and pain
will increase ultimately leading to rather radical decisions of management."
<P>

 
<P>

Further Professor Jones remarked:
<P>

"Vocational rehabilitation will benefit Miss Phillips if she can live with her
impairments and hopefully improve the function in
the right leg.  If she does
not, the condition will deteriorate.  Psychological support and a pain
management program encouraging
her to use her right leg would be an appropriate
form of therapy over at least a twelve month period.  Unless the outcome is
favourable
there are dire consequences.  At this time she may require
approximately three hours of domestic assistance per week on the basis
of her
perceptions of impairment and the reduced function in the right leg."
<P>

33   	As I have indicated, I generally accept the medical
evidence.  The situation is that there is a relevant causal nexus between
the
plaintiff's present impairment and condition and the accident.
<P>

34   	I turn therefore to deal with the individual ingredients
of damage.  The out-of-pocket expenses and workers compensation entitlements
amount to $40,120.00.  There is a submission made on behalf of the plaintiff
that by reference to wages earned by Miss Cole, an asserted
comparable employee
at Woolworths, that the plaintiff would have earned if she remained in the
employment between the date and the
tort $42,641.00.  There was no contesting
submission made on  behalf of the defendant suggesting other than that I should
include
that amount in damages.  In any event independently I find that should
be included in the award.  Thereby an ingredient of $42,641.00
for economic
loss to date is included.
<P>

35   	I turn then to the issue of future economic loss.  The
evidence to which I have made some reference talks of the chance of
resolution
or improvement but also of the permanent damage that is being done by reason of
the non-use in the period to date.  The
plaintiff of course could be viewed in
terms of analogy as a one legged person.  That injury does not render the
victim totally unemployable.
<P>

36   	I note that in one of the opinions that I have recited
there is reference to commencing at something like 12 hours per week
of
sedentary employment.  The implication is that that number of hours may
increase over the years in the future.  On the other hand,
I have to take into
account the predictions so eloquently made by Professor Jones that if the
plaintiff cannot come to terms with
what is required of her the consequences
will be dire.
<P>

37   	The plaintiff has advanced a submission that if one took
what I take to be the present wages of a comparable employee of $388.00
and
projected that over a working life of 42 years using a multiplier of 931.6
there would be capitalization at $361,460.00.
<P>

38   	There was tendered a series of sheets of wage records and
I infer that the submitted figure of $388.00 was extracted therefrom.
 No
submission was made by the defendant that that was an inappropriate figure to
use and I adopt it accordingly.
<P>

39   	Senior counsel for the plaintiff recognising that some
allowance had been made for vicissitudes and also some exercise of
residual
capacity tendered and spoke to a written submission in which it is suggested
that I should take from the calculated sum
that I have mentioned the almost
conventional 15 per cent and then from the resultant figure deduct a further 15
per cent to represent
residual capacity.
<P>

40   	I note in passing that that two-stage deduction leaves a
larger figure to be notionally awarded as damages than if 30 per
cent was taken
from the original figure.  That is merely a matter of arithmetic.
<P>

41   	I have indicated that I regard the plaintiff's future as
probably bleak.  However I cannot find that she is entirely without
prospect of
performing any work and therefore income producing over the next 42 years of
her life.  The lastmentioned like other
one-legged persons to use the analogy
that I have taken.
<P>

42   	There must be a scope of activity, if she chose, she could
undertake.  I have to take into account that although she sat for
Higher School
Certificate her academic achievement has apparently  not been high.  There are
vocational assessments made by psychologists
and also some mention of such
matters in a report from an occupational therapist Miss Berger to which I will
make later reference.
<P>

43   	Doing the best I can between the parties, I regard it as
appropriate to use as an initial guide the full figure for total
loss of
employment with the defendant until a notional retiring age 42 years hence and
I propose to deduct one-third  to allow for
adverse vicissitudes and any
residual capacity that the plaintiff may choose to exercise during the balance
of her notional working
life.
<P>

44   	If one takes one-third from the base of figure of $361,460
there is left $240,973.00 and I propose to include that sum as
an ingredient in
the damages.
<P>

45   	The parties are agreed that I should include in the
damages the sum of $4,000 to avoid the detriment to the plaintiff identified
by
the High Court in<b> Fox v Wood</b>.
<P>

46   	I turn next to a claim made for future treatment.  The
plaintiff gave evidence that she visits her general practitioner several
times
a month and also obtains renewals of prescription for Panadeine Forte on a
monthly basis.  It would appear that is the only
medication which she takes.
<P>

47   	As is implicit in the medical material and in those parts
which I have recited, it does not appear that the plaintiff has
been able to
respond positively to the medical advice that she has received.  In this claim
for future treatment reference is also
made to expenses for pain management and
for counselling.  A schedule of payments shows that, for example, a lump sum of
$5,000 was
paid by the workers compensation insurer in respect of pain
management.
<P>

48   	The expenditure on counselling is a matter which is
somewhat obscure.  I can only conclude that whatever counselling has been
given
it has not been sufficiently effective to persuade the plaintiff to undertake
the use of her leg as unanimously has been advised
to her by the range of
medical practitioners whom she has seen.
<P>

49   	The other item which it is sought to include in that
ingredient of compensation is the additional cost of motor vehicle apparatus
in
order to place the accelerator on a vehicle so that the plaintiff can use her
left foot.  It seems to me that given the whole
of the circumstances that is a
reasonable response in the plaintiff's case; that is to say, that such
modifications should be made
to any vehicle that she owns.
<P>

50   	The figures taken in the conventional way from the report
from the NRMA brings the cost down to an estimated weekly amount
of $10.  The
cost of attendance upon a general practitioner and the purchase of medication
has been for these purposes reduced to
an average expenditure of about $13 per
week.
<P>

51   	As evidenced, the expenditure if it is to be made in the
future on pain management counselling is somewhat obscure. Then there
is the
$10 per week for the motor vehicle.  As is obvious from simple additions, there
is a base figure, ignoring the pain management
and counselling, of some $23 a
week.
<P>

52   	The next problem to contemplate is how far into the future
that expenditure is likely to extend and how long the plaintiff
is likely to
make such expenditure as a result of reasonable response to tort induced
need.
<P>

53   	In the written schedule to which counsel spoke in
submissions a claim is made for a round sum of $50,000 although it would
seem
to be the product of divination as much as arithmetic.
<P>

54   	I am unable to be persuaded as a question of probability
that the plaintiff's expenses will continue at that, that is  $23
per week plus
a sum for pain management over the balance of her life expectancy.  My task is
to award a figure which in judgment
is fair to the parties but which reflect
the consequences of the tort committed by the defendant.  I observe that if I
increased
the figure of $23 to $25, that is to say a $2 a week increase, and
gave the plaintiff that sum for the next 25 years capitalisation
at a five per
cent authorised factor of 783 would produced a lump sum of $19,575.00.  In my
view a round sum of $20,000 would be
appropriate for this ingredient of
damage.
<P>

55   	I performed the mathematical exercise merely to give
myself some guidance as to what a lump sum of $20,000 will represent.
 That
figure will be included in damages for future expenditure.
<P>

56   	I now turn to a claim for domestic assistance.  I have
found this a most difficult task in the light of the evidence in this
case.  On
the one hand, one has the comment of Professor Jones, that at the moment
unspecified domestic assistance could be assessed
as something in the order of
three hours per week.
<P>

57   	Evidence was called from the plaintiff's father.  He
testified that they not only fetched and carried for the plaintiff but
did
everything for her.  He gave this evidence: 
<P>

"Q. Do people fetch and carry for her?  
<P>

A. Everything.  We literally do everything.  If she wants a cup of coffee or a
cup of tea we have to make it for her.  We have to
carry it for her because
having to use the two crutches she is incapable of balancing the cup, so if it
is hot, obviously the water
might spill out of the cup and scald her, if it is
hot, so we have to do everything.  She may have Weetbix in the morning and put
milk on it and we have to physically take it over and put it down for her
because she can't carry it and put it down once again.
 
<P>

Q. Things like washing and ironing?  
<P>

A. Incapable.  Once again she could not stand long enough to do it. 
<P>

Q. Making her own bed? 
<P>

A. Incapable. 
<P>

Q. Things like helping with the vacuuming or cleaning the bathroom?  
<P>

A. Not a chance at all.  Once again she used to do it prior to the accident.
We could get up in the morning and she would already
have a load of washing on
but nowadays, no."
<P>

58   	As evidence it appears to me, from that passage in
particular, the father has responded by treating the plaintiff as an invalid.
I do not regard his evidence as sincere and it is tinged by exaggeration.  The
reference to the Weetbix has a flavour of the absurd
about it.  The plaintiff
is perfectly capable of sitting at a table and if the Weetbix is on the table
and the milk is there she
can prepare her own breakfast.  The need for walking
around with the bowl is, in my view, an imaginative effort by the plaintiff's
father to exaggerate the level of her disability.
<P>

59   	I observe that the plaintiff's mother was not called and I
infer that her evidence would not have assisted the plaintiff's
case.
<P>

60   	There is however another source of evidence concerning the
need for services and that is in the report of the occupational
therapist Miss
Berger.  I do not recite the various items that Miss Berger has collated as
these can be read in her report.  However
in final conclusion she made  this
observation:
<P>

"It is considered that Miss Phillips is not able to provide such services for
herself. It is estimated that the family provide about
ten hours per week in
meal and snack preparation, 15 to 20 hours per week in household cleaning, six
hours per week in laundry tasks,
two hours per week in grocery and personal
shopping, one hour per week in garden maintenance and daily driving of at least
30 minutes
with occasional driving over several hours. The family and friends
undertake to provide constant companionship."
<P>

61   	Part of my task is to sit as a tribunal of fact.  I do not
accept that in the context of any reasonable single human being's
existence
something in the order of 21 to 26 hours per week each and every week 52 weeks
a year for the balance of their life is
spent performing the task of laundry
and household cleaning.  Any dedication or devotion to this extent would
produce pristine accommodation
for that single person to a quite remarkable
extent.
<P>

62   	I regard Miss Berger's estimates as beyond the limits of
reasonable response to tort induced need.  Perhaps the extravagance
of Miss
Berger's opinion was recognised by counsel who advanced a claim based on a
total of 28 hours per week for the entirety of
the provision of services.
<P>

63   	There was also tendered a separate quote from a person who
would provide lawn mowing services.  The plaintiff's situation
is that she
resides at home with her parents.  She is of course entitled to leave home in
due course but there is no evidence as
to whether she would live at home or go
to a home or flat or apartment or anything else.
<P>

64   	I am however satisfied that given the plaintiff's
disabilities, particularly as perceived by her, that she has established
that
it would be reasonable to provide her with some form of assistance.  The
question is how I should measure that.  As I believe
would be apparent from my
earlier remarks, I do not accept as a basis for calculation either the evidence
of her father or the evidence
of Miss Berger. On the other hand, I do not
accept the evidence of Professor Jones unembellished as it is as to any
description of
services that the professor had in mind.  My task is to award
damages of course and not to look into a crystal ball and establish
what it is
the plaintiff will have provided for her over the balance of her life, the
expectancy of which would appear to be in the
order of 58 years.
<P>

65   	In order to provide myself a basis for determining an
appropriate figure I have elected to perform the following calculation.
 I do
not suggest that is what will happen in the future but it seems to me to
represent a reasonable way of making an estimate of
what should be included in
the damages for this ingredient of loss.  If one were to hypothesise that the
plaintiff were supplied
with what in effect amounts to a servant for two
working days seven days a week each and every week for every day of her life
and
that person was to provide all services or every other need that the
plaintiff cannot fulfil herself and take the rate of $15 per
hour, one can
perform a calculation of 14 hours per week at $15 by 1006, that is the factor
referrable to a life expectancy of 58,
and produce a lump sum of $211,323.
<P>

66   	In the submission advanced on behalf of the plaintiff,
which was done on a different calculation, I was invited to discount
that
calculation by 15 per cent.  It is not in my view appropriate to discount
damages calculated in this fashion for adverse vicissitudes.
<P>

67   	I have for guidance performed the sum earlier mentioned
and propose to include $211,311.00 in damages for future assistance
of the
nature that I have specified.
<P>

68   	Finally, in terms of the ingredients I come to the issue
of non-economic loss.  My task is to assess the plaintiff's disability
in terms
of a proportion of a most extreme case.  The figure referable to a most extreme
case is $221,650.
<P>

69   	Whilst, as I have said, the initial injury to the
plaintiff was minor the consequences have been the reverse of that.  The
defendant is not in a position to obtain any benefit from the circumstance that
it is the plaintiff's apparently peculiar vulnerability
that has led to the
horrendous consequence to her leg.
<P>

70   	I have come to the conclusion that her overall situation
represents 65 per cent of a most extreme case and according to the
proportionate table therefore the ingredient to be included in the damages
would be $144,072.  The ingredients which I have thus
far calculated can be
tabulated as follows: Out of pocket expenses $40,120; economic loss to date
$42,641; future economic loss $240,973;<b> Fox v Wood</b> $4,000; future
expenses $20,000; future assistance $211,323; and non-economic loss
$144,072.
<P>

71   	In tabulating those amounts I have observed that I have
omitted to include in the damages a claim for assistance in the past.
 That
amount would be calculated over the period of 132 weeks at the rate which I
used for guidance namely $15 per hour for 14 hours
per week.  There should
therefore be included in the damages $27,720 for services to date.  The total
of the ingredients thus far
is $730,849.00.
<P>

72   	The defendant pleads payment in accordance with the
appropriate statute to the extent of $72,421.00 and I find the defence
of
payment made out to the extent of that figure.
<P>

73   	It was foreshadowed that the plaintiff would make a claim
for loss of employer contribution, loss of superannuation benefits
in the
future, but such claim could not be formulated until my findings were known.
It was also foreshadowed that depending on my
findings there would be a finding
for interest according to the terms of statute. Accordingly I allow liberty to
apply in respect
of those issues and I reserve judgment.
<P>

PETTY:  We have reached agreement as to the past and future superannuation
entitlements based on your Honour's findings. We propose
to give the two
contingencies if you would tender subsequently a typescript of the calculations
that underpin the two agreed sums?
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  That seems sensible.
<P>

 
<P>

PETTY:  The total amount is $22,358.00.
<P>

 
<P>

74   	HIS HONOUR:  I have been informed by the representatives
of  the parties that for the purposes of calculation it has been
agreed,
derived from the findings which I have just announced, a calculation can be
made of the loss of employer contributions both
past and present an amount of
$22,358.00. I give leave to the parties to tender and tender in evidence a
sheet showing that amount
was calculated in order that there might be a
reference point in the order that this point is taken elsewhere.
<P>

 
<P>

75   	I am informed there is no application in respect of
interest.  The amount of my sum including the mentioned sum is $753,207.00.
 In
accordance with the plea made good as to payment there should be deducted the
sum of $72,421.00, leaving a figure of $680,786.00.
<P>

76   	I direct entry of judgment for the plaintiff for
$680,786.00.
<P>

Any application as to costs?
<P>

PETTY:  I seek an offer of compromise - the relevant date was 1 April 1999.
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Is it agreed that the offer was less than the result.
<P>

 
<P>

DEFENDANT:  Yes.
<P>

 
<P>

PETTY:  There is no 10 per cent as far as costs.  It only arises if it is a
photo finish.  This is not a photo finish. I will tender
the offer of
compromise.
<P>

 
<P>

EXHIBIT #P OFFER OF COMPROMISE TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION.
<P>

 
<P>

77   	HIS HONOUR:  I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's
costs of action such to be on an indemnity basis from 1 April 1999.
<P>

 
<P>

PETTY:  The last thing is two counsel including two senior counsel.
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  I do not have any power do that.  That is only in the District
Court.  In the Supreme Court it is not a matter that
is certified.  In this
case I am asked to certify for two counsel.  I am conscious of the provisions
as to certification of counsel
which to my memory used to exist in the District
Court, although I have not looked for those rules for many years now.  I am not
directed to any rule of the Supreme Court.  But however for the costs assessor
I would express the view in the light of the very
particular and potentially
difficult issues of damages in this case that it was an appropriate case for
the retainer of senior and
junior counsel.
