<b><u>70050/97 - REGINA  v  Nicholas Raymond GRENENGER</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>ON SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	On 3 March 1999 Nicholas Raymond Grenenger, ["the
prisoner"], was presented in this Court for trial upon an indictment charging
him
with having murdered, on or about 5 November 1996 at Bargo, one Robert
Lance Wirepo, ["the deceased"]. The prisoner pleaded not guilty,
and he was
put, accordingly, upon his trial by jury. The trial continued until 19 March
1999, upon which day the jury returned a
verdict finding the prisoner not
guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 
<P>

2	The prisoner was remanded in custody to 26 March for sentence. On that day I
heard submissions on sentence; and thereafter I further
remanded the prisoner
in custody for sentence on a date to be fixed. 
<P>

3	The Crown case at trial was, essentially, a simple one. It was that at about
7 pm on 5 November 1996 a number of patrons were
drinking in the bar of Bicey's
Hotel at Bargo. Among them were the prisoner and the deceased. The prisoner was
in the company of
two men named Davies and Pascoe; and the deceased was in the
company of two men named Baird and Cockburn. A fight broke out between
Mr.
Davies and Mr. Baird, and it developed very quickly into an ugly incident
involving all six of the men previously mentioned.
In the course of that
expanded fight, the prisoner picked up a bar stool and struck with it a number
of blows to the deceased. One
of those blows caused part of one of the metal
legs of the bar stool to puncture the right side of the deceased's head at a
point
10 cm above, and 2 cm in front of, the deceased's right ear canal; and to
penetrate the deceased's skull in a track moving from front
to back, from right
to left, and downwards. 
<P>

4	The severity of this wound can be judged from the following detailed
description of the wound as given by Dr. Hulewicz, the pathologist
who
conducted the post mortem examination of the deceased:
<P>

	"There was a track extending from the hole in the scalp through the right side
of the skull through the dura. The dura is a tough
membrane which surrounds the
brain, through the right side of the brain. Also through the left side of the
brain and then through
the dura on the other side of the brain and the track
ended in the left petrous temporal bone where there was an excavated circular
defect 1.5 cms in diameter and 0.3 cms in depth. The petrous temporal bone is a
bar of bone which forms part of the base of the skull.
So the object
penetrating the head went straight through the brain, then struck that
particular bone producing a crater defect on
the surface of the bone."
<P>

5	The action which caused this wound was so strong that, when the metal stool
leg was withdrawn from the deceased's skull, a plastic
lug attached to the foot
of the metal leg became detached and remained lodged in the deceased's skull
until it was removed at the
post-mortem examination.
<P>

6	At trial there was some attempt made to put into precise language a
description of the degree of force with which the fatal blow
must have been
struck in order to cause such a penetrating injury. Such evidence as was given
in that respect did not take the point,
in my opinion, beyond the conclusion
which I think unaided common sense would suggest, namely that the blow must
have been a deliberate,
and a substantially forceful, blow.
<P>

7	The case of the prisoner at trial was, essentially, one of self-defence. The
prisoner contended that, during the course of the
general brawling, the
deceased had come towards him clutching a pool cue, and behaving in such a
fashion that the prisoner apprehended
personal injury unless he defended
himself. The prisoner contended that the bar stool happened, by unfortunate
chance, to be the
nearest apparent defensive weapon, and that he had picked it
up and struck in quick succession three pre-emptive blows. 
<P>

8	The charge to the jury left in the hands of the jurors a document suggesting
a connected sequence of questions for their consideration.
The questions were:

<P>

	"Question 1:
<P>

	Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the victim, Robert Lance
Wirepo, died on or about 5 November 1996? If so, then:
<P>

	Question 2:
<P>

	Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of his death was a
penetrating head injury: If so, then:
<P>

	Question 3:
<P>

	Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the fatal injury was caused
by the act of the accused? If so, then:
<P>

	Question 4:
<P>

	Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, at the time he
inflicted the fatal injury, was not acing in self-defence?
<P>

	If you answer this question: no; then the Crown has not proved beyond
reasonable doubt that the killing was unlawful, whether as
murder or as
manslaughter; and the verdict should be, simply, not guilty.
<P>

	If you answer this question: yes, then the Crown has proved beyond reasonable
doubt that the killing was unlawful; and you must
then decide whether the
killing was a murder or a manslaughter. This depends upon the answer to a
further question:
<P>

	Question 5:
<P>

	Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, when, not
acting in self-defence, he inflicted the fatal injury,
had then the intent to
inflict upon the victim grievous bodily harm, that is to say, really serious
bodily injury?
<P>

	If you answer that question: yes; then the killing is a murder, and the
verdict should be guilty of murder.
<P>

	If you answer that question: no, then the killing is a manslaughter; and the
verdict should be not guilty of murder but guilty
of manslaughter."
<P>

9	The questions went to the jury after prior notice to, and with the consent
of, both Crown and defence counsel. There is no reason
to think that the jury
did not address the questions thus put to them. I consider that it is fairly to
be inferred from the jury's
verdict that the jury answered the first four
questions in the affirmative, and the fifth question in the negative. 
<P>

10	In my opinion, the evidence at trial supports amply an affirmative answer to
the fourth question. I do not believe that a reasonable
view of that evidence
could sustain a contention that the striking of such a blow as I have earlier
described bore such a reasonable
proportionality to any demonstrated behaviour
of the deceased as would be required by law in order to substantiate the case
of self-defence
that was put forward at trial. 
<P>

11	I am of the further opinion that an answer given in the negative to the
fifth question was, on the available evidence, very favourable
to the prisoner.
I do not imply in any way an opinion that the jury was not entitled on that
evidence so to answer that question.
I say no more than that my own view of the
evidence is that such an answer gives the prisoner the most liberal and
generous benefit
of the doubt. I accept, of course, that I must deal now with
the prisoner in a way that respects the verdict of the jury; and that
respects
also what I think is an irresistible inference as to way in which the jury
answered the fifth question left to them. 
<P>

12	As will appear presently, I am of the opinion that the prisoner's subjective
and personal circumstances are very strong. That
makes it important to keep
carefully in mind the following observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
<b>Regina v Dodd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A Crim R 349</a> at 354:
<P>

	"............. (M)aking due allowance for all relevant considerations, there
ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a
sentence and the
circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in
seeking to determine the sentence appropriate
to a particular crime to have
regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this
assessment  the other factors
requiring consideration in order to arrive at the
proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime,
............................, has its own objective gravity meriting at the
most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum
sentence fixed by
the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave
category. The relative importance of
the objective facts and subjective
features of a case will vary: ........................ . Even so, there is
sometimes a risk that
attention to persuasive subjective considerations may
cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case:
...................... ."
<P>

13	In my opinion, there is no gainsaying the objective severity of the
prisoner's offence. The simple proposition that human life
is sacred underpins
fundamentally the body of principles, of standards, and of values that defines
the conception of our society
as to what is meant by civilisation. In such a
context, any unlawful taking of a human life must be, axiomatically, a grave
offence
against social harmony and public order. This is, in my opinion, even
more emphatically the case when, as in the present matter,
an unlawful killing
results from a public affray in a place of lawful public resort such as
licensed hotel premises. 
<P>

14	As I have earlier said, I think that the prisoner's subjective and personal
characteristics, as now relevant, are very strong.
I summarise them as
follows:
<P>

1.	<i>Age</i>
<P>

The prisoner was born on 9 September 1974. He was aged, therefore , 22 years
and about 2 months at the date of the killing; and
he is now aged 24 years and
almost 8 months.
<P>

2.	<i>Criminal Antecedents</i>
<P>

The prisoner has one recorded matter on his record, namely a mid-range
drink-driving offence committed on New Year's Eve 1994. He
was fined $380 and
disqualified from driving for 12 months. At trial, it was agreed that this
offence should not deprive the prisoner
of the benefit of a good character
direction to the jury, and the jury was so directed. I take now the same
approach. 
<P>

3.<i>	General Personal Characteristics and Circumstances</i>
<P>

The prisoner presented at trial as a mild-mannered and quietly-spoken young
man. This accords with evidence given at trial by several
witnesses. Witnesses
who knew the prisoner as a patron of the particular hotel spoke of him as
having been at all times polite, quiet
in his general address, not a drinker to
excess, and no trouble to those in charge of the orderly conduct of the
business of the
hotel. His immediate past employer spoke of him in very
complimentary terms. I am satisfied that the prisoner's attack upon the
deceased
was strikingly out of character. I do not have any apprehension that
he will so offend again; or that he will in the future be a
violent threat to
public order. 
<P>

4.	<i>Contrition</i>
<P>

I accept the evidence of the prisoner that he is properly remorseful for the
death of the deceased. The prisoner gave all proper
cooperation to the
investigating police; but always upon the basis, to which he adhered clearly
and consistently from the time he
was first questioned, that he had acted only
in self-defence. The prisoner is not entitled to the particular leniency that
is conventionally
extended in response to a plea of guilty made because of
genuine contrition; but he is entitled not to be punished more severely
by
reason only of having exercised his undoubted right to put the Crown to proof
of its case of murder, the only charge actually
preferred in the indictment.

<P>

5.	<i>The Consequences of Imprisonment</i>
<P>

The prisoner appeared off bail for his trial. He went into custody on 17 March
last at the completion of the charge to the jury.
Any custodial sentence now
imposed will be the prisoner's first substantial experience of full-time
imprisonment. His particular
case would require some sensitive handling by the
correctional authorities for reasons known to those authorities and calling for
no further comment from me. 
<P>

15	In bringing the foregoing objective and subjective factors into a fair
balance, I have kept in mind the three following statements
of principle:
<P>

	-	".............. (T)hough not so serious a crime as murder, ...........
(manslaughter)...............is a serious crime the punishment
for which varies
with the circumstances of each case, but may be anything from imprisonment for
life to a merely nominal penalty.
There is no offence in which the permissible
degrees of punishment cover so wide a range, and none perhaps in permissible
degrees
of punishment cover so wide a range, and none perhaps in which the
exercise of so large a discretion is called for in determining
the appropriate
penalty." See per Street CJ speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>R v
Withers</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1925/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1925] NSWStRp 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281925%29%2025%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1925) 25 SR (NSW) 382</a> at 394-5.
<P>

It is to be noted that the maximum penalty for manslaughter is no longer
imprisonment for life, but is, rather, penal servitude
for 25 years.
<P>

	-	"............. (counsel) ..............surveyed the custodial sentences
imposed in a range of cumulative provocation manslaughter
cases over the last
decade. That kind of analysis can be helpful, but the circumstances involving
manslaughter being so various it
would be erroneous to place too much store on
any sentencing survey, let alone to look for a median or average outcome." See
<b>Reg v Morabito</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2062%20A%20Crim%20R%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 62 A Crim R 82</a> per Wood J at 86.
<P>

	-	"We should make it clear that we do not suggest that it could never be
proper to order that a sentence for the crime of manslaughter
be served by way
of periodic detention. There may well be cases of manslaughter where that is an
appropriate order. It enables the
offender to remain in employment and also
minimises disruption to family life. We do not disregard the fact that even
part-time custody
is a substantial punishment." <b>Reg v Dodd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A
Crim R 349</a> per curiam at 354.
<P>

16	Notwithstanding what was thus said in <b>Dodd</b>, I cannot think that in
the present case any sentence that did not require at least some period of
full-time custody would be appropriate;
and I think that it would do the
prisoner no worthwhile service for the Court to proceed otherwise.
<P>

17	Much more difficult is the framing of a sentence of full-time custody that
not only will give proper vindication to the rule
of law, but also will avoid,
so far as is possible for the Court to do, any risk of ruining the prisoner's
young life by exposing
him to lengthy contact with hardened criminals. 
<P>

18	I have not been able to find any reported or unreported decision that seems
to me to provide a really relevant and useful guide
in the present case; but
there are two decisions that give, I believe, some very broad indicative
assistance. 
<P>

19	The first of them is the matter of <b>Regina v Azar</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 56 A Crim R
414.</a> The facts of that matter are not completely on all fours with the facts of
the present matter; but there are some significant similarities.
Mr. Azar was
convicted of having stabbed another man during the course of a brawl involving
two groups of young persons. At his trial,
he asserted, among other things,
that he had acted in self-defence. The jury rejected that contention. Gleeson
CJ, speaking for the
Court of Criminal Appeal, summarised as follows the
findings that had been made by the primary Judge as to Mr. Azar's subjective
features:
<P>

	"His Honour made strong subjective findings in favour of the appellant, who
was a man of good character with no relevant criminal
history. It was accepted
that he was unlikely to offend again. He expressed contrition which his Honour
accepted as genuine. His
Honour described the appellant as `a decent man whose
past entitles him to receive the maximum discount in mitigation of sentence'.
"
<P>

20	The primary Judge sentenced Mr. Azar to penal servitude for 6 years
apportioned between a minimum term of 4-1/2 years and an
additional term of
1-1/2 years. That sentence took account of the fact that the appellant had
spent 6 months in pre-sentence custody.
The Court of Criminal Appeal held that
such sentence was within the range of an appropriate sentencing discretion.
<P>

21	It is important to note that, if there were significant similarities between
Mr. Azar's case and that  of the present prisoner,
there were also significant
dissimilarities. The most important of them was that Mr. Azar, having
participated in the brawl in question,
left the brawl while it was still in
progress, went to a nearby house from which he obtained the knife used by him
in the subsequent
killing of his victim; and returned deliberately and thus
armed, to the affray, which he re-joined, and during the course of which
thereafter he inflicted the fatal stab wounds upon his victim. There is no
comparable feature in the objective facts of the present
prisoner's case. That
seems to me to entail that the sentence imposed in the matter of <b>Azar</b> is
more than is justly required in the case of the present prisoner. I
re-emphasise that I have not treated the decision in <b>Azar</b> in any other
way than as a very broadly indicative precedent.
<P>

22	The second decision which I have found of some assistance is that of
<b>Regina v Barry Boris Sofokleous</b>; unreported; Court of Criminal Appeal;
13 December 1993.
<P>

23	Mr. Sofokleous, also, was found guilty of having stabbed another during the
course of a violent affray. In his case, he had participated
in the affray at a
time when he had upon his person, and secreted in one of his boots, the knife
with which he subsequently inflicted
fatal wounds upon his victim. The fact
that he had gone to the location in question thus armed, was considered both by
the primary
Judge and by the Court of Criminal Appeal as an aggravating
objective factor; and nothing comparable is to be found in the objective
facts
of the present prisoner's case. In addition, it was demonstrated that Mr.
Sofokleous had told the investigating police deliberate
lies as to his
involvement in the fatal affray; and this, also, is not parallelled by any
objective feature of the present prisoner's
case. 
<P>

24	In the case of Mr. Sofolkleous, the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a
sentence of penal servitude of 4 years divided between
a minimum term of 3
years and an additional term of 1 year. As with the case of <b>Azar</b>, so
with the case of <b>Sofokleous</b>: I have used it only as a very broadly
indicative precedent. 
<P>

25	I have come to the conclusion that a total sentence of penal servitude for 3
years should be imposed. I have no hesitation in
finding "special
circumstances" in the sense contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 5</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act
1989</a></b>, they being the matters earlier canvassed in connection with the
prisoner's relevant subjective circumstances. I think that it would
be just,
having regard to those "special circumstances", to apportion the aggregate
sentence equally between minimum and additional
terms.
<P>

26	Nicholas Raymond Grenenger, you are formally convicted of the crime of
manslaughter of which you were found guilty by the verdict
of the jury. You are
sentenced upon that conviction to penal servitude for 3 years, comprising a
minimum term of 18 months and an
additional term of 18 months. The minimum term
will commence on 17 March 1999 and will expire on 16 September 2000. The
additional
term will commence on 17 September 2000.
<P>

27	I order, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 24(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a></b>, that
you be released to parole at the expiration of the minimum term.
<P>

28	I make the following recommendations to the Commissioner of Corrective
Services, and direct the Registrar of the Court to bring
them to the
Commissioner's urgent attention:
<P>

1.	That the prisoner's classification be processed as a matter of urgency.
<P>

2.	That urgent consideration be given to the detention of the prisoner at the
Berrima Correctional Institution. It is noted that
Mr. R. Gow of the Department
of Corrective Services has been acquainted with the particular circumstances
that the Court accepts
as justifying this recommendation.
<P>

3.	That in the event that placement at Berrima is not available, urgent
consideration be given to the immediate admission of the
prisoner to the Young
Offenders Programme.
