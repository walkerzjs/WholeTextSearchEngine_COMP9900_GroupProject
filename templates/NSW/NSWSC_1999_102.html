<P>

<b>50304/94	<u>STRATA CONSOLIDATED (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD &amp; 2 ORS  v  EDWARD
JOHN BRADSHAW &amp; 13 ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	The costs orders made in order 2J of the supplementary judgment (order 2J),
probably 	dispose of the main or substantial costs
of these proceedings.
Although a "global" 	approach has been adopted in the making of final costs
orders, it may be helpful in 	considering
any challenge to the orders to
identify with more particularity the main, 	discrete areas of costs encompassed
in order 2J.
<P>

2	There is a further advantage in doing so, in that such an analysis should
give a strong 	indication as to the manner in which
any general costs of the
proceedings should be 	dealt with and also aid determination of the question
whether, in the assessment
of 	costs, the assessor should be left to make an
assessment of costs in those discrete 	areas, or whether this Court should
circumvent
that task and further disputation over 	costs by making a percentage
assessment of the parties' respective costs which is to be 
borne by one or the
other parties.
<P>

3	The case of Bradshaw is a useful starting point for it demonstrates the
strong contrast 	between the particular issues in which
he was successful and
the allegations which 	were successfully made against him.  
<P>

4	The liability of Bradshaw is examined in detail at pp 231 et seq of the
principal judgment.  	Pars 23 and 24 of the plaintiffs'
contentions as set out
in the summons (the contentions) 	specify the duties said to be owed by
Bradshaw to the plaintiffs as a fiduciary
or as a 	director.  Par 25 set out
the breaches relied upon.  So far as those breaches relied upon 	alleged
wrongful disclosure of
confidential information, the findings at pp 233 and 234
of the principal judgment, in substance, reject Strata's case, save in respect
of 		information referred to in pars 21 (g) and (h), relating respectively to
the 			Translight-Xelux agency and the Selectrons agency
(the agencies).
<P>

5	The findings in relation to the alleged breaches are set out at pp 238-247 of
the principal 	judgment.  In substance, apart from
Bradshaw's conduct in
relation to the agencies, the 	plaintiffs failed in their case against
Bradshaw.
<P>

6	Similarly, the allegations raised in pars 27 to 29 of the contentions,
relating to alleged 	misrepresentations to Strata's agents,
were examined at pp
247-251 of the principal 	judgment.  The plaintiffs failed to make out that
case against Bradshaw.  
<P>

7	The allegations in pars 35 to 51 and 57 of the contentions were examined in
the principal 	judgment at pp 251 to 253 and, in substance,
the customer
representation case against 	Bradshaw was rejected.  
<P>

8	Further, I think the findings in the principal judgment at pp 253 to 258
dispose of the 	case against Bradshaw, as pleaded in
pars 52 to 56 of the
contentions, relating to 	alleged misrepresentations to the plaintiffs. 
<P>

9	At p 258 of the principal judgment, the case against Bradshaw as alleged in
pars 104 and 	105 of the contentions was also rejected.
<P>

10	At pp 259 to 273 and 275 to 278 of the principal judgment, allegations
against various 	groups of defendants were considered.
 So far as those
allegations involved the 		conduct of Bradshaw, in substance, they were found
to have failed against him, save 
for his participation in the acquisition of
the agencies.
<P>

11	Similarly, the case of passing off, examined at pp 279 to 287 of the
principal judgment, 	failed as against Bradshaw.
<P>

12	It follows that under order 2J Bradshaw is entitled to the costs of all
issues raised 	against him save for those issues concerning
his involvement in
the acquisition of the 	agencies.  Although it is correctly stated that where a
breach of fiduciary duty is found
	to have occurred, liability for that breach
is not founded upon loss to the party to whom 	the duty is owed, it does not
follow
that the circumstances of breach are necessarily 	irrelevant to the
exercise of the court's discretion in determining the appropriate
order 	for
costs of issues relating to that breach.  In this case the acquisition of the
agencies 	took place in circumstances which
I have found occasioned no loss to
Strata and, on 	enquiry into any profits that may have been so derived by any
of the defendants,
it was 	found that no profit was derived by the fiduciary
(or for that matter by any of the 	defendants who participated in the
fiduciary's
breach) during the relevant period.
<P>

13	In my view, the appropriate result should be that each party bear their own
respective 	costs of the issues relating to those
breaches of duty by Bradshaw,
including the costs 	of the enquiry into profits.  In reaching that conclusion,
I am mindful of Bradshaw's
	claim for indemnity costs on the enquiry.  However,
bearing in mind Bradshaw's 		comparatively minor participation in those
proceedings,
I think the conclusion I have 	reached is unaffected by the basis
upon which costs of the enquiry proceedings should 	be assessed.
 I think it is
clear that Bradshaw has been substantially successful in the 	principal
proceedings and should have his general costs
of those proceedings.  The 	order
to which he is entitled is dealt with later in these reasons.
<P>

14	The position of Ney is similar to that of Bradshaw except for a significant
qualification, 	namely the adverse findings against
him for passing off and
under the related trade 	practice issues.
<P>

15	The issues raised against him, or which involved him, in pars 21 to 23, 25
to 34, 35(a), (c) 	to (h), 36, 37, 40 to 48, 50, 51,
56 to 58, 76 to 106, 109,
112 and 116 of the contentions, 	save for his involvement in the acquisition of
the agencies, in substance,
were resolved 	in his favour, as set out at pp 259
to 273 and 275 to 279 of the principal judgment.  I 	think the extensive nature
of those allegations is of significance in considering the 	costs of a hearing
that occupied some twenty weeks.
<P>

16	The passing off and related trade practice case against Ney is found in pars
35(b), 49 	and 59 to 74 of the contentions.  In
relation to that aspect of the
case, there stands an 	order (2G) in the supplementary judgment that Ney,
Procus Australia, Maguire
and 	Binney pay the plaintiffs' costs.  However, in
considering those costs, I think it is 	essential to keep in mind the limit of
the plaintiffs' success on those issues.  That may 	be gauged from the extent
of the allegations raised in par 35 of the contentions
upon 	which Strata
failed in all but one.  The findings in the principal judgment upon the
passing off suit at pp 279 to 287 need
to be read in conjunction with the
findings in 	relation to customer representations at pp 170 to 224
(particularly at pp 222 to
224).  	Those findings, in my view, demonstrate the
limited success of Strata in relation to the 	passing off and related issues
which should be reflected in the assessment of Strata's 	costs on those issues
under 2G.
<P>

17	In relation to the costs of the enquiry into profits, Ney has advanced a
ground upon 	which his costs of those proceedings should
be treated on an
indemnity basis:  an offer 	having been made to Strata on behalf of all
defendants to settle that aspect of the
case 	by a payment to Strata of $10,000
inclusive of costs.  That offer was made on 16 October 	1998.  As a discrete
area of costs,
Ney would be entitled to the costs of the enquiry into 	profits
and, probably, on an indemnity basis were it not for his manipulative
conduct
upon which enough has been stated in the course of these proceedings.  In many
ways 	I think Ney brought upon himself Strata's
scepticism of the reliability
of his accounts: 	no better example of that resting in the manner in which he
manipulated the Lansarc
	accounts.
<P>

18	I think any assessment of the enquiry costs should be on the usual basis and
not on an 	indemnity basis.
<P>

19	Although I regard the task as an invidious one, and one which, at best,
involves an 	approximation, I have come to the conclusion
that the approach of
McLelland J in <b>Ritz 	Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20AIPC%2090%2d567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) AIPC
90-567</a> is the appropriate one and one 	which calls for "a global approach",
with some qualifications, to the question of the 	costs of Ney,
Procus
Australia, Selmet, Sipro, Siska, Maguire and Binney.  
<P>

20	Before addressing the terms of such costs orders, I think it is necessary to
identify the 	salient costs considerations affecting
those defendants (the Ney
defendants).  
<P>

21	Maguire's case is in a similar category to that of Ney.  A substantial
independent case 	was raised against him as reviewed at
pp 273 to 275 of the
principal judgment.  That 	case failed.  He was successful on the enquiry into
profits and was not a principal
in the 	acquisition of the agencies:  although
caught up in the account of profits proceedings.  	He is liable to Strata, as
is Ney,
under order 2G of the supplementary judgment and is 	entitled to
significant costs under order 2J.  The issues to which order 2J
relates were
examined at pp 259 to 275, 277 and 278 of the principal judgment and reflect
substantial 	success of Maguire's defences.
 
<P>

22	Binney is in a similar position to that of Maguire: his liability to Strata
being confined to 	his involvement in the passing
off of Procus' business as
that of Strata and his liability 	to account for any profits derived through
Procus in the exploitation
of the agencies.  	While liable under order 2G, he
is also entitled to the benefit of order 2J as examined at 	pp 259 to 273 and
275 to 278 of the principal judgment.  He, like Maguire, enjoyed 	significant
success in resisting Strata's claims.  
<P>

23	The allegations against Siska are considered in the principal judgment at pp
259 to 272 	and 273 to 278.  The only liability
of Siska was its liability to
account for any profits 	derived through the agencies.  I think it is clear
that the discrete costs
incurred by Siska 	would not be significant, despite
the extent of the allegations made against it in the 	contentions.
<P>

24	The orders sought against Siska in pars 18 to 41 of Strata's claims for
relief in the 	summons (Strata's claims) (reproduced
at pp 312 and 313 of the
principal judgment) lack 	restraint.  The only evidence against Siska was as
the provider of funds, fixed
with 	knowledge of the breaches relied upon by
reason of the fact that it was controlled by 	Ney.
<P>

25	In considering its entitlement to costs under order 2J of the supplementary
judgment, 	regard should be had to the limited nature
of the liability
evidenced against Siska in 	contrast with the relief sought under pars 18 to 41
of Strata's claims.  
<P>

26	Selmet and Sipro were the vehicles for the acquisition and exploitation of
the agencies 	and were also fixed with knowledge of
the breaches of fiduciary
duties involved in 	those acquisitions.  Otherwise, the relief sought in pars
18 to 41 of Strata's claims
were 	not made out.
<P>

27	Among the corporate defendants, Procus Australia is in a different category.
It bears 	the burden of costs under order 2G in
addition to having the benefit
of cost order 2J.  	The assessment of costs under order 2G should have regard
to Strata's limited
success 	on the passing off issue as noted earlier in these
reasons.  In the case of order 2J the 	assessment of costs should have
regard
to the extent to which Strata's claims in pars 10 	to 17 in addition to the
relief sought in pars 18 to 41 failed.  
<P>

28	Any assessment of costs under the orders made in these proceedings will need
to have 	regard to the fact that the third to fourteenth
defendants enjoyed the
same 		representation and that the burden of the work performed in defending
these claims fell 	upon the shoulders
of Ney, to the point where it may be
difficult to discern in particular 	cases, such as that of Siska, any
appreciable general costs
or, for that matter, any 	significant costs of
individual issues.  There is no doubt that the major targets of Strata 	were
Bradshaw
and Ney and, to a lesser extent, Binney and Maguire.  It may be
extremely difficult to distinguish which `cost that' Ney was wearing
from time
to time 	beyond the fact that there were very few issues in which he was not
involved.
<P>

29	Although the above analyses would permit separate orders for costs in
respect of the 	Ney defendants, I think the correct approach
is to treat their
costs as one.  Such an 	approach reflects, in my view, the reality of their
representation as being in the one
	interest, the manner in which the case was
conducted against those defendants and is 	consistent with the approach adopted
against
them under order 2G.  
<P>

30	The conclusion I have reached is that the plaintiffs are to pay 40% of the
costs of the 	Ney defendants.  That order is to encompass
the respective
entitlements and liabilities 	of the parties under orders 2G and 2J.  I think
the order requiring the plaintiffs to
pay 	40% of those defendants' costs is
the correct approach having regard to the following: 
<P>

	(a)	The limited nature of the success of the plaintiffs on the passing off and
related trade practice issues.
<P>

	(b)	The significant level of success, in varying degrees, of those defendants
upon issues falling within order 2J.
<P>

	(c)	The manner in which those defendants conducted their defences, principally
under the umbrella of Ney's defence.  In the case
of the corporate defendants,
it may be difficult to identify discrete areas of costs peculiar to their
respective cases.
<P>

	(d)	An award of 40% of those defendants' costs avoids the extremely onerous
and imprecise, if not arbitrary, task of identifying
the costs of specific
issues.  
<P>

31	The percentage awarded is intended to reflect a nett result of the
plaintiffs having a 25% 	to 30% success rate and the defendants
having a 70% to
75% success with each being 	entitled to the costs of issues on which they were
successful.  As a simple example,
if 	the costs of the plaintiffs and of the
Ney defendants were, in each case, $600, on a 25/75 	basis, Strata would be
entitled to
be paid $150 by the Ney defendants and those 		defendants would be
entitled to be paid $450, giving them a nett benefit of $300,
or 50%.  	If the
ratio was 33/66, the nett benefit would be $200, or 33%.
<P>

32	In that simple illustration, I have treated the costs of Strata and of the
Ney defendants 	as being approximately the same. 
There may be some built in
distortion in such an 	assumption, given that Strata's costs of the proceedings
include costs of the case
	against Bradshaw and of defendants against whom the
plaintiffs have failed.  However, 	I think the percentage band I have chosen
is
reasonably reliable.
<P>

33	The defendants have carried out assessments of percentages of evidentiary
material 	attributable to particular issues.  Those
assessments, I think, are
quite useful in 		providing some tangible analysis of the costs of issues.  As
such they provide some 
guide.  Where they are found particularly wanting is in
failing to give sufficient weight 	to the customer representation issues
involving numerous witnesses.
<P>

34	In the result, I am comfortable with the fairness of a result which awards
the Ney 		defendants 40% of the total costs of those
defendants, on the basis
that the entitlement 	of the plaintiffs and of the Ney defendants under orders
2G and 2J are subsumed in
that 	costs order.
<P>

35	The order to be made in the case of Bradshaw, I think, raises little
difficulty in adopting 	a "global" approach.  As earlier
observed, he has been
substantially successful, save 	for his involvement in the acquisition or
exploitation of the agencies.  I
think the 		appropriate order is that the
plaintiffs are to pay 90% of the total costs of Bradshaw and 	of Tarkello.  I
have bracketed
Tarkello with Bradshaw as they were in the same interest 	and
for the reason that Tarkello is in much the same position as Siska
in the
assessment 	of costs.  The entitlement of the plaintiffs and of Bradshaw and
Tarkello under orders 	2G and 2J are to be subsumed
in this costs order.
<P>

36	The only remaining costs centre is the cost of the application to join
Lansarc.  Having 	regard to the findings in the enquiry
into profits, I think a
fair result will be achieved by 	making no special order as to costs.  They may
be treated as part of the
costs of the 	parties involved in the enquiry into
profits.  I do not see any need to make an order in 	respect of Lansarc's
costs.
<P>

37	The defendants have sought orders against J Biady in respect of the costs to
which 	they are entitled.  As indicated during the
course of the hearing, I
would not consider 	making such an order other than upon formal notice of
motion supported by the 		evidence
to be relied upon, notwithstanding the
several instances throughout the 	principal judgment in which I drew attention
to unsatisfactory
aspects of Strata's 	witness statements. 
<P>

38	The parties are agreed, I think, that there should be a stay in enforcement
of the orders 	made in these proceedings, save for
the assessment of costs,
until costs are assessed 	or agreed.  In any event, I think it is appropriate
to order that such a stay
be put in place 	in view of the disclosed financial
position of the defendants and of Strata.  For the same 	reason, the security
for costs provided by Strata is to remain in place pending such 	assessment or
agreement.
