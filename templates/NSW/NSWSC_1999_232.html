<b>1120/99 - ALFRED LESLIE HOWARD &amp; ORS  V  LESLIE MECHTLER &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 16 March 1999 and revised on 24 March
1999)</b>
<P>

	<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	Regrettably the affairs of the St George Budapest Soccer Club Limited are in
a sorry state.  When an organisation such as this
is riven by factional
disputes, principles of corporate governance cannot cure the underlying
problem.  The best one can hope to
do is to apply the requirements of the law
with respect to the management of the organisation in a fashion which ensures
that legal
rights are vindicated.
<P>

2	The legal issues raised in the case concern a meeting convened by members of
the Club and held on 30 December 1998, after the
directors had not convened a
meeting in response to a requisition by members.  The meeting purported to pass
various resolutions,
including a resolution to remove the plaintiffs from their
positions as directors and a resolution to elect some of the defendants
as
directors.
<P>

3	The plaintiffs claim relief to establish that the meeting was not validly
convened; that the first plaintiff (the company secretary
as well as a
director) had no obligation to convene the meeting; that the resolutions
purportedly passed at the meeting are void;
 and that the first to seventh
defendants have not been validly elected as directors of the Club.  They also
seek an injunction restraining
the first to seventh defendants from
representing they are entitled to act as directors.  By their cross-claim the
defendants seek
a declaration that the meeting was not invalid.
<P>

	<b>The parties</b>
<P>

4	The plaintiffs are seven of the eight directors who were the subject of the
dismissal motion, and the defendants are the seven
members who were purportedly
elected, plus another member who served the requisition for the meeting but was
not a candidate for
election.  
<P>

5	The thrust of the relief sought is to enforce the company's constitution, yet
the company itself is not a party to the proceedings.
 Although the point was
not contested, it is probable that the plaintiffs have standing in their
capacity as members to enforce compliance
with the company's constitution
against other members:  see especially <i>Kraus v  G J Lloyd Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1965/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] VicRp 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20VR%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965]
VR 232.</a>  The matter raised in the proceedings is in a sense a matter of
internal management, but it is also a matter which affects the proper
constitution of an organ of the company.  If the constitution has not been
complied with in the manner alleged, the defect cannot
be cured by ordinary
resolution of the members in general meeting:  see <i>Ford's</i> <i>Principles
of Corporations Law</i> (Looseleaf) pages 1118-7.  Further, to the extent that
the plaintiffs invoke statutory provisions such as s 225 and ss 249Q and 249R,
they may have standing under s 1324.  I therefore proceed on the basis that it
is not necessary to join the company in the proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The Club and its business</b>
<P>

6	The Club was incorporated in 1966 as a non-profit company limited by
guarantee.  Its constitution limits the number of full members
to 300 and the
evidence suggests that the actual number of members is about 140.  As a company
limited by guarantee, the Club is
a public company:  see definition of `public
company' in s 9 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

7	Prior to April 1997 the Club's principal business was conducted at licensed
premises which it owned at 84 Victoria Avenue, Mortdale.
 Additionally, the
Club has teams in National and State as well as junior soccer competitions and
had a long-term licence of stadium
facilities at 88 Bestic Street, Rockdale.

<P>

8	The Club experienced poor trading results over a period of time and so on 21
April 1998 the directors appointed Mr M C Donnelly
as administrator.  The
administrator ceased trading at the licensed premises in Mortdale and set about
exploring the sale of the
freehold of the site for residential flat
development.  On the administrator's recommendation, creditors approved a deed
of company
arrangement which was entered into on 16 May 1997, in order to
achieve an ordinary realisation of assets and the development for
sale of the
Mortdale site.   As is typical in such deeds, the deed of company arrangement
provided that unless the administrator
otherwise decides, the directors have
full control of the company's property, business and affairs subject to the
terms of the deed.
<P>

9	The administrator's attempts to secure development approval for the Mortdale
site proved to be unsuccessful.  Consequently, he
convened a meeting of
creditors held on 1 September 1997, at which the creditors passed a resolution
approving an amendment to the
deed of company arrangement to permit him to
negotiate and give effect to a sale of the Mortdale premises by private treaty
without
development approval.  He then continued his negotiations for the sale
of the property.  The evidence indicates that a contract for
the sale of the
property has been entered into, though there is no evidence as to the identity
of the purchaser, nor as to all terms
of the sale.	
<P>

	<b>The emerging dispute</b>
<P>

10	One infers from the evidence as a whole that during the period of
administration of the company under the deed, tensions have
grown substantially
between at least two factions of the Club.  One group, represented by the
plaintiffs, is concerned to ensure
an effective sale of the Mortdale premises
and to develop the Club's sporting activities in close association with a body
called
St George Soccer Association Inc, with whom some of the plaintiffs are
connected.
<P>

11	Another faction, represented, it seems, by the defendants, opposes the
closeness of the connection between the Club and the Association
and is
concerned to ensure that the Mortdale site is sold for the best price,
preferably after securing development consent.  Beyond
disputes about those
specific issues, there seems to be a difference between the factions which has
to do with the desire of at least
Mr Mechtler, one of the defendants, and
presumably his colleagues, to maintain the link between the current Club and
the football
team's origins and its connection with Budapest and the Hungarian
culture.
<P>

12	Whatever be the true nature of the dispute between the parties and their
respective factions, it is clear that an argument emerged
during the course of
1998 which has led to these proceedings.  There were essentially three
important developments during that year
so far as the present proceedings are
concerned:  namely, the amendment of the Club's constitution on 1 October 1998,
the general
meeting of 12 November 1998, and the further meeting of 30 December
1998.
<P>

	<b>The amendment to the constitution</b>
<P>

13	Article 15(2) had previously provided for the composition of the Board of
Directors in the following terms.  The members were
to elect a Board of
Directors of eleven at each annual general meeting.  Three-elevenths of the
number to be elected were required
to have the special qualification of being
members nominated by the Management Committee of the St George Soccer
Association; three-elevenths
were to have the special qualification of being
debenture holders; three-elevenths were to have the special qualification of
being
members nominated by the St George Budapest Sports Club;  and the
remaining two-elevenths were to be elected from the members of
the Club
generally.
<P>

14	The amendment to Article 15(2) adopted on 1 October 1998 replaced that
provision with the following words:
<P>

	`The members shall elect seven persons to the office of the director from the
members nominated'.
<P>

15	The amendment is presumably intended to have the effect that in due course
the size of the Board is to be reduced to seven and
all directors will be
elected by the members without any special qualifications or special nomination
procedures applicable to any
sub-group of directors.  However, the amendment
does not contain any transitional provision or otherwise deal with the position
of
the existing directors.  That being so, it would appear that the directors
in office at the time of the adoption of the amendment
remain in office and are
entitled to remain in office until the elections at the next Annual General
Meeting.  There is no dispute
as to the validity of the amendment in the
present proceedings but it provides important background for the dispute which
has emerged
in this case.
<P>

	<b>The meeting of 12 November 1998</b>
<P>

16	The second development arose out of a requisition for a meeting of members
which was delivered to the secretary of the Club on
20 October 1998.  The
requisition purported to require the directors to convene a meeting of the
members to consider the following
special resolutions:
<P>

	(1)  resolution that pursuant to Article 18(b) the members remove from office
directors including the plaintiffs and others;
<P>

	(2)  resolution appointing a number of directors, including some of the
defendants, to act as directors in place of those removed.
<P>

17	The requisition was signed by the eighth defendant.  Two Articles of the
Club's constitution are relevant to this requisition,
and to the subsequent
requisition to which I shall refer.  They are Articles 18(b) and 26.  They are
in the following terms:
<P>

	`18(b) The Club may by special resolution carried at an extraordinary general
meeting remove any Director or all the Directors
before the expiration of his
or their period of office and appoint another or other Director or Directors as
the case may be in his
or their place.  The person or persons so appointed
shall hold office during such time only as the Director or Directors removed
would have held office if he or they had not been so removed.
<P>

	26. An extraordinary general meeting may be called on any date by the
President or the Board and shall be called by the secretary
upon receipt by him
of a requisition which need not be in one document signed by not less than
one-tenth of the total number of members
entitled to vote, stating the business
to be considered.  The date of such meeting shall be within forty days of
receipt of such
requisition.  Provided that such meeting is not called within
fourteen (14) days of receipt of the requisition, the requisitionists
or a
majority of them may themselves call the meeting and for that purpose shall
have access to the Register of members and any other
records necessary for the
purpose of calling a meeting of members.'
<P>

18	It will be noted that Article 18(b) requires a special resolution for the
removal of directors.  This is in contrast with s 227
of the Corporations Law,
which also applies to a public company such as the Club.  Section 227 gives
members the right to remove
directors by ordinary resolution on special notice
and gives the directors the right to make representations which are distributed
to the members.  Case law indicates that where, as here, the constitution of
the company sets up a procedure for removal of directors
which is different
from s 227, those who convene the meeting at which removal resolutions are to
be put, have, in effect, the right
of election whether to proceed under the
company's constitution or under s 227:  see <i>Shanahan v  Pivot Pty Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2026%20ACSR%20740" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 26 ACSR 740</a> at 748; <i>Link Agricultural Pty Ltd v  Shanahan</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] VSCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
28 ACSR 498</a> at 516-7.  Both the October requisition and the subsequent
requisition in November 1998 signify an election to proceed under the
constitution of the company rather than under s 227, which is therefore not
relevant.
<P>

19	Pursuant to Article 26, the directors responded to the requisition by
convening the meeting which was held on 12 November 1998.
 Seventy-five members
were present.  The special resolutions to remove and elect directors were put
consecutively.  The first resolution
was defeated, sixty-two per cent of those
voting favouring removal.  The second resolution was then defeated, sixty-one
per cent
of those voting favouring removal.  Of course, the passage of a
special resolution requires approval of seventy-five per cent of
the members
present and voting.
<P>

	<b>The meeting of 30 December 1998</b>
<P>

20	The third important event, and the one most relevant to these proceedings,
is a meeting which flowed from a requisition served
by the eighth defendant on
the first plaintiff, Mr Howard, on 24 November 1998.  There appears to be a
dispute as to the validity
of the service of the requisition, since it was not
served at the registered office of the company.  The registered office of the
company remained the Mortdale address but it appears from the evidence that
those premises had been closed up and were not occupied.
 It is clear, however,
that the requisition was brought to the attention of the Board of Directors of
the plaintiff through its personal
service on Mr Howard.  It seems to me that
if it were necessary to cure any deficiency in service, it would be entirely
appropriate
to do so by the exercise of the Court's discretion conferred by s
1322.  In my opinion, the circumstances of service of the requisition
were
adequate to constitute proper service under the Corporations Law and under the
constitution of the company, particularly Article
52.
<P>

21	This time the directors did not convene a meeting within the period of
fourteen days allowed by Article 26.  In those circumstances
the effect of
Article 26 was to permit the requisitioning members, or a majority of them, to
call the meeting themselves provided
that the meeting was convened within the
period of forty days from receipt of the requisition.  I note that Article 26
establishes
a regime for requisitioning meetings which exists in parallel to
the provisions of the Corporations Law, ss 249D and 249E.  In fact,
the
provisions of Article 26 are more stringent in the sense of providing for the
convening of the meeting by the directors within
fourteen days rather than (as
in the case of the Corporations Law) twenty-one days, and by requiring that the
meeting be held in
any event within forty days rather than (as in the case of
the Corporations Law) three months.  Another difference is that Article
26
casts the obligation to convene the meeting on the secretary, whereas s 249D
casts the obligation on the directors as a whole.
<P>

22	The requisitionists proceeded to convene a meeting by posting to members a
notice signed by the eighth defendant inviting members
to attend an
extraordinary general meeting of the Club to be held on 30 December 1998 at
6pm.  The directors adopted the course of
approving a circular signed by Mr
Howard and sent to the members on 22 December 1998.  In that circular they
claimed that according
to their legal advice the notice convening the meeting
for 30 December 1998 was invalid and void.  They asserted that in view of
the
defeat of resolutions for the dismissal of the directors at the November
meeting it would, in their opinion, be an abuse of 
proper procedure for a
further meeting to be held so soon on the same topic.  Nevertheless, the
meeting was held, and about 53 members
attended.  It appears from the evidence
that the directors under challenge did not attend.
<P>

23	There is a lengthy minute of the meeting, indicating what transpired at the
meeting on that day.  Clearly, special resolutions
were put for the dismissal
of directors and for the appointment of directors, and equally clearly those
resolutions were carried
by those present at the meeting.  However, it appears
to me that the conduct of the meeting left a great deal to be desired.
<P>

24	First, I note that the notice convening the meeting indicated that a number
of resolutions were to be put to the meeting as ordinary
resolutions, in
addition to the special resolutions for dismissal and appointment of directors.
The resolutions proposed as ordinary
resolutions were scarcely coherent.  They
involved a series of assertions concerning oppressive and unjust conduct and
conflicts
of interest on the part of certain specified directors, apparently
arising principally out of the connection of some directors with
St George
Soccer Association Inc.  In each case the resolution purports to call upon the
administrator to use his power under the
Corporations Law to enforce the
resolution.  There is a resolution declaring that the directors, having lost
the confidence of the
majority of the members of the company, be restrained
from voting in respect of the special resolutions to be presented to the
meeting
and inviting the administrator to use his power under the Corporations
Law to achieve this objective.  There is also a resolution
for the Board to
refrain from any negotiations that involve any of the assets of the Club and in
particular, the stadium and the
Club's teams.
<P>

25	Some of these resolutions are proposed in simple disregard of the basic
principle of corporate law that where, as here, the management
of the affairs
of a company is vested exclusively in the Board of Directors of the company
(see Article 21), the members in general
meeting cannot intervene to override
decisions of the directors:  <i>NRMA Ltd v Parker </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20ACLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 ACLR 1.</a>  The
resolutions reflect additional, and in some ways more serious, confusion about
corporate law.  They indicate a view which, according
to the minutes, was also
asserted by the chairman of the meeting on 30 December 1998, Mr Mechtler, to
the effect that an administrator
under a deed of company arrangement has the
power to enforce resolutions with respect to such matters as conflicts of
interests by
directors, alleged oppressive conduct by them and constraints upon
their exercise of their rights as members to vote at a general
meeting of
members.
<P>

26	According to the minutes, Mr Mechtler read out s 442A of the Corporations
Law, as if it had application to the circumstances
before him, in order to show
that the administrator had the power to do what the resolutions invited him to
do, and thereby to show
that the directors had been misleading in asserting the
contrary.  Section 442 only applies to an administrator of a company under
administration.  It is plain from s 435C that the administration of a company
ends when a deed of company arrangement is executed.
 I mention this not
through any pedantic insistence on the correct application of the Corporations
Law, but because it signifies
that the members at the meeting on 30 December
1998 are likely to have been misled on a matter of some significance, namely
whether
the directors may have deliberately misled them.
<P>

27	There are other problems with the conduct of the meeting on 30 December, if
the minutes are an accurate record of what occurred.
 For example, Mr Mechtler
appears to have presented an incorrect view to the members as to the effect of
the amendments of 1 October
1998.  As earlier noted, those amendments did not
contain any transitional provision, a matter which itself signifies an immature
approach to matters of corporate governance.  In those circumstances, the
passage of the resolution to amend Article 15(2) did not
affect the holding of
office by the then existing directors, contrary to Mr Mechtler's representation
to the meeting.
<P>

28	Another matter relates to an apparent attempt at the meeting to cure short
notice of the meeting by passing a resolution purportedly
under s 247(3)(b) of
the Corporations Law.  That section was superseded on 1 July 1998 by s 249H(2).
More importantly, the section
is applicable only when there is a vote by
members with at least ninety-five per cent of the votes that <b>may be cast</b>
at a meeting.  The question is not whether ninety-five per cent of the votes of
members who happened to be present at the meeting
have been secured.
<P>

	<b>The grounds for challenging the meeting of 30 December 1998</b>
<P>

29	In these circumstances, the plaintiffs challenge the validity of what
occurred on 30 December 1998 on three specific bases, namely:
<P>

	(1)  inadequacy of notice of the meeting;
<P>

	(2)  impropriety of purpose of the requisitionists;
<P>

	(3)  convening the meeting at an inappropriate time and place.
<P>

30	I shall deal with each of these in turn.  However, when I perused the
affidavit evidence in chambers after the hearing, I noticed
that the resolution
for the appointment of new directors which was passed on 30 December 1998, is
cast in the form of a single resolution
purporting to elect multiple directors.
My Associate therefore sent a note to counsel for the parties inviting them to
make any submissions
they may wish to make as to the possible application of s
225 of the Corporations Law.  I received submissions from both parties
and I
propose to deal with that matter as well as the grounds of challenge stated
above.
<P>

	<b>Inadequacy of notice</b>
<P>

31	Article 27(c)(ii) stipulates a requirement of twenty-one clear days' notice
for an extraordinary general meeting convened for
the passing of a special
resolution.  Article 52 deals with the time of service of a notice which is
served by post.  In the case
of a notice convening a meeting, Article 52 has
the result that service is effected the day after posting.  Therefore, a notice
posted
on 9 December 1998 in respect of a meeting convened for 30 December 1998
fails to comply with the requirements of the constitution
because it provides
only nineteen clear days' notice, two days short of the requirement of the
Articles.  Section 249H(1) of the
Corporations Law requires at least twenty-one
days' notice of a meeting of members but allows the constitution to specify a
longer
minimum time (for example, as here, twenty-one clear days).
<P>

32	As I have mentioned, the attempt to cure the deficiency of notice by passing
a resolution purportedly under s 259H(3) clearly
failed.  It follows that the
meeting was not validly convened because of the absence of notice.  It may be
saved by the curative
effect of s 1322.  Section 1322(2) states that a
proceeding under the Law (an extraordinary general meeting of members is
clearly
such a proceeding) is not invalidated because of any procedural
irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the irregularity
has
caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot be remedied by any order
of the Court and by order declares the proceeding
to be invalid.  By s
1322(1)(b)(ii) the reference to a procedural irregularity includes a reference
to a deficiency of notice.  Therefore
s 1322(2) applies to produce automatic
validation of the meeting notwithstanding the lack of adequate notice, unless
the Court intervenes
by order.
<P>

33	The general approach of the Courts to matters of this kind is to seek to use
s 1322 in a beneficial manner where it is clear
that the defect is in the
nature of a technical one and no injustice has occurred.  In <i>Australian
Hydrocarbons Ltd v Green</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2010%20ACLC%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 10 ACLC 72</a> at 79 Hodgson J expressed the
opinion that the onus of proving substantial injustice rests on those alleging
it.  One infers from
his judgment that he regarded the onus as a substantial
one.  Similarly in <i>Re Tantalex Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%208%20NSWLR%208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 8 NSWLR 8</a> the Court was
clearly willing to use s 1322 to cure a lack of 21 days' notice of a special
resolution, notwithstanding the specific
requirement of the Corporations Law
that 21 days' notice be provided.  The criteria which need to be established in
order for the
Court to intervene under s 1322(2) were explored in <i>Sipad
Holdings Pty Ltd v Popovic</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2061%20FCR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 61 FCR 204.</a>  
<P>

34	I have considered these cases carefully.  Nevertheless, I have come to the
view that in all the circumstances of the present
case it is appropriate to
intervene by making an order under s 1322(2) declaring the proceeding to be
invalid because of the deficiency
of notice.  In reaching this conclusion I
have taken the following matters particularly into account.  First, the
resolutions which
were put to the members on 30 December 1998 were very
important.  Section 249H(3)(a) and (b) do not directly apply in the present
circumstances because, as I have indicated, the requisitioning members are able
to choose to proceed to remove directors under the
corporate constitution
rather than under s 227.  Nevertheless, those provisions indicate the
importance which the Legislature has
attached to a proposal for the removal of
directors.  This implies a need to ensure that the requirements as to notice
are strictly
adhered to when a resolution of such importance is to be put to
the members.  
<P>

35	Secondly, one of the specific resolutions to be put to the meeting on 30
December 1998 was the election of an over-age director.
 Section 249H(3)(c) is
directly applicable.  It states that at least twenty-one days' notice <b>must
be given</b> of a meeting of members of a public company at which a resolution
will be moved to appoint or re-appoint a director under s 228(7)
or (8).  While
there may be a residuum of discretion under s 1322 to overcome the requirements
of s 249H(3)(c) in an appropriate
case, it seems to me that the present
circumstances are not sufficiently compelling to act in a manner which would be
specifically
contrary to the wording of that provision.
<P>

36	Finally, in deciding to make an order under s 1322(2) I am influenced by the
risk of confusion which may arise if such an order
is not made.  For reasons I
am about to give, the appointment of the new directors was in this case invalid
under s 225 in circumstances
where, in my view, it would be inappropriate to
cure the invalidity under s 1322.  It would be most undesirable to leave the
Club
in a position where the removal of the existing directors is effective and
the appointment of the new directors is not.  It is better,
in my opinion, to
make orders having the effect that the entire proceedings are invalidated than
to produce that complicated halfway
house.
<P>

	<b>Improper Purpose</b>
<P>

37	I propose to deal with questions of impropriety of purpose of the
requisitionists and inappropriate time and place very briefly.
 Section 249Q of
the Corporations Law, which was introduced on 1 July 1998, states that a
meeting of a company's members must be
held for a proper purpose.  The
Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill is unhelpful in indicating the
Legislature's intention in enacting
this provision.  However, in my view, the
provision does not introduce any new substantive law, though it may have an
effect as far
as standing and procedure are concerned.  In <i>Australian
Innovation Ltd v  Petrovski</i> (1996) 14 ACLC 1257, Whitlam J was able to
extract a similar principle from the general law with respect to discretions
and powers,
without needing to rely on any particular statutory text.  I
respectfully agree with his reasoning.
<P>

38	In the present case it is true that the meeting of 30 December 1998 followed
shortly after a meeting on substantially the same
subject matter.  In some
circumstances this sequence could itself be sufficient to establish an
intention to harass and consequently
impropriety of purpose.  In the present
case, however, the evidence indicates a real and growing concern on the part of
the defendants
about transactions which were in the course of negotiation with
the St George Soccer Association Inc, and about the negotiations
which were
proceeding for the sale of the Mortdale premises, and also a concern that if
the present Board were not removed before
the beginning of 1999, they would be
able to engage in a form of membership stacking through the appointment of new
members after
the beginning of the year.  In view of that evidence, I am not
persuaded that the requisitionists were motivated by an improper purpose
in
convening the meeting.
<P>

	<b>Time and place of the meeting</b>
<P>

39	Section 249R, which was also introduced on 1 July 1998, says that a meeting
of a company's members must be held at a reasonable
time and place.  Again, the
Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill, which introduces that provision, is
unhelpful.  However, once again
my opinion is that the section does not create
any new substantive law.  In <i>Smith v Sadler</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 ACSR 672</a>,
Young J was able to find a similar constraint in the general law, particularly
the law with respect to fraud on the power to convene
a meeting.  He held that
a meeting convened at premises to which the plaintiff would be denied access
was not convened at an appropriate
place.  
<P>

40	In the present case there is evidence that the time and place of the meeting
were inconvenient, at least to some of the plaintiffs
who were unable to
attend.  However, there is also evidence which implies that the plaintiffs as a
group had decided to boycott the
30 December meeting.  Therefore I am not
persuaded that they would have been there even if it had been held at a time
when they were
free to attend.  Moreover, the time limits established by
Article 26 require that the requisitionists must act swiftly after the
failure
of the secretary to convene the meeting within fourteen days of the
requisition.  Effectively it would have been necessary
to hold the
requisitioned meeting in early January, if not late December, at a time which
presumably would have been equally inconvenient,
in order to fit within the
forty-day period permitted by Article 26.
<P>

41	Finally, I am not persuaded that the time and the place of 6pm on 30
December 1998 was inherently an unreasonable time.  It may
be that some people
would be on vacation at that time, but as far as I am aware many people
continue to work between Christmas and
New Year's Day, other than upon public
holidays or during the vacations which they choose to take.  Therefore I am not
persuaded
by the submission that s 249R be invoked to strike down the
meeting.
<P>

	<b>Election of directors by single resolution</b>
<P>

42	This leaves me finally with s 225 of the Corporations Law.  Section 225(1)
has the effect that a motion for the appointment of
two or more persons as
directors of a public company by a single resolution is not to be moved unless
a resolution that it be moved
has first been agreed to by the meeting without
any vote being cast against it.  It is common ground that no such resolution
was
passed in the present case.  It is also common ground that the resolution
for the appointment of the new directors was put as a single
motion naming all
seven candidates.  Prima facie such a resolution conflicts with s 225(1).  
<P>

43	That provision exists for an important policy purpose.  According to
<i>Ford's Principles of Corporations Law</i> (Looseleaf) at para 7.170, the
provision has:
<P>

	`the purpose of saving members the embarrassment of having to elect X whom
they may not want when they elect Y whom they do want.'
<P>

44	Therefore disregard of that provision is likely to produce substantial
injustice.  Reflecting the importance of the requirement
in s 225(1), s 225(2)
provides that a resolution passed pursuant to a motion moved in contravention
of the section is void.  These
considerations suggest that failure to comply
with s 225 leads to an ineffective resolution, and that the Court would be
unlikely
to overcome that consequence under s 1322, assuming it has the power
to do so.
<P>

45	Nevertheless, the defendants assert that the consequences of the application
of s 225 can be avoided in either of two ways. 
First, the defendants draw
attention to s 225(6), according to which nothing in the section prevents the
election of two or more
directors by ballot or poll.  In the present case the
motion to elect the seven new directors proceeded by `ballot'.  The ballot
paper is in evidence.  It shows that the motion was that the listed persons be
appointed to act as directors in place of those removed.
 Adjacent to that
motion there were two boxes, one labelled `for it' and the other labelled
`against it'.  Instructions on the ballot
paper said:
<P>

	`The voter shall mark his/her voting paper by ticking for it or against
it.'
<P>

46	In my opinion, though for some purposes this voting paper may be described
as a `ballot' or `poll', it does not qualify as a
ballot or poll for the
purpose of s 225(6).  That subsection envisages a voting procedure in which
members are given the opportunity
by completing the voting paper to select some
candidates but not others.  A voting paper which presents candidates as a block
and
requires the voter to choose for or against the block without the
opportunity to make any further selection is contrary to the fundamental
policy
of s 225 and therefore, in my opinion, does not qualify for exemption under s
225(6).
<P>

47	Secondly, the defendants urge that the Court should apply s 1322(4) to
overcome failure to comply with s 225.  They refer to
a number of cases
disclosing the general approach to s 1322(4) which (consistently with what I
have said earlier) show that the Court
should give a beneficial construction to
s 1322 in view of its evident curative purpose.  A good indication of the
approach of the
Court to the section and its predecessors can be seen in
<i>Abalcheck Pty Limited v  Pullen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ACLC%201078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ACLC 1078</a> and <i>Sydney Aussie
Rules Social Club Ltd v  Superintendent of Licences</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%207%20ACLC%20991" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 7 ACLC 991.</a>
<P>

48	Those cases confirm that s 1322(4) may be used to cure irregularities which
would otherwise have the consequence that a proceeding
such as a meeting would
be completely and utterly void.  Even so, one must bear in mind that s 225
contains an express indication
of legislative intention that the resolution is
to be void if the section is not complied with.  That was enough to persuade
Brinsden
J in <i>Harman v Energy Research Group Australia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%209%20ACLR%20897" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 9 ACLR
897</a> to decline to cure a breach of the predecessor of s 225 by invoking the
predecessor of s 1322.
<P>

49	While there may be occasions when a breach of s 225 can be overcome by
orders under s 1322, I fail to see any good reason for
exercising such a
discretion in the present case.  I particularly take into account that failure
to comply with s 225 is combined
in this case with short notice of the meeting;
that there has been a sequence of events in which the meeting of 30 December
followed
an unsuccessful meeting on 12 November in which the same vice appeared
in the motion to appoint directors;  and that although the
meeting has not been
invalidated solely because of the inconvenience of the time and place, the fact
that the meeting was held on
30 December does not inspire confidence that it
was a truly representative meeting of members.  Finally, I take into account
the
general sloppiness and amateurish approach to the requisitioning and
conduct of the meeting of 30 December and the potentially misleading
remarks
made by the chairman at the meeting.
<P>

	<b>Conclusions and orders</b>
<P>

50	In all of these circumstances I believe that I should make orders having the
effect that the notice of the meeting of 30 December
1998 was inadequate and
consequently that under s 1322(2) the meeting is invalid.
<P>

51	The plaintiffs have sought other relief which I am less inclined to give.
In particular, it seems to me unnecessary and possibly
undesirable to make the
order sought in para 2 of the summons, having regard to the fact that the first
plaintiff would have been
under a clear obligation to convene a meeting at the
time of receiving the requisition had the proposed motions been in proper form.
For the reasons indicated I do not propose to make the orders sought in paras 3
and 4 of the summons.
<P>

52	It therefore seems to me that the appropriate orders are in terms of paras
1, 5, 6 and 7 of the summons and that the defendants'
cross-claim be dismissed
in whole.  
<P>

53	My orders therefore are:
<P>

1. 	A declaration that the Notice of Meeting given by the defendants to the
members of St George Budapest Soccer Club Limited (`the
Company') and dated 9
December 1998 purporting to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of the
Company on 30 December 1998 was
ineffective for that purpose and is void and of
no effect.
<P>

2. 	A declaration that the resolutions purportedly passed at the purported
Extraordinary General Meeting of the members of the Company
on 30 December 1998
are void and of no effect.
<P>

3. 	A declaration that the first to seventh named defendants were not  and are
not validly elected directors officers of the company.
<P>

4. 	An order that the first to seventh named defendants and each of them be
restrained from representing themselves as being or
entitled to act as
directors or officers of the company.
<P>
