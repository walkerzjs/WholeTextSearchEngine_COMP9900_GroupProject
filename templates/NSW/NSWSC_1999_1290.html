<P>


<P>

<b>TIGER INVESTMENT COMPANY LIMITED (ACN 062 759 077)</b>
<P>

Plaintiff
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>23 December 1999</b>
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

1   	The Plaintiff, Tiger Investment Company Limited ("T"), is a
publicly listed company registered under the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  T's
business largely involves investing in Asian assets.
<P>

2   	Under the current corporate structure of T, 50.321% of T is
owned by Metals Exploration Limited ("M") and its subsidiary, "MI",
and the
remaining 49.689% is owned by the public.
<P>

3   	The proposal, in substance, involves the public
shareholders of T having their shares in T cancelled and being issued by M
with
shares in M on a 5 for 6 basis.  Those M shares do not at any time vest in T
for onward transfer to the T shareholders but come
from M direct.  Thus the
"consideration" for the reduction  -- the M shares --  emanates from M not T.
M, for its part, will (with
MI) "inherit the earth" by becoming at the
conclusion of these steps the sole shareholder in T, so that it receives value
for the
issue of its shares.  The proposal is to be achieved by the combination
of a fully interdependent selective reduction of capital
and a scheme of
arrangement to be put to the members of T at a series of court ordered meetings
causing the T shareholders to take
up the M shares without further consent than
the scheme meetings.
<P>

4   	The shares of all T shareholders other than those of M and
MI will also be cancelled pursuant to a reduction of capital under
s256B. 
<P>

5   	The following meetings will be convened for the purpose of
approving this capital reduction:
<P>

(a)	a meeting of members of T to consider two special resolutions to
selectively reduce T's share capital;  and
<P>

(b)	a meeting of T's members (excluding M and MI) to pass a special resolution
to selectively reduce T's share capital by cancelling
shares held by the Scheme
Shareholders.
<P>

6   	In addition there will be the three scheme of arrangement
meetings with and without M and MI (see 43 below)
<P>

7   	After the proposed scheme of arrangement and reduction of
capital, M and MI will own 100% of the shares in T.
<P>

<b>Issues</b>
<P>

8   	The legal issue which arises in the present case is the
operation of s256C(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> in relation to such a
capital reduction made in association with a scheme of arrangement. 
<P>

9   	In this case, unlike in <i>Re Etrade Australia Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/254.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] NSWSC 254</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2030%20ACSR%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 30 ACSR 516</a>, where I held that the reduction of capital was an equal
reduction, it is conceded by the Plaintiff that the reduction of capital
is
selective.  The present case is also distinguishable from <i>Etrade</i> in that
the consideration to shareholders whose shares are proposed to be reduced does
not move from the company to which the capital
reduction relates, but from a
third party.
<P>

10   	My comments in <i>Etrade</i> concerning the operation of
s256C(2) were therefore obiter in suggesting that, because of the drafting of
s256C(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, a selective reduction required
<i>all</i> ordinary shareholders to vote for it so that, if correct, this would
leave any greenmailer, even holding only one share, in an unassailable
position.  It is necessary to consider how the section operates in the
circumstances of the present case and I have had cause to
revise the views I
earlier expressed as dicta. 
<P>

11   	As the reduction here would not be within the definition
of equal reduction, it would be deemed to be a "selective reduction".
As a
selective reduction, s256C(2) would apply and is in these terms:
<P>

"<b>256C(2) Special shareholder approval for selective reduction</b>. If the
reduction is a selective reduction, it must be approved by either:
<P>

(a)	a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no
votes being cast in favour of the resolution by any
person who is to receive
consideration as part of the reduction or whose liability to pay amounts unpaid
on shares is to be reduced,
or by their associates; or
<P>

(b)	a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary
shareholders.
<P>

If the reduction involves the cancellation of shares, the reduction must also
be approved by a special resolution passed at a meeting
of the shareholders
whose shares are to be cancelled."
<P>

12   	For present purposes, the issues which arise in relation
to s256C(2) relate to the first of the two meetings mentioned above,
namely,
the meeting to consider the two special resolutions to selectively reduce T's
capital;  these are identical in their terms
save as to whose role may be
accepted. 
<P>

13   	M and MI have indicated their intentions not to vote in
favour of the first resolution of this meeting. The notice of this
meeting also
notes that the public shareholders of T "may vote against resolution 2, but are
not required to vote on resolution 2.
If any shareholders other than M and MI
vote in favour of resolution 2 those votes will not be accepted due to
requirements under
the s256C(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>."
<P>

14   	The submissions of the Plaintiff raise two issues for
consideration in the context of s256C(2)(a).
<P>

15   	First, whether the shareholders of a company to which the
proposed capital reduction relates will be prevented from voting
because they
receive any consideration "as part of the reduction", (employing the words used
in s256C(2)). This must be considered
in relation to the two separate classes
of shareholders - the public whose shares in T are to be cancelled, and M and
MI, who as
a consequence of the capital reduction will become the sole
shareholders of T.  It will be appreciated that if one but not the other
class
can vote in conformity with s256C(2)(a), then one of the identical resolutions
will be passed.  If neither class can thus vote,
then neither resolution will
be passed.  If both classes can thus vote, then again the resolution will be
passed.
<P>

16   	Second, if one determines in relation to the above issue
that shareholders do receive consideration "as part of the reduction",
what is
meant by the words "no votes being cast" in s256C(2)(a).  In particular does
"cast" mean the act of voting, or the result
of counting the vote?  Is a vote
made but not counted nonetheless cast?
<P>

<b>Submissions on first issue</b>
<P>

17   	As to the first issue, the submission put by the Plaintiff
was that the word "consideration" in the quoted phrase in s256C(2)(a)
refers
only to consideration moving from the company in which the reduction of capital
is to occur. The Plaintiff submitted that
"consideration" in this context does
not include consideration from a third party, not the company, moving as part
of an interdependent
scheme of arrangement. 
<P>

18   	Counsel for the Plaintiff provided the court with the
following reasons in support of this submission:
<P>

&#183;	Section 256C(2)(a) seeks to preserve the capital of a company and
regulates the procedure in relation to a return of capital.
The section is not
intended to regulate schemes of arrangement. This interpretation of s256C(2)(a)
is consistent with s256B(1)(b),
which allows a company to reduce its share
capital in a way not otherwise authorised by law, provided the reduction does
not materially
prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors. Counsel
for the Plaintiff has made the point that in the present circumstances,
given
that no there is no liberation of T's assets to its public shareholders as part
of the reduction, there is no prejudice to
the creditors of T.
<P>

&#183;	Although the proposed selective reduction of T's shares ought to be said
to have the effective result of a successful takeover
bid by M for T's shares,
the Plaintiff submits that Division 1 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/fclsb1994374/index.html#p2j.1" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 2J.1</a>, Chapter 2J of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> (in which s256B and C appear) does not prohibit such a
result. The concern of the Division is rather to ensure fairness between T's
shareholders inter se in relation to the liberation of company assets via a
reduction, not fairness in every conceivable aspect (including,
for example, in
relation to the consideration moving from a third party).
<P>

&#183;	The phrase "as part of the reduction" in s256C(2)(a) should not be read
so broadly as to include what occurs pursuant to
the scheme of arrangement, as
the scheme and reduction are separate and distinct mechanisms that operate in
different ways under
different parts of the <i>Corporations Law</i>. This is so
even if both a scheme and a reduction are connected via their expressed
interdependence, as in the present case.  Thus
the reduction (if validly voted
upon) effects cancellation of the shares, whilst the scheme of arrangement
effects the compulsion
upon a shareholder to accept an allotment of shares
(here allotted directly by M, a third party);  see my decision in <i>Re Advance
Bank</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2022%20ACSR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 22 ACSR 513</a> at 528 to 533 especially at 532.
<P>

&#183;	Accordingly, the Plaintiff submits that neither the public nor M
receives consideration "as part of the reduction".  In short
this is so because
the only consideration that the public receives comes from the company and
comes from the scheme, not the reduction.
In the case of M, this is so because
the consideration it receives is not a part of the reduction but the
<i>consequence</i> of the cancellation of shares taking effect.
<P>

19   	If these submissions of the Plaintiff were correct, then
the result would be that all the shareholders could vote on the special
resolution for capital reduction (though not for the scheme resolutions).  The
first of the proposed resolutions is not inconsistent
with this analysis.
Simply, M will be choosing not to exercise the right it has to vote on the
special resolution. 
<P>

20   	However, what the Plaintiff has done is to propose that
the resolution will be put twice. On the first resolution, because
M will not
vote, it will meet the possibility that M is receiving consideration under the
reduction. For the second resolution, what
the Plaintiff proposes is that the
public will be told that although they may vote against the resolution, any
vote in favour of
the resolution by them will not be accepted. This is
indicated on the notice of meeting, the proxy form and it is what the Chairman
intends to do at the meeting. This second resolution is designed to meet the
argument that the public receives consideration under
the reduction.
<P>

21   	However, this then raises the second issue, which is
precisely what is meant by "no votes being cast" in s256C(2)(a).
<P>

<b>Submissions on second issue</b>
<P>

22   	The second issue involves the question of when one "casts"
a vote in the sense relevant in s256C(2).  During argument, Counsel
for the
Plaintiff brought my attention to a modification to the proxy form proposed to
be used for the relevant meeting, the effect
of which would be to preclude
certain shareholders appointing a proxy from instructing their proxy to vote in
favour of the resolution
to be passed pursuant to s256C(2)(a).
<P>

23   	While superficially an attractive solution (subject to the
requirements of the company's constitution), it would not deal
with the
possibility of a shareholder receiving consideration as part of the reduction
from attending the meeting and voting in favour
of the resolution thereby
preventing the relevant approval from being obtained.  There may also be a
question whether a proxy can
be validly provided by the company in such a
form.
<P>

24   	The Plaintiff's submission was that the words "no votes
being cast" in s256C(2)(a) operate only at the stage of the counting
of the
votes for the particular purposes of that section. 
<P>

25   	The section permits and, it was submitted, requires the
company not to count the votes of those who receive consideration
but
nevertheless cast a vote in favour of the resolution to reduce the company's
capital. The section does not prohibit those shareholders
from voting either in
favour of or against the resolution (cf Owen J's obiter and shorthand comment
that such shareholders "cannot
vote" on the resolution in <i>Westchester
Financial Services Pty Ltd v Acclaim Exploration NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2032%20ACSR%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 32 ACSR 499</a> at
502). Nor is the section a self-denying ordinance such that the resolution is
invalidated if any shareholder who is not entitled
to cast a vote under the
section votes in favour of it. 
<P>

26   	As this submission was put, the effect of the section is
that the special resolution will not be invalidated merely because
any one or
more shareholders receiving consideration as part of the reduction vote in
favour of it; rather, the company has a statutory
mandate to disregard their
votes in determining whether a special resolution has been passed for the
purposes of this particular
section. It may be that for other purposes, such as
the company's constitution, a special resolution is required, on which everyone
can vote. If that be so, then the votes cast in favour of the resolution by the
shareholder receiving consideration as part of the
reduction can be counted for
that other purpose, but have not been "cast" in favour of the reduction
resolution, as not able to be
counted for that purpose.
<P>

27   	However, against this further possibility that this
argument may not be accepted, the Plaintiffs have agreed to call a general
meeting to amend their articles of association and, for precaution, to hold
that meeting the day before the meeting to consider the
resolutions for the
reduction of capital. The latter step is taken in view of s137(1)(a) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, which states that a special resolution adopting,
modifying or repealing a company's constitution takes effect, if no later date
is specified in the resolution, on the date on which the resolution is passed.
The effect of holding the meeting in relation to the
alteration of T's articles
one day before the meeting to consider the capital reduction ensures that any
resolution to amend T's
articles takes effect before the resolution to reduce
T's capital is put to the meeting and passed.
<P>

28   	Although it is not necessary for me to consider the form
of the amendment to the articles, I have been informed that it will
be broadly
along these lines:
<P>

"Notwithstanding any other Article, where:
<P>

(a)	the <i>Corporations Law</i> requires that a matter must be approved by a
resolution at a general meeting with no votes being cast in favour of the
resolution
by any person who is to receive a benefit or who is treated in a
particular way, or by their associate (each an "excluded person");
and
<P>

(b)	a general meeting is convened to approve such a matter, then;
<P>

(c)	an excluded person whose vote in favour of the resolution would preclude
the requirement of the <i>Corporations Law</i> being satisfied is not permitted
to vote in favour of the resolution; and
<P>

(d)	any vote purported to be cast by or on behalf of such an excluded person
shall not be accepted and shall be treated as not cast."
<P>

<b>History and analysis of section 256C</b>
<P>

29   	The explanatory memorandum to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clrb1997220/" class="autolink_findacts">Company Law Review
Bill</i> 1997</a> which introduced s256C explained:
<P>

"A reduction of capital that is not an equal reduction is a selective reduction
(Bill Schedule 5 Item 18 s256B(2)), and must be
approved by either:
<P>

(a)	a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, or
<P>

(b)	a resolution agreed at a general meeting to by all ordinary shareholders
(Bill Schedule 5 Item 18 s256C(2)).
<P>

Selective reductions require a special resolution, or unanimous shareholder
agreement at a general meeting, because they have the
capacity to advantage
some shareholders over others. Where a selective reduction is approved by a
special resolution, a vote may
not be cast in favour of the resolution by a
person who is to receive consideration as part of the reduction, or whose
liability
in respect of amounts unpaid on shares is to be reduced (Bill
Schedule 5 Item 18 s256C(2)(a)). This is intended to ensure that the
resolution's approval reflects the wishes of the company's disinterested
shareholders and corresponds to the approach taken in section
257D of the Bill
in relation to shareholder approval for a selective share buy-back.
<P>

The Bill also includes a procedure to protect minority shareholders against
their shares being cancelled under the guise of a capital
reduction. In
addition to the other shareholder approval requirements, a reduction of capital
that involves the cancellation of shares
will require approval by a special
resolution passed at a meeting of the shareholders whose shares are to be
cancelled (Bill Schedule
5 Item 18 s256C(2))."
<P>

30   	The scheme of s256C can be seen as one designed to protect
two classes of shareholder. 
<P>

31   	Section 256C(2)(a) seeks to exclude shareholders who will
receive consideration as part of the reduction (or whose liability
to pay
amounts on unpaid shares will not be reduced) or their associates from a
consideration of the special resolution to approve
the selective reduction. The
logic of this exclusion is clear. The remaining shareholders could be
disadvantaged if the capital reduction
were too generous. The exclusion ensures
that the resolution is not passed by reason of the influence of shareholders
that stand
specially to benefit from the capital reduction. These shareholders
whose shares are to be cancelled are protected by the requirement
in the last
paragraph of section 256C for a special resolution to be passed in a general
meeting of these shareholders.
<P>

32   	Although it is not necessary to decide the point at this
stage, there is merit in the argument that neither class of shareholder
is
precluded from voting because the reduction involves no liberation of the
company's assets and therefore no risk that it is too
generous to one class of
shareholders over another.
<P>

33   	It is unfortunate that such a cumbersome mechanism as that
in s256C(2)(a) should have been used. The reference to "no votes
being cast in
favour of the resolution by any person who is to receive consideration" may, at
first glance, seem an economic way
of convening and regulating meetings.
However, the effect of this is that, rather than protecting a class of
shareholders it may
give a veto right to any shareholder who is to receive
consideration as part of the reduction to prevent the reduction from being
passed.  The opportunity for an approval under s256C(2)(b) would be to no avail
because it requires unanimity at the general meeting
by all ordinary
shareholders (presumably being those ordinary shareholders who are present in
person or by proxy and vote at the
general meeting).
<P>

34   	The second protection afforded by s256C(2) is that if the
reduction involves a cancellation of shares, the reduction must
be approved by
a special resolution passed at a meeting of shareholders whose shares are to be
cancelled. In extending the potential
protection to shareholders under this
subsection, s256C(2) contemplates a meeting in which only those shareholders
whose shares are
to be cancelled are present. 
<P>

35   	Similar drafting to that contained in s256C can be found
in s257D(1)(a) (which deals with buy-backs) and by s260(D)(1)(a)
(which deals
with financial assistance approval).
<P>

36   	In relation to buy-backs, s257D(1)(a) was inserted by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/clra1998210/" class="autolink_findacts">Company Law Review Act</i> 1998</a> in replacement for the former s206E(1) which
is in similar terms. The explanatory memorandum on the introduction of s206E(1)
of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, which was introduced as part of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/fclsb1994374/" class="autolink_findacts">First
Corporate Law Simplification Bill</i> 1994</a> stated:
<P>

"5.9	Selective buy-backs can only proceed if they are approved by all
shareholders, or by a special resolution of the company on
which no vote is
cast by selling shareholders or their associates (<b>Schedule 1, proposed
subsection 206E(1)</b>).
<P>

5.10	Selling shareholders and their associates may not vote in favour of a
special resolution to approve a selective buy-back (<b>Schedule 1, proposed
paragraph 206E(1)(a)</b>)."
<P>

37   	There was no relevant comment in the explanatory
memorandum relating to the introduction of the current s257D.
<P>

38   	On the introduction of s206(D)(1)(a) the Explanatory
Memorandum stated:
<P>

"Shareholder approval of a financial assistance transaction may be given by:
<P>

(a)	a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no
vote being cast in favour of the resolution by the
person acquiring the shares
or units of shares, or their associates, or
<P>

(b)	a resolution agreed to by all ordinary shareholders (Bill s260B(1)).
<P>

The restriction on persons acquiring shares from voting in favour of the
resolution is intended to avoid the vote on a special resolution
being
controlled by those who will directly benefit from the financial assistance.
The procedure for approval by resolution agreed
to by all ordinary shareholders
has been added, to avoid a situation where all shareholders are prohibited from
voting in favour
of a resolution to approve the financial assistance."
<P>

39   	It is perhaps unfortunate that the <i>Corporations Law</i>
has not adopted a similar approach to the drafting of such shareholder
protection as the Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rules.
 For instance, the
standard voting exclusion statement contained in Listing Rule 14.11 makes it
clear that the entity seeking shareholder
approval must only:
<P>

"disregard any votes cast on a resolution by
<P>

&#183;	the (named) person (or class of persons) excluded from voting; and
<P>

&#183;	an associate of that person (or those persons)."
<P>

40   	If votes are cast, those votes do not go to the validity
of the resolution but rather those votes are simply excluded in determining
the
results of the resolution.
<P>

41   	Although it is unnecessary for me to decide the point at
this stage, there is some merit in the argument that the provisions
in the
<i>Corporations Law</i> were intended to operate in the same way as the more
clearly worded ASX rules.  Indeed it would be desirable for that to be placed
beyond doubt by a clarifactory amendment for the future.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

42   	It is not necessary at this stage of making orders
convening the scheme meetings in this case finally to resolve all of the
issues
exposed above in what is essentially a takeover proceeding by an interdependent
selective reduction and scheme.  In the present
case, through the combination
of two resolutions, with their different voting requirements and the prior
amendment to the articles,
the Plaintiff contends, and I accept, that the
requirements of s256C should be able to be met, whatever view is taken on the
meaning
of the section.
<P>

43   	Indeed if the exclusion from casting votes does not apply,
because the consideration emanates from a third party rather than
T  then it
may well be the case that only one resolution was needed so that either
resolution would have sufficed.  That still leaves
the necessity, which only a
scheme of arrangement lays down, for the three class meetings for the scheme of
arrangement (that is
with all T shareholders, all T shareholders without M and
MI and only M and MI).  It also provides the fairness appraisal mandated
for a
scheme of arrangement;  contrast an equal reduction which has no fairness
appraisal and a selective reduction where the fairness
appraisal might be
arguably most concentrated on creditors.  Clearly for Scheme purposes different
classes for voting are here involved
as between M and MI on the one hand, and
all the rest who receive their consideration in M shares.  They so vote by
virtue of the
scheme, not by virtue of the reduction, doing so after
cancellation of their T shares by the reduction.
<P>

44   	That begs the question, would a <i>cash</i> takeover
masquerading as a selective reduction of capital, but <i>not</i> associated
with a scheme, fall foul of the decision in <i>Gambotto v WCP Limited</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 432?</a>  The argument would be that such a selective reduction of
capital would amount to expropriation without the Court appraisal of fairness
mandated for a scheme.  In <i>Gambotto</i> (supra) at 446 the High Court
impliedly excludes schemes, or other statutory regimes for compulsory
acquisition, which have the safeguards
of a fairness appraisal.  However, these
are questions for another day.
<P>

45   	Without foreclosing any argument that may be made by any
other party in this matter at a later stage or any submissions then
by ASIC, I
am prepared to make orders convening the scheme meetings on the basis that the
Plaintiff will proceed in the manner referred
to above being satisfied that the
proposal may thus proceed to the next stage.  Meantime I express my
indebtedness to Mr J Gleeson
of Counsel for T for assistance by way of
comprehensive submissions.
