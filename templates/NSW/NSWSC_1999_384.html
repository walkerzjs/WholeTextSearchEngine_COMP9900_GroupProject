<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	On 1 December 1993, the plaintiffs, Mars Constructions Pty Limited, ("Mars
Constructions"), and its founder and principal director,
Mr Joseph Wehbe, for
which and whom Dr C.J. Birch of Counsel appeared, entered into two written
building contracts pursuant to each
of which they undertook to build a block of
home units.  I shall also refer to the plaintiffs as "the builder".  One
contract was
entered into with Rolando Pty Limited, ("Rolando"), as trustee for
a unit trust, and provided for the redevelopment of a property
at 6-10 May
Street, Hornsby by the demolition of existing improvements and the construction
of twenty seven new two-bedroom and one
new three-bedroom Strata Title home
units for a fixed price of $2,785,225 "subject only to rock excavation being
undertaken in accordance
with the contract".  The project manager was nominated
as PBI Holdings Pty Limited, ("PBI"), a company effectively controlled by
Mr
George Papallo.  The nominated architect was H &amp; B Pty Limited, although it
was accepted that Mr Papallo had the control of
supervision on the site.  The
other contract was entered into with Corbel Pty Limited, ("Corbel"), as trustee
for another unit trust,
and provided for the redevelopment of a property at
8-12 Water Street, Hornsby, which was nearby 6-10 May Street, by the demolition
of existing improvements and the construction of twenty seven new two-bedroom
Strata Title home units for a fixed price of $2,773,200
"subject only to rock
excavation being undertaken in accordance with the contract".  The project
manager was nominated as Alanto
Investments Pty Limited, ("Alanto"), which was
also effectively controlled by Mr Papallo and, notwithstanding that H &amp; B
Pty
Limited was the nominated architect, Mr Papallo had the control of
supervision.  Mr Richard Hudson and Mr Herman were directors of
Rolando and
Corbel.  The two contracts were to be performed almost simultaneously.  Mr
G.T.W. Miller of Queen's Counsel and Ms V.A.
Hartstein of Counsel appeared for
Rolando, Corbel and Mr Papallo, which and who respectively were the first,
second and third defendants.
 I shall also refer to Rolando and Corbel as "the
proprietor".
<P>

2	It was not in issue that Mr Wehbe was a very experienced and competent
builder and, before these contracts were entered into,
he and Mr Papallo had
been engaged in other building projects in the same capacities including one
next door to the May Street site,
being 2-4 May Street, and that they enjoyed a
good relationship and friendship.  Mr Wehbe's wife and his son, Mr Raymond
Wehbe, were
also directors of Mars Constructions.  Towards the end of May or in
early June 1995 Mr Joseph Wehbe returned to the Lebanon, where
he remained
until his death on 26 July 1995.  Mr Raymond Wehbe appears to have assumed
basic control of the builder, and he was appointed
to represent his father in
these proceedings.
<P>

3	The contracts were the subject of detailed negotiations between the parties
and their solicitors.  Mars Constructions and Mr Wehbe
retained Mr Wehbe's
nephew, Mr Louis Wehbe, as their solicitor, and the defendants retained Mr J.A.
Snelgrove as their solicitor.
 It did not seem to be in issue that on the late
afternoon or early evening of 1 December 1993 Mr Joseph Wehbe, Mr Raymond Wehbe
and Mr Louis Wehbe attended at Mr Snelgrove's offices for the purpose of
considering and, if satisfied, signing the contracts.  Mr
Snelgrove was present
from time to time, but there was no other representative of the defendants
present.  However, during the meeting
there was a telephone conversation with
Mr Papallo, which was conducted on a conference line.  There was an issue as to
whether,
during that telephone conversation, Mr Joseph Wehbe told Mr Papallo
that he was not satisfied with the time provided for building
the May Street
units.  It was alleged by Mr Raymond Wehbe and Mr Louis Wehbe that a
conversation to that effect took place and that
Mr Papallo, in essence, said
that if any additional time was needed there would be no problem about it.  Any
conversation to this
effect was denied by Mr Snelgrove and Mr Papallo but, in
the end, it did not seem to matter particularly which version is accepted.
Therefore, I find it unnecessary to resolve the conflict.
<P>

4	Each contract comprised the standard form JCCB 1985 Building Works Contract
together with detailed special conditions and a specification.
 There is no
issue but that the work was essentially carried out, although disputes arose
towards its conclusion in relation to alleged
defects and, subsequently,
concerning the failure to provide insulation and an acceptable fire rated
ceiling on the top floors. 
These matters were not ascertained until about
August 1995.
<P>

5	Clause 10.20 required the builder to give security, which was agreed at five
per cent of the contract sum, by way of bank guarantee
"in an amount being the
equivalent of five per cent (5%) of the Contract Sum in two (2) Bankers'
Undertakings or Guarantees each
the equivalent of two and one half per cent
(2%) of the Contract Sum".  This was done by way of four Bank Guarantees
furnished by
the National Australia Bank Limited, ("NAB").
<P>

6	Clause 10.22.02 provided that the Bank Guarantee should be maintained
effective until the issue by the architect of the Notice
of Practical
Completion pursuant to Clause 9.09.02, or until the date the works are deemed
to have reached Practical Completion pursuant
to Clauses 9.09.04 or 9.10.04
and, upon the first of those events to happen, the proprietor was to authorise
the reduction to half
the original amount or, upon the builder providing a
further Bank Guarantee on like terms and conditions but equal to one half of
the amount the proprietor was to release the original Bank Guarantee.
<P>

7	Clause 9.09.04 provided for what should happen in the event of the architect
not issuing a Certificate of Practical Completion;
and Clause 9.10.04
provided:-
<P>

	<b>"If the Proprietor occupies and/or uses the Works or part thereof prior to
Practical Completion in the absence of any such agreement
and Notice or of
other written agreement between the Proprietor and the Builder then the whole
of the works shall be deemed to have
reached Practical Completion on the date
of commencement of such occupancy and/or use."</b>
<P>

8	Clause 9.11 provided that the Defects Liability Period shall commence on the
date on which the works reached or were deemed to
have reached Practical
Completion, and Clause 9.12 provided that subject to several clauses the
builder should complete the making
good of all defects within a reasonable time
"of the end of the Defects Liability Period". The Defects Liability Period was
twenty
six weeks.
<P>

9	Clause 10.14 provided that if the builder failed to bring the works to
Practical Completion by the date for Practical Completion
then the architect
may give notice in writing to the builder and to the proprietor, not later than
twenty days after the date on
which the works actually reached or are deemed to
have reached Practical Completion, that in his opinion the works ought
reasonably
to have been brought to Practical Completion at some earlier time to
be stated in the Notice, not being earlier than the date for
Practical
Completion.  Clause 10.14.02 provided that if such notice was given the builder
shall pay or allow to the proprietor a
sum calculated and certified by the
architect at the rate stated in Item M of the Appendix as liquidated and
ascertained damages
for the period commencing from the date so stated during
which the works shall remain or have remained not brought to Practical
Completion,
and Clause 10.14.03 provided:-
<P>

	<b>"In the event of no further moneys being payable to the Builder or in the
event of the sum calculated in accordance with paragraph
10.14.02 exceeding the
amount remaining payable by the Proprietor to the Builder the Proprietor shall
be entitled to recover the
same, or any excess, as a debt due to the Proprietor
by the Builder."</b>
<P>

In the schedule the amount provided was $6,000 "per week or part thereof".
<P>

10	The terms of the building contracts were largely overtaken by various
events.  Firstly, the architect was not required to issue
notices Mr Wehbe and
Mr Papallo apparently sorting out matters in a more informal way as the
building work progressed. Thus the giving
of formal notices conformably with
the contract was not required. Secondly, a further agreement was entered into
on 18 May 1995,
which, in my opinion, overtook the building contracts, save to
the extent that their terms were incorporated in it.
<P>

<b>The Agreement Of 18 May 1995</b>
<P>

11	On 18 May 1995 Mr Joseph Wehbe and Mr Papallo met with a view to seeking to
resolve various differences which had arisen and
letters bearing that date were
exchanged.  They discussed the problems for several hours, after which they
approached Mr Noel Smith,
who worked on some contract basis for Mr Papallo.  Mr
Papallo dictated both letters in the presence of Mr Wehbe.  Mr Smith typed
what
Mr Papallo dictated and, thereafter, Mr Wehbe took the letters away to consider
them with Mr Raymond Wehbe and Mr Louise Wehbe
before he signed his letter.
The letters were then returned to Mr Papallo.  The letter signed by Mr Joseph
Wehbe was addressed to
Mr Papallo and, after referring to the two properties in
the heading, continued:-
<P>

	<b>"In regard to the above matters and further to my meetings with you, we
acknowledge the following:</b>
<P>

<b>1)	As agreed, your principals owe us a total of $153,000 in regard to the
Building Contracts re the above properties, inclusive of
all extras etc.</b>
<P>

<b>2)	We concede that penalties apply in regard to both of the above projects
in the sum of $133,000.</b>
<P>

<b>We therefore advise that upon payment of the sum of $20,000 your principals
have fully satisfied their obligations to us under the
relevant contracts and
no further monies whatsoever are due.</b>
<P>

<b>We again reiterate our assurances to you that we acknowledge our continuing
obligations under the contracts in regard to defects etc
and we will always
promptly attend to rectification of the same and any of our other obligations
under the contracts for as long
as we remain liable under the said
contracts."</b>
<P>

	
<P>

12	The letter signed by Mr Papallo, which was on Alanto's letterhead and was
signed by him on behalf of Alanto and PBI, stated:-
<P>

	<b>"On behalf of ourselves in regard to 8-12 Water Street and on behalf of PBI
Holdings Pty Ltd in regard to 6-10 May Street, we acknowledge
receipt of your
letter dated today and advise that we find the contents thereof as being
satisfactory and acceptable.</b>
<P>

<b>	We further acknowledge that the second Bank Guarantee in regard to May
Street is due to be released to you on 8th June 1995 and the
second Bank
Guarantee in regard to Water Street is due for release to you on 3rd September
1995."</b>
<P>

13	There is a handwritten post script stating:-
<P>

	<b>"We accept that the tar staining on the driveway cannot be rectified and we
will not require any further rectification in regard to
such tar
staining."</b>
<P>

14	On the same day Mr Papallo caused the $20,000 to be paid and the first Bank
Guarantees in relation to May and Water Streets to
be delivered to Mr Wehbe.
Those actions support the conclusion that the only matters outstanding were the
repair of defects and the
release of the second guarantees.
<P>

15	It was not in issue that the two letters constituted an agreement but, on
behalf of the defendants, it was submitted that they
did not set forth the
totality of it.  It was submitted that the defendants' position was that the
reference to the dates in the
second letter was in response to a request from
Mr Wehbe that he be advised of the dates when those Bank Guarantees were due
for
release, and that it was always a term of the agreement that their release
was contingent on the defects being rectified.
<P>

16	It was also submitted on behalf of the defendants that there were certain
oral terms, namely that upon payment of $20,000 the
parties would compromise
their claims, but that the plaintiffs remained liable and responsible to
address the defects and the remaining
bank guarantees were to be retained to
support the performance of that obligation.
<P>

17	It was not in issue that the agreement reached on 18 May 1995, subject to
ascertaining its precise terms, was a genuine attempt
by Mr Joseph Wehbe and Mr
Papallo to conclude their differences in relation to the building works.  Mr
Joseph Wehbe, according to
Mr Raymond Wehbe, was concerned that there may be a
claim for substantial damages and he wished to resolve the matter before
leaving
for the Lebanon, which he did shortly thereafter.  Matters then seem to
have been left in the hands of Mr Raymond Wehbe and, on 20
June 1995, he wrote
to Mr Papallo stating:-
<P>

	<b>"I refer to the undertaking given by you on behalf of Alanto Investments
and PBI Holdings P/L on the 18th of May 1995 regarding the
bank guarantees.
Pursuant to the undertaking you were to return the guarantee given in regard to
May Street development on 8 June
1995.  The bank guarantee has not yet been
returned.  Your failure in this regard is causing Mars Constructions P/L to
incur further
costs for which we hold you responsible.  I insist that you
return the bank guarantee referred to within 48 hours, i.e. 1.00 pm Thursday
22
June 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>	Failure by you to return the bank guarantee would be a serious breach of
the arrangements entered into between yourselves and Mars
Constructions for the
settlement of all outstanding claims between the parties that was made on the
18th of May 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>	Following my conversation with Mr Noel Smith last week he indicated that
you were retaining the bank guarantee until you had received
a notice from us
addressed to Metway Finance Limited.  We are not obliged to provide you with
any notices for Metway Finance and
we will not be providing you with any
notices that we are not obliged to provide under the terms of the contracts.
You are not entitled
to refuse to return the bank guarantees on conditions
relating to us providing notices to your financiers."</b>
<P>

18	On 26 June 1995 Mr Louis Wehbe wrote to Mr Papallo stating:-
<P>

	<b>"We refer to previous correspondence in respect to the above matter and
advise that we act on behalf of Joseph Wehbe and Mars Constructions
Pty Limited
regarding same.</b>
<P>

<b>	We are instructed that pursuant to the Agreement reached with you on 18th
May 1995, the second Bank Guarantee in respect of the development
at 6-10 May
Street Hornsby was to be released to our clients on 8th June 1995.  We note
that our client by letter dated 20th June
1995 demanded the return of the Bank
Guarantee within a further 48 hours but that you have refused or neglected to
provide same to
our client.</b>
<P>

<b>	We accordingly formally advise that the Agreement of 18th May 1995 referred
to above is hereby rescinded.</b>
<P>

<b>	We will, on behalf of our clients, pursue recovery of the monies
outstanding to them and commence proceedings against Corbel Pty
Limited and
Rolando Pty Limited in the District Court of New South Wales forthwith.</b>
<P>

<b>	All future correspondence regarding this matter from yourself or the
proprietors of the subject property should be directed to this
office."</b>
<P>

19	On 28 June 1995 Mr Papallo wrote to Mr Joseph Wehbe and Mars
Constructions:-
<P>

	<b>"Having just returned from holidays, I have now read with bemusement your
correspondence as addressed to ourselves and PBI Management
Pty Ltd dated 20
June 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>	Your letter seems to be based on your ignorance of your contractual
obligations and I would suggest you and your solicitors read
all your
contractual documentation before coming to the conclusions as expressed in your
letter.  Your expression (in the final paragraph
of your letter) of Noel
Smith's statement is <u>not</u> correct.  Our undertaking to you in regard to
the bank guarantees as contained in our letter to you dated the 18 May 1995 was
based
upon the matters contained in your letter to us of even date, and in
particular your final paragraph.  Your non-compliance in the
matter of defects
is despite our continual verbal and written demands since approximately
November 1994 and continues since the 18
May 1995, whereby you have failed and
continue to fail, to rectify the defects.  This is primarily the reason that
the bank guarantees
have not been released.</b>
<P>

<b>	Having regard to your attitude and your continuing non-compliance with our
demands regarding defects you are now put on notice that
you leave us with no
option but to cash all bank guarantees and use these funds to pay for the
rectification of the defects.</b>
<P>

<b>	Finally, we would request that you inform your solicitors to correspond
with our solicitors and <u>not</u> ourselves."</b>
<P>

There is no suggestion in this letter of the existence of any additional oral
terms.
<P>

20	On 28 June 1995 Mr Louis Wehbe wrote to Mr Papallo denying that there were
any defects, which had not been rectified, seeking
particulars of any
notification of such defects, and stating that all defects had been attended to
promptly on notification.
<P>

21	On 29 June 1995 Mr Snelgrove responded stating, inter alia:- 
<P>

	<b>"We note at a meeting in May 1995, at which Joe Wehbe for himself and on
behalf of Mars Constructions Pty Limited was present with
George Papallo on
behalf of Alanto Investments Pty Limited and PBI Management Pty Limited,
certain matters were agreed and which
we are instructed are correctly set out
in your client's letter to our clients of 18 May 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>	Our client acknowledged the correctness of the abovementioned letter by its
letter of 18th May 1995 and the cheque of $20,000 was
paid by way of a bank
cheque drawn on Metway Bank Limited on 18th May 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>	In relation to the bank guarantees referred to in the second paragraph of
our client's letter of 18th May 1995 to your clients, these
are the dates that
are referred to in the relevant Building Contracts but naturally any release of
such bank guarantees is dependent
upon your clients discharging their
contractual obligations in accordance with the Building Contracts.  In that
regard we advise
that contrary to your letter of 28th June 1995 to our clients,
there are still defects that are not rectified or defects that have
been
purportedly rectified but not to our clients' and its consultants'
requirements.</b>
<P>

<b>	In relation to your letter of 24th May 1995 addressed to Mr Noel Smith of
Alanto Investments Pty Limited, your letter appears to
ask to proceed on an
erroneous basis, namely, that the matters set forth in our respective clients'
communications of 18th May 1995
are not yet complete.  This is certainly
incorrect as the compromise as worked out between our respective clients was
agreed and
then completed upon payment of the sum of $20,000 as indicated
above.  These matters cannot be revisited and your client, and indeed
our
client, are bound by the agreement that has been reached and now concluded.
However, this has nothing whatsoever to do with rectification
of defects, and
the consequent release of the second bank guarantees on each project, that have
been and are yet to be resolved.</b>
<P>

<b>	On 20th June 1995 your clients wrote to our clients a letter which again
appears to us to proceed on an erroneous basis.  The agreements
reached between
our respective clients of 18th May 1995 have nothing to do with defects and
their rectification by your clients in
order the release of the second bank
guarantees for each project.  Indeed, the defects issue is specifically
accepted by your clients
in their letter of 18th May 1995 and it goes without
saying that the reference to the release of the bank guarantees in our client's
letter of 18th May 1995 is and has always been and will be dependent upon your
clients' performance of their contractual obligations.</b>
<P>

<b>	In relation to your letter of 26th June 1995 to our client, we do not
intend to say anything further as the matters mentioned above
adequately
respond and deal with the matters that you have raised save that your clients
had no basis to pursue the matters that
were the subject of the compromise
agreed 18th May 1995 which has now been completed and fully performed.  If the
reference in the
penultimate paragraph of this letter is to some other moneys,
then please provide to us how those moneys allegedly became owing or
are due
and owing to your clients in the face of the compromise of 18th May
1995."</b>
<P>

This letter made no reference to any additional oral terms.
<P>

On 5 July 1995, Mr Louis Wehbe wrote to Mr Snelgrove referring to that letter
and advising that the defects period relating to the
May Street development "is
now finalised".  The letter continued that there were no outstanding defects,
and that with respect to
the Water Street property his clients were attending
to other defects of which they had been advised.  The letter continued:-
<P>

	<b>"With regard to the letters of 18th May 1995 we wish to confirm that the
contents of those letters have been rescinded.  The original
Contract
accordingly applies.  Your client has breached that Contract by not paying
progress payments claimed, and demands for payment,
regarding the May Street
development on 13th September 1994, 19th October 1994, 1st December 1994, 19th
December 1994, 6th January
1995, 3rd April 1995 and 7th April 1995."</b>
<P>

In my view, and for reasons to which I shall refer, the statement that the
original building contracts were applicable was erroneous.
<P>

22	The letter went on to refer to a dispute about payments in respect of Water
Street and because of the existence of those disputes
the prospect of the
matter being referred to arbitration.
<P>

23	There was an assumption in this letter that the effect of terminating the
agreement of 18 May 1995, assuming that it was lawfully
terminated for breach,
was to reinstate the original building contracts, rather than to bring about a
situation whereby the rights
of the parties were to be determined pursuant to
the agreement of 18 May 1995.
<P>

24	On 11 July 1995, Rolando and Corbel gave notice to NAB calling up the Bank
Guarantees in the sums of $69,631 and $69,330 respectively.
 NAB, pursuant to
those notices, paid out the amounts to those companies.  The evidence, however,
makes it clear that neither company
had made an assessment of the amount
payable to remedy the defects, at that time, and the evidence of Mr Papallo was
that he gave
instructions to Mr Snelgrove to recover the amounts
notwithstanding that fact, and notwithstanding that each guarantee allowed for
a payment by NAB in whole or in part.  It will be necessary to refer to Mr
Papallo's evidence about this in some detail.  On 12 July
1995 Mr Raymond Wehbe
was informed that the guarantees had been drawn down and, on 13 July 1995, the
plaintiffs commenced proceedings
in relation thereto and obtained relief on an
ex parte basis from Brownie J.
<P>

25	The purported justification for calling on the guarantees was the alleged
failure by the plaintiffs to remedy the defects.  However,
on 23 May 1995, Mr
Smith, who was contracted in some way to Alanto and PBI, sent a facsimile
transmission to Mr Raymond Wehbe in
relation to outstanding defects at both
properties.  On 24 May 1995 Mr Wehbe responded advising that all items had been
rectified
with certain exceptions and, in relation to May Street, the exception
was that in two units a tiler was to replace damaged tiles.
 The other defects
to which attention had not been given were in the Water Street property.
<P>

26	There was a dispute between Mr Raymond Wehbe and Mr Papallo about the terms
of a telephone conversation between them on 24 May
1995.  Notwithstanding that
Mr Papallo had prepared a contemporaneous note, I prefer the evidence of Mr
Raymond Wehbe, whom I accepted
as a generally truthful witness.  Whichever
version is accepted, it is quite clear that Mr Papallo was seeking to have a
letter to
the financier signed and was threatening to move against the
guarantees if this was not done.  It is inherently improbable that only
six
days after the 18 May 1995 agreement was entered into Mr Papallo would have
been saying that the defect position was "getting
out of hand".
<P>

27	On 29 May 1995 Mr Smith sent another facsimile transmission to Mr Wehbe
referring to defects at both properties and, on 7 June
1995, Mr Wehbe wrote to
Mr Papallo reporting that all items referred to in that facsimile transmission
had been rectified "with the
exception of the planter box waterproofing in
Water Street which has been promised to be done this week by the
sub-contractor". 
Accordingly, the assertion was being made that all the
defects at May Street had been rectified.  This was never contradicted orally
or in writing by Mr Papallo or Mr Smith.  It is to be noted that an expert
retained by Mr Papallo, Mr Edminston, appears to have
carried out an inspection
on 30 May 1995 but no report from him detailing defects was furnished before
proceedings were commenced.
<P>

28	Notwithstanding that Mr Papallo had been a solicitor for some ten years
until 1981 and was an experienced property developer
by 1995, and
notwithstanding that he said that defects remained, he made no response to the
assertions in the letter of 7 June 1995.
 This is a matter of some significance
because on 20 June 1995 Mr Smith sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Wehbe
complaining about
possums entering Water Street.  The significance of this, in
my opinion, is that when complaints were thought to be justified they
were made
and, on 22 June 1995, pursuant to a further list of defects in respect of Water
Street, Mr Wehbe wrote to Mr Papallo dealing
with them.  However there were no
complaints in respect of May Street.
<P>

29	At Tp.103 Mr Papallo said, in a not particularly satisfactory manner, that
so far as May Street was concerned "there are a whole
list of things that were
not completed" on about or shortly after 7 or 8 June 1995.
<P>

30	At Tpp.113-115 I referred Mr Papallo to the letter of 28 June 1995, which he
said he drafted and which correctly recorded his
views about the matters to
which he referred.  I asked him to what documents he was referring in the
second paragraph and he said
the building contracts and he supposed all the
defects lists, but nothing else.  Although his attention had been turned to the
letters
of 18 May 1995, Tp.114, he did not include those among the contractual
documents to which he was suggesting regard should be had.
 
<P>

31	He agreed, Tp.115, that he could not find any written correspondence in
relation to May Street after the letter in which he was
told that all defects
had been made good, and that in retrospect the obvious thing for him to have
done, if there had been a dispute
about May Street, would have been to send a
letter or facsimile transmission stating that, contrary to what Mr Wehbe was
asserting,
there were still matters outstanding.  He said he was an experienced
developer, used to dealing with builders and a solicitor of
some ten years'
standing, who appreciated the importance of contemporaneous written documents
and:-
<P>

	<b>"Q. Yet in answer to one of the major assertions in this case, at that
point, namely that May Street had been concluded so far as
defects were
concerned, you made no response; is that the position?</b>
<P>

<b>		A. Yes your Honour."</b>
<P>

I am satisfied there were no such communications because Mr Papallo and Mr
Smith were satisfied there were no defects in May Street
at that time, nor up
to the time when Mr Papallo refused to return the Bank Guarantee for May
Street.
<P>

32	At Tp.122 I again referred Mr Papallo to the letter of 28 June 1995 and he
agreed there was no reference in it to any oral communications
concerning the
contract.  He attempted to say that whilst there was no direct reference there
was one by implication in the words
"Having regard to your attitude and your
non-compliance with our demands".  At Tp.123 he agreed the demands were not
contractual
terms and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And in this letter, you were pointing the reader to the contractual
obligations in contractual documentation were you not?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. In contractual documentation, and in agreements that Joe and I had come
to from day to day.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Would you tell me where you refer to that in agreements where you and Mr
Joe Wehbe had come to day by day?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. I don't - can't show you in this letter.  No it's not in this
letter.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. What I put to you I think is correct: you were referring the reader to
the contractual documentation?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That's the way it reads your Honour, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. You were not referring the reader to some oral terms after contract into
which you and Mr Wehbe had entered, were you?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Your Honour, in my mind the contractual obligations between us involved
a little bit in so far as from January onwards of that
year the costs of
discussion about what would and would not be done, which weren't necessarily
one hundred per cent covered by the
written documentation.  </b>
<P>

<b>	Q. The point I'm making is that you make no reference to those
conversations in this letter?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That's correct.  I agree.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. You only refer the reader to the contractual documentation?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That's what this letter does, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Which you have identified for me earlier this afternoon?</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>	<b>A. Yes your Honour."</b>
<P>

33	Mr Papallo, acting on behalf of Rolando and Corbel, instructed Mr Snelgrove
to obtain the funds covered by the second two guarantees
on 11 July 1995.  He
said that was done with the intention of using the funds to rectify defects in
the buildings and that the amount
obtained was $138,000.  He agreed, Tp.115,
that he had not then made any calculations whatsoever as to what moneys were
needed to
rectify whatever defects there were in the buildings, and added that
the intent was to go straight out to tender and get it done.
 He also agreed
the costs might only have been $15,000.  He said, although he agreed he was
uncertain about it, that he did not think
he understood that the Bank Guarantee
could be drawn down in part, but that the moneys that were drawn down "went
into a trust account",
and that there was no intention to touch any of them
"apart from whatever likely was required to rectify".  It was not in issue that
the Bank Guarantees provided that the whole or part of the money could be drawn
down, nor that the moneys were to discharge the indebtedness
of the plaintiffs.
The evidence continued, Tp.116:-
<P>

<b>"Q. Before you drew them down, before you gave the instruction to draw them
down, did you turn your mind to that question and think
to yourself how much am
I entitled to draw down?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. No, we just drew down the whole lot and put it into a trust
account.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Well when you say you put it into a trust account, did you receive
notice shortly after the visit to the Bank that an application
had been made to
the Supreme Court?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Several days later, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. The moneys were actually moved from the account they were initially paid
into, were they not, shortly after proceedings were commenced?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. My instructions were that the moneys were to go into trust, and to be
held there until we knew how much was to be used, because
the balance was to be
refunded to Mars Construction.</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>	Returning though to the contract itself, did you consult the contract to
ascertain whether you were entitled to take all the moneys
and put them into a
trust account under your control, and then deal with them as you saw
fit?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. No I didn't consult the contract.  I knew we were entitled to draw down
on them, I just instructed the solicitor to do that.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. You didn't bother to find out firstly whether you could only draw down
for so much as was due to you at that time?</b>
<P>

<b>		A. I was of the impression that we had to draw down the whole lot."</b>
<P>

34	Mr Papallo agreed he did not check the contracts and that he was not sure,
because he did not check, whether the guarantees provided
for drawing down of
part of the money.  He said that he simply instructed Mr Snelgrove to draw down
the Bank Guarantees: Tp.118,
and that he never turned his mind to what was the
amount of money to which there was an entitlement under them, having no
"specific
idea" of the amount to which Rolando and Cordel would ultimately be
entitled.  He agreed, however, that he knew that under the contracts
he was
only entitled to have recourse to the guarantees to the extent that money was
due by the builder to the proprietor under the
contracts, but he was uncertain
of the amount due.  He repeated that and said, at Tp.119:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And you didn't care whether or not the moneys that you were demanding
from the Bank were really due to you or not, or whether
they were in excess of
what was due to you?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. The issue of caring didn't cross my mind.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. You simply took $138,000 without caring whether or not that was money
that you were entitled to take on 12 July?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. I didn't consider we took it.  We cashed some guarantees and put some
money into trust.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. You were intending to put it into an account that was controlled by you,
is that correct?</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>	<b>A. Absolutely not.  An account that was controlled by the legal
firm handling the matter."</b>
<P>

35	He was unable to give any explanation as to why he did not leave the money
with NAB, although he said that "in retrospect" he
should have.  He denied that
he called upon the guarantees because he wanted to put pressure on Mr Wehbe to
sign a letter to the
financier of Rolando and Corbel.
<P>

<b>The Pleadings</b>  
<P>

36	On 12 April 1999 the plaintiffs filed a Further Amended Summons in Court
whereby they sought, as against Rolando, Corbel and
Mr Papallo declarations
that the proceeds of the two Bank Guarantees given by NAB on 6 December 1993 in
the sums of $69,631 and $69,330
were held on trust for them, and an order that
they be restrained from dealing with the proceeds.  Various other orders were
sought
in relation to those moneys, and declarations were sought that Rolando
is indebted to the plaintiffs pursuant to the building contract
in respect of
May Street in the sum of $62,122, and that Corbel is indebted to the plaintiffs
pursuant to the building contract in
respect of Water Street in the sum of
$105,694.
<P>

37	An order was sought that the defendants pay damages to the plaintiffs and,
further or alternatively, exemplary and/or aggravated
damages.
<P>

38	At the commencement of the proceedings it was far from clear what matters
were in issue or the extent to which the pleadings
dealt with matters in issue.
This arose notwithstanding that the proceedings have now been on foot for some
four years, that the
hearing was specially fixed to commence on 12 April 1999
as long ago as early November 1998, and that the parties were directed to
bring
in a statement of the issues.  On the second day of the hearing Mr Miller was
still promulgating the Defence to the Further
Amended Summons.  This is not
said in a necessarily critical manner as the Amended Summons was only filed in
Court on 12 April 1999,
but it is totally unsatisfactory, when matters are the
subject of extensive case management, for the parties and those representing
them not to be able to formulate the issues, both through pleadings and a
Statement of Issues prior to the commencement of the hearing.
 It is a quite
inefficient way to conduct litigation and it leads to a waste of the Court's
time.
<P>

39	In the Notice of Contentions to the Further Amended Summons, most of which
were not amended in any material respects, it was
pleaded, and so much was not
in issue, that Mr Raymond Wehbe was appointed to represent the estate of the
late Mr Joseph Wehbe, who
died on 26 July 1995, that the various corporate
parties were duly incorporated, and the entry into the building agreements.
Initially
paragraphs 7 and 8 were admitted, they asserting that as at 18 May
1995 Rolando and Corbel were indebted to the builder in the sums
of $62,122 and
$105,694 respectively pursuant to the building contracts.  Mr Miller withdrew
those admissions and, in place thereof,
substituted a pleading that in relation
to Rolando the amount owing is $59,569, and that in relation to Corbel the
amount owing is
$82,707, but that from the sum of those two amounts must be
deducted $20,000 paid pursuant to the agreement entered into on 18 May
1995.
However, Rolando and Corbel also pleaded that the building contracts were
novated by the agreement of 18 May 1995 whereby the
parties resolved this part
of the claim by setting off the amounts of $153,000 and $133,000, and by the
payment by Rolando and Corbel
to the plaintiffs of $20,000.
<P>

40	The plaintiffs pleaded that as 18 May 1995 there was a dispute between the
parties as to any penalties alleged to be owing by
the builder to Rolando or
Corbel in regard to the contracts, which was admitted, although it was asserted
that the builder admitted
penalties were owing and that the dispute was as to
the quantum thereof.
<P>

41	In paragraph 10 to 13 it was pleaded:-
<P>

<b>"10.	On 18th May 1995 the builder of the one part and Corbel and Rolando of
the other part entered into an agreement to settle the
dispute between
themselves in regard to the outstanding penalties under the said contract, such
agreement being in writing and contained
in two (2) letters each dated 18th May
1995 (hereafter `the Agreement').</b>
<P>

<b>  11.	It was a term and condition of the said agreement that the builder
acknowledged to Rolando and Corbel that penalties applied
under the said
Contract in the sum of $133,000 and that $156,000 was outstanding under the
said Contract and that Rolando and Corbel
were consequently indebted to the
builder in the sum of $23,000.</b>
<P>

<b>  12.	It was a further term of the said agreement that Rolando and Corbel
acknowledged that the second Bank Guarantee in regard to
the May Street
development was due to be released on 8th June 1995 and the second Bank
Guarantee in regard to the Water Street development
was due to be released on
3rd September 1995.</b>
<P>

<b>  13.	It was either an express term or alternatively an implied term of the
said agreement that the said Bank Guarantees would be
released upon the said
dates but for any sum which Rolando or Corbel might become entitled to retain
pursuant to the said Contract
in regard to defects in the said building works
notified in accordance with the terms of the said Contracts."</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

42	The defendants admitted paragraph 10, it not being contended at that stage
that there were any oral terms of the agreement. 
However, when the case
commenced Mr Miller said there was no issue that the two letters of 18 May 1995
constituted an agreement,
but that they did not constitute its totality, the
defendants' position being that the reference in the letters to the date of the
two guarantees was in response to a request from Mr Joseph Wehbe for
confirmation of the dates when the guarantees were to be released,
which
release was always contingent on defects being rectified.  He added there were
some oral terms, namely that upon payment of
$20,000 the plaintiffs would
compromise their claims, but that the builder remained liable and responsible
to address the defects
and the remaining two Bank Guarantees were to be held to
bring about performance of the rectification work, Mr Joseph Wehbe saying
that
all outstanding defects would be rectified.  Paragraph 13 of the Notice of
Contentions provides support for this view.
<P>

43	The Defence, in answer to paragraph 11, admitted that it was a term and
condition of the agreement that the builder acknowledged
to Rolando and Corbel
that penalties applied in the sum of $133,000, and the defendants denied that
$156,000 was outstanding and
that they were indebted to the plaintiffs in the
sum of $23,000.  The defendants admitted that it was agreed that $153,000 was
outstanding
and that Rolando and Corbel were consequently indebted to the
builder in the sum of $20,000.  So much did not seem to be in issue.
 The
Defence admitted paragraph 12, but, on 13 April 1999, Mr Miller said that
paragraph 12 was now denied in so far as there was
a reference in the letters
to the dates  on which the Bank Guarantees were due to be released, and that it
was now asserted that
as to paragraphs 12 and 13 the agreement, which arose in
consequence of the exchange of the letters together with the payment of
$20,000, constituted a novation of the contracts on the terms that the
defendants acknowledged liability to pay for extras in the
sum of $153,000, the
plaintiffs acknowledged liability to pay penalties of $133,000, and the
plaintiffs acknowledged a continuing
obligation to address defects arising
under the contract and such other obligations as might remain under the
contracts to enable
the work to be completed in a proper and workmanlike
manner.  It was further asserted that in consideration of the entry by the
defendants
into the novated agreement, Mr Joseph Wehbe, on behalf of the
plaintiffs, represented and promised that all defects would be addressed
in
seven to ten days as from 18 May 1995 and that both projects would be brought
to a stage where they were completely free from
defects.  So much was pleaded
in the Amended Defence filed on 14 April 1999, although paragraph 12 was still
admitted.
<P>

44	This led to an oral withdrawal of the admissions in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of
the Defence and to the addition of a further amendment,
whereby it was asserted
that the plaintiffs are estopped and precluded from raising or relying on any
alleged failure to give notice
of the defects under the contracts because both
the proprietor and the builder had so conducted themselves as not to rely on
the
notification provisions of the contracts, save for giving a notice to a
third party lender; and that the plaintiffs waived their
rights to insist on
notice provisions of the contract.  None-the-less the Amended Defence still
admitted paragraphs 5 and 6.
<P>

45	In paragraphs 14 and 15, both of which were admitted, the plaintiffs
asserted that they demanded the return of the May Street
Guarantee "due for
release on 8th June 1995" by letter dated 20 June 1995 and by a conversation on
21 June 1995 with Mr Noel Smith,
and that on 11 July 1995 Rolando and Corbel
procured NAB to pay the whole of the proceeds of those guarantees "which were
appropriated
to the use of Rolando and Corbel".
<P>

46	In paragraph 16 it was pleaded that when that occurred there were no defects
requiring rectification.  The defendants denied
that allegation and said that
when the proceeds were taken by the defendants:-
<P>

	<b>".. there were defects outstanding the cost of rectifying which far
exceeded the sum of the proceeds of the said guarantees, particulars
of which
have been supplied."</b>
<P>

This assertion now has to be viewed in the light of the evidence of Mr Papallo
that he had no idea of the amount necessary to remedy
any defects, and of the
calculation of the amount necessary to remedy defects. 
<P>

47	In paragraph 17 it was pleaded that in the alternative to paragraph 16 if
there were any defects they had not been notified to
the builder by the
architect in accordance with Clause 6.11 of the said contracts, that the
builder was ready, willing and able to
correct any such defects as may have
been notified to the builder in accordance with the terms of the contract; and
that the cost
of correcting any such defects as may have been contained in the
building works would not have exceeded $10,000.  I have noted the
pleadings and
the changed pleadings in relation to this.  I should also note that in the
original Defence, in answer to paragraph
17, the defendants repeated what
appeared in paragraph 8, which raised essentially the same issue as Mr Miller
propounded on 13 April
1999.
<P>

48	In paragraph 18 it was pleaded that Rolando and Corbel, through Mr Papallo,
knew that when the Bank Guarantees were appropriated
the builder was not
indebted to Rolando or Corbel in the sum of $138,961 "or any sum at all"
pursuant to the contracts, and that
neither Rolando nor Corbel had any
entitlement to any of the moneys appropriated from the Bank Guarantees.  This
was denied, it being
asserted that the builder had failed and refused to
rectify defects which had been notified according to the agreement and practice
"the cost of which exceeded the proceeds of the said guarantees".  Rolando and
Corbel did not establish this.
<P>

49	In paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 it was pleaded that the conduct of Rolando and
Corbel constituted a repudiation of the agreement
entered into on 18 May 1995,
in consequence of which repudiation the builder accepted it and terminated the
agreement, and, in consequence
of that termination, the builder is now entitled
to recover the whole of the moneys due under the building contracts.  Certain
consequences
were said to flow from that including a claim for exemplary and/or
aggravated damages against Rolando, Corbel and Mr Papallo.
<P>

50	That claim was pleaded thus:-
<P>

<b>"23.	Further and/or alternatively at all material times Rolando and Corbel
authorised the third defendant (hereafter `Papallo') to
take all action on
their behalf in relation to the said contracts including all action in relation
to the said Bank Guarantees such
that the conduct and intentions of Papallo at
all material times was the conduct and intentions of Rolando and Corbel.</b>
<P>

<b>  24.	Papallo caused the said Bank Guarantees to be appropriated on behalf
of Rolando and Corbel knowing that Rolando and Corbel had
no entitlement to the
proceeds of the said guarantees and the said appropriation of the said
guarantee was fraudulent.</b>
<P>

<b>  25.	By virtue of the matters described in paragraphs 23 and 24 above each
of the defendants displayed a contumelious disregard for
the entitlements of
the builder under the said agreement, the building contracts, and to its
entitlement not to have the proceeds
of the Bank Guarantees appropriated other
than in accordance with the lawful entitlements of Rolando and Corbel.</b>
<P>

<b>  26.	By virtue of the matters pleaded in paragraphs 24 and 25 above each of
the defendants is liable to the plaintiffs for exemplary
and/or aggravated
damages."</b>
<P>

51	On 14 June 1996 the defendants filed a Further Amended Cross-Claim.  In the
nature of the dispute reference was made to the contracts
and the alleged
failure by the builder to carry out and complete the building work as specified
in the contracts or in a good and
workmanlike manner.  It was further asserted
that the builders and Mr Raymond Wehbe had made false and untrue claims for
payment
under the contracts and untrue representations in circumstances
amounting to fraud or to conduct which was misleading or deceptive
pursuant to
ss.52 and 42 of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> and the <b>Fair Trading Act</b>,
and that the defendants relied on the representations and have suffered loss
and damage.  The essential allegations of fraud or
breach of the statutory
obligations were that there were representations made in respect of both
buildings that the ceilings installed
in the top level of the units were one
hour fire rated ceilings in compliance with the requirements of the agreements
and the Building
Code of Australia.  The claim for damages arising from this
alleged conduct included claims for making good the work, the alleged
reduction
in the selling prices of the units "by reason of delayed construction",
increase in advertising costs "by reason of delayed
construction", additional
rates, levies and other outgoings "by reason of delayed construction",
additional fees payable to the project
managers and consultants, and liquidated
damages under Clause 10.14 and Appendix M and Special Condition 69 of the
contracts at the
rate of $6,000 per week in respect of each of the said
agreements.
<P>

52	By the Defence to this Cross-Claim the plaintiffs denied, inter alia, that
the ceilings installed did not comply and asserted
that they were "certified to
be one (1) hour fire rated in accordance with Pioneer Plasta Masta
Specification PS560 by AAA Interiors
Pty Limited dated 24 November 1994".
<P>

53	In paragraph 22 it was pleaded that on 7 December 1994 and 1 March 1995
Hornsby Shire Council approved the works at May Street
and Water Street as in
accordance with the Code, and that possession of May Street and Water Street
was taken on 12 December 1994
and 29 January 1995 respectively.
<P>

54	In paragraph 23 it was pleaded that there was a failure by the defendants to
mitigate their loss because, by letter dated 11
September 1995, Pioneer offered
to rectify the failure to provide fire rated ceilings but the defendants
refused to permit it to
do so; and, on 31 July 1995, Mr Martin Wahbe, a
licensed builder, offered to Mr Papallo that he would rectify all defects
claimed
by him to be then existing, which offer Mr Papallo refused.  According
to Mr Wahbe the refusal was in the context that Mr Papallo
also required
payment of some $10,000 to $12,000 by way of legal costs.
<P>

<b>The Referee's Report</b>
<P>

55	On 7 November 1997 Giles CJCommD ordered, by consent, that Mr Geoffrey
Lumsdaine and Professor Stephen Grubits be appointed as
joint referees,
pursuant to Part 72, to inquire into and report to the Court upon the questions
arising as specified in Schedules
1 and 2.  Those matters were:-

to ceiling and No 5397AC1, as to fire and acoustic upgrading to risers and
ceilings and filed in these proceedings
by the first and second
defendants:-</b>
<P>

<b>  2.1.1	is the appropriate means of rectification; and</b>
<P>

<b>  2.1.2	as to 5397FRI, is in conformity with the recommendations contained
in the report of the CSIRO referred to in Order 1 and CSIRO's
supplementary
report of 7 August 1997.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.2	That the costs of rectification as referred to in the said quotations
are the reasonable costs for rectification.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.3	That if the means of rectifying such defects are not appropriate, or
as to 5397FRI, in conformity with the said CSIRO report
and supplementary
report then:-</b>
<P>

<b>  2.3.1	what means of rectifying such defects is appropriate? and</b>
<P>

<b>  2.3.2	as to 5397FRI is in conformity with the CSIRO report and
supplementary report."</b>
<P>

56	The Referees reported on 10 August 1998.  The report was adopted by the
Court, by consent, on 28 August 1998, on which date the
proceedings against the
fourth defendant were, by consent, dismissed.
<P>

57	The report noted that the major items were related to work required to
attain the standards of fire resistance construction required
for the types of
building under the Building Code of Australia.  The Referees continued:-
<P>

	<b>"By the terms of reference, as interpreted by the parties, we were required
to report only on methodology and quantification.  Accordingly
it was
considered appropriate to work with the parties' experts, and a number of
conclaves were held by the Referees with various
groups of experts, culminating
in the submission of joint reports.  Consensus was reached on the majority of
items, and we adopt
and set out below such agreed findings.</b>
<P>

<b>	The findings are based on methodologies and related quantum on which the
experts agreed and which we found appropriate to adopt.
 The agreements
expressly excluded questions of liability."</b>
<P>

58	The Referees dealt firstly with defects other than fire rating items and
concluded that the amount payable in respect of such
items, including the
builder's fee, was $9,411 in respect of May Street and $26,649 in respect of
Water Street giving a total of
$36,060.
<P>

59	The Referees dealt nextly with extras and variations, which were found in
respect of May Street to be $59,569 and in respect
of Water Street to be
$46,707 giving a total of $106,276.
<P>

60	In Section 3 of the Report the Referees considered preliminaries,
administration and builder's fee.  They came to certain conclusions
and, in
Section 4, dealt with the acoustic requirements and roof space installation.
They found that certain elements of the construction
did not, as agreed by the
experts, achieve the necessary acoustic rating as required under the Building
Code of Australia and that
roof space insulation had not been put in place,
although there was a dispute as to whether that was a contractual requirement.
They
concluded that the amount required to rectify the acoustic rating problem
was $29,903.80, and the amount to provide roof insulation
was $11,584.10, if it
was required.
<P>

61	In Section 5 the Referees turned to fire rating related items and held that
the construction of both buildings fell short of
the requirements of the
Building Code of Australia in this respect and that a reasonable strategy for
achieving compliance was developed
through a series of conclaves, which
resulted in a joint report of 18 May 1998, which was annexed to the Referees'
Report.  In paragraph
5.3 the Referees stated:-
<P>

	<b>"As it affects the fourth defendant, we note that the ceiling problems
relate to the installation of the plaster board ceiling system
as distinct from
the plaster board ceiling system itself.  We find that the ceiling system
complied with the BCA current at the time
the ceilings were installed in the
May Street and Water Street buildings."</b>
<P>

They concluded that the reasonable costs of carrying out the work in relation
to May Street was $36,995.06 and in relation to Water
Street was $36,196.66
giving a total of $73,191.72.
<P>

62	In Section 6 they summarised the findings which showed that, subject to a
determination of issues of liability, there was a total
amount payable by the
plaintiffs to the defendants of $238,230 and a total amount payable by the
defendants to the plaintiffs of
$106,276, leaving a difference of approximately
$133,000 in favour of the defendants.
<P>

<b>Certain Essential Issues</b>
<P>

63	Notwithstanding that the submissions ranged over a number of topic there
were, in my opinion, several fundamental issues the
determination of which will
essentially resolve this case.  Firstly, it is necessary to determine what the
agreement of 18 May 1995
means, what its significance is, whether it was
lawfully terminated and, if it was, the effect of that.  Secondly, it is
necessary
to consider whether Rolando and Corbel are entitled to recover a
large amount of damages for delay in selling the units allegedly
caused by
delay of the builder and defects in the buildings.  Thirdly, it is necessary to
decide whether the parties are entitled
to the amounts found by the Referees.
Finally, the question of aggravated and/or exemplary damages must be addressed.
Before considering
these matters I propose to consider certain evidence.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Robert Luke Murray</b>
<P>

64	Mr Robert Luke Murray, who is a registered valuer by profession, swore
affidavits on 2 August 1996 and 1 April 1999.  He supplemented
his evidence by
a statement of 14 April 1999, which became Exhibit C.
<P>

65	Mr Murray has had substantial experience in valuing properties, particularly
in and around Hornsby, and in his report of 24 July
1996 he described the two
properties and the course of the contractual relations between the parties.
Under the heading "Defects"
he said that he inspected both blocks of units
externally and a number of the units internally on 10 July 1996 and found the
defects
ranged from minor items "to the usual maintenance items which appear in
new buildings".  He observed that both owners were claiming
financial loss from
the builder due to the extra costs caused by the alleged defects, the extended
building/marketing periods and
the purported diminution in value to the units.
He considered the course of construction and said, without objection, to have
such
projects completed with exhaustive lists of defects indicated a lack of
project supervision and:-
<P>

	<b>"Had the project been inspected on a day to day basis, quality control
would have prevailed and the finished product would have been
ready for sale
without delay.  All new buildings of this calibre are subject to some
maintenance items after they are completed due
to the drying out of the
structure and the expansion and contraction which subsequently takes
place."</b>
<P>

The last sentence did not seem to be in issue and when I consider the Scott
Schedule, in due course, it will appear that a number
of matters fell into this
category.
<P>

66	Mr Murray nextly dealt with the economy and stated that the Sydney
residential real estate market has been basically in recession
since December
1988, and that the period during the construction and marketing/selling of the
subject units was not strong due mainly
to the lack of buyer confidence and
competition from other new blocks of units.  He considered the economy, the
sale prices achieved
and the competition from other two-bedroom home unit
developments in the vicinity of the subject properties, and said:-
<P>

	<b>"Sales of new two-bedroom home units in this section of Hornsby range from
between approximately $190,000 to $225,000 depending upon
location, aspect,
size, accommodation and parking arrangements.</b>
<P>

<b>	The sales achieved in both blocks, apart from the `internal' sales, are in
line with the market conditions prevailing at the time."</b>
<P>

No objection was taken to this statement and Mr Murray's evidence satisfied me
that it is correct.  Indeed it was barely challenged.
 The reference to
"internal sales" was to sales to unit holders in the trusts.
<P>

67	He expressed the conclusion that based on market evidence of new two-bedroom
home units in the Hornsby area alleged defects "have
not detrimentally affected
the value of the subject units as their sale prices are in line with other new
units".  He was of the
view that the main defect items, which could have
possibly affected marketing/sales, were the cracking of the concrete floor in
the
garaging areas and poorly patched mortar in the common areas.  However, he
observed that the acceptance of the units by virtue of
their sale prices, which
were in line with other new two-bedroom home units in the immediate locality,
showed that the market was
not concerned by that matter, and he concluded:-
<P>

	<b>"The cause of the problem between the Owners and the Builder stems from the
lack of progress supervision.  Had the Owners representative
supervised the
construction of these blocks this situation would not have occurred.  Funds for
the Builder during construction could
have been held up until any defects or
problems were rectified.  To present an exhaustive defect list after completion
indicates
either poor building supervision practice or pettiness by the
Owners.</b>
<P>

<b>	In my opinion there is no diminution in value to these units caused by the
alleged defects."</b>
<P>

I also accept this evidence.  Mr Murray was a very well qualified expert.
<P>

68	In the report annexed to his affidavit of 1 April 1999 Mr Murray dealt, at
some length, with the report of Mr Edmonds.  I shall
refer to his comments in
relation to that when I consider Mr Edmonds' evidence.  In Exhibit C Mr Murray
considered the report of
Ms Colleen Coyne dated 13 April 1999 and I shall
consider that when I come to her affidavit.
<P>

69	Although Mr Murray was cross-examined at some length I am satisfied that he
was not only an honest and reliable witness, who
was well qualified to express
his opinions, but that his evidence was supported by the probabilities.  I
therefore accept it.
<P>

70	The defendants' cross-claim is based, in large part, upon assertions that
the consequence of the delay in completing the units
and of the defects was,
firstly, that the units were being sold at a less favourable time, it not being
seriously in issue that the
market was beginning to become more difficult for
sales towards the end of 1994 by virtue, inter alia, of the increase in
interest
rates and greater competition from more home units; and, secondly,
that the defects were such as to cause potential buyers not to
proceed with the
purchase of units.  There are, in my opinion, a number of matters which
establish that these allegations have not
been made out.
<P>

71	Firstly, in May 1995, Mr Papallo, who, in my opinion, was an astute
businessman and property developer, was prepared to accept
from the plaintiffs,
albeit by way of a compromise settlement, $133,000 for penalties.  I have no
doubt that if Mr Papallo had any
valid reason for believing that the claim was
substantially in excess of that amount, as opposed to asserting it, he would
not have
settled on that basis.
<P>

72	Secondly, I accept the evidence of Mr Murray that such defects as appeared
were not such as to cause prospective purchasers not
to buy and his further
evidence that the sales were at prices in line with the sale price for
comparable units.  There was an exception
to this, namely the "internal sales",
but it was not suggested that these should be taken into account.  Mr Murray's
evidence received
the strongest corroboration from the evidence of Mr Barry
Hudson, who is a very experienced real estate agent and has been, at all
material times, the manager of Ray White Real Estate at Hornsby.  Mr Hudson
swore three affidavits, one on 18 August 1995 and two
on 9 April 1999.  In his
first affidavit he referred to various letters he had written to the trustees,
which he said accurately
and frankly set out the position as he saw it.  Mr
Hudson's agency had a sole agency agreement for the sale of these units and, so
far as I can see, there is absolutely no reason why any letter written by him
would not disclose to the owners all relevant matters
in relation to their
sale.  Indeed, it would be contrary to his interests to conceal any matter
which made it difficult to sell the
units and, in quite voluminous
correspondence with the trustees and Mr Papallo, he pointed out how the sales'
programmes were proceeding.
 This correspondence has to be viewed in the light
of assertions by Mr Hudson that had the properties been available for sale
earlier
and had they not suffered from defects, they would have sold more
quickly and at better prices.  In my opinion the effect of the
contemporaneous
correspondence is to show that this evidence is not to be accepted and, in
fairness to Mr Hudson, he agreed on three
occasions in cross-examination,
Tpp.205, 209 and 210 that the appearance of the home units made no difference
to the ability to sell
them.
<P>

73	On 29 June 1994 Mr Hudson wrote to Mr Papallo concerning May Street.  He
confirmed the proposed completion date and the marketing
strategy for the
project.  He noted that the completion date was expected to be around the end
of September 1994, subject to weather
conditions, and said that based on this
estimated date and provided the main entrance and the individual entrances to
all the units
were finished, landscaped, and totally free of building material
etc, thus providing a good clean access from the street, it was
his
recommendation that a "display unit" be made ready and the full marketing
programme commence four weeks prior to the date of
completion.  He said that
meant the gala "open for inspection" weekend should be scheduled to commence on
3 and 4 September 1994.
 He did not suggest that that date would cause any
difficulty in effecting sales.
<P>

74	He referred to the fact that there were several other home unit projects
currently under construction in the immediate area,
but said:-
<P>

	<b>"However, your project at 6-10 May Street, has a substantial advantage over
all the other competitive projects in so far as `May Lea'
has a superior
location, proven design, larger individual unit size and above all, quality of
finishing and fittings."</b>
<P>

75	He regarded another major factor favouring the project as being that it
would be completed some two to three months ahead of
any other unit project
that would impose any direct competition.  He discounted competition from 5-7
Water Street and furnished certain
further information about other projects in
the area.  He expressed the view that those should not pose any direct
competition to
May Street for various reasons and concluded:-
<P>

	<b>"Although no written guarantee can be given, we strongly believe, if priced
and marketed correctly, your units 6-10 May Street should
sell without
hesitation, as not only have you produced what we consider to be `the best
Units ever built in Hornsby' but certainly
the best Units that will be on the
market at that time.</b>
<P>

<b>	We already have a number of enquiries from potential buyers showing
interest in the project subject to price and an inspection of
the finished
product."</b>
<P>

76	On 10 November 1994 Mr Hudson wrote confirming a telephone conversation and
documenting details in respect of activity at the
May Street units.  He
recorded that the official opening was held on the weekend of 29 and 30 October
1994 and that some thirty five
groups of people inspected, although he noted a
number were neighbours rather than actual buyers.  Despite that he was pleased
to
report that the comments from the majority of these people "were extremely
complimentary of the Unit Project in general terms and
specifically in respect
to size, design, location and in particular the outstanding quality".  These
are hardly the remarks to be
attributed to units being put forward which
evidenced substantial and disabling defects, such as to make them difficult to
sell.
<P>

77	The letter continued that there was more enquiry the following week and:-
<P>

	<b>"As you are aware, total completion of the project is approximately some
two weeks away, thus making the presentation of the complex
and the individual
Units more desirable as completion grows nearer."</b>
<P>

He noted that in respect of ten units contracts had either been issued,
exchanged or there were negotiations in train, and that
he was "extremely
pleased" with the results of the campaign "and confidently expect the same
positive results to continue over the
next few weeks".
<P>

78	It seems to me it would be utterly impossible for Mr Hudson to have written
a letter in those terms if the difficulties in selling
the units about which
Rolando and Corbel complained existed.  A real reason for the problem emerged
in his letter to the trustees
of 31 January 1995.  He reported that thirteen
units had either been sold or retained by the trust, and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Unfortunately since the latter part of November and, up to and including
the present date there has been a substantial reduction
in buyer inquiry with
much fewer people attending the `open for inspection' period, thus resulting in
only a couple of additional
sales since the last report.</b>
<P>

<b>	However, on review of previous years the trend has been exactly the same
with December and January being extremely quiet with buyer
inquiry and
subsequent sales showing a positive increase and the market returning back to
normal from about mid February.</b>
<P>

<b>	We feel there is no reason why this year should be any different to
previous years and expect a reasonable recovery in inquiry and
sales to take
place within the next few weeks."</b>
<P>

He said that everything was being done which was "humanly possible to ensure
that this project is being positively promoted in every
respect".
<P>

79	On 16 March 1995 he wrote to Mr Papallo advising that thirteen of the twenty
eight units had been sold and that there had been
a number of inspections by
potential buyers of several others.  He continued:-
<P>

	<b>"As mentioned to you during our conversation there are a number of other
new unit developments currently on the market for sale with
prices ranging from
high $190's to early $200's thus giving a far greater choice to any potential
buyer to view and select from.
 However, the proven formula of size, aspect and
<u>quality of finish</u> in your project is not only proving superior to the
competition but is enabling us to achieve substantially higher sale prices."
(My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

80	In so far as Mr Hudson asserted that he made oral complaints about quality
to Mr Papallo, but did not commit them to writing
because the letters would go
to other people, this letter is extraordinary.  It may be understood that the
letters to the trustees
may go to others, but in this case Mr Hudson was
writing to Mr Papallo, and advising him, in glowing terms, of the quality of
finish.
 His enthusiasm was such that he continued:-
<P>

	<b>"As you no doubt will remember the `May Glen' development was extremely
successful, not only in the market place, but because of aforesaid
formula we
were able to achieve an additional $17,785.75 per unit up and above the nearest
competition.</b>
<P>

<b>	It is our opinion that the same will apply to the current projects at 6-10
May Street and 8-12 Water Street."</b>
<P>

81	On 5 April 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees advising "with regret" that
there was no change to the previous sale report,
and noting that weekly
inspection numbers had become totally unpredictable and were changing
substantially from one week to the next.
This provided another reason for the
drop in sales. He continued:-
<P>

	<b>"<u>Even though the majority of the people inspecting the units praise this
project</u> and, in many cases have inspected several times previously, they
are still very hesitant and not prepared to commit themselves, with
the lack of
confidence and the overwhelming concern that interest rates may continue to
rise like they did in 1989-90 being given
as the main reason.</b>
<P>

<b>	This factor is not only effecting (sic) the `May Lea' project but has
effected (sic) every other unit development in the Hornsby
area, with very few
new unit sales being made during and over the past four to six weeks.  The lack
of sales is not only confined
to the `May Lea' style of project but includes
the projects with units that are priced substantially cheaper than ours.</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>We therefore believe that until such time as general confidence is
restored and a clear indication that interest rates will remain
stable, the
above situation may continue at least until the May budget is
announced</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>	Perhaps in the immediate future you may consider the possibility of renting
out a few selected units which can still be sold to investors
at any stage and,
in the interim, would assist you in recovering some of the holding charges."
(My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

82	On 18 May 1995 a further letter was sent by Mr Hudson to the trustees noting
that since the last report two units had been sold
and negotiations were
continuing in relation to another.  The letter concluded that it was Mr
Hudson's belief that if "this newly
found confidence continues to grow, in
particular amongst the investor buyers, we should see a substantial increase in
inquiry for
these units thus resulting in subsequent sales".
<P>

83	On 6 June 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees noting the lack of interest
in the units and that advertising was not attracting
buyers "generally"
irrespective of the type of real estate being promoted.  He confirmed "that
there is still a lack of confidence
amongst the buying public".  He said
that:-
<P>

	<b>".. We feel certain that the recent announcement by the banks of a further
drop in home loan interest rates will assist greatly and
instil some confidence
back into the market, which, in turn, should result in a steady increase in
inquiries for these units."</b>
<P>

84	On 15 August 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees stating that it was not
possible to report any further "definite sales", although
there were some
negotiations in progress.  The letter stated that weekly inspections were still
continuing and:-
<P>

	<b>"During the past six weeks or so there has been some five or six new units
sold in the area.  These sales have been made only after
substantial reduction
in price of all these units with the contract prices ending up at $186,000,
$195,000, $199,000, $201,000, $203,000
and $205,000.</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>It is very obvious that the current buying public has acknowledge (sic)
the downturn in the market (in other words the current market
is a buyer's
market) and expects to be able to negotiate a substantial amount off the asking
price and buy under their terms</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>	Please rest assured that we are doing everything humanly possible to
encourage potential buyers to purchase a unit in this project.
 <u>We do
however, point out that the market has dramatically changed (for the worse)
since we started marketing this project</u>."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

85	On 11 September 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees confirming that
following telephone discussions and a meeting on 23 August
1995 the asking
price tag had been removed from each of the unsold units and, during the last
two week period, Mr Hudson had been
promoting the units without a specific
asking price and inviting offers over $205,000.  The letter stated that as a
result of "this
positive move" contracts had been issued on three units at
$213,980, $213,000 and $210,870.  The letter repeated that the buying
public
recognised that the market "is still very much a buyer's market" and that
purchasers would only buy "after they are totally
satisfied that they have
obtained good value".
<P>

86	On 30 October 1995 he wrote to the trustees in relation to May Street.  He
said that two new blocks of units had come on to the
market and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"As you are aware, when these two complexes first came on the market some
weeks ago their two bedroom units were being offered `for
Sale' around the
$200,000 to $210,000 bracket, however, due to the lack of activity during this
time they have in turn both slashed
their prices dramatically with 2 two
bedroom units now being advertised for $155,000 and $169,000
respectively.</b>
<P>

<b>	Even though there are only a few units available at these ridiculous prices
the balance of their units including the `better ones'
can be purchased between
$180,000 and $195,000 making it extremely difficult for us to compete in the
market when there is a price
difference of approximately $25,000 in the asking
price.</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Although the majority of people inspecting the May Street units agree
that these units are of a better quality and location they find
it hard to
accept the price difference.  Subsequently, the only offers we are receiving
are those in the vicinity of $190,000 or
thereabouts</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>	Therefore, if these units are to be sold in this current market it appears
that you will have to be prepared to accept an end sale
price of between
$190,000 to $195,000.  However, as an alternative to sacrificing them now at
silly prices you may consider the possibility
of renting out the balance and
wait until the market recovers at which time they can be put back on the market
to achieve sale prices
similar to those accepted in the early stages.</b>
<P>

<b>	Although we are keen to see these units sold now it seems a shame for you
to be forced into a situation of disposing the remainder
at prices well below
what we consider to be their true value, given the right market, and, in doing
so we further believe that you
may undermine all the good you have done in the
Hornsby area to date."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

87	This letter is totally inconsistent with any suggestion that the May Street
units were not selling other than for the reason
that the market had taken a
severe downturn, and with any suggestion that the presentation of the units or
the delay in marketing
them was hampering their sale.  It was this letter which
stimulated the letter from Mr Papallo to the trustees of 31 October 1995,
which
stated:-
<P>

	<b>"This confirms our verbal advice to you over recent months that Corbel has
two clear choices, being:</b>
<P>

<b>	1.	Meeting the market; or</b>
<P>

<b>	2.	Refinancing, holding and remarketing in twelve to eighteen months
time.</b>
<P>

<b>	The second option is our recommendation as rental returns will more or less
cover interest costs thus allowing the situation to be
put on `hold' until the
market rationalises itself.  Having seen `forward-market' reports that are in
your possession, holding and
remarketing in the future can only but be a huge
advantage when compared to meeting the market now."</b>
<P>

88	On 29 June 1994 Mr Hudson wrote to Mr Papallo in relation to Water Street
noting that it was expected that subject to weather
conditions completion would
be effected around the end of November or early December 1994.  On this basis
he suggested a gala "open
for inspection" weekend scheduled to commence on 12
and 13 November 1994, and he stated that the project had a unique advantage
over
all other projects because it had been designed around and took advantage
of a newly created landscaped park, which in turn provided
uninterrupted views
to the majority of the units.  He continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The other major factor in your favour is that this project boasts a proven
internal design, larger individual unit size but above
all, the project is
being built by an established and well respected builder who has a proven track
record in providing nothing but
the highest standard of quality and
finish.</b>
<P>

<b>	At the time `Park Court Garden' is programme (sic) for completion, there
should be very few other new units completed and available
for sale that will
create any competition to the sale of these units.</b>
<P>

<b>	One thing is for sure there will be no other units on the market at the
time that have their own park-like environment or offer the
views these units
will enjoy."</b>
<P>

89	On 9 March 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees in relation to Water Street.
The letter reflected that there had been a downturn
in the market and that
there was competition from other new unit developers "thus giving a far greater
choice to any potential buyer
to view and select from".  Mr Hudson pointed out
the problems and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"However, in our opinion, the 8-12 Water Street development is
substantially superior to any of it's (sic) competition, not only in
design
<u>and quality</u> but has the distinct advantage of adjoining and overlooking
the newly created park which is now starting to look superb.</b>
<P>

<b>	Notwithstanding all the above, you may recall a similar situation occurring
in the early months of 1993 whilst marketing the complex
at 2-4 May Street.
Once again there was a substantial decline in inspections and immediate sales
in the May Street complex when three
other blocks of units were released on to
the market simultaneously, at considerably lower and discounted prices.</b>
<P>

<b>	However, you may also recall that after a settling period of time, combined
with the continuing perseverance of our marketing campaign,
the inquiry and
subsequent sales of the better quality units strengthened bringing to a
successful conclusion the marketing of 2-4
  May Street Hornsby.  Not only did
the better quality unit ultimately win out but the average sale price achieved
throughout "May
Glen" was some $17,000 higher per unit that (sic) nearest
competitor."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

90	On 5 April 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees in respect of Water Street
stating that the problems confronting the sales were
lack of confidence and the
overwhelming concern that interest rates may continue to rise as they did in
1989-1990.  The letter continued:-
<P>

	<b>"This factor is not only affecting the `Park View Court' project but has
effected (sic) every other unit development in the Hornsby
area, with very few
unit sales being made during and over the past four to six weeks.  The lack of
sales is not only confined to
the `Park View Court' style of project but
includes the projects with units that are priced substantially cheaper than
ours."</b>
<P>

91	On 18 May 1995 Mr Hudson again wrote to the trustees in respect of Water
Street stating that there had been some return of confidence
and, on 6 June
1995, he reported to them that advertising was not attracting buyers, although
the likelihood of the drop in home
loan interest rates would probably greatly
assist the market and instil some confidence in it.
<P>

92	On11 September 1995 Mr Hudson wrote to the trustees in the same terms as the
letter to the trustees of Rolando of the same date.
<P>

93	Mr Hudson was cross-examined about the letters he had written and he said,
Tp.204, that the letters were providing advice on
matters which he thought the
proprietors should take into account in selling the units and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And you would have also considered it important, if you thought that
some aspect of the presentation of the units called for attention
to mention
that to them?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That is also correct, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. In particular, if you considered that the appearance or condition of the
building was having a detrimental effect on the selling
programme, that is
something that you would have pointed out in your reports to the
proprietors?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Not necessarily in the report, more so in letters when the defects were
brought up more so than the actual errors."</b>
<P>

94	Mr Hudson said he notified defects, which he expected would have been
attended to, although he said he did not report on defects
necessarily in his
reports.  However, Tp.205, he continued:-
<P>

<b>"Q. If it had been the case that over a period of months the marketing of
the block would have been hindered or impaired by its appearance,
then that
would have been a crucial matter for you to record in your report to the
proprietors?</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>	<b>A. That's correct, yes."</b>
<P>

95	This answer is totally inconsistent with the suggestion that there were
continuing and unresolved defects in the buildings, which
precluded their being
sold, and with his failure to note any such conditions.
<P>

96	He was taken through the correspondence in relation to May Street and
referred to the words "outstanding quality", and he said
that as at the date of
his letter of 29 June 1994 he was satisfied that May Street was of outstanding
quality for marketing and he
did not consider that anything so far as the
physical state or condition of the buildings needed to be drawn to the
proprietors'
attention in accordance with the report.  He agreed, Tp.206, that
in November 1994 there were no difficulties inhibiting or preventing
the
effective sale of May Street.  All his advertising was consistent with this.
He was referred to the correspondence in early 1995
where he attributed the
failure to sell to the time of the year, and to the letter in March 1995 where
he observed that the proven
formula of size, aspect and quality of finish was
not only proving superior to the competition, but was enabling him to achieve
substantially
higher sale prices.  He agreed, Tp.207, that he was not
experiencing any difficulty with the presentation of May Street through defects
or incomplete building "or anything of that sort", and that in relation to the
insides of the units the quality of finish was superior
to the competition and
to that point the outside of the buildings was not having an effect on the
marketing programme.
<P>

97	He agreed that by mid-1995 the market had deteriorated and, Tp.208, that the
letters he wrote to his clients frankly and accurately
set out the position as
he saw it in relation to the units, and that he did not conceal anything from
them. 
<P>

98	He was asked whether it would have been important to draw to the
proprietors' attention a shabby or poor appearance or presentation
to which he
replied that he was dealing with Rolando as the trustees and with Mr Papallo as
the project manager "and I did verbally
on many occasions talk to him about
some of the things that I would like to have seen done; not in the reports".
He referred to several
units which he was unable to open "as time went on", but
he said that matter was fixed.
<P>

99	At Tp.209 he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. The position is that in the first half of 1995, you never had cause to
tell the proprietors that their marketing programme was
impaired by the
appearance or presentation of the block?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. No, not the trustees.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. The reason you didn't tell the trustees was because there was not a
problem with marketing presentation?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. I guess I have to accept that, yes."</b>
<P>

100	He was then taken to the Water Street property and, once again, he agreed
that he did not, in his letters, report to the trustees
in relation to Water
Street that the marketing programme was being impaired or harmed by the
appearance of the units or the existence
of defects: Tp.210.  His advertising
was consistent with this.
<P>

101	At Tp.210 he said, in relation to May Street:-
<P>

<b>"Q. And you give advice at the bottom of that regarding whether or not they
should continue to leave the units on the market or withdraw
them?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That is also correct, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. And this is the case, isn't it, that the reason that you advised them to
withdraw those units from the market was because you
considered the market at
that stage was over supplied?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Well, that is exactly right, and also the deterioration of the market
had taken place.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Did you receive that instruction to withdraw the units?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Yes."</b>
<P>

102	He also became concerned about the legal proceedings in September 1995, and
he was cross-examined about paragraph 21 of his
affidavit in which he said that
because of problems caused to the sales and marketing programme associated with
ceiling defects and
non-compliance, he advised Mr Papallo and the trustees to
consider letting the units.  It was suggested to him that answer was false
and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. You didn't suggest that they take them off the market because of
problems with the ceilings, you advised them to take them off
the market
because of the over supply?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. It was a combination of both.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Well, I think you have agreed it would have been sufficient in itself
just to have over supply as a reason to take them off?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Well, it was not the intention of that.  It was the intention of both,
because there certainly was an over supply and a deterioration
of the market,
but when this was made aware to me, it made sense at that time that it would be
very difficult to proceed with sales,
when the market was hard, number one,
and, two, there was a problem that at that time could not be explained."</b>
<P>

His letter of 30 October 1995 made it clear that his reasons for suggesting the
units be taken off the market was concerned only
with the state of the real
estate market.  Further, he agreed that before the ceiling issue was resolved
the units were returned
to the market.
<P>

103	At Tp.210 it was put to Mr Hudson that in relation to Water Street the
marketing programme was not being affected or impaired
by the existence of
defects with which he said he would have to agree.  In re-examination he said
he complained to Mr Papallo about
some cosmetic defects.
<P>

104	At Tp.213 he said there was no mention in any of the letters to a poor
presentation because they were going to other people,
and it was not
necessarily in their interest, he believed, to know the ins and outs "of that
part".  This answer was totally inconsistent
with the evidence he had given
earlier about the need for frankness and accuracy, and with what he had written
and much of his oral
evidence.  It was evidence which did him no credit at all,
and, as I have observed, did not correspond with his advertising, which
emphasised the high quality of the units.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Ms Colleen Coyne</b>
<P>

105	Ms Colleen Coyne is a director of LandMark White (NSW) Pty Limited, which
is a property research valuation and consultancy practice.
 She is its National
Research Manager and a Master of Urban and Regional Planning, a Corporate
Member of the Royal Australian Planning
Institute, a Member of the Urban Land
Institute, a Member of the Australian Population Association and a Member of
the Australian
Institute of Urban Studies.  She does not hold any
qualifications in relation to valuation matters.  In her affidavit of 13 April
1999 she said she had been instructed to comment upon Mr Murray's report of 26
March 1999:-
<P>

	<b>".. in relation to the issues of the Hornsby real estate home unit market
and the economic and property cycle for the same periods
as referred to by Mr
Murray."</b>
<P>

106	In her report, which is Annexure "A" to her affidavit, she described her
knowledge of the Hornsby residential unit market during
1994 and 1995, which
arose from her having prepared two separate reports in respect of the new
residential unit market in Hornsby,
the first in about December 1994 and the
second in about May 1995.  She researched these reports by examining all new
projects of
ten units or more, visiting units and talking with local agents.
She said that from her knowledge and experience of the Sydney Metropolitan
and
Hornsby residential unit markets, she came to a different understanding of the
economic and property cycle from that described
by Mr Murray.  She
continued:-
<P>

	<b>"I believe that by late 1993, when the building contracts were let, the
economy was in recovery from the recession of the early 1990's
and the
residential unit market was entering a period of buoyant demand."</b>
<P>

She then referred to unemployment and attached to her report certain graphs.

<P>

107	Under the heading "Hornsby Unit Market" she referred to graph 4, which she
said showed trends in the number of total residential
unit sales and median
prices for the Hornsby Local Government area.  She continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The graph reflects sales at the date of settlement, that is, when
pre-sales are made during construction, they appear in the graph
at the time
the building has completed.  It shows a new peak of 187 sales in the June
quarter 1994 at a median price of $192,000.
 This probably coincided with the
completion of the first round of new supply in the Hornsby suburb.  The second
half of 1994 saw
a gradual decline in activity and a dip in median prices, with
the first and second quarters of 1995 being the lowest since the June
quarter
1993.  The resurgence in the September quarter 1995 may reflect settlement of
new stock in the Hornsby suburb as buildings
had completed.  From this time
onwards prices were flat until the over supplies in the market were
absorbed."</b>
<P>

108	She then dealt in more detail with her analysis of the research carried out
in December 1994, in which research she included
May Street and Water Street.
She said May Street had recently completed and the agent was reporting twelve
units sold with the average
asking price of the remaining units being $225,900.
She observed that the building at Water Street had just commenced marketing at
prices from $224,000 to $232,000 and was under construction.
<P>

109	However, by the time of her May 1995 research she found that market
conditions "had noticeably deteriorated, with evidence of
projects discounting
to effect sales".
<P>

110	She continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The market was effected by the higher interest rates and by the increased
availability of units for sale.  I identified 195 units
in ten low rise
projects being marketed in the Hornsby suburb.  Of these, approximately 57%
were reported sold.</b>
<P>

<b>	The number of units under construction, but not marketed as at May 1995 was
75 units in four buildings, with a further 239 units
in thirteen developments
proposed, with DA approved or lodged.</b>
<P>

<b>	In summary, the Hornsby low rise unit market had experienced buoyant
conditions during 1994, with 502 recorded sales, and evidence
of rising median
prices.  During 1995, sales activity declined noticeably and median prices
fell.  There was evidence of discounting
occurring as at May 1995, and it was
considered that further discounting would be required to sell out remaining
stock in low rise
buildings.  There was evidence of developers not putting
buildings into the market, but renting them instead.  The rental market
appeared to be quite strong.  I consider that over supply conditions were
likely to characterise the Hornsby unit market for some
time, particularly if
all of the proposed developments were to proceed.</b>
<P>

<b>	I am of the opinion that had the subject buildings been completed to the
schedule originally envisaged (by late 1994), they would
have caught the market
while it was still relatively buoyant, before the downturn in 1995."</b>
<P>

111	Ms Coyne's evidence is not relevantly in conflict with that of Mr Murray
and Mr Hudson.  She observed the downturn, which is
well illustrated in graph
4, but where, in my opinion, she fell into error, was that she assumed,
contrary to the fact, that May
Street and Water Street were not completed by
late 1994.  The evidence of Mr Hudson makes it clear that they were being
actively
marketed with success at that stage, but that they suffered from the
quiet period over the Christmas/New Year time and  the subsequent
downturn in
the market.
<P>

112	In her oral evidence in chief Ms Coyne said that the third and fourth
graphs had some bearing on the Hornsby market, her view
being that the most
telling material was that in relation to the low rise unit market in the
Central Hornsby area during 1994 and
1995.  She confirmed, Tp.163, that there
was a decline in the second half of 1994, and that the Christmas/New Year
period is one
of a traditional downturn in the market.
<P>

113	At Tpp.164-165 she was asked to assume that May Street would have been
completed in or about 17 September 1994 and Water Street
in or about
mid-November 1994 and, on those assumptions, what the likely or available
market would have been.  She replied:-
<P>

	<b>"When I visited in December 1994, the agents were reporting back to me;
still strong buying conditions.  In fact, during the latter
part of 1994, some
developments were still increasing prices and there was still quite a lot of
units coming through, with some under
construction not yet marketing, and a
further 200 units were either with developers' approval or applications before
Council.</b>
<P>

<b>	So I would conclude that as at the end of 1994, even then there was some
impact from the interest rates in the general market.  The
Hornsby local market
was still strong and I think Mr Murray referred earlier to a shortage of units
in the Hornsby market.  That
was probably still driving demand from both
investors and owner/occupiers after modestly priced products close to the
railway station
and shopping centre."</b>
<P>

All of this, as I would understand it, is completely consistent with what Mr
Hudson was finding.
<P>

114	Ms Coyne was then asked when the market went into decline and she said that
was in the early part of 1995 and certainly by May
1995 market conditions had
deteriorated markedly.  She added that given the weaker buying conditions and
increase in supply, it had
become a very competitive market by 1995.  By that
she meant it was a buyers' market.
<P>

115	At Tp.167 Ms Coyne said that from 1993 through to 1995 prices remained
fairly flat in the sense that there was not much price
growth, but it was a
buoyant period in terms of market activity and demand.  She said that by May
1995 discounting to the extent
of some 5% was occurring.
<P>

116	Whilst it may be correct to say that there was some difference, at least of
emphasis, between Mr Murray and Ms Coyne I do not
consider this to be
significant.  Ms Coyne's evidence made it clear that had the units come on the
market towards the end of 1994,
which they did, they would have experienced the
advantage of a reasonably buoyant market.  This was totally consistent with the
evidence
of Mr Hudson and, in my opinion, not inconsistent with the evidence of
Mr Murray.  Thereafter the market faced the problem, firstly,
of the
Christmas/New Year downturn which appears to happen each year, and, more
importantly, the loss of buyer and investor confidence
brought about by fiscal
problems, such as interest rates.  The simple fact, in my opinion, is that the
sale of the units in these
projects, which started at about the time
anticipated, was caught up in these two problems.  The evidence, in my opinion,
is all
one way on this and I am not satisfied that the inability to sell the
units resulted from either defects in them or any delay.  It
resulted from
circumstances totally beyond the control of either the plaintiffs or the
defendants, but for which, in my opinion,
the defendants are now seeking to
make the plaintiffs responsible.  In my view they have failed on the evidence
to establish any
such responsibility.  As I have said this matter is further
highlighted by the agreement reached on 18 May 1995 when penalties were
decided
at $133,000.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Philip Edmonds</b>
<P>

117	Mr Philip Edmonds swore affidavits on 6 May 1996 and 2 March 1999.  He is a
registered valuer and accountant in private practice
and has had extensive
experience in real estate development, real estate marketing, and valuation.
He prepared a report, which was
annexed to his affidavit of 6 May 1996.  He
dealt, in that report, with the defects he saw in both blocks of units as a
result of
his inspections on 2 November 1995, 10 January 1996 and 10 April
1996.  He was of the view that the attempted rectification of some
of the
defects had left a continuing defect in the construction of the building, and
that the defects and the poor attempts at rectification
of some of them
reflected on both the value and saleability of the units.
<P>

118	At p.8 of his report he noted that on 17 August 1994 the Reserve Bank
raised official cash interest rates by .75 per cent, which
was followed by
further increases of 1 per cent on 24 October 1994 and 1 per cent on 14
December 1994.  He stated these increases
were in response to concerns that the
rate of growth of the Australian economy evident in 1994 was not sustainable
and also that
dwelling construction and business investment were at
unsustainable levels.
<P>

119	He considered the list price for the units, the averages for May Street
being $226,750 and for Water Street being $216,592.
<P>

120	He noted that according to the agent the units in both the buildings "as
planned" were substantially superior to any other new
units available in the
locality at the time, and he considered that there were features which
warranted a price premium for them.
 He said that the list prices reflected the
higher quality of the units and were considered by him to be appropriate at the
time,
assuming the buildings were completed in a proper and workmanlike manner
and to a standard not less than that of the other units
available on the market
at the time.
<P>

121	He dealt with the selling period stating that May Street commenced to sell
around July 1994 and Water Street about October 1994.
 He considered, contrary
to the views of Mr Hudson, who had the advantage of being "on the ground"
selling, that there were several
competitive projects at the same time,
although he observed that most of those units sold more quickly, but at lower
prices than
May Street and Water Street.  He also noted evidence that the
market in the locality had been shrinking from December 1994 to May
1996.  He
expressed the opinion that had May Street been completed by 22 September 1994
"it was reasonable to expect that the sale
of units would have been settled at
the rate set out in Annexure 7.15 over the months January 1995 to July 1995".
He was also of
the opinion that had Water Street been completed by 19 December
1994 it was reasonable to expect that the sale of units would have
been settled
at the rate set out in an annexure to his report over the months May 1995 to
December 1995.  He said that from his enquiries
of Mr Hudson when these units
came on to the market "other units were already being offered on the market
which were of similar quality
and price".  If Mr Hudson said that it differed
from what he had told the trustees.  He continued that this had a detrimental
impact
on the sales rate achieved for the Water Street property, such that the
first unit was not sold until April 1995.  I have already
referred to the
evidence of Mr Hudson, which makes it clear that he did not share the opinion
that these units were in competition
with other units as they were superior in
many ways including quality.  
<P>

122	In Section 5.2 of his report Mr Edmonds dealt with the reduction in selling
prices.  In relation to Water Street he noted that
six units were sold before
the completion of construction and, therefore, those units were not, in his
view, the subject of an allowance
for loss of selling price.  He was also of
the view that the seven units retained by Corbel as trustee were properly
subject of an
allowance for loss of value, and the remaining fourteen units
together with three other units retained by Corbel had prices "at 7
October
1994 totalling $3,965,000 and averaging $220,278 per unit".  He expressed the
opinion that there had been some loss in value
as a consequence of the defects
and:-
<P>

	<b>"The calculation of that loss in value is necessarily based on informed
opinion following inspection of the subject units, inspection
of other units
being offered for sale in competition to the subject units and inquiry of those
involved in the selling of the subject
units and those offered in competition
to them."</b>
<P>

What, however, it was not based on was a proper valuation of the units, which
could be compared to the actual sale prices.  I shall
return to what I regard
as this deficiency in Mr Edmonds' evidence.
<P>

123	Once again I would observe that in so far as Mr Hudson may have given
advice contrary to the contemporaneous letters he wrote
and to his sworn
evidence, I prefer the latter evidence, to the extent to which I have accepted
it.  However Mr Edmonds calculated
that in his opinion $50,000 was "a
reasonable estimate" of the loss in value of selling price suffered by Corbel
in respect of twenty
one units in Water Street.  He agreed, in
cross-examination, that he had not sought to value the units in a conventional
manner,
i.e. by a consideration of comparable sales.  This, if I may so with
respect to Mr Edmonds, was a somewhat extraordinary omission.
 In my opinion,
the way in which one could determine how any particular matter impacted on the
value of units was by working out
the valuation of them by reference to
comparable sales and then comparing that figure with the actual sale prices to
see if there
was a difference and, if there was, to seek to attribute the
difference to some defect in the building.  For this not to have been
done
leaves a quite gaping hole in the defendants' case.
<P>

124	Mr Edmonds followed the same approach in relation to May Street and
concluded that $35,000 was a reasonable estimate of the
loss in value and
selling price suffered by Rolando in respect of twenty one units in that
development.  He said, at p.15:-
<P>

	<b>"In the last quarter of 1994 the market was subjected to three consecutive
increases in interest rates the effect of which was to
depress the rate of sale
of real estate right through 1995 and to suppress what would have otherwise
been an increase in prices."</b>
<P>

Once again this was not a matter particularly in dispute.
<P>

125	In his report of 2 March 1999 Mr Edmonds sought to carry out an exercise
which, if I may so with respect, was the correct exercise
of comparing what
actually happened with what, in his opinion, would have happened but for the
breaches of contract. However, in
doing this he made a number of assumptions,
which the facts did not establish, and he laboured under the disadvantage of
having no
valuation of the subject units.  He included an interest component at
12.5 per cent based on opportunity loss, i.e. being a figure
at which in his
opinion Rolando and Corbel would have been able to re-invest the money in
further developments.  However there were
certain obvious defects and errors in
his calculations, which he sought to correct by preparing a further report.
<P>

126	In his further report of 15 April 1999, Exhibit 6, Mr Edmonds re-worked the
figures and, in Schedules B1 and B2, he set out
the interest loss he calculated
"as a consequence of the delayed sale of the units" and their reduced selling
prices.  He said the
latter were worked from summary settlement sheets he
received and he dealt only with the units which were sold.
<P>

127	So far as interest was concerned the amended recalculations provided for
interest at the rate "actually paid" until the loans
were paid out and,
thereafter, "at the approximate average rate available for the investment of
funds on mortgage".  So far as Annexure
"B1" was concerned the interest rate
actually paid ceased in October 1995 and, thereafter, the interest rates
applied were on a loss
of opportunity basis.  So far as Annexure "B2" was
concerned the interest rates actually paid ceased as at July 1998 and,
thereafter,
the interest rates applied related to opportunity loss.
<P>

128	Mr Edmonds also recalculated Annexure "C" because he allowed for the fact
that the builder did not receive the plans until 15
February 1994.  He factored
into his calculations the agreement figures of 18 May 1995.
<P>

129	In Annexure "C1" he provided for the extended completion date in respect of
May Street as being 22 September 1994, and in respect
of Water Street as being
22 November 1994 and for the commencement of the liquidated damages period as
being 20 October and 19 December
1994 respectively.  He noted the date of
occupation of the first unit sold in May Street was 24 March 1995, and in Water
Street as
26 June 1995, although there was no evidence showing the terms on
which the contracts were entered into.
<P>

130	The substantial elements in each of his calculations were the loss of
interest due to delayed settlements as set forth in paragraph
5.4.  In relation
to May Street and Water Street the interest components were $674,874 and
$491,911 respectively whether the agreement
of 18 May 1995 stood or not.
However, these calculations did not take into account the settlement as at that
date of the amount for
penalties.  In my opinion, that precluded any such
amount being allowed prior to that date.
<P>

131	Paragraph 5.4 of Mr Edmonds' first report asserted that the settlement of
the sale of the units had been delayed initially by
the delay in the
registration of the Strata Plan to the extent that this was due to the delayed
completion of the building, and to
the reduced rate of sale resulting from the
construction defects.  It was conceded by Mr Miller that these were assumptions
Mr Edmonds
was asked to make for the purposes of his calculations and that I
had to be satisfied that the assumptions had been made good.
<P>

132	Mr Edmonds also worked out figures for other loss amounts, but the same
assumptions and principles apply to them.  
<P>

133	In his oral evidence Mr Edmonds said he compared the sale prices with the
listing prices, Tp.179, and that in relation to selling
periods he considered
when the units would have been at a sufficiently advanced stage of construction
to enable some pre-sale activity,
which he assessed would have been from
mid-1994.  He said that Annexures "B1" and "B2" were his calculation of what
actually happened
as opposed to what would have happened if certain assumptions
had come to pass as to when the units would have been completed.  He
said the
figures in those annexures were net figures.
<P>

134	At Tp.182 Mr Miller said that the completion date for Water Street should
have been calculated from 15 February 1994.
<P>

135	Mr Edmonds said that he did not understand that one of his tasks was to
determine the market value of the typical units in May
and Water Streets, and
that he did not make an attempt to do so.  Rather he made, in a general way, a
comparison to other units being
offered at the time and how the prices compared
with what was being sold on the market at the time.  He agreed that one way of
testing
his assertion that the units would have sold for more, if they did not
have defects, was by reaching a market value.  Indeed, unless
Mr Edmonds
performed that task I find it difficult to understand how he can offer any
valid opinion as to whether the units sold
for more or less than their value.
I have commented on the effect of his not doing this exercise.  He attempted to
excuse this by
saying that only a few units had been sold when he undertook his
report, although he added that he did not consider it necessary
"at that time
in order to draw the conclusions which I have drawn".  He did not think such an
exercise was warranted, but rather
he attempted to estimate what he believed
was a diminution in value per unit as a result of the defects.  I reject this
method as
providing any reasonable or proper basis for forming a proper
opinion, particularly in the light of all the other evidence in relation
to the
saleability of these units.
<P>

136	Mr Edmonds said, Tp.187, that the loss in value of the units was caused by
people seeing that there was a defect "and either
not buying the units or
deferring their purchase, or paying a lesser price because they knew they were
going to have a hassle with
the builder or developer or the owner about getting
these things fixed".  This was contrary to the contemporaneous letters of Mr
Hudson and not established by any evidence.
<P>

137	In my opinion these were all assumptions Mr Edmonds made which were not
validated by what happened.  I have referred to the
evidence of Mr Barry Hudson
and I shall refer to the evidence of Mr R.H. Hudson in due course.
<P>

138	Mr Edmonds also agreed that it was usual valuation practice not to treat
asking prices as evidence of market value "absolutely,
yes", but none-the-less
he did that by comparing the actual prices with the asking prices from which he
said he could assess "what
sort of discount was being evidenced, if any,
between the list price and the price being achieved".  This, in my view, was an
unsatisfactory
answer in the sense that the method which supported it was
unsatisfactory because no real reliance could be placed on the list prices
and,
therefore, the "discount" may not in truth have been any such thing, which, I
think, Mr Edmonds readily enough accepted: Tp.187.
 Once again his method
lacked any reasonable or rational basis given the task he was undertaking.
<P>

139	He then said he had enough evidence of sales of units to form a conclusion
as to what the market value "generally" was, but
he agreed he did not undertake
a specific valuation exercise, although he thought he had done sufficient work
to form a view as to
what the value of the units were "in a general way".  In
this case, and perhaps in most posing these issues, that left the evidence
for
the defendants in a totally unsatisfactory state.
<P>

140	In some evidence he gave at Tp.188 he seemed to agree that it was necessary
to inspect comparable sales to determine that they
were, in truth, comparable,
although his evidence made it clear that he was relying on generalised
estimates, which, in my opinion,
provided an unsatisfactory basis for the
calculation of damages, even if the assumptions he had made had been
established.
<P>

141	At Tp.192 Mr Edmonds agreed that if the estate agent selling the units
properly held the view that they were well presented
and were being well
received by those inspecting them, that would tend to indicate that whatever
defects were present were not affecting
the market value, and he agreed that
having regard to the nature of his task he was certainly more aware of the
defects than he might
otherwise have been.  The first part of his agreement
substantially negated his evidence, in so far as it retained any real semblance
of accuracy.
<P>

142	Mr Edmonds said, Tp.167, that interest was claimed on the basis that the
sale was settled at a later date than otherwise would
have been achieved:-
<P>

	<b>".. and I have calculated the interest on the difference between the date
that the money would have been received if they had been
sold in the normal
course, and the date that the proceeds were actually received as a consequence
of them being settled later than
they would have normally been."</b>
<P>

This was obviously a reference to "normally have been" but for delays in
completion and defects.
<P>

143	In the state in which the evidence was left as to the calculations Mr
Edmonds had carried out he was invited to prepare fresh
schedules, which became
Exhibit E, and, at Tp.228, he produced those calculations and said that he had
adopted the two differing
interest rates.  In relation to lost opportunity
interest he said he made no assumption that the trusts would have made
distributions
to the unit holders, although he agreed they probably would, but
he could not be sure.  He said that if that had occurred then no
interest would
have been payable as the unit holders would have received the interest.  At
Tp.229 he said:-
<P>

<b>"Q. If you pick up the interest rate which was actually being paid, doesn't
that have to be taken into account in the cash flow, rather
than as a separate
component?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. It could be expressed in a cash flow, but doing it in this way still
produces a meaningful result."</b>
<P>

144	Mr Edmonds concluded by saying that he calculated liquidated damages up to
18 May 1995 and, thereafter, used an assessment of
general damages.  Whilst I
am prepared to assume Mr Edmonds did his best to tackle the task, his
methodology was, for the reasons
I have given, quite unsatisfactory and
provided no basis for a claim for damages.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr Richard Hamish Hudson</b>
<P>

145	Mr Richard Hudson was, at all material times, a director of Rolando and
Corbel.  He said it was his practice to provide written
reports to the unit
holders regularly and he was shown a bundle of reports, which became Exhibit D.
He said the purpose of doing
this was to provide unit holders with accurate
information about the state of the investments and the progress being made in
their
building and marketing.  He understood his duties included keeping unit
holders properly informed about the state of their investment
and, if the value
of the investment was jeopardised by some matter that may have been capable of
correction, then it would have been
important to inform the unit holders about
it unless it was fixed immediately.
<P>

146	Mr Hudson agreed, Tp.218, that he did not have sufficient concern about the
marketing programme to refer it to unit holders.
 His recollection was that in
October 1995 a decision was made to cease selling the units and that marketing
did not resume until
some time in 1997, part of the reason for that decision
being that it was his belief that the market was adverse and the units would
not be able to fetch what he thought was their real value.  He said there were
other factors.  He disagreed that if the market had
been buoyant in October
1995, he would have allowed the remaining units to remain on the market,
although he agreed he received a
letter from Mr Papallo, dated 31 October 1995,
which stated, inter alia, that he had sighted a copy of Mr Barry Hudson's
recent report,
which was identified as that of 30 October 1995, regarding Water
Street and stating that Mr Papallo "can only but agree with the
contents
therein".  
<P>

147	This letter bears out entirely, in my view, the problem which was
confronting the sale of these units.  It had absolutely nothing
to do with
delay in completion or defects.  It was solely concerned with the downturn in
the market, which had to be overcome by
retaining the units and selling later
and on a more favourable market.  I do not accept, even allowing for the
finding of the failure
to properly fire rate the top storey ceilings, that the
units would not have remained on the market but for the downturned market.
Even on Mr Hudson's evidence one of the reasons for taking the units off the
market was the downturn in the market: Tp.221.
<P>

148	Mr Hudson agreed that he never reported to the unit holders about any
defects in the buildings, or the need to rectify them,
nor did he report to
them about any delay in completion: Tpp.221-222.
<P>

149	Mr Hudson also agreed that the units were put back on the market before the
fire rating problem was finally resolved, which
corroborates the view that the
reason they were taken off the market was not related to that.
<P>

<b>The Evidence Of Mr George Papallo</b>
<P>

150	At Tp.93 Mr Papallo agreed that in the correspondence of 18 May 1995 he was
acknowledging that the two remaining guarantees
were to be released on the
dates stated and:-
<P>

<b>"Q. It was more than that, Mr Papallo.  There was a dispute between you and
Mr Joe Wehbe about whether there had been delay in the
construction of the
units, wasn't that the case?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That was a dispute, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. And you maintain that you were entitled to substantial penalties?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Penalties and damages, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. And, indeed, part of the reasons that Mr Joe Wehbe, you believed, wanted
to enter into the agreement was to settle the disputes?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Yes, we both were.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. And the dates on which the release guarantees were to be released,
depended on the date on which the buildings were treated as
being
completed?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That and completion of defects and problems, yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. But the position is this; the date upon which the guarantees were due to
be released, was one of the things you and Mr Wehbe were
arguing about?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Absolutely not.  The Bank guarantees were not part of the discussions
downstairs at all.  The Bank guarantees were raised by Joe
as we were
dictating, if you like, the words to Mr Smith and that is why it was dictated
at that time."</b>
<P>

I do not accept this evidence.  It is inherently improbable that a matter as
important as the return of the guarantees would not
have been discussed before
the dictation commenced, or that Mr Papallo did not choose his words in this
regard carefully.
<P>

151	Notwithstanding, Mr Papallo said that in his mind at that time he and Mr
Joseph Wehbe had resolved any issues between them "so,
there was nothing
further to talk about".  However, he said there was not a resolution as to when
the guarantees were to be released
"because it was not discussed during the
negotiations".
<P>

152	Mr Papallo agreed that the release of the guarantees was dependent upon an
agreement as to the date of completion, and that
the dates 8 June 1995 and 3
September 1995 "therefore" were related to an agreed date of completion, which
dates were part of the
settlement negotiations.  He continued that he and Mr
Wehbe agreed to adopt practical completion at 18 May 1995.  It was quite clear,
Tp.24, that the dates 8 June and 3 September 1995 were negotiated around
completion dates and "came out of the discussions and negotiations,
yes".  This
is totally inconsistent with the matter being a last minute thought.
<P>

153	In the light of that evidence I am not prepared to accept Mr Miller's
submission, or, for that matter, Mr Papallo's evidence,
that those dates were
merely indicative of the dates when, subject to the defects being rectified,
the guarantees were "due" to be
released.  I consider that those words mean
that those were the dates agreed upon for the release of the guarantees,
irrespective
of other considerations.
<P>

154	Mr Papallo agreed, although not immediately, that the agreement to remedy
the defects was to take place in accordance with the
contractual provisions in
effect as incorporated in the letters of 18 May 1995, it then being delegated
to Mr Smith to follow up
the rectification.  He also agreed the words appearing
in the two letters of 18 May 1995 were of his dictation in Mr Wehbe's presence.

<P>

155	Mr Papallo was then cross-examined about the drawing down of the two
guarantees on 11 July 1995.  He was referred to various
correspondence
emanating from Mr Smith and he said that he would not necessarily have
considered it because, as Mr Smith had the
carriage of the matter to some
extent, he would accept what he said was the situation.
<P>

156	At Tp.100 Mr Papallo said, somewhat surprisingly, that he did not consider
that "free of defects" meant "defects measured by
their obligations under the
contract" and, at Tp.101, he agreed that what was being discussed were defects
representing bad workmanship
and the failure to build in accordance with the
contract and its specifications.  From this it arose that he agreed that the
obligation
on the plaintiffs was to correct that which they were contractually
obliged to correct under the contracts.
<P>

157	At Tp.102, after having referred to the various ways in which defects can
appear in a building, Mr Papallo agreed that he received
the letter dated 7
June 1995 stating that all items had been rectified with the exception of the
planter box waterproofing in Water
Street, and that that showed that the
plaintiffs understood they had finished May Street as at that date.  But he
said he did not
think he inspected the premises after receipt of the letter,
but engaged Ray White to do so.  He added that he would have wanted
to satisfy
himself as to May Street, but he was not satisfied because "there are a whole
list of things that were not completed".
 Notwithstanding, he put nothing in
writing to the plaintiffs, and he agreed the next letter from Mr Smith referred
only to Water
Street, as did the following correspondence.  Put shortly there
was no complaint about May Street after 7 June 1995.
<P>

158	It then became apparent that Mr Papallo needed a document signed by Mr
Wehbe for the purpose of obtaining further funds from
the financier.  He agreed
it was no part of the agreement of 18 May 1995 that the plaintiffs were obliged
to sign any such document,
but it was a matter of commercial importance to him
that it occurred.
<P>

159	In relation to Corbel Mr Papallo agreed, Tp.107, that on 4 May 1995 a
document signed by Mr Smith was prepared at his direction,
which demanded a
payment of the final instalment from Corbel.  This is quite inconsistent with
any assertion that work had not been
completed.  By way of emphasis Mr Papallo
said, Tp.108:-
<P>

<b>"Q. But what Corbel is being charged for is the amount under the building
contract which had been approved by you, isn't that what
the letter plainly
says?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. And that is the whole of the amount demanded by Mars
Construction?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Absolutely without any deduction for penalties or damages or anything of
that sort?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. Not on this statement.</b>
<P>

<b>	Q. Because on 4 May you didn't believe that there were any penalties or
damages that should be deducted?</b>
<P>

<b>	A. That is not correct."</b>
<P>

Mr Papallo said that there was a calculation of $133,000 in relation to
penalties, which figure he denied he had dreamt up.  However,
he was quite
unable to give any comprehensible explanation for the obvious discrepancies in
his evidence.
<P>

160	Mr Papallo was then taken to the evidence in relation to the drawing down
of the two guarantees, including the failure to advise
of further defects
either in writing or, so far as he was concerned, orally.  This reinforced the
view that there was no foundation
in fact for these complaints.  In my opinion
Mr Papallo was seeking to attribute blame to the plaintiffs for the financial
plight
in which Rolando and Corbel found themselves in consequence of the
market turning against them.
<P>

<b>A Consideration Of Certain Issues</b>
<P>

161	I shall now consider certain of the issues raised.
<P>

162	<b>(a)	The Contract of 18 May 1995</b>
<P>

It was not in issue	that Mr Joseph Wehbe, on behalf of himself and Mars
Constructions, entered into an agreement with Mr Papallo,
on behalf of Rolando
and Corbel, on 18 May 1995.  There were, however, issues as to the terms of the
agreement, the proper meaning
of the written agreement, whether the agreement
was lawfully terminated on behalf of Mars Constructions and Mr Wehbe, and, if
it
was, the consequences of that termination.  If it was not lawfully
terminated a further question arose as to the consequences of
its remaining on
foot.
<P>

163	The background factual matrix against which, in my opinion, the agreement
can be considered is that Mr Joseph Wehbe and Mr Papallo
engaged in building
projects together previously; each was a highly experienced and competent
businessman; the May and Water Street
projects were essentially completed by
May 1995 and were being actively marketed for some months before then; disputes
had arisen
between Mr Wehbe and Mr Papallo as to the payments for extras and
penalties; and each was desirous of resolving those disputes and
working out a
way in which any further disputes in relation to defects could be resolved and
the Bank guarantees returned.
<P>

164	I am satisfied that the agreement reached on 18 May 1995 was intended to
effect a final resolution of all the problems the parties
had encountered, and
that it was confined to the two letters of that date.  I reject the submission
that there were additional oral
terms as was contended for by Mr Miller.  My
reason for this latter view is that after the agreement had been worked out
over a long
period of discussion, Mr Papallo and Mr Wehbe went to see Mr Smith
and Mr Papallo dictated the two letters to him and, as he did
so, Mr Smith
typed them.  If, as Mr Papallo suggested, there were oral terms such as the
defaults being rectified within seven to
ten days and the two Bank guarantees
only being released in the event of the defects being rectified, there was
absolutely no reason
why Mr Papallo, who, in addition to being an experienced
and, I am satisfied, astute businessman, had also practised as a solicitor
for
a number of years and appreciated the significance of contemporaneous written
records, would not have committed any further terms
to writing.  The care the
parties employed in reaching their agreement and ensuring it was committed to
writing is clear and emphasised
by Mr Papallo's handwritten postscript to the
second letter.  Further, the letters were not signed immediately by Mr Wehbe,
who took
them away to consider them with his solicitor, Mr Louis Wehbe, and his
son, Mr Raymond Wehbe.  This, in my opinion, showed a degree
of care in what he
was doing to negate any suggestion that he would have agreed to terms, which
were not included in the letters.
 Mr Raymond Wehbe made it clear that his
father was anxious to have all matters finalised so that he could be sure that
no further
claims, save to the extent he agreed about rectifying defects, could
be made.  For all these reasons I am satisfied that the agreement
of 18 May
1995 was wholly in writing and incorporated the relevant terms of the building
contracts, but that those obligations were
spelt out very precisely as only
applying "for as long as we remain liable under the said contracts". 
<P>

165	The next question is what the agreement means.  Firstly, it resolved the
questions of extras and penalties and these matters
were concluded by the
payment to Mr Wehbe of the balance of $20,000 on that day.  I have referred to
the significance of the acceptance
by Mr Papallo of the amount for penalties.
The effect of this part of the agreement was that Rolando and Corbel satisfied
all their
obligations to pay money to Mars Constructions and Mr Wehbe.  The
rights, in regard to those matters, became accrued rights.	Therefore,
even I
had accepted Mr Edmonds' methodology it was in error because penalties were
agreed to 18 May 1995.  It was only if additional
damage for delay or defects
could be proved that there was any conceivable basis for such a claim.
<P>

166	Further, Mr Wehbe acknowledged the obligation to make good the defects,
subject to there being a continuing liability under
the building contracts.
The contractual liability in respect of defects ended, prima facie, at the
expiration of the defects liability
period, which was twenty six weeks after
the date for Practical Completion.  Mr Miller submitted that the dates for
Practical Completion
were 17 September 1994 in respect of May Street and 21
November 1994 in respect of Water Street.  However, it is clear from Mr
Papallo's
evidence that the parties varied those dates when determining the
dates upon which the two remaining Bank guarantees were to be released.
 If the
defects were not rectified by each of those dates, the rights of Rolando and
Corbel were to be governed by the right to sue
for breach of the 18 May 1995
agreement.		
<P>

167	This gave rise to the next difficulty, namely the meaning of the
paragraph:-
<P>

	<b>"We further acknowledge that the second Bank Guarantee in regard to May
Street is due to be released to you on 8th June 1995 and the
second Bank
Guarantee in regard to Water Street is due for release to you on 3rd September
1995."</b>
<P>

Dr Birch submitted that it was an essential term of the agreement that on each
of those dates the second guarantee would be released,
noting that on 18 May
1995 the first guarantees had been released.  Mr Miller submitted that the
words did not constitute an agreement
to release the guarantees on those dates,
but comprised a statement that provided the rectification work was carried out
those would
be the days on which they would be released.  He submitted that the
evidence established that these words were inserted to advise
Mr Wehbe of the
dates upon which the guarantees were "due" to be released, provided that the
rectification work had been carried
out.  I reject Mr Miller's submission.
<P>

168	The return of the guarantees was a matter of high significance to Mars
Constructions and Mr Wehbe.  Whilst they remained on
foot they incurred fees to
NAB and, of course, the guarantees could be drawn down without prior notice.
The total amount guaranteed
was $138,961 which, in the context of the amounts
being discussed on 18 May 1995, was significant.  Any final settlement between
the parties demanded that the dates upon which the guarantees were to be
released was resolved.  When the relevant words are read
they bring about, in
my opinion, the necessary resolution.  Firstly, Mr Papallo signed an
"acknowledgment" in relation to them. 
This is hardly the word to be used if
one was merely conveying information.  Secondly, it was an acknowledgment of
the date when
each guarantee was "due to be released to you" and "due for
release to you".  The words mean, in my opinion, that on those dates
the
guarantees would be released.  There was no reservation of any right not to
release them, nor was there any insertion of any
provision for early release if
the defects were rectified. 
<P>

169	If, as Mr Miller submitted, the release was dependent on the defects being
rectified I would have expected the letter to provide
two things, namely that
in the event of that not occurring there would be no release or, put another
way, that the release was contingent
on that happening; and, in the event of
the defects being rectified before those dates there would be a release of the
guarantees
upon that occurring.  No reason can be advanced as to why the
guarantees should have been retained once the rectification of defects
was
concluded.  On the other hand, I appreciate that the defects may have been
rectified before the dates for the release of the
guarantees occurred, but that
only reinforces, having regard to the care with which this agreement was worked
out, the view that
the dates were the dates on which, irrespective of what had
happened, the guarantees would be released.  The parties determined on
dates
certain remitting themselves thereafter, so far as Rolando and Corbel were
concerned to sue, and so far as Mars Constructions
and Mr Wehbe were concerned,
to be sued, for the cost of the rectification of defects not carried out in
accordance with the contractual
terms and, so far as the former were concerned,
without the benefit of the guarantees. 
<P>

170	One may ask why Mr Papallo was prepared to risk having defects carried out
without the assurance of the guarantees.  I am satisfied
that that was a
concession he was prepared to make for the entry into the overall agreement
and, in any event, the defects were,
in so far as any existed on 18 May 1995,
of a quite minor nature.  As I have said there can be no doubt that no
agreement could have
been concluded unless certainty was brought to the release
of the guarantees.
<P>

171	The guarantee was not returned on 8 June 1995, or at all, and Mars
Constructions and Mr Wehbe purported to terminate the contract
for breach of an
essential term by the letter from their solicitor dated 26 June 1995.  That
could only be done if the term was an
essential one, the test being:-
<P>

	<b>".. whether it appears from the general nature of the contract considered
as a whole, or from some particular term or terms, that
the promise is of such
importance to the promisee that he would not have entered into the contract
unless he had been assured of
a strict or substantial performance of the
promise, as the case may be, and that this ought to have been apparent to the
promisor
.."</b>: <b><i>Tramways Advertising Pty Limited v Luna Park (NSW)
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2030%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 30 SR (NSW) 632</a> per Jordan CJ at pp.641-642.</b>
<P>

172	In my opinion, the promise to return each guarantee had these qualities.
It was contained in a separate letter signed by Mr
Papallo by way of an
acknowledgment, and it related to the return on dates certain of guaranteed
funds of $69,631 and $69,330 respectively.
 Until the guarantees were returned
Mars Constructions and Mr Wehbe remained liable on those guarantees and,
therefore, to having
$138,961 debited to their accounts.  Viewing the matter
objectively I cannot conclude that Mr Wehbe would have entered into this
agreement unless he had been assured of the return of the guarantees in
exchange for his promise to rectify the defects.  That was
the basis on which
the parties reached their overall agreement and, as I have said, there was no
reservation of rights in relation
to the guarantees if the defects were or were
not rectified.
<P>

173	Accordingly, I am of the view that the failure to release the May Street
guarantee on 8 June 1995, or at least after demand
for its release had been
made, led to a breach of an essential term of the agreement, which entitled
Mars Constructions and Mr Wehbe
to terminate it, as they did by the letter of
26 June 1995.  Although the letter referred to the agreement being rescinded,
it is
more accurate to say that it was terminated for breach.  Dr Birch
submitted that the consequence of that termination was to avoid
the contract
<i>ab initio</i>, thus remitting the parties to their rights under the building
contracts and entitling his clients to claim for all extras and variations,
which had been compromised.  Mr Miller submitted that the agreement was only
terminated in respect of future rights, and that the
termination did not impact
on accrued rights.
<P>

174	In my opinion, Mr Miller's submission is correct.  Thus, the settlement of
the claim for extras and penalties was not affected.
 Mars Constructions and Mr
Wehbe were, however, released from their obligations to comply further with the
contract and, by virtue
of the breach, entitled to recover damages for the
failure of Rolando and Corbel to release the guarantees.  They also claimed
damages
from Mr Papallo for his having given instructions for the draw down of
both guarantees on 11 July 1995.
<P>

175	The agreement of 18 May 1995 was entered into by Mr Papallo on behalf of
Rolando and Corbel.  So much was not in issue.  However,
that did not make Mr
Papallo a party to that agreement.  Further, the draw down of the guarantees on
11 July 1995 was effected by
Rolando and Corbel.  The notices to NAB were
furnished under the common seals of each of those companies and, in so far as
those
were wrongful acts, they were performed by the companies, albeit pursuant
to instructions given by Mr Papallo.  It will be necessary
to consider these
matters when dealing with the question as to whether Mr Papallo is liable to
pay damages to the plaintiffs.
<P>

176	A termination <i>ab initio</i> is only brought about where there is a
rescission for misrepresentation or mistake or some other disqualifying factor
affecting the
entry into the contract, rather than for breach of an essential
term.  The consequence of a termination for breach is to discharge
the party
not in breach from further performance of the contract and to entitle that
party to sue for damages.
<P>

177	The consequences of the breach by Rolando of failing to deliver up the
second guarantee meant, in my opinion, that Mars Constructions
and Mr Wehbe
were absolved from any further obligation to rectify the defects.  It also
meant that they were entitled to sue for
damages for the wrongful drawing down
of the guarantee.
<P>

178	In my opinion, the drawing down of the guarantee was wrongful because the
parties had not, by the agreement of 18 May 1995,
provided that that should be
done.  On the other hand, if the view is taken that the incorporation of the
terms of the building contracts
entitled Rolando to exercise its rights against
that guarantee, Rolando was faced with the further difficulty that as at 11
July
1995 there was no evidence of any subsisting defects entitling the drawing
down of the guarantee.  I have referred in some detail
to the evidence, which
showed that by 7 June 1995 the plaintiffs were contending that there were no
further defects in May Street,
and that thereafter it was conceded by Mr
Papallo that he gave no written or oral notice to the plaintiffs of any such
defects. 
I have dealt with the total improbability of this not having been
done if defects existed.  I do not accept that Mr Papallo would
not have given
written notice if there had been defects in May Street.  Further, as I have
observed, Mr Papallo, when he gave the
instructions that the guarantee in
favour of Rolando be drawn down did so without knowledge of the amount
involved, of the terms
of the guarantee, of whether it could be drawn down in
part, and, not caring what the situation was.
<P>

179	A submission was raised that the agreement of 18 May 1995 had to be viewed
as, in effect, two agreements, one being between
the plaintiffs and Rolando,
and the other being between the plaintiffs and Corbel.  I do not consider this
is a proper characterisation
of the agreement which, in my opinion, was
intended to be one between all parties for the resolution of all disputes
between them.
 The determination of the disputes in respect of extras and
penalties, involving as it does lump sums not divided between Rolando
and
Corbel, is incomprehensible unless this view is taken.  Therefore, in my
opinion, if the plaintiffs were entitled, as I consider
they were, to terminate
the agreement because of Rolando's conduct, that led to a termination of the
whole agreement.  There is no
injustice in this situation bearing in mind the
commonality of directors of both companies and of Mr Papallo, through Alanto
and
PBI, being the supervisor for both projects which, in essence, were running
in tandem.  However, if I be wrong in this view, there
was a further and
separate breach by Corbel on 11 July 1995 in drawing down the guarantee.  There
was no evidence that at that time
Corbel was entitled to do that pursuant to
its rights under the building contract.  There was no evidence as to the amount
owing
at that date, and Mr Papallo displayed the same attitude to drawing down
that guarantee as he had in relation to the May Street guarantee.
 I can only
assume, in those circumstances, that the directors of Rolando and Corbel shared
that view.  No attempt was made by Mr
Richard Hudson to say anything to the
contrary.  There was no evidence to establish that any breach by the plaintiffs
in relation
to defects at Water Street was of such a nature as to entitle
Corbel to terminate the agreement lawfully.
<P>

180	In those circumstances the conduct of Corbel amounted to an anticipatory
breach, Mars Constructions and Mr Wehbe having until
3 September 1995 to remedy
any defects.  That breach, in my opinion, was accepted by the immediate
institution of legal proceedings
for declaratory relief denying the entitlement
of Corbel to act in the way in which it had.  Therefore, if one views the
contracts
as two separate contracts there were, in my opinion, two separate
breaches.  Each breach was of an essential term and entitled the
plaintiffs to
terminate the contracts, which they did.
<P>

181	The consequences of the breaches were, in my opinion, that the plaintiffs
were discharged from the obligation to carry out any
further rectification work
and entitled, by way of damages, to a repayment of the amounts drawn down
pursuant to the guarantees.
<P>

182	There was no entitlement to re-visit the questions of extras and penalties.
Nor was there any room for the application of the
liquidated damages amount,
even if the evidence had otherwise made out an entitlement to such damages,
which it did not.
<P>

183	<b> (b)	The Effect Of The Referees' Report</b>
<P>

I have set out the terms of reference, which, in relation to defects required
the findings as to the physical defects in the buildings
"for which the
plaintiffs are responsible" and the reasonable cost of rectifying them.
<P>

184	The Referees approached their task by referring to the terms of reference
"as interpreted by the parties".  They stated that
they were "required to
report only on methodology and quantification".  They concluded their opening
remarks thus:-
<P>

	<b>"The findings are based on methodologies and related quantum on which the
experts agreed and which we found appropriate to adopt.
 The agreements
expressly excluded questions of liability."</b>
<P>

185	In their submissions before me the parties accepted, as I understood it,
that this was the way in which the reference had been
conducted.  I think it
unfortunate, and it adds to the difficulties for referees, when,
notwithstanding the order of the Court for
reference out, the parties adopt a
different attitude at the hearing.  In saying this I do not intend that it is
impermissible. 
However, this is what happened and, accordingly, the defects
other than fire rating items, which disclosed a figure of $36,030 payable
comprising $9,411 for May Street and $26,649 for Water Street, have to be
considered on the basis that the liability for these amounts
is to be
determined by me.
<P>

186	The way the Referees approached their task in relation to defects is
disclosed from the letter of 27 May 1998 from Mr Condliffe
and Mr Sassine to Mr
Lumsdaine setting out, by way of a Scott Schedule, defect items.  It appears
this schedule was prepared in 1998,
although there is no evidence in the
schedule to indicate when it is alleged the defects occurred.  This is a not
insignificant matter
because in so far as they occurred after 26 June 1995 they
are not, in the view to which I have come, defects for which the plaintiffs
remained responsible.  
<P>

187	The onus is on Rolando and Corbel to establish that these were defects for
which the plaintiffs are liable.  In my opinion they
have not, save for limited
exceptions, discharged that onus.  The Scott Schedule comprises some hundreds
of items.  Mr Papallo's
affidavit of 10 February 1999 deals only with a few and
not in a way which is relevantly helpful.  I was not favoured with any
submissions
on them.  The first tranche is concerned with Water Street, and the
initial one is for $4,365 because the entrance driveway was splattered
with
black tar-like substance "in all probability damp proofing compound".  The
postscript to the letter of 18 May 1995 accepted
"that the tar staining on the
driveway cannot be rectified and we will not require any further rectification
in regard to such tar
staining".  It is not immediately clear that this is a
reference to Water Street, but there is a coincidence of defect.  The
defendants
have, therefore, not established that that amount should be
allowed.
<P>

188	One may infer that certain of the items, such as 2, 3 and 4, which I only
state by way of example, were defects which existed
at the time the building
work was completed.  On the other hand one may infer that other items such as
7, 8 and 9, once again to
take examples, were probably not defects resulting
from the building work.  My immediate reaction to the way in which the case was
presented was to decline to travel through items, on which the parties had not
addressed me, to work out for myself those in respect
of which the plaintiffs
may be liable.  However, I think the Court's duty is to try and terminate this
case, at least at first instance,
and, with that in mind, I have been through
the defects in relation to Water and May Streets and, simply from a description
of them
which is essentially all the information I have, I have decided that
the following items are referable to the plaintiffs' failure
to fix the
defects.  In doing so I have satisfied myself, on the balance of probabilities
and from the meagre descriptions offered,
that this is the position.  I have
deliberately omitted cracking and other matters which can arise from general
wear and tear having
regard to the fact that a number of the units, if not all,
have been occupied and, in any event, it was conceded that there could
be no
ongoing obligation on the plaintiffs to remedy matters such as hairline cracks
and other minor matters, which will appear from
time to time in a new building.
I have also taken the view that damage to parts of the buildings cannot, on the
evidence before me,
properly be attributed to the plaintiffs.  As I have said
the onus was on the defendants to prove the defects and in so far as they
have
sought to do so by leaving me to work through the Scott Schedule I am not
prepared to make any assumptions in their favour because
they carry the onus.
I think I should also note that the parties contented themselves before the
Referees with dealing with the matter
on the basis of the defects in the Scott
Schedule.  In these circumstances I do not see that the Court should go beyond
that document.
<P>

189	Applying the principles to which I have referred I am satisfied that the
defendants are entitled to have the plaintiffs compensate
them in respect of
defects 2, 3, 4, 11, 13, 16, 19-21, 77, 81 and 167 in relation to Water Street.
These items total $2,623.33.
<P>

190	<b>In Relation To May Street</b>
<P>

In respect of May Street I allow Items 231, 232 and 233, which total $258.  I
do so on the basis that the experts attributed the
cracking to the absence of
structural expansion joints as shown on the engineer's drawings, thus making it
clear that the fault was
attributable to the plaintiffs.  I make it clear that
I do not conclude that the cracking was evident at any time in 1995.
<P>

191	Similarly in relation to Items 2, 3 and 4 in relation to Water Street, the
problem was the absence of construction joints shown
on the relevant
drawings.
<P>

192	In the result for minor defects to May Street I allow $258 and for Water
Street $2,623.33, subject to the observations I am
about to make.
<P>

193	The defendants were clearly under an obligation to mitigate their damages.
Mr Wahbe, whose evidence I accept without reservation,
told Mr Papallo in July
1995 that he was prepared to rectify such defects as existed, free of charge.
Mr Papallo rejected this offer
unless he was paid some $10,000 to $12,000 by
way of costs for the legal proceedings, which had just been instituted because
of the
wrongful drawing down of the Bank Guarantees.  This was a preposterous
suggestion, which Mr Wahbe quite rightly rejected.  The consequence
was that
the defects were not remedied and the reason was solely attributable to Mr
Papallo's totally unreasonable response.
<P>

194	In considering Mr Wahbe's evidence it is necessary to note that he
confirmed that the offer he made to carry out the rectification
work was a
genuine one and that when he made it he was aware there were a number of
defects, which required fixing.  He had a list
of them.  His offer was made in
July 1995.  However, there was no evidence sought to be adduced as to which
defects, if any, related
to May Street and which related to Water Street.
<P>

195	If Mr Papallo had accepted Mr Wahbe's offer the rectification would have
been carried out without any cost to him.  No valid
reason was put forward why
Mr Papallo was justified in not accepting that offer and, in all the
circumstances, I consider that the
plaintiffs have established that the
defendants failed to take appropriate steps to mitigate their damages.
Accordingly, I do not
consider that the defendants are entitled to any damages
for rectification costs and my conclusion would have been the same even
if I
had come to the view that they had established a greater entitlement than that
of which they have satisfied me.
<P>

196	The next item dealt with in the Referees' Report was extras and variations
which, for the reasons I have given, are covered
by the agreement of 18 May
1995.  That is a matter which, in the view I take, cannot be re-visited.
<P>

197	The fourth matter dealt with in the Referees' Report was the question of
acoustic requirements and roof space insulation.  The
Referees found that
certain elements of the construction did not, as agreed by the experts
including Mr Ian Ezzy, achieve a rating
required under the Building Code of
Australia, and that reasonable methods to achieve such ratings were agreed by
the experts and
costed by experts.  As to roof space insulation there was a
dispute as to whether it was a contractual requirement, which question
was not
referred to the experts.  In relation to acoustics the Referees found the
amount payable to be $29,903.80 and, in relation
to roof insulation $11,584.10.
There was not, as I understood it, any dispute about the former amount. 
<P>

198	In relation to insulation Mr Ezzy conceded there was a clause in the
contracts requiring it, but he said it was "incorrectly
contained, was not even
a reference to domestic construction.  It was a reference to industrial
construction ...": Tp.68.  In my
opinion, on the evidence, there was a
requirement for insulation, even if it had been incorrectly stated in the
specifications, and
unless the matter was the subject of some subsequent
agreement, which I am not satisfied it was, the defendants are entitled to be
paid $5,792.05 for May Street and $5,792.05 for Water Street, they being the
agreed figures.  Dr Birch submitted this was a lump
sum contract, so that if
the work was not done, the same amount was payable.  I disagree for reasons
which must be obvious.  The
lump sum must have been based on the cost of
carrying out the specified work.
<P>

199	As I understood it there was no argument in relation to the expenses for
the acoustics and, accordingly, the defendants are
entitled to be paid the
figures found by the Referees of $14,516.41 for May Street and $15,387.39 for
Water Street.
<P>

200	This left the fire rating related items.  The Referees found the
construction of both buildings fell short of the requirements
of the Building
Code of Australia to provide fire rating.  I am not satisfied by the evidence
that this was in consequence of any
fraudulent conduct by the plaintiffs or of
conduct which contravened ss.52 or 42 of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> and the
<b>Fair Trading Act</b>, rather the evidence indicates that the plaintiffs were
misled, albeit probably innocently, by the manufacturers of the ceiling
material.
 None-the-less the fact is that the plaintiffs did not achieve the
fire rating requirements and it was not suggested that this was
a matter which
Mr Wahbe had in mind when he made his offer.  Nor was it suggested that he had
in mind rectifying the acoustic and
roof insulation problems. However, the
evidence of Mr Simmons, in his affidavit of 12 December 1997, and of Mr
Carasso, in his affidavit
of 7 November 1996, make it clear that the
sub-contractor, AAA Pty Limited, and the supplier, Pioneer Plasterboard Pty
Limited, showed
an interest in undertaking rectification work.  Mr Papallo gave
reasons for rejecting the offers, which, so far as AAA Pty Limited
was
concerned, was valid.  On the whole of the evidence I am not satisfied that it
has been shown that adequate was done to justify
the conclusion that Mr
Papallo, on behalf of Rolando and Corbel, should have accepted this method of
rectification, or that there
was a sufficient offer made to require that to be
done.  Accordingly, in relation to these items I would allow the amounts the
Referees
found being in respect of May Street:-
<P>

(a)	Mechanical vent boxes 				$   6,387 . 22
<P>

(b)	Wardrobe and linen CPD boxes 		$   2,322 . 63
<P>

(c)	Ceiling penetrations etc 				<u>$ 36,995 . 06</u>
<P>

						Total		<u>$ 45,704 . 91</u>
<P>

201	In respect of Water Street I would allow the figures found by the Referees
of:-
<P>

(a)	Mechanical vent boxes				$     7,185 . 62
<P>

(b)	Wardrobe shaft panels				$   71,594 . 92
<P>

(c)	Ceiling penetrations etc				<u>$   36,196 . 66</u>
<P>

						Total		<u>$ 114,977 . 20</u>
<P>

<b>The Defendants' Claim for Loss Resulting From Alleged Delay and
Defects</b>
<P>

202	A substantial claim mounted by the defendants was for loss allegedly caused
because of delay by the plaintiffs in completing
the works and the defects
meant that the units were difficult to sell, such that the loss allegedly
suffered by the defendants on
their sale is attributable to the plaintiffs.  In
my opinion the defendants have failed to establish this claim.  They have
failed
at a number of levels.  I have set them out earlier in these reasons and
it is only necessary to summarise my conclusions.
<P>

203	Firstly, the prima facie method of calculating any such loss would be by
having a valuation made of the units at the time it
was alleged they should
have been brought on to the market and in the condition in which it was alleged
they should have been, and
to have compared that valuation with the prices
actually achieved.  The defendants did not cause any valuation to be carried
out,
Mr Edmonds conceding, as I have noted, that he did not perform a valuation
exercise of comparing like with like.  Nor did he perform
any exercise placing
the units into the temporal context, which the defendants would have asserted
should have been the time they
would have been available for sale.  In the
absence of any valuation evidence from the defendants comparing the units as
valued by
the implementation of proper valuation principles, with the prices
achieved, from which at least an inference could be drawn that
any delay or
defects caused the fall in the price, the defendants have, in my opinion, no
case at all.  However, their task is made
harder by a number of other matters,
not the least of which is that Mr Murray's evidence is that the units were sold
at prices which
matched the market prices for comparable units.  Therefore, not
only did the defendants not prove their case in the way to which
I have
referred, but there was evidence to the contrary, which I accept, that there
was no diminution in value.  Secondly, the evidence
from Mr Barry Hudson makes
it obvious that there was no problem so far as delay or defects were concerned
in marketing these units.
 I have referred in some detail to the letters he
wrote and I find it inconceivable that if there had been a problem in relation
to either delay or defects he would not have referred to it.  In so far as he
suggested that he did not refer to those matters because
he was writing to the
trustees, who would pass the information on, I reject his evidence and, as I
have observed, in writing to Mr
Papallo he made no such comments.  Mr Hudson's
evidence makes clear what is corroborated by the evidence of Mr Murray, Ms
Coyne and,
to some extent, Mr Edmonds, namely that when the units came on the
market they were acceptable and indeed of a better quality than
other units,
such that Mr Hudson did not consider they would be affected by the competition
from them.  Initially the units sold
reasonably well.  There was then the slow
period, which happens according to the evidence every year in the real estate
market over
the Christmas/New Year holidays, after which the sale of the units
struck the difficulty of a downturn in the market brought about,
inter alia, by
increasing interest rates.  The whole thrust of Mr Hudson's correspondence
during the first half of 1995 was to the
effect that there was a lowering in
confidence because of this problem and other financial uncertainties and that
the saleability
of all units in the area was reduced in consequence thereof.
<P>

204	The advertising by Mr Hudson showed a concerted campaign to sell what he
described as quality units.  There was no suggestion
that he was engaging in
false advertising, nor that the letters he wrote were inaccurate and
deceptive.
<P>

205	The totality of this evidence, in my opinion, when combined with the
failure by the trustees in reporting to the unit holders
to make any complaint
about the matters now complained of, makes a nonsense of the suggestion that
any conduct or lack of conduct
on the part of the plaintiffs was responsible
for the inability to sell the units.
<P>

206	Thirdly, the evidence of the decline in the market was corroborated, as I
have stated, by the evidence of Mr Murray, Ms Coyne
and, to an extent, Mr
Edmonds.  Mr Papallo also agreed with it in his correspondence with the
trustees.
<P>

207	Fourthly, Mr Papallo's preparedness to accept a figure of $133,000 in
respect of penalties on 18 May 1995, by which time the
market was in serious
decline, shows his acceptance of this situation.
<P>

208	Fifthly, the various assumptions on which Mr Edmonds' report has been based
have not been made out.  There is no evidentiary
basis for his assertions of
delay or defects rendering the units more difficult to sell; nor for his
assertions that prospective
purchasers would be put off by the appearance of
the units, as to which Mr Hudson's correspondence is to the contrary; nor to
support
his assumption that the quality of the units was diminished by any
conduct on the part of the plaintiffs.  Once again Mr Hudson's
evidence
disposes of this contention.  Nextly, there was no evidentiary basis for the
awarding of damages on the basis of lost opportunity,
because there was no
evidence from Mr Richard Hudson that the moneys would have been used in a
different project and would not have
been returned to the unit holders.
<P>

209	For all these reasons I reject the defendants' claim for damages on this
basis, and I repeat that there is no basis for applying
the liquidated damages
provisions of the contracts.
<P>

<b>The Claim Against Mr Papallo</b>
<P>

210	I have referred to the fact that Mr Papallo was acting as the agent for
Rolando and Corbel, which is confirmed in paragraph
23 of the plaintiffs'
allegations.  That paragraph, in its concluding words, makes it clear that the
claim in relation to Mr Papallo
relates to his position as the agent of Rolando
and Corbel.  In the way in which the matter was pleaded it seems to me that if
there
is any claim for aggravated and/or exemplary damages it is a claim to be
made against Rolando and Corbel acting through their agent
Mr Papallo.  There
was no suggestion that this was not the situation and, in the Amended Defence
filed on 14 April 1999, paragraph
23 was admitted and the later paragraphs were
denied.  The Amended Defence thus accepted the fact that Mr Papallo was acting
conformably
with authority conferred upon him by Rolando and Corbel.
<P>

211	For the reasons I have given I consider that the actions of Mr Papallo, for
which Rolando and Corbel are responsible, were high-handed
in the extreme and
were not justified by the circumstances which then existed.
<P>

212	The plaintiffs are seeking aggravated damages, which are compensatory in
nature, and exemplary damages, which are punitive in
nature. In <b>Lamb v
Cotogno </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 1</a>, the High Court was concerned with a case in tort
in which an award had been made by way of exemplary damages for trespass
arising
out of a motor vehicle incident.  In that case the High Court, in a
joint judgment, upheld that exemplary damages could be awarded
where the
conduct of a party was sufficiently reprehensible to require the Court to mark
its disapproval of it by the award of damages.
 Their Honours adopted what
Brennan J had said in <b>XL Petroleum (NSW) Pty Limited v Caltex Oil
(Australia) Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20155%20CLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 155 CLR 448</a> at p.471:-
<P>

	<b>"As an award of exemplary damages is intended to punish the defendant for
conduct showing a conscious and contumelious disregard for
the plaintiff's
rights and deter him from committing like conduct again, the considerations
that enter into the assessment of exemplary
damages are quite different from
the considerations that govern the assessment of compensatory damages."</b>
<P>

213	At p.8 in <b>Lamb</b> their Honours distinguished between exemplary damages
and aggravated damages, which they described as "compensatory in nature, being
awarded for injury to the plaintiff's feelings caused by insult, humiliation
and the like".  They continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Exemplary damages, on the other hand, go beyond compensation and are
awarded `as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such
proceeding to
the future, and as proof of the detestation of the jury to the action
itself'."</b>
<P>

214	Assuming for present purposes that such damages may be awarded in a
contract case, I am not satisfied that this is a case in
which it is
appropriate to award aggravated damages.  Certainly Mars Construction would not
be entitled to such damages and I am
not satisfied that Mr Joseph Wehbe is
through his estate.  I make the assumption because the parties did not address
me on any authorities
showing that aggravated and/or exemplary damages may be
awarded for breach of contract, although reference, without further relevant
elaboration, was made to <b>Gray v Motor Accident Commission</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2073%20ALJR%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 73 ALJR
45</a>, which was a tort case.
<P>

215	The question then is whether an award of exemplary damages is permissible
for breach of contract and, if it is, whether it is
justified on the facts of
this case.
<P>

216	Although no submissions were made to me as to whether exemplary and
aggravated damages could, as a matter of law, be awarded
in circumstances such
as the present, where the breach alleged is of contract, it seems to me that is
the first matter for consideration.
I should add that Dr Birch suggested that
there may be a tortious basis for the award of damages based on fraud, but, for
the reasons
I have given, I consider that, on a proper analysis, the damages
flow from breach of contract.
<P>

217	In <b>McGregor on Damages</b> (16th Edition) (1997) in paragraph 442 the
authors stated:-
<P>

	<b>"In addition to these two exclusions from the exemplary damages net, it is
clear that awards of exemplary damages will not be available
in negligence,
however gross, or public nuisance - <i>AB v South West Water Service </i> so
decides - or in conversion, and certainly not for breach of contract where the
writ of exemplary damages has never been allowed
to run."</b>
<P>

218	In <b>Halsbury's Laws of Australia</b> (Volume 6) at paragraph 110-11060 it
is stated:-
<P>

	<b>"The fundamental principle governing the award of damages at common law is
that they are compensatory.  Because the purpose of the
award is to compensate
the plaintiff rather than to penalise the defendant, exemplary or punitive
damages are not awarded in contract,
although they are available for some
torts.  Thus the general principle when damages are awarded in contract is for
the plaintiff,
so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation,
with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed."</b>
<P>

219	In <b>Butler v Fairclough &amp; Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1917/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1917] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281917%29%2023%20CLR%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1917) 23 CLR 78</a> Griffith CJ said,
at p.89:-
<P>

	<b>"The measure of damages in an action for breach of contract is well
settled.  It is such loss as may fairly and reasonably be considered
as arising
according to the usual course of things or may reasonably be supposed to have
been in the contemplation of the parties
at the time of making the contract as
the probable result of a breach.  The motive or state of mind of a person who
is guilty of
a breach of contract is not relevant to the question of damages
for the breach, although if the contract itself were fraudulent the
question of
fraud might be material (see per Lord Chelmsford in <i>Bain v Fothergill</i>).
A breach of contract may be innocent, even accidental or unconscious, or it may
arise from a wrong view of the obligations created
by the contract.  <u>Or it
may be wilful, and even malicious and committed with the express intention of
injury the other party</u>.  But the measure of damages is not affected by any
such considerations.  A statement of claim which alleged that the defendant
wilfully
or maliciously or fraudulently committed a breach of contract would
not gain any additional effect from the vituperative epithets,
which would
indeed be as irrelevant to the case as the ancient averment that a person
accused of an offence acted at the instigation
of the devil."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

220	In <b>Addis v Gramophone Company Limited</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1909/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1909] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1909%5d%20AC%20488" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1909] AC 488</a> a servant sued
for wrongful dismissal.  It was held that the damages could not include
compensation for the manner of the dismissal,
for injured feelings, or for loss
sustained from the fact that the dismissal of itself made it more difficult for
the servant to
obtain fresh employment.  Lord Loreburn LC, who gave the first
speech, commenced:-
<P>

	<b>"My Lords, this is a most unfortunate litigation, in which the costs must
far exceed any sum there may be at stake.  A little commonsense
would have
settled all these differences in a few minutes."</b>
<P>

221	If I may say so with respect these remarks remain as relevant, or perhaps
more so, to-day to much litigation which comes before
the Court, as they were
ninety years ago.
<P>

222	After considering the facts his Lordship said, p.490:-
<P>

	<b>"My Lords, it is difficult to imagine a better illustration of the way in
which litigation between exasperated litigants can breed
barren controversies
and increase costs in a matter of itself simple enough."</b>
<P>

223	On the point presently in issue he said, p.490:-
<P>

	<b>"To my mind it signifies nothing in the present case whether the claim is
to be treated as for wrongful dismissal or not.  In any
case there was a breach
of contract in not allowing the plaintiff to discharge his duties as manager,
and the damages are exactly
the same in either view.  They are, in my opinion,
the salary to which the plaintiff was entitled for the six months between
October
1905 and April 1906, together with commission which the jury think he
would have earned had he been allowed to manage the business
himself.  I cannot
agree that the manner of dismissal affects these damages.  Such considerations
have never been allowed to influence
damages in this kind of case."</b>
<P>

224	At p.493 Lord James of Hereford said:-
<P>

	<b>"I have been unable to find any case decided in this country in which any
countenance is given to the notion that a dismissed employee
can recover in the
shape of exemplary damages for illegal dismissal, in effect damages for
defamation, for it amounts to that, except
in the case of <i>Maw v
Jones</i>."</b>
<P>

225	At p.496 Lord Atkinson said that exemplary damages were not recoverable in
a case such as that before him.
<P>

226	In <b>Flamingo Park Pty Limited v Dolly Dolly Creation Pty Limited &amp;
Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2065%20ALR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 65 ALR 500</a>, at p.526, Wilcox J said that according to the 14th
Edition of <b>McGregor on Damages</b> there had never been an award of
exemplary damages for breach of contract, although he thought that there was a
suggestion that in
the wake of <b>Rookes v Barnard</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1964/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 1129</a> this may
now be possible in England.  His Honour continued:-
<P>

	<b>"It is not impossible to conceive of circumstances in which a defendant's
conduct, in relation to a breach of contract, will be conduct
of the type
attracting exemplary damages in tort.  However, that would probably be a rare
event; and if it arose it would be a matter
of policy for the Courts to
determine whether it was appropriate to extend what some see as an anomaly -
punishment in a civil action
- from tort into contract law.  The question does
not arise in the present case.  Although the circumstances of Mercedes' breach
of contract reflect no credit on that company, its behaviour does not merit the
epithets necessary, upon the traditional view, to
attract exemplary
damages."</b>
<P>

227	The matter was most recently considered by the High Court in <b>Gray v
Motor Accident Commission</b>.  That was a case involving tort liability in
circumstances where the tortious act was also a criminal act and the defendant
had
been punished by the criminal law.  It was held that the infliction of that
punishment for virtually the same conduct was a bar to
the award of exemplary
damages. 
<P>

228	In their joint judgment Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ noted the
distinction between aggravated and exemplary damages,
and that the case before
them was concerned with exemplary damages.  Their Honours did not doubt the
power to award exemplary damages
in dealing with tortious liability.  At
paragraph 13 they quoted from the passage in <b>Butler v Fairclough </b>to
which I have referred and continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The position is put somewhat differently in <i>Restatement (Second) of
Contracts</i>:</b>
<P>

<b>	`Punitive damages are not recoverable for a breach of contract unless the
contract constituting the breach is also a tort for which
punitive damages are
recoverable.'</b>
<P>

<b>	The reasons underlying the apparent rule excluding an award of exemplary
damages, even in cases of intentional or malicious breach
of contract, were
discussed by Friendly J in <i>Thyssen Inc v SS Fortune Star</i>.  That case
also is authority that an Admiralty Court does not award exemplary damages for
a deviation or other breach of contract."
</b>
<P>

229	In my opinion the mainstream of authority, which has been consistently
applied, precludes the award of exemplary damages for
breach of contract.
<P>

230	I have already expressed my views as to the conduct of Mr Papallo, and
therefore Rolando and Corbel, in calling upon the guarantees.
 I regard it as
high-handed and lacking due commercial justification.  If I had concluded that
exemplary damages were available,
I would, on the basis of that conduct, have
awarded $10,000 against each of Rolando and Corbel.  As I have said I do not
consider
Mr Papallo is liable for such damages.  None-the-less, for the reasons
to which I have referred the law does not recognise that exemplary
damages may
be awarded in those circumstances.  The same conclusion, I think, follows in
relation to aggravated damages, although,
as I have said, on the facts I do not
consider that aggravated damages would be awarded.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

231	In my opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages from Rolando
in the sum of $69,631 with interest at Supreme Court
rates, no other rate being
suggested, from 12 July 1995 to the date of judgment, and from Corbel in the
sum of $69,330 with interest
at the same rate for the same period.  
<P>

232	I consider that Rolando is entitled to recover damages from the plaintiffs
in the sum of $60,221.32 with interest at Supreme
Court rates from the date
when it outlaid those moneys to the date of judgment; and that Corbel is
entitled to recover damages from
the plaintiffs in the sum of $130,364.59 with
interest at Supreme Court rates from the date when it outlaid those moneys to
the date
of judgment.
<P>

233	I consider that there should be a judgment in favour of Mr Papallo.
<P>

234	The parties should bring in short minutes of order reflecting the
judgments, which, conformably with these reasons, should be
entered, at which
time I shall hear submissions on costs.
