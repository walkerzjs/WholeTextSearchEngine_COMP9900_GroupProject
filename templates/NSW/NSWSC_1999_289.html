DECISION: 
<P>

SEE PARAGRAPH 34
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> Zdenko Josef Caska late of Longueville New South Wales
Retired Medical Practitioner died on 24 September 1991 aged 72 years.  He
was
survived by his widow Mrs Sarah Caska the defendant, and by the four adult sons
of his first marriage.  The Testator's first
wife Mrs Anna Caska, whom he
married in 1940, died on 7 August 1974.  The Testator married the defendant on
9 October 1976.
<P>

2	The defendant obtained from this Court Probate dated 16 September 1992 of the
Testator's Will dated 30 June 1989 and Codicil dated
23 June 1991.  Claims by
two of his sons for orders under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i> 1982</a> were
heard together.  The plaintiffs are the Testator's eldest son Dr John Pius
Caska who was born in Germany on 6 December 1944
and his youngest son Mr
Michael Ferdinand Caska who was born in Australia on 20 September 1951.
<P>

3	The Testator's two other sons Dr Peter Caska and Dr Paul Caska are twins born
in Germany on 11 February 1946;  they did not bring
claims to hearing, although
Dr Peter Caska at one time was named as a plaintiff;  he withdrew his claim.
<P>

4	In considering an application for provision under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act
1982</a> and applying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> and subs 9 (2) of that Act the Court follows a process
described in the judgment of Mason CJ Deane J and McHugh J in <i>Singer v
Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> at 208-209:-
<P>

	<i>"It is clear that, under these provisions, the court is required to carry
out a two-stage process.  The first stage calls for a determination
of whether
the applicant has been left without adequate provision for his or her proper
maintenance, education and advancement in
life.  The second stage, which only
arises if that determination be made in favour of the applicant, requires the
court to decide
what provision ought to be made out of the deceased's estate
for the applicant.  The first stage has been described as the `jurisdictional
question'  See e.g. White v. Barron <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1924/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980), 144 CLR 431</a>, at p. 456;
Bondelmonte v.Blanckensee,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20W%20A%20R%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] W A R  305</a>, at p. 307;  Golosky (unreported;
N S W Court of Appeal;  5 October 1993).  That description means no more than
that the court's
power to make an order in favour of an applicant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 7</a> is
conditioned upon the court being satisfied of the state of affairs predicated
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 9(2)(a)."</a></i>
<P>

Later at 209 their Honours also said:-
<P>

	<i>"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
`inadequate for [his or her] proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life"?  The difference between `adequate' and `proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between `adequate
provision' and `proper
maintenance' etc. was explained in Bosch v. Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. [1938] A
C , at p. 476.  The determination
of the first stage in the two-stage process
calls for an assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was inadequate
for what,
in all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc.
appropriate for the applicant having regard, amongst other things,
to the
applicant's financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate,
the totality of the relationship between the
applicant and the deceased, and
the relationship between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate
claims upon his or her
bounty.</i>
<P>

<i>	The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations. Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like Ellis v. Leeder <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2082%20C%20L%20R%20645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 82 C L R 645</a>, where there were no assets from which
an order could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the
testator's arrangements
to pay creditors."</i>
<P>

5	It is difficult entirely to separate the two stages;  see their Honours'
further observations at 210-211.
<P>

6	Claims by adult sons do not involve special principles, as they once were
thought to do, and there is no requirement for an adult
son to prove a special
need or special claim; see <i>Hunter v Hunter &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR
573.</a>
<P>

7	At the time of the hearing the agreed nett value of the assets in the estate
was $750,495.00.  In addition there had been two
interim distributions
totalling $33,069.32 to the Plaintiff Michael Ferdinand Caska.  The estate
assets consisted of two properties
at 419 and 421 Ocean Beach Road Umina Beach
used or formerly used for a residence and medical practice, a home unit at
17/44 Grosvenor
Street Summer Hill, money on deposit at a bank, money held in a
solicitor's trust account and a loan to the trustee of the Harovance
Trust.
Disregarding for limited purposes the interim distributions, the value of the
estate assets should be taken to be $783,564.32.
<P>

8	The costs of the proceedings will be considerable, as the hearing took six
days.  There is no evidence establishing exactly what
the costs are, but they
are probably in the order of $50,000.00.  These figures suggest that the amount
available for distribution
(after adding back the interim distributions) should
be treated as $733,564.32.  Michael Ferdinand Caska's one-sixth share should
be
taken as $122,260.00 and the undistributed balance $89,191.00.  The figures are
not precise, but indicate generally the provision
still available for him.
<P>

9	The Testator's second marriage was long and happy and he regarded the
defendant very highly.  The defendant bore significant burdens
of care during
his last years of declining health.  The defendant has significant resources of
her own as well as the assets which
pass to her under the Testator's Will.  Her
benefits under the Will are estimated to be worth $503,858.00 (Ex. AJ).  She
owns her
home in Longueville:  there is no reliable evidence of its value,
variously asserted to be $800,000.00 and $1,100,000.00, but it
is a substantial
house and she is unlikely ever to sell it, unless her circumstances change very
greatly.  Her other assets are valued
at $419,800.00 (Ex.AF).  She also has,
for practical purposes, power of disposition over the assets of the Harovance
Trust, and can
direct benefits to herself.  Provision for the plaintiffs, even
of several hundred thousand dollars, would leave her with significant
assets,
and with income, most notably income from the Brisbane Waters Private Hospital
and consequent discretionary distributions
by the Harovance Trust.
<P>

10	By his Will the Testator gave his widow a motor car, some items of jewellery
and furniture, eight shares in Harovance Pty Limited
and two thirds of the
residue of his estate.  He gave each of his four sons two shares in Harovance
Pty Limited.  He gave one sixth
of the residue of his estate to Mr Michael
Ferdinand Caska, and one sixth to trustees for the Testator's twelve
grandchildren.  The
Codicil did not alter these dispositions.
<P>

11	The Testator made different provisions to operate in case the defendant did
not survive him for one month, and in that case his
executors were to be Dr
John Pius Caska and Dr Peter Caska.  Each son was to receive four shares in
Harovance Pty Limited, Michael
Ferdinand Caska was to receive sixteen
ninetieths (a little over one sixth) of the residue, each other son was to
receive a tenth
of the residue and the remaining forty seven ninetieths of the
residue was to be divided among named relatives, including the defendant's
children, and the testator's grandchildren.
<P>

12	The gift of shares in Harovance Pty Limited, together with other shares
which the defendant already had, gave her voting control
over the trustee and,
in effect, control over the trust and discretions as to the application of
trust property;  in reality, complete
control over the assets.  It is so
unlikely as to be disregarded that any discretion will be exercised to confer a
significant benefit
on one of the plaintiffs.  The Harovance Trust at the date
of hearing held (Exhibit AF) cash and other investments, and a large investment
in the Brisbane Waters Private Hospital, consisting of both shares and trust
units, and the net value of trust assets was $516,107.00.
 The defendant's
power to control the trust means that for practical purposes this should be
regarded as at her disposition.  It
was contended that the dispositions in the
Will of shares in Harovance Pty Ltd to sons of the Testator show that in his
belief the
sons were to have shares in the trust funds:  there is no good basis
for this, especially as the Will shows signs that it was prepared
by a legal
adviser.
<P>

13	Dr John Pius Caska's claim for provision for his advancement in life was
expressed by him in terms of a claim to provide himself
with a house or to
assist him to obtain a house.  He is a medical practitioner with a general
practice;  his practice earnings vary
from year to year but the net earnings
are in the order of $200,000.00 per year.  He is divorced and is at present
enmeshed in proceedings
before the Family Court relating to the maintenance of
his three daughters, who are still of school age.  He has a number of actual
or
potential health problems, not unduly severe having regard to his age, and they
do not disable him from earning;  there is a potential
that they may bring his
working life to an end, but evidence does not establish when that is likely to
be and I expect him to continue
earning at a high rate for a number of years.
In my finding he does not have a need for provision for his maintenance out of
the
Testator's estate.
<P>

14	Dr John Pius Caska's financial affairs generally are in a very poor state.
He is the co-owner with a partner of a valuable rural
property, but it has been
conducted with severe losses for many years, and he is now facing the need to
resolve his dealings with
his bank, and with other creditors to which he is
indebted for large amounts, solely or with a partner.  He produced a table of
his
affairs which is very difficult to follow but which seems to show, if all
his valuations are accepted (and they were not proved in
any clear way) a
deficiency in which his liabilities exceed his assets by about $280,000.00.
That calculation assumes that he will
bear the burden of a liability which
ought to fall on his partner in the contingency that the partner is unable to
pay.  If that
did not happen his liabilities would be approximately equal to
his assets.   This does not necessarily represent an accurate foresight
of what
is likely to happen;  it is unlikely that there will be one general winding-up
of his affairs in the near future, as he has
a number of creditors, his
relationships with them differ and he faces a lengthy and I would think
difficult period of negotiation
and resolution which may take several years.
In October 1998 his bank served on him a Bankruptcy Notice for an overwhelming
sum,
over l7 million dollars, but it is unlikely that this heralds bankruptcy
proceedings as the bank may take the view that its interests
would be better
served by realising its securities before precipitating bankruptcy.
<P>

15	If a large sum, even several hundred thousand dollars, came to hand for Dr
John Pius Caska by way of provision from the Testator's
estate it is very
unlikely that it would be applied to provide him and his dependants with
housing  It is far more likely that it
would be seized by a judgment creditor
or consumed in the struggle to satisfy creditors or keep them at bay, while an
eventual outcome
in availability of housing would not emerge for some years,
cannot be clearly foreseen and is on the whole unlikely.  The likelihood
is
that any provision ordered to be made would go to the benefit of creditors,
while any benefit ultimately to Dr John Pius Caska
would be long postponed and
its nature and the time of its enjoyment is not possible to predict.  Payment
of a large sum, even several
hundred thousand dollars, to him out of the
Testator's estate is not actually likely to operate as provision for his
advancement
in life.
<P>

16	It is difficult to understand how his affairs came to this pass.  The rural
investment has operated with large losses for many
years and in hindsight it
seems most unwise that he has stayed in it.  It is not in my understanding a
purpose which orders under
this legislation should serve to rescue long-term
bad investments.  Overall, Dr John Pius Caska as a professional man long
established
in practice and actually earning professional earnings in the order
of $200,000.00 a year, even with his manifold financial difficulties,
appears
to me to have reached the state of being established in life which takes him
altogether out of consideration as a person
for whom provision ought to be made
by his father out of an estate of $780,000.00 left for the most part to the
Testator's widow.
 This is not a case where the Testator had very great wealth,
or where there was great wealth elsewhere in the family.
<P>

17	Dr John Pius Caska's position in life and earning capacity were attained
with very large assistance from the Testator.  The Testator
and his first wife
arrived in Australia as immigrants in 1949.  It was necessary for the Testator
to qualify as a medical practitioner
again, and to work in subordinate
positions in the medical world while doing so.  He passed through these
difficulties while having,
eventually, a wife and four children as dependants.
He established himself in medical practice at Umina from 1954 onwards.  He
provided
the means for Dr John Pius Caska's schooling and education in medicine
at the University of Sydney, including the provision of a
flat for him and his
student brothers in Sydney, with food, a motor car and other maintenance needs.
He received Dr John Pius Caska
into the practice soon after he graduated, and
he gave Dr John Pius Caska the assistance of a home and establishment during
his long
bachelorhood.  He also assisted him early in his rural ventures, and
participated in them, although he came to take an unfavourable
view of rural
ventures and withdrew from them.
<P>

18	About 1988 a conflict arose among the members of the associateship, not it
would seem in strictness a partnership, which conducted
the medical practice,
and the dispute and litigation related in some way which is not established
fully or clearly to entitlements
to possession of the premises in which the
practice was conducted, which the Testator owned.  In that litigation the
Testator and
Dr John Pius Caska were on opposite sides of the record;  the
proceedings were settled but left the Testator with strongly adverse
feelings
towards the other associates, including Dr John Pius Caska.  The Testator's
feelings may not have been entirely just and
reasonable, as Dr John Pius Caska
did not join with the other associates in the litigation;  he took a separate
position and was
separately represented, and he was not a caveator of the
caveat which the Testator was seeking to have removed.  However that may
be the
Testator saw Dr John Pius Caska as one of those ranged against him, and not as
an ally in support.
<P>

19	In the last three or four years of the Testator's life the relationship
between him and Dr John Pius Caska was severely deteriorated
and characterised
by savage exchanges.  In letters and other documents which he prepared in and
around 1989 the Testator recorded
very strong feelings adverse to Dr John Pius
Caska;  indeed savage antipathy, and recorded many instances of Dr John Pius
Caska's
conduct, in long past years as well as in recent years, of which he
took severely adverse views.  Dr John Pius Caska for his part
also exhibited
savage antipathy in a letter Exhibit 5 which he sent to the Testator soon after
Dr John Pius Caska's wedding, nominally
expressing filial duty but clearly
showing deep resentment and hostility towards the Testator and more
particularly towards the defendant.
 The position of the Testator was not
entirely meritorious in the events which led to this antipathy, but it is quite
clear that
Dr John Pius Caska also was not in a meritorious position.  He did a
number of things which the Testator resented;  in particular
he expressed
adverse feelings relating to the defendant which cannot fail to have deeply
offended an elderly parent who treated his
second marriage and his second wife
with high esteem.
<P>

20	Many aspects of relationships within the family were combative and the
Testator showed that he was well capable of combat.  He
arranged to have
himself examined and reported on by a psychiatrist when he made his Will, with
favourable results, so that his testamentary
capacity cannot be doubted.  This
shows that he was well aware of potential conflict.  Five witnesses who are
general practitioners
expressed in various forms views to the effect that in
and about 1989 the Testator was showing signs of early dementia.  I do not
accept however that he was suffering from early dementia, having regard to the
specialist opinion, and also to the vigour and clarity
of expression and
thought of documents written by the Testator about that time.
<P>

21	At earlier times when the Testator experienced a personal crisis after the
death of his first wife requiring treatment for nervous
disorder, Dr John Pius
Caska assisted him loyally as was appropriate for a son.
<P>

22	Overall, having regard to the overwhelming balance of benefits and
advantages conferred earlier in life by the Testator on Dr
John Pius Caska, far
in excess of any burdens borne, and having regard to the severely deteriorated
relationship in the final years,
the Testator's not have made any effectual
provision for Dr John Pius Caska in his Will is well explained.  He did make
some provision
in the contingency that the first defendant did not survive;
that did not take effect.  The fact that the contingent provision was
made
shows that their family relationship had not entirely come to an end.
<P>

23	In my judgment the claim of Dr John Pius Caska cannot receive a favourable
answer at either stage of the two stage process described
in <i>Singer v
Berghouse</i>.  He has not been left without adequate provision for his proper
maintenance;  his earning capacity attends fully to that need. 
He has not been
left without adequate provision for his advancement in life;  his advancement
in life was fully attended to long
ago, and it has been in his own hands for
decades, and, addressing the second stage (and I find it difficult to separate
them) my
decision is that no provision ought to be made out the Testator's
estate for his advancement in life;  and further if I were to order
provision,
the order would probably fail to produce any effect in terms of actual
provision.
<P>

24	Mr Michael Ferdinand Caska, who represented himself, is within a class of
adult sons who have long been recognised as candidates
for provision.  It is no
longer necessary to fall within that class to obtain consideration;  he clearly
does.  The Testator provided
for Mr Michael Ferdinand Caska's schooling in
Gosford, and extended his schooling for a year to enable him to enhance his
prospects
of University entrance;  and provided for him to live in a University
College for three years while he studied medicine at the University
of New
South Wales.  Mr Michael Ferdinand Caska passed the first year after repeating
his studies, but did not pass the second year
and withdrew from the University.
He then married and was for a time thoroughly estranged from his father.  He
lived in very poor
circumstances with his wife in Brisbane, took up studies in
medicine there without success, and received some assistance from his
father.
This assistance was jealously watched and withdrawn when his father thought
appropriate.  Mr Michael Ferdinand Caska at one
time lived under an assumed
name, and says that the Testator engaged private investigators to find out
something - it is not clear
what - about him.  He appears to have last
attempted medical studies in 1975.
<P>

25	After that Michael Ferdinand Caska worked for a time in insurance and then
in a clerical position in the Department of Taxation.
 He qualified for
admission to the Bar by Barristers' Admission Board study and was admitted in
1982;  he says that his father congratulated
him.  However he did not attempt
to practice law.  For many years he supported himself by driving taxis.  In
this way he became established
in life and self-supporting, according to what
in reality are his abilities.  He was divorced;  he had relationships with
other women
which have ended.  In 1995 he lost his Taxi Authority on the basis
of a complaint by passengers to the effect that he had behaved
indecently and
dangerously while driving a cab;  he disputes this claim, and has challenged it
unsuccessfully in Court;  and some
appeal proceedings are still pending.  He is
unemployed and has been for about four years, supported by social benefits and
by some
assistance from his brothers.  He has put much endeavour into seeking
employment, with official guidance which is a condition of
his social benefits,
but this has not been effectual.  He lives in very poor circumstances in cheap
accommodation at the Bay View
Hotel at Woy Woy;  at a minimal standard of
comfort and convenience.
<P>

26	Michael Ferdinand Caska can barely support himself on his social benefits.
He has a number of obligations including particularly
fines and costs totalling
about $14,000.00 imposed on convictions (and appeals) for driving a taxi
without a Taxi Authority.  Although
he disputes the justice of the decision to
take away his Taxi Authority and of the penalties imposed on him I am of the
view that
for present purposes I should not attempt to review those decisions,
and I accept them as correct.  Correct or not they are facts;
 he does not have
a Taxi Authority and he has large penalties to face.  He has hopes of
employment.  He genuinely holds hopes of
entering legal practice, but the long
interval since he was admitted to the Bar, his age and the lack of any relevant
experience,
and the manner in which he conducted these proceedings in person,
including his affidavits (and he filed about thirty) lead me to
find that it is
improbable that he could ever earn his living at the Bar or otherwise in legal
practice.
<P>

27	Although Michael Ferdinand Caska is a man of education, and has absorbed
much of his education well, and in some ways can express
himself well, he is
for some reason unable to engage properly with the world of practicalities.  He
will be able to become self-supporting
when he finds employment of a general
nature for which his experience equips him such as driving courier vehicles or
other vehicles,
or if he ever recovers his Taxi Authority.  The lack of success
of his four-year search for employment is remarkable, and shows his
difficulty
in engaging with reality.  When he makes an address to the need to provide for
himself by working, he will probably recover
his economic independence at the
kind of level he long achieved by driving taxis.  In the past he has been
something of an athlete
although this is not longer so.  He put forward as
needs a number of matters which I regard as fanciful, such as a touring cycle
and equipment to join a bicycle club, martial arts training and an overseas
holiday;  these claims show that his thinking is at a
distance from reality.
He has musical ability which is clearly real and he put forward claims for
musical instruments which I do
not regard as realistic.  He also put forward a
claim to be provided with housing, which he said would cost in the order of
$200,000.00
on the Central Coast, and a claim to be provided with a taxi plate
which he said would cost in the order of $280,000.00, or a vehicle.
 These
claims are out of scale with anything which should be provided by a parent, or
which should be ordered by the Court as a provision
out of the estate.
<P>

28	He referred here and there throughout his diffuse evidence to many debts,
obligations and proposed expenditures.  Some of these,
fines costs and
witnesses' expenses of unsuccessful proceedings, are not sums which it could be
just to include in any provision
to be ordered for him at the expense of the
defendant or of other beneficiaries.  For the most part the proposed
expenditures relate
to projects which are not practicable or not necessary. A
practical training course at the College of Law is not an expense which
it
would be prudent for him to incur.  The debts for things such as dental care,
hotel accommodation and furniture storage, clothing
and shoes are well within
the scale of things he can cope with out of his own resources including
provision under the Will.
<P>

29	In my judgment the Testator went as far it could be said that he ought as a
father to have gone in endeavouring to establish
Mr Michael Ferdinand Caska in
life.  His medical studies simply did not succeed. Michael Ferdinand Caska
complained that his father
did not offer him any assistance in establishing
himself at the Bar;  however he did not ask or press his father to do so, and
it
is very unlikely that he would have made a success of the Bar or that any
resources used to that end would be well spent.  He was
able to continue to
function as a taxi driver and to maintain himself for a number of years, until
he lost that opportunity from
circumstances which I must attribute to his own
misconduct.
<P>

30	The relationship between the Testator and Michael Ferdinand Caska became
severely deteriorated.  There was a particularly clear
and gross
exemplification in the transcribed passage of the tape recording Exhibit 14
which Mr Michael Ferdinand Caska sent to his
father as a communication in 1986.
In the passage transcribed Michael Ferdinand Caska beset the Testator with a
number of speculations
and observations, very difficult to follow but plainly
wounding, about the Testator's early life and conduct during and after The
Second World War.  The observations in the transcript reveal an astonishing
lack of sensitivity to the feelings of a person who experienced
the hard
destiny of living in Germany during The Second World War, with a German wife
but not himself a German. Michael Ferdinand
Caska beset his father with
wounding and belittling speculations about his father's behaviour, in no way
clear or conclusive but
obviously bound to be distasteful.  The Testator
responded with a severely expressed and characteristically forceful refutation,
and there seems to have been very little in the relationship after that.
<P>

31	In the statement (Exhibit 3) made and signed by the Testator on 15 March
1989 explaining the terms of an earlier Will (not his
last Will, but with
somewhat similar provisions) the Testator recognised that Mr Michael Ferdinand
Caska needed support and financial
help.  His appraisal was:-
<P>

	<i>"He did not succeed in establishing himself in society, due largely to his
unwillingness to start at the bottom and work his way up
the successful ladder
of life.  Michael has for some time developed a very antagonistic attitude to
me making no bones about the
fact that he expects me to continue to retrieve
him from all his financial follies, which I do not propose to do.  He is also
encouraged
in these expectations by his brother John, who put constant and
stressful pressure on me during 1988 to retrieve Michael, for sums
up to
$80,000.00.  I could not do this then, and will not do so, it is throwing good
money after bad.</i>
<P>

<i>	During discussions with my sons John, Peter and Paul, re Michael's mental
stability, it was decided that due to my own ill health
at the time, John
should arrange for Michael to see psychiatrist, but Michael would not
co-operate, and despite my constant appeal
to him to seek help he refused, and
in fact Michael has not been in contact with me for about twelve months - he is
still driving
taxis as far as I know."</i>
<P>

32	This with the provisions of his Will, shows that the Testator did not take
as adverse a view of Michael Ferdinand Caska as might
have been taken in view
of his behaviour, and as might have been understood from the Testator's written
response to the message on
the tape in 1986.  The provisions of the Will
reflect the understanding of Michael Ferdinand Caska's needs expressed in
Exhibit 3;
 assistance for a son who did not succeed in establishing himself in
society.  The provision under the Will is sufficient to enable
Michael
Ferdinand Caska to resolve pressing claims on him;  indeed he has used interim
payments to date for that purpose.  He has
also spent some of the interim
payments on things which are altogether unsuitable to his circumstances, and he
has shown extravagance.
 He is however in charge of himself;  he is not shown
by any evidence to be suffering from any mental illness or any incapacity for
conducting his affairs which marks him out from the community at large.  The
provision made in the Will is sufficient to enable him
to supplement from time
to time his support of himself by his own earnings, and from social benefits
when he does not have earnings,
by giving him a fund to draw upon when crises
require.
<P>

33	The circumstances in which he is no longer able to earn his living as a taxi
driver do not qualify him for provision out of property
owned by others:  it is
not a provision which a parent ought to make to rescue him from his loss of his
earning capacity as a taxi
driver, in view of the circumstances in which he
lost it, or to pay his fines or costs orders.  He will however have funds
available
out of the provision made under the Will on which to draw from time
to time to ensure that he has accommodation suitable to his modest
circumstances,  and to tide him over crises.  In my judgment the Testator by
the provisions of his Will fully met everything that
was required of him by way
of provision for maintenance for Michael Ferdinand Caska, having regard to the
value of the estate.
