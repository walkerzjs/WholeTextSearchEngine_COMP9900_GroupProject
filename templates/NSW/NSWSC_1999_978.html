070097/97	<b>REGINA   v   ANDREW JAMES PAPANDREA</b>
<P>

SENTENCE
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  On 19 March 1999 the prisoner, Andrew James
Papandrea, pleaded not guilty before Mr Justice Barr on the presentation
of an
indictment charging him with having murdered Guy Piers Janjic at Binna Burra on
15 May 1997.  The prisoner adhered to that
plea in this Court on 10 August 1999
and his trial began before a jury.
<P>

2  	However on 16 August 1999, on the morning of the fifth day of the
trial, the prisoner sought to be re-arraigned and on this
occasion whilst
pleading not guilty to murder pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  The Crown
accepted that plea in satisfaction of the
indictment.  Following <i>Maxwell v
The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20184%20CLR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 184 CLR 501</a> it is settled that a trial judge cannot
reject a plea such as that entered here unless it is perceived that the
prosecution acted
irresponsibly in accepting the plea to the lesser offence:
see in particular the joint judgments of Dawson and McHugh JJ at 514 and
of
Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 355-356.  No such perception was warranted in this
case and accordingly the jury was discharged pursuant
to s 399A of the
<i>Crimes Act</i>.  The prisoner was convicted of the crime of manslaughter and
was remanded until 17 August 1999 for the taking of evidence and receiving
submissions on sentence.  Having heard the submissions of counsel on 17 August,
I remanded the prisoner in custody for sentence on
a date to be fixed.
<P>

3  	It is necessary now to address the facts in this matter.
<P>

4  	The deceased died from the effects of a shotgun wound to his
chest.  The weapon from which the shot was fired was a single barrelled
shotgun
that the prisoner had acquired some weeks prior to the shooting.  The shooting
occurred at the prisoner's home at Binna Burra
at about 3.00 am on 15 May 1997.
The prisoner had known the deceased for two to three years and he invited the
deceased to stay overnight
at the prisoner's home after the two men had been
intermittently in each other's company at Byron Bay during the two days that
preceded
the shooting.  The prisoner went to Byron Bay on 13 May and he met the
deceased there.  The two men became involved in discussions
to do some work at
the Epicentre at Byron Bay.  On 13 May the prisoner said he had half a bottle
of Jack Daniels and approximately
five smokes of cannabis (T 168).  He slept in
his car that night.  On the following day he met the deceased and they each had
an
injection of heroin and smoked cannabis.  The prisoner said that he and the
deceased had a beer and some bourbon sometime about the
middle of the day (T
171).  They separated for a time and the prisoner had <i>"a few"</i> Jack
Daniels whilst he was at the RSL club during the afternoon.  Then he and the
deceased set off together for the prisoner's home,
stopping on the way at the
Bangalow Hotel and the prisoner said he had one more Jack Daniels there (T
175).
<P>

5  	The evidence of the prisoner's wife satisfies me that the men
arrived at the prisoner's home about 10.00 pm.  Thereafter the
prisoner and the
deceased had some beer and they both smoked cannabis from a bong.  The prisoner
prepared some food which the deceased
was in the process of eating when he was
shot.
<P>

6  	The evidence does not permit me to make a precise finding as to
what the prisoner had to drink or as to the precise extent of
his other drug
abuse.  There is no reliable evidence as to the prisoner's state of sobriety
and the prisoner's wife, the ambulance
officers, and the police officers who
attended the home shortly after the shooting gave no evidence of making any
observation as
to the prisoner's state of sobriety.  It is clear that the
prisoner regularly abused drugs and alcohol and in these circumstances
I am
unable to determine with accuracy their effect upon him at the time of the
shooting.  Analysis of blood taken from the deceased
showed the concentrations
of alcohol, morphine and cannabinoids in the deceased's blood but I consider it
would be unreliable to
draw any parallel from this evidence in attempting to
assess the impact of the pre-shooting drug abuse upon the prisoner.
<P>

7  	Even if the prisoner was intoxicated, and I do not find that he
was, his state was self-induced and, of course, s 428E of the
<i>Crimes Act</i>
provides that evidence of self-induced intoxication is not to be taken into
account in determining whether the prisoner had the requisite
mens rea for
manslaughter.  Mr Bruce tendered a report from Professor Neering (Exhibit A).
Professor Neering was given a history
of the prisoner's drug and alcohol intake
prior to the shooting which does not strictly accord with the prisoner's
evidence before
the Court.  In any event, Professor Neering found himself
unable on the history he had to determine <i>"with any degree of precision"</i>
the <i>"overall effect"</i> of the drugs the prisoner had taken.  Nor did
Professor Neering feel capable of assessing the effect of the alcohol without a
complete
history of the prisoner's long term resort to alcohol.  I have not in
the circumstances found Professor Neering's report helpful.
<P>

8  	It seems to me to be likely that the prisoner's inhibitions were
loosened by what he had had to drink and by his abuse of drugs,
and that his
co-ordination, his concentration and his judgment may have been somewhat
impaired.  This may go some way to explaining
the prisoner's behaviour but it
certainly does not excuse it.
<P>

9  	The prisoner's wife went to bed after watching a television
programme that began at 12.30 am and ended at 1.00 am.  According
to her
evidence, and I see no reason to reject it, the relationship between the
prisoner and the deceased appeared cordial. This
witness noticed nothing in the
nature of a quarrel, and although she heard voices after she went to bed they
plainly did not convey
to her that any quarrel was occurring.
<P>

10  	How then, and in what circumstances, did the shooting occur?
<P>

11  	It was submitted by the Crown that I should approach the case as
one of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.  Mr Bruce
accepted this for
the purpose of his submissions.  In accepting the prisoner's plea of guilty to
manslaughter in satisfaction of
the indictment, the Crown has accepted that the
prisoner did not shoot the deceased either with intent to kill or with intent
to
cause bodily harm, and I must approach my task in sentencing the prisoner
upon the basis that he entertained no such intent.  On
the other hand, by his
plea of guilty to manslaughter, the prisoner acknowledged, contrary to his
assertions immediately after the
shooting, that the act of firing the shotgun
was deliberate, even though that act was not accompanied by the intent required
to establish
the crime of murder.
<P>

12  	There was evidence, to my mind compelling, that the front end of
the shotgun must have been at the very outside one metre away
from the deceased
when the shotgun was discharged.  Indeed, it may have been as close as 300 mm
away.  I accept the evidence that
Sgt Charleston gave about this.  I accept
also the evidence which Mr Wrobel gave, but before referring to this expert
evidence I
should address the evidence of Dr Schwartz who conducted the post
mortem examination.
<P>

13  	The post mortem examination revealed a shotgun wound to the
right side of the chest of the deceased which was 25 mm x 35 mm
with an
abrasion cuff on the lower and outer margin.  The upper margin of the wound was
serrated but the lower margin of the wound
was sharp.  Dr Schwartz said that
the direction of the wound track was from right to left, backwards and
downwards.  In the conduct
of the post mortem examination wads from the shotgun
cartridge were found inside the deceased's body on the front surface of
thoracic
vertebrae 9 and 10 and most of the pellets lodged there as well.  To
the extent that the entry wound was serrated, this was consistent
with the shot
fired having started to spread in its movement away from the muzzle of the gun.
Whilst Dr Schwartz acknowledged she
was not a ballistics expert, it was her
opinion, having considered the nature of the wound, that the shot was fired
from a distance
of about two to three feet.
<P>

14  	Sgt Charleston was present when the post mortem examination was
conducted and she noted the character of the entry wound on
the right side of
the chest of the deceased.  It was her opinion that the wound was consistent
with the impact of a single charge
of shot having entered the upper chest with
the shot passing through the body from right to left, from front to back and
slightly
downwards.  Sgt Charleston observed where most of the pellets finished
up inside the body and she also saw the wads.
<P>

15  	It was Sgt Charleston's opinion, based on the appearance of the
wound itself and taking into account the damage to the shirt
that the deceased
had been wearing, that the shot was fired from a point between 300 and 500 mm
away from the body.  That opinion
was strengthened by proximity test results.
What Sgt Charleston did was to fire the shotgun at a blotting paper target at
varying
distances from such target and then to study the nature of the damage
occasioned to the target.  The witness fired two shots from
each of the
distances from which test firing was done, save for the tests conducted from
6.5 metres, where three shots were fired.
 These test results also led the
witness to the opinion that the fatal shot was fired from a distance of 300 to
500 mm.  However
on cross examination the witness conceded that it was possible
that the shot might have been fired from one metre away, but definitely
from no
further away.
<P>

16  	Stubs from an appropriate testing kit were used on the hands of
the deceased, both palm and back.  These were sent off for
analysis by a
forensic officer attached to the Victorian Forensic Science Centre, Mr Harald
Wrobel.  He gave evidence that one of
the stubs showed shotgun residue
particles that had been found on the deceased's right palm.  That finding
indicated, according to
the witness, that the residue had been deposited there
by the discharge of the firearm and that the hand was in close proximity to
the
muzzle or the deceased handled the firearm itself.  From his experience,
particles of the type found would only travel about
half a metre, although in
cross examination he agreed that the range could have been as far as a
metre.
<P>

17  	The evidence I have reviewed leads me to find beyond reasonable
doubt that when the shotgun was discharged by the prisoner,
its muzzle was at
the very most one metre from the deceased's chest.  Allowing for the length of
the weapon which the prisoner was
holding, the prisoner was no more than two
metres away when the shotgun was discharged.
<P>

18  	The only direct account in sworn evidence of how the shooting
happened was the account given by the prisoner.  According to
him he had placed
his twelve gauge single barrelled shotgun on a table in the dining area of the
house.  The deceased was sitting
on a lounge by the fire, some distance from
the table where the shotgun had been placed.  The prisoner said that he had
brought the
gun out to clean it, that he had the weapon in his hand when his
child, sleeping in a bed in an adjacent alcove, woke up and spoke
to him.  He
swung round, still clutching the weapon, and stepped a couple of paces towards
the alcove.  He said that the deceased
then spoke to him and he swung around
towards the deceased and it was then that the shotgun went off.  
<P>

19  	Detective Senior Constable Cairnduff, who at the time of the
shooting was with the Lismore Crime Scene Forensic Services Group,
attended the
scene, and in the course of his investigations prepared a rough sketch plan of
the interior of the premises.  He measured
the distance from the table
indicated as having been the table where the gun had been resting to that part
of the lounge where the
deceased was sitting when he was shot as being a
distance of 6.5 metres.  Mr Bruce submitted that I should not find that the
shotgun
was discharged from that distance, and even without regard to the
evidence of the prisoner, he submitted that that measurement is
misleading and
indeed irrelevant.  Mr Bruce submitted that I would not find that the table was
where the plan shows it to have been,
and that I would not find that the
prisoner was standing at the point from which that measurement was taken at the
time the shot
was fired.  He submitted that I should find that the shotgun was
discharged when the prisoner was standing much closer to the lounge
room, and
in the approximate location where the prisoner placed himself with the "cross"
on Exhibit B.  The expert evidence which
I have reviewed convinces me that the
shot was not fired from that table.
<P>

20  	As to the prisoner's evidence however, I did not find the
prisoner to be a convincing witness.  In particular, I did not find
his account
as to how he happened to discharge the shotgun to be a credible account and I
do not accept it.  The prisoner's account
as to what he was doing when the gun
went off, given in the witness box at the trial, was not put forward in the
ERISP interview
in which indeed he denied firing the gun at all.  In response
to the following questions in the recorded interview, the prisoner
gave the
following answers:
<P>

<i>"Q168	And tell me, have you fired the weapon before tonight?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Never.</i>
<P>

<i>Q169	Or today?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Never, mate.  Never.</i>
<P>

<i>Q170	And can you - - -</i>
<P>

<i>A	I never fuckin' fired that weapon.  I didn't fire that fuckin' weapon
today either, right?</i>
<P>

<i>Q171	Right.</i>
<P>

<i>A	I've never fuckin' fired that weapon once, mate, ever, OK?</i>
<P>

<i>Q172	Can you tell - - -</i>
<P>

<i>A	Don't fuckin' say, don't put words into my mouth, mate.</i>
<P>

<i>Q173	That's all right.</i>
<P>

<i>A	Right.  No more.  I want a fuckin' lawyer.  Get fucked."</i>
<P>

21  	Sergeant Charleston tested the trigger mechanism of this weapon.
The firing mechanism required the hammer to be pulled back
manually and she
said that it was quite heavy to do this.  To fire the weapon required between
six and seven pounds pressure to be
applied to the trigger.  I refer to her
evidence at T 129-130:
<P>

<i>"Q.	The operation of the hammer is such where the trigger is depressed that
causes the hammer to fall forward?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And in turn, the hammer strikes the firing pin which in turn strikes the
back of the cartridge which causes it to discharge?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What sort of pressure is required for that weapon to cause the trigger to
fire to operate?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Between 6 and 7 pounds.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I think in your test that you did it was 6.5 to 7 pounds which means you
put pressure on the trigger of between six and a half
and seven pounds.  Is
that a light pressure for a gun?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would be average for this type of weapon.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It's quite a definitive movement that is required to cause the gun to
discharge?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Just show us then again how you go about it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	You push the trigger, the action release which is in front of the trigger
guard.  The action falls open.  You then place the shotgun
cartridge inside the
chamber, close the weapon, you then have to cock the weapon by pulling the
hammer to the rear.</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  Q.  What type of pressure is needed for doing that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Pulling the hammer to the rear, it's actually quite heavy.</i>
<P>

<i>CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Q.  I know you don't like to pull the trigger on an empty
chamber, but could you please show the jury what would
be required to cause the
hammer to fall forward?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	(Witness indicated).</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In doing that the hammer doesn't go all the way forward.  Why is
that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It's an internal safety mechanism on the weapon.  The weapon doesn't have
any external.  It's to save a knock that may happen to
the hammer.  It will not
travel forward onto the firing pin without the trigger being fully depressed to
the rear, so that if you
drop it or if you knock it it's still safe.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Even though the hammer might be dislodged and go forward it won't go all
the way to cause the gun to discharge?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In other words, you have got to pull the trigger and do it very
definitely otherwise the gun just won't go off?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If one's holding the gun, is it easy to discharge by its own weight in
the sense if I am walking along with the gun cocked and
open and loaded and I
am just sort of walking along with the gun in my hand such as it's hanging by
the trigger by its own weight,
would it readily go off?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  You need to pull the trigger."</i>
<P>

22  	Whilst Sgt Charleston did not herself test the gun to see if it
would discharge accidentally, the witness was present when
Mr Barber, a
forensic ballistics expert, did tests on behalf of the defence to see if the
gun might discharge accidentally.  In the
course of those tests the gun was
broken at the timber wrist of the butt but during tests the weapon did not
discharge, and Sgt Charleston's
conclusion, having observed these tests, was
that the weapon was not subject to accidental discharge.
<P>

23  	Mr Bruce cross examined this witness as to the circumstances in
which the weapon could discharge (T 146-148):
<P>

<i>"Q.	Do you recall the learned Crown had the gun by his side with the gun
being held by the trigger, the weight of the gun was taken
on the trigger?
Remember the example he gave earlier?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Okay, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You indicated in your opinion the gun wouldn't go off by its own
weight?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I am not sure if he then started moving.  Walking along with the total
weight of the gun on the trigger on its own, if someone
walked along, walked
along the street, could that cause the gun to discharge?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, that would depend on how you're holding it and how much force you
are sort of bouncing the gun in your hand.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Again, what if the weight of the gun is on the trigger in the downward
position as the Crown had indicated with just consistent
equal movement, no
jerking or anything like that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I still wouldn't expect it to, no.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You wouldn't go walking down the street like this with this gun, would
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Then bringing into the equation again this movement and perhaps at the
end of one of the arcs some jerk, is there a reasonable
possibility the gun
could go off then?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Without doing it - see, this weapon takes 7 pounds to activate the
trigger which is a fair force.  It would depend on a lot of
things, how you are
holding it, how you are swinging it, how much jerk you are putting into it.  It
is difficult to say unless you
do it yourself.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If we are walking along the street with the gun in hand just moving it
evenly and we trip in the gutter, there is a sudden jerking--</i>
<P>

<i>OBJECTION</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is that a reasonable possibility?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Once again, how hard and everything.  If you fall on the weapon while you
are holding the trigger, I could give you numerous--</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Not falling on the weapon, but walking with the weapon moving, you fall
and a sudden jerk is caused, is there a reasonable possibility
that this gun
will go off?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, if it is--</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  Q.  Whatever you do you need 7 pounds on the trigger?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Exactly.</i>
<P>

<i>BRUCE:  Q.  Again, just accepting this scenario that the gun, I will just
use a ruler, the gun is positioned as such with the stock
under here
(indicated), the gun facing slightly down, the finger just forward or just
touching the trigger, and a person like this
again with a movement roughly a
half circle and coming to a sudden halt, is there a reasonable possibility that
this gun would go
off here?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Two factors would make the gun go off, it is cocked or whether or not the
pressure that is applied to that trigger is 7 pound,
so I really can't say in
these instances.  They are the two things that dictate whether or not this gun
goes off, cocked and 7 pounds
on the trigger.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Accepting the gun is cocked, it really depends I suppose on the quickness
of the movement in the turning circle?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Sure.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the suddenness or the jolt, if I can put it that way, when you come
to a halt?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Sure."</i>
<P>

24  	I found Sgt Charleston to be a most impressive witness and
having considered her evidence and the other evidence in the prosecution
case,
I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:
<P>

(i)	the shotgun was discharged by the prisoner when the muzzle end of the
weapon was no more than one metre from the deceased;
<P>

(ii)	to discharge the shotgun required:
<P>

(a)	the hammer to be cocked, and this movement required quite heavy
pressure;
<P>

(b)	the exerting of between six and seven pounds pressure on the trigger to
force it right back;
<P>

(iii)	the shot was fired with the weapon in such a position as to permit of the
path of the shot and the wads through the entry
wound on the deceased's body to
track from right to left, backwards and downwards.
<P>

25  	The prisoner gave evidence before the jury that he did not know
the shotgun was loaded, and that he did not think he put <i>"any cartridge in
anywhere"</i> (T 178).  The only person who the prisoner could suggest may have
loaded the weapon was the deceased, but in the course of cross
examination the
prisoner said that the cartridges he had been given when he acquired the
shotgun were kept under the sink and that
the deceased would not have known
where they were kept.  The prisoner admitted he lied to the police about how he
came to have possession
of the weapon and I do not accept the evidence that he
did not think he put the cartridge in it.
<P>

26  	The prisoner acquired this shotgun no more than a month before
the shooting and when it was acquired, the prisoner said by
way of a direct
exchange when he gave the previous owner a quantity of cannabis, the gun was in
poor condition.  According to the
prisoner he took it home and cleaned it and
he did not challenge the evidence that his wife had given that he cleaned the
gun three
nights before the shooting.  Mrs Papandrea gave evidence that she saw
the gun on the night of 12 May and that the prisoner cleaned
it using <i>"some
cleaning stuff"</i> that included WD40 and <i>"something to clean the pipe out
with"</i>.  Mrs Papandrea said that the prisoner pulled the weapon apart,
<i>"the pipe from the end of it"</i>.  I accept the evidence of Mrs Papandrea
to that effect.
<P>

27  	In cross examination the prisoner was asked these questions and
gave these answers (T 199):
<P>

<i>"Q.	See, it's a matter of sheer commonsense, Mr Papandrea.  You must have
known if there was a cartridge in that weapon the Monday
night you would have
known it, and you would have seen it.  That's right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So, was there a cartridge, or was there not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't see any cartridge in it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In cleaning this weapon, why did you not first of all check to see
whether it was loaded?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did.  There was no cartridge in it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Up until just a moment ago you weren't prepared to concede whether you
knew if it had a cartridge in it or not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If I was cleaning it up and I pulled it apart as it says it mustn't have
had a cartridge in it."</i>
<P>

28  	The conclusion is inescapable that the cartridge must have been
placed in the gun after that cleaning process at some time
between the cleaning
observed by the prisoner's wife and the shooting two nights later.  I am
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
this is what occurred, and that it was
the prisoner who loaded this weapon.  
<P>

29  	Mr Bruce submitted that I should identify the unlawful and
dangerous act on the evidence as according with the description
of the shooting
given by the prisoner.  Since I reject the prisoner's account of the shooting,
I cannot accept that submission. 
I identify the unlawful and dangerous act
which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence occurred as being
that the
prisoner, having cocked the hammer of the loaded weapon, pressed back
the trigger when the muzzle end of the weapon was proximate
to the deceased, at
no greater a distance than that which I have found, and at a time when the
weapon was pointing in the direction
of the deceased.  Precisely why the
prisoner did so, I am unable to determine and I must not speculate.  
<P>

30  	Of course I keep in mind that the prisoner is to be sentenced on
the basis that he did not intend to cause the death of the
deceased or to cause
him grievous bodily harm.  Nevertheless in the circumstances I have reviewed,
this shooting was unquestionably
a dangerous act and it caused death.
Objectively I view the features of this crime as very serious, and s 24 of the
<i>Crimes Act</i> provides for a maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter
of penal servitude for twenty-five years.
<P>

31  	I turn to consider the subjective features in this case.
<P>

32  	The prisoner is thirty-one years of age.  He is a married man
with two small children.  He has a criminal record, but with
the exception of
one offence, none of the other matters recorded against him attracted prison
sentences.  Leaving aside offences
dealt with at Children's Court level, the
prisoner has convictions for a number of driving offences, for offensive
language, for
resisting police, and for drug matters.  In June 1998 the
prisoner was sent to prison for six months for two offences of supplying
a
prohibited drug.  More recently he was placed on a recognizance in May this
year at the Burwood Local Court for larceny.  The last
two offences mentioned
were committed whilst the prisoner was on bail awaiting trial on the murder
charge.
<P>

33  	There are I observe no firearms offences on his record and the
prisoner has not committed any offence of violence to the person,
since the
offence of resisting police in October 1990.
<P>

34  	The prisoner was first given the indication that the Crown would
accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter in satisfaction of
the indictment on
the morning on which the plea was entered.  The entry of that plea was, of
course, fairly late in the course of
the trial, but the prisoner was given no
earlier incentive to enter such a plea and he is entitled to have that plea
taken into account
in his favour.  Some trial costs were saved, and the
prisoner sacrificed, in entering that plea, any possibility that the jury might
have found that the shooting was an accident.  I add, however, that on my
assessment of the evidence, the prospect of such a finding
was remote, but
nevertheless it would have been for the Crown to negative accident beyond
reasonable doubt.
<P>

35  	The actions of the prisoner from the time of the shooting were
consistent with the prisoner being sorry for what he had done.
 He called his
wife to help him in endeavouring to resuscitate the deceased and he himself
endeavoured to do this until the ambulance
arrived.  The evidence did not
reveal that the prisoner entertained any ill-will towards the deceased.  The
prisoner told Dr Westmore
on the occasion of his assessment in June 1999 that
he and the deceased got on well together and that they never argued.  There is
no evidence before me to the contrary.  I am prepared to accept Mr Bruce's
submission that the prisoner should be regarded as being
contrite for what he
has done.
<P>

36  	Dr Westmore's report dated 28 June 1999 sets out in considerable
detail the prisoner's history.  The report refers to a work
incident when the
prisoner sustained a head injury following a fall.  The prisoner gave evidence
concerning that matter and said
that he has been on medication since that
accident but not on a regular basis.  The medication he said was to help him to
sleep and
to alleviate pain.
<P>

37  	Dr Westmore recorded a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  The
prisoner apparently began to abuse alcohol at the age of sixteen
and by that
time he was already using cannabis.  The prisoner also described his use of
heroin and amphetamines.  The prisoner told
Dr Westmore that he came from a
stable family background but that his parents were very strict.  He was only
educated to Year 9,
apparently having been expelled for assaulting teachers.
Dr Westmore saw CT brain scan reports, apparently undertaken after the
prisoner's
work fall, and concluded his report by expressing the opinion that
the prisoner was not suffering from any mental illness.  Dr Westmore
said:
<P>

<i>"From a psychiatric perspective there is a history of a head injury and
alcohol and drug abuse and there are some personality factors
present in this
man but these factors do not appear to have any direct or immediate relevance
to the incident, certainly on the account
he provided to me."</i>
<P>

38  	The prisoner was in custody for fourteen days immediately
following his arrest on 15 May 1997 before being released on bail.
 He was
again taken into custody to serve the sentence for the drug offences to which I
earlier referred.  However, after the completion
of that sentence he remained
in custody for a further period of ten weeks before being re-admitted to bail
in relation to the murder
charge.  Bail was continued then until 10 August
1999.  In all, the prisoner has been in custody referable to the subject
offence
for a period of thirteen weeks and I take that into account in the
sentence I am shortly to impose.  When the prisoner was admitted
to bail in
February of this year a condition was imposed requiring him to live at Castle
Hill and to report daily to the officer
in charge of police at Castle Hill.  Mr
Bruce submitted that the prisoner was entitled to have the restrictive nature
of those bail
conditions taken into account on sentence.  Whether some credit
ought to be given for conditions of bail in a sentencing exercise
was
considered in <i>Cartwright</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 243</a> and in <i>King</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%2d99%29%2099%20A%20Crim%20R%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998-99) 99 A Crim R 288.</a>  In the latter case the submission that bail
conditions warrant reduction in a sentence as a matter of course was rejected:
see the
judgment of Hunt CJ at CL at 294.  I have heard no evidence in this
case as to particular hardship associated with the bail conditions
although I
am mindful that the prisoner was required to stay away from his home at Binna
Burra.  However, I am not persuaded on the
material before me that there should
be any reduction in a sentence otherwise appropriate because of the conditions
of bail set in
this court in February of this year.
<P>

39  	Mr Bruce tendered a number of achievement awards for courses
that the prisoner has undertaken in custody and he also tendered
a report from
a drug and alcohol counsellor.  That report is dated 15 September 1998 and it
was prepared at a time when the prisoner
was serving his prison sentence on the
supply prohibited drug offences.  Whilst it is to the prisoner's credit that he
achieved what
these exhibits record, it is to be observed that the prisoner's
behaviour in the days immediately before the subject offence was
committed is
indicative of further abuse of both drugs and alcohol.
<P>

40  	Mr Bruce submitted that I should find special circumstances in
this case particularly by reference to the ongoing need the
prisoner will have
when eventually he is released for supervision in relation to his drug and
alcohol problems and in the interests
of his rehabilitation.  I accept that
submission.
<P>

41  	In the course of his submissions Mr Bruce referred to a number
of unreported decisions.  He took me to the decision in the
Court of Criminal
Appeal in <i>R v Dunn</i> (unreported, 28 October 1997); to the decision of
Barr J in <i>R v McEwan</i> (unreported, 9 July 1998); and to the decision of
Levine J in <i>R v Sherry</i> (9 July 1999).  I have, of course, considered
those and other unreported decisions concerning penalties imposed in cases of
manslaughter,
including many cases where death was caused by the discharge of a
firearm.  I have also been referred to statistics on manslaughter
sentences.

<P>

42  	I do not propose in the course of this judgment to record the
judgments to which my research has taken me in this case as I
have sought to
arrive at an appropriate sentence.  It has often been observed that the range
of sentences for the crime of manslaughter
is so broad that it is difficult to
derive assistance from sentences passed in other cases, even within the same
category of manslaughter
and my recent research has emphasised this.  So much
depends upon the particular circumstances of each case.  In <i>R v Blacklidge
</i>(unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995), Gleeson CJ, with whom the other
members of the court agreed, said at p 4:
<P>

<i>"It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a
conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range
of degrees of
culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established
sentencing tariff which can be applied
to such cases.  Of all crimes,
manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting
culpability."</i>
<P>

43  	See, to the like effect, the dicta of Kirby P in <i>R v
Troja</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 16 July 1991) at p 3.
<P>

44  	The classification of this crime of manslaughter as manslaughter
by unlawful and dangerous act does not of itself assist in
arriving at an
appropriate sentence.  The range for sentences in this category of manslaughter
can differ markedly.  In the course
of his judgment in <i>R v Maguire</i>
(unreported, NSWCCA, 30 August 1995) James J said, in a judgment with which the
other members of the court agreed:
<P>

<i>"In some cases of voluntary manslaughter where, apart from the partial
defence of provocation or diminished responsibility, the prisoner
would have
been guilty of murder but the Crown has not succeeded in disproving either
provocation or diminished responsibility, a
heavy sentence will be appropriate.
But there will also be cases of involuntary manslaughter, that is cases of
manslaughter by unlawful
and dangerous act or manslaughter by criminal
negligence, where a heavy sentence will also be appropriate..."</i>
<P>

45  	I must fix a sentence which is appropriate to the prisoner's
crime and in doing so heed the importance of the gravity of the
crime as well
as the subjective features:  <i>R v Dodd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A Crim R 349</a> and in
particular at 354.
<P>

46  	My starting point must be to recognise that the prisoner's crime
involved the felonious taking of a human life.  Thus in <i>Blacklidge</i>
(supra) the Chief Justice said (at p 4):
<P>

<i>"At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved
in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking
of a human life.  That is
the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key
element in the assessment
of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the
case. (R v Dodd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A Crim R 349</a>; R v Hill  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%203%20A%20Crim%20R%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 3 A Crim R 397</a> at
402.)"</i>
<P>

47  	I must heed all the recognised principles of sentencing,
including retribution and deterrence, both general and specific. 
I must also
pay due regard to the subjective features of this case such as I have
reviewed.
<P>

48  	The Crown tendered a statement by Tracy Shaw, with whom the
deceased had a relationship and by whom the deceased had a son.
 That statement
has been received under Pt 6O of the Criminal Procedure Act.  In <i>R v
Previtera</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 A Crim R 76</a> it was made plain that it is inappropriate
for me to take account of the subject matter of that statement in determining a
proper
sentence for the prisoner.  However, a reading of the statement reveals
the impact which the death of the deceased has caused to
the author of the
statement and to the deceased's child.  The Court expresses its condolences and
it is to be hoped that the grief
experienced will be assuaged by the passage of
time.
<P>

49  	I have concluded that I should sentence the prisoner to a total
sentence of nine years penal servitude.  In doing so I am mindful
of the period
spent in custody prior to the commencement of the trial.  I am also mindful of
the fact that since the trial concluded
in Lismore the prisoner has been in
protective custody, because of death threats apparently, so I have been
informed, referable to
the commission of this crime.  I say referable to the
commission of this crime but I say no more about it.  I know no more about
it.
I do not know the source of the threats nor what is contemplated as to the
continuous of the protective custody.  No doubt after
the prisoner has been
sentence he will be settled in the long term in a particular prison and I have
been asked to recommend, and
I do recommend, that the prisoner serve his
sentence in Kirkconnell prison where visiting opportunities for his wife, his
parents
and his children can be apparently facilitated.  I am mindful, as I
have said, of the period spent in custody prior to the commencement
of the
trial and I also have regard to special circumstances in structuring the
sentence which I now fix.
<P>

50  	I pass sentence as follows:  I impose a minimum term of  six
years commencing 10 August 1999 and to expire on 9 August 2005
and an
additional term of three years commencing on 10 August 2005 and expiring on 9
August 2008.  I specify 10 August 2005 as the
first date the prisoner will be
eligible for release on parole.
