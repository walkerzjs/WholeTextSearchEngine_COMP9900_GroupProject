<P>

10696/99	<b>KEVIN PATRICK KENNEALLY   v   NEW ZEALAND</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is a summons for review of orders made by a
magistrate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act 1988</a></i> (Commonwealth).  The
plaintiff, Kevin Patrick Kenneally, named the Commonwealth Director of Public
Prosecutions as defendant, but
it was conceded that "New Zealand" should be
substituted as defendant and an order to that effect was made by consent.  The
summons
sought an order for review pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 35</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition
Act</a></i> but I was asked to treat the matter as a review and the hearing
proceeded on this basis.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act</a></b>
<P>

2  	At the outset it is desirable that I consider the relevant
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act</a></i> which deals exclusively with
extradition from Australia to New Zealand.  By way of background to it, I refer
to the Second Reading
Speech for the relevant Bill, which is conveniently set
out in <i>New Zealand v Venkataya</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2057%20FCR%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 57 FCR 151</a> at 163-164:
<P>

<i>"The Bill contains a special part which governs extradition relations with
New Zealand.  Our close ties with that country have made
appropriate a
reciprocal regime which bears a very close similarity to the extradition
relations between the various Australian States
and Territories contained in
the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901.  Fugitives are moved between
Australia and New Zealand
by a process based on the backing of warrants by
magistrates.  The whole process is normally handled by the police in exactly
the
same way as an interstate extradition would be handled.  The Bill's only
innovation in this area is to permit temporary surrender
to New
Zealand."</i>
<P>

3  	The first of the provisions in Pt 3 to which I refer is s 28.
Where an application is made in the statutory form for the endorsement
of a New
Zealand warrant under s 28(a), and the magistrate to whom the application is
made is informed by affidavit <i>"that the person for whose arrest the warrant
is in force is or is suspected of being in or on his or her way to
Australia"</i>, the magistrate <u>shall</u> endorse the warrant so as authorise
its execution in Australia.
<P>

4  	Then under s 32, following arrest on a warrant endorsed under s
28, the person arrested is to be brought before a magistrate
<i>"as soon as
practicable",</i> for remand for such period as may be necessary for the
purpose of proceedings under s 34.
<P>

5  	Section 34(1) provides that where a person has been remanded
following arrest upon an endorsed New Zealand warrant, and a request
has been
made for proceedings to be conducted under the section, the magistrate
<u>shall</u> order that the person be surrendered to New Zealand (s 34(1)(c)),
and order that the person be committed to prison pending surrender
to New
Zealand (s 34(1)(d)), <u>unless</u> the magistrate makes an order under s
34(2).  That sub-section I set out in full:
<P>

<i>"(2)  if the magistrate is satisfied by the person that, because:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the offence in relation to which any indorsed New Zealand warrant in
relation to the person was issued is of a trivial nature;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	if the offence is an offence of which the person is accused - the
accusation was not made in good faith or in the interests of
justice; or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	a lengthy period has elapsed since that offence was committed or
allegedly committed;</i>
<P>

<i>or for any other reason, it would be unjust, oppressive or too severe a
punishment to surrender the person to New Zealand, the magistrate
shall order
that the person be released."</i>
<P>

6  	Section 34(4) provides:
<P>

<i>"(4)  In the proceedings under this section, the person is not entitled to
adduce, and the magistrate is not entitled to receive,
evidence to contradict
an allegation that the person has engaged in conduct constituting an offence in
relation to which any indorsed
New Zealand warrant was issued."</i>
<P>

7  	Section 35 provides for review of an order made under s 34, where
appropriate, by this court.  Section 35(2) provides:
<P>

<i>	"(2)  The Court may, by order:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	confirm the order of the magistrate; or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	quash the order of the magistrate and direct a magistrate to:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	in the case of an order under paragraph 34(1)(c) - order the release of
the person; or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	in the case of an order under subsection 34(1) - order, by warrant,
that the person be surrendered to New Zealand."</i>
<P>

8  	A review under s 35 is to be <i>"by way of rehearing"</i>, and
the court may have regard to evidence in addition to or in substitution for the
evidence that was before the magistrate (s 35(6)(d)).
 
<P>

<b>The earlier proceedings against the plaintiff</b>
<P>

9  	On 5 November 1998 a New Zealand judge issued a warrant for the
arrest of the plaintiff on the following charges:
<P>

<i>"1.	Between 1 January 1998 and 20 June 1998, at Auckland, together with
Kelly Raymond Robertson, did commit an offence against the
Misuse of Drugs Act
1975, section 6(1)C and 2(B), did have possession of a Class B controlled drug
namely methamphetamine for supply.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Between 1 January 1998 and 20 June 1998, at Auckland, together with Kelly
Raymond Robertson, did commit an offence against the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1975,
section 6(1)C and 2(B), did supply a Class B controlled drug namely
methamphetamine to Steven Riki.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Between 1 January 1998 and 4 October 1998, at Auckland, together with
Kelly Raymond Robertson, did commit an offence against the
Misuse of Drugs Act
1975, section 6(2A) and (b), conspired to supply the Class B controlled drug
namely methamphetamine."</i>
<P>

10  	The New Zealand warrant was endorsed by a magistrate in New
South Wales pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act</a></i> on 16 December 1998
and on 8 January 1999 the plaintiff was arrested on the warrant.  He came
before the Local Court on the same
day.  The hearing of the proceedings for
extradition was set down for 18 March 1999.  On that date the magistrate made
orders for
surrender and committal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(1)(c)</a> and (d) of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act</a></i>.  The applicant was subsequently granted bail in this
court.
<P>

11  	The evidence before the magistrate on 18 March 1999 to support
the making of the orders under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(1)</a> was not tendered in this Court, and
since these proceedings under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 35</a> are by way of rehearing there has been no
need for counsel to focus on the evidence placed before the Local Court in
March 1999.
<P>

12  	It has not been contended that there was any irregularity in the
endorsement of the warrant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a> nor in the arrest of the plaintiff on
that endorsed warrant, nor since the proceedings before this Court are by way
of rehearing
has there been any submission addressed by the plaintiff to the
reasons for the decision taken by the magistrate on 18 March 1999.
 In these
circumstances neither the transcript of proceedings before the magistrate nor
the magistrate's reasons have been placed
before me.
<P>

13  	Before this Court, Mr Jones, who appeared for the plaintiff, has
submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(2)</a> assumes relevance and that having regard to the
provisions of this subsection the order made by the magistrate for the
surrender
of the plaintiff to New Zealand should be quashed.
<P>

<b>The proceedings before this Court</b>
<P>

14  	The defendant in this Court relied upon the following
evidence:
<P>

(i)	an affidavit by Darryl Brazier, Detective Sergeant of New Zealand police
sworn on 4 May 1999;
<P>

(ii)	an affidavit of Simon Penny of the Australian Federal Police sworn 4 May
1999.
<P>

15  	This evidence was admitted subject to objections by Mr Jones.
The evidence was tendered to establish what was placed before
the judge in New
Zealand who issued the New Zealand warrant and what was placed before the
magistrate who endorsed the warrant under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28.</a> I consider the evidence in
these affidavits is admissible having regard to the purpose for which the
evidence was tendered and the
scheme of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> of the statute.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff sought to rely upon the affidavit of Leigh
Johnson, the plaintiff's solicitor, which affidavit was sworn on 21
May 1999.
The affidavit expressed <i>"instructions"</i> given by the plaintiff to his
solicitor, and the defendant objected to the instructions as affording proof of
the assertions of fact
conveyed in the instructions.  That objection is of
substance.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff, whilst in Court, gave no evidence and I do not
regard the instructions received as probative of the assertions
of fact
apparently conveyed by the plaintiff to his solicitor.
<P>

18  	The effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/" class="autolink_findacts">Extradition Act</a></i> is, as Mr
Wigney for the defendant submitted, that the magistrate was required to order
that the plaintiff be surrendered to New
Zealand upon proof of his arrest on an
endorsed New Zealand warrant unless satisfied that an order should be made
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(2).</a>  The evidence before the magistrate attracted the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
34(1)</a>, unless the magistrate made an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(2).</a>  The same approach to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34</a> is required when this Court reviews the magistrate's order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
35:</a>
<P>

19  	Plainly the evidence relied upon by the defendant in this Court
establishes:
<P>

(i)	the arrest of the plaintiff under an endorsed New Zealand warrant;
<P>

(ii)	a request enlivening consideration of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34.</a>
<P>

20  	This Court must approach this matter upon the basis that the
statutory scheme, upon proof of (i) and (ii), requires an order
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
34(1)(c)</a> unless an order should be made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(2).</a>
<P>

21  	The plaintiff bears the onus of proving that an order should be
made in his favour under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(2).</a>  This is clear from the language of the
sub-section itself:
<P>

<i>"If the magistrate is </i><cite>satisfied by the person</cite><i>..."</i>
<P>

22  	See also <i>New Zealand v Venkataya</i> at 163.  The standard of
proof required is the civil standard, that is to say, proof on the balance of
probabilities:  see <i>Daemar v Parker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%207%20ALR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 7 ALR 564</a> at 569 and <i>Bates
v McDonald</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 89</a> at 99.
<P>

23  	Mr Jones has not contended that an order for the plaintiff's
release should be made because the offence in relation to which
the endorsed
warrant was issued was <i>"of a trivial nature"</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(2)(a).</a>  Clearly the
drug related offences identified in the relevant warrant are not to be
categorised as trivial.
<P>

24  	Nor has it been submitted that the plaintiff should be released
because of the lapse of time since the offences were allegedly
committed:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
34(2)(c).</a>
<P>

25  	The thrust of the plaintiff's case has been towards
consideration of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 34(2)(b).</a>
<P>

26  	I am not satisfied that the accusation of the plaintiff of the
offences charged was not made <i>"in good faith"</i>.  To establish that an
accusation was not made in good faith would require proof that the accusation
was made without a genuine belief
that it was true:  see <i>Bates v
McDonald</i> at 99 where Samuels JA said (referring to the same concept in the
<i>Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act, 1966</i>:
<P>

<i>"An accusation not made in good faith is one made without an honest belief
in its truth.  If honest belief exists the requirement
will not be satisfied
however negligently or carelessly the accusation was made."</i>
<P>

27  	In the present case Det. Sgt Brazier, who has the conduct of
this matter for the New Zealand police, was cross examined before
me on his
affidavit and that cross examination did not establish absence of good faith in
the pursuit of the accusations against
the plaintiff.
<P>

28  	The focus of Mr Jones' submissions under s 34(2) was on the
concept of <i>"the interests of justice"</i> in sub-s (2)(b).
<P>

29  	There was only one other submission advanced by Mr Jones to the
following effect: 
<P>

(i)	that these proceedings are in the nature of criminal proceedings:  see
<i>Brackenridge v New Zealand</i> (unreported, Court of Appeal (Qld), 2 October
1988); and
<P>

(ii)	that the charges should be regarded as representative charges. 
<P>

30  	 This being so, it was submitted that it would be unjust to
require the plaintiff to return to New Zealand to answer to these
charges.
Reference was made to <i>Bannister v New Zealand</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1999/362.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] FCA 362.</a>  
<P>

31  	However, in the course of submissions Mr Jones conceded, to my
mind properly, that the charges in the warrant were not representative
charges,
and this submission was abandoned.
<P>

32  	Accordingly I now turn to consider the basis upon which it was
submitted the magistrate's order should be quashed.
<P>

<b>The interests of justice</b>
<P>

33  	Mr Jones submitted, adopting expressions in <i>Willoughby v
Eland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d85%29%2059%20ALR%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-85) 59 ALR 147</a> at 152 and <i>Bates v McDonald</i> at 95, that
the defendant's accusations against the plaintiff are <i>"wholly
misconceived"</i>, that they <i>"cannot possibly be right"</i>, and that it is
<i>"demonstrably clear that the proceedings could have no foundation at
all"</i>.
<P>

34  	The nub of the submissions so carefully and thoroughly pursued
by Mr Jones is that the evidentiary basis for the accusations
made against the
plaintiff is so deficient that it would be unjust to permit the plaintiff's
extradition.  In advancing that submission
he relied upon the following
statement of principle in <i>New Zealand v Venkataya </i>at 165:
<P>

<i>"(i)	On an application for the surrender of a person to New Zealand, it is
not necessary, at least in the first instance, for the
applicant to adduce
evidence of the guilt of the person apprehended: Narain v DPP at 419.  However,
if the person apprehended can
show that there is no evidence to support the
charge, or that there are other reasons why the prosecution cannot succeed, the
court
is likely to conclude that the accusation was not made in the interests
of justice, within the meaning of s 34(2)(b) and that the
surrender of the
person would be unjust or oppressive: Bates v McDonald at 102; Lewis v Wilson;
Binge v Bennett at 585; Butler v
Morahan  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2094%20FLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 94 FLR 372."</a></i>
<P>

35  	The affidavit evidence of the defendant disclosed that police in
New Zealand intercepted and recorded a conversation that took
place allegedly
between the plaintiff and another man at premises at 80 Fairburn Road, Otahuhu,
pursuant to a warrant issued in the
High Court in Auckland.  The defendant's
contention is that the conversation so evidenced inculpated the plaintiff
concerning the
offences specified in the subject New Zealand warrant.  In his
affidavit evidence Sgt Brazier expressed his belief that this intercepted
conversation sufficed to charge the plaintiff.  In his affidavit the Federal
Police Officer, Simon Penny, referred to this same conversation
as <i>"the
basis of the charges laid in New Zealand against [the plaintiff]"</i>.

36  	A copy of the CD ROM which it was claimed recorded the
intercepted conversation was tendered by the defendant as Exhibit B
and on the
plaintiff's application it was played in Court.  Mr Jones submitted that the CD
ROM did not record that which the defendant
has alleged it to have recorded.
There are before this Court three transcripts purporting to set out what is
recorded on Exhibit
B.  The first of these transcripts is what Sgt Brazier
described in evidence as "a working transcript" which he said was relied upon
for the affidavit used to secure the issue of the warrant.  This is the
transcript which forms an annexure to the affidavit of this
police officer
sworn on 5 November 1998, which affidavit is itself an annexure to the
affidavit of the same deponent sworn on 4 May
1999.  The second transcript,
admitted into evidence as Exhibit C, is what Sgt Brazier described as "the
evidentiary transcript"
which will be relied upon in court in New Zealand in
the event the plaintiff is extradited.  The third transcript is an annexure
to
the affidavit of Leigh Johnson, and is a transcript taken from a copy CD ROM
served upon the plaintiff.  These transcripts differ,
and it is to be inferred
that the differences reflect differences in what was heard by those responsible
for the typescripts.  Of
course none of these transcripts affords independent
evidence of what is on the relevant CD ROM, still less does it afford
independent
evidence of the intercepted conversation.  If, ultimately, the
plaintiff stands trial, the jury will no doubt be instructed as to
the limited
use to which such a transcript can be put, presumably consistently with the
statement of principle to be found in <i>Butera v Director of Public
Prosecutions</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 180.</a>
<P>

37  	Mr Jones submitted that now that I have heard the CD ROM played,
I would find that it does not evidence the plaintiff's criminal
participation
in drug related activity so as to support the charges set out in the New
Zealand warrant.
<P>

38  	Having considered the matter, I have concluded that it is
inappropriate for me on a hearing of this nature to make a final
determination
as to what has been recorded in the intercepted conversation.  Sergeant
Brazier's evidence was that, having heard the
disc played a number of times, he
considered Exhibit C to be an accurate transcript.  Whoever prepared the
transcript annexed to
Ms Johnson's affidavit upon which the plaintiff relies
would obviously disagree.  It will be for the court hearing the charges against
the plaintiff to resolve what the disc has recorded and the significance to be
attributed to such evidence.
<P>

39  	Even if it be assumed, contrary to the version for which the
defendant contends, that the disc does not inculpate the plaintiff
in the
manner claimed (and the plaintiff has not satisfied me of this), it would not
follow that the defendant cannot prove any of
the charges.  Paragraph 10 of Sgt
Brazier's affidavit, upon which he was not cross examined, is as follows:
<P>

<i>"A brief of evidence has been prepared in New Zealand supporting the charges
against Kevin Kenneally as set out in the original warrant
marked `B'."</i>
<P>

40  	Since details as to the contents of that brief have not been
elicited in this Court, I cannot assume that the defendant is
entirely
dependent upon what is heard on the record of the intercepted conversation in
order to support the case it intends to prove
against the plaintiff.
<P>

41  	Mr Jones relied in seeking to discharge the onus on the
plaintiff not only upon what he contended I would find was recorded
on the disc
but upon responses elicited from Sgt Brazier in cross examination:
<P>

(a)	that the police had conducted fifty days of listening device interceptions,
and there was only the one interception involving
the plaintiff over a period
of twenty minutes;
<P>

(b)	that the plaintiff had a legitimate reason to be in New Zealand at the
time, namely to attend the funeral of a member of the
family and that he was
then travelling north to visit friends;
<P>

(c)	that Sgt Brazier was unable to say precisely when the alleged offences
occurred, or where they occurred or what was the quality
of the drug.
<P>

42  	In my opinion none of those responses tips the scales in the
plaintiff's favour.
<P>

43  	The task for a plaintiff facing extradition to satisfy a court
for the purposes of s 34(2) that the accusation against him
is demonstrably
without foundation so as to render it contrary to the interests of justice to
extradite him is extremely onerous.
 This is so even in a case where there have
been committal proceedings and the court called upon to consider s 34(2) has
the advantage
of access to the transcript of the proceedings, as in <i>Bates v
McDonald</i> (supra).  However here there have been no committal proceedings,
the Court has not seen the brief of evidence to which Sgt Brazier
referred and
simply does not know the totality of the evidence the defendant will be able to
adduce.  McHugh JA said, by way of assessment
of such a situation, in <i>Bates
v McDonald</i> (at 102):
<P>

<i>"In cases where no evidence has yet been given against [the person sought to
be extradited], or where the whole of the evidence has
not been tendered, his
task of establishing that the accusation was not brought in the interests of
justice will be almost impossible."</i>
<P>

44  	Those dicta are particularly apt in the present
circumstances.
<P>

45  	The plaintiff has not satisfied me on the balance of
probabilities that this is an appropriate case for an order under s 34(2).
Accordingly I confirm the order made by the magistrate under s 34(1)(c) and I
revoke the plaintiff's bail.  I order that he be taken
into custody pending the
execution of the warrant ordered under s 34(1)(c).
<P>

46  	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the
summons.
