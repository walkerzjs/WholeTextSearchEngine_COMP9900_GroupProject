<b><u>20333/94  -  John LONG &amp; ANOR v GAINCREW PTY LTD &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  John Long appeals from the judgment of Master Harrison
dated 15 December 1998, insofar as she dismissed a Notice of Motion, dated
22
September 1998, brought pursuant to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/loaa1974226/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 30</a> and s 31 of the
Queeensland Limitations of Actions Act, 1974, for an order extending the time
in which the appellant may bring proceedings
against Dr Fallowfield and the
State of Queensland (described by the Master as the proposed fourth defendant
and the proposed fifth
defendant respectively) for damages for alleged
negligent medical treatment.  
<P>

2	It is necessary to consider some background to the application to Master
Harrison.  The plaintiff, a resident of New South Wales,
is the managing
director of Premier Pools Pty Limited, a company engaged in the erection of
swimming pools.  Between 28 June 1993
and 2 July 1993 the plaintiff undertook a
diving course conducted by the first defendant, Gaincrew Pty Limited (Gaincrew)
at Port
Douglas in the State of Queensland.  
<P>

3	On 3 July 1993 the plaintiff displayed symptoms of decompression illness.
His consequential medical treatment included treatment
at the Mossman Hospital
and the Townsville Hospital (for which hospital the State of Queensland incurs
liability pursuant to the
Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1996 of the
State of Queensland).  Dr Fallowfield was at the time the Director of
Hyperbaric
Medicine at the latter hospital.
<P>

4	On 12 October 1993 the plaintiff retained Sydney solicitors to commence legal
proceedings in this Court on his behalf with respect
to serious physical
sequelae which he contends he suffered as a result of the alleged negligence of
Gaincrew and those who afforded
him medical treatment.  At the time the
plaintiff's solicitors received instructions, they did not believe that they
had sufficient
evidence to establish a breach of duty on the part of Dr
Fallowfield and/or the Townsville Hospital.
<P>

5	On 30 May 1994 the plaintiff's solicitors filed a Statement of Claim in which
Gaincrew was named as the first defendant, Marina
Medical Pty Limited as the
second defendant, Dr J. Christie as the third defendant (proceedings against
him have now been discontinued)
and Mossman Hospital as the fourth defendant.

<P>

6	An amended statement of claim was filed on 24 July 1997 but the amendment is
not of relevance for present purposes.
<P>

7	On 15 and 16 July 1997, the plaintiff was examined by Professor Des Gorman
who is, I understand, a specialist in decompression
illness practising in
Auckland, New Zealand.  Professor Gorman reported to the plaintiff's solicitors
on 29 July 1997 to the effect
that there was, in his view, negligence on the
part of Dr Fallowfield and the Townsville Hospital in their treatment of the
plaintiff.
 I might say, parenthetically, that the report also expressed the
view that there had been negligence on the part of Gaincrew and
the Mossman
Hospital.
<P>

8	On 29 August 1997 the plaintiff conferred with his solicitors and counsel and
was advised that in light of Professor Gorman's
report it was appropriate to
proceed against both Dr Fallowfield and the Townsville Hospital.  However by 29
August 1997 the three
year limitation period under Queensland law had expired.
It is common ground that the Queensland <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/loaa1974226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions Act, 1974</a> applies
to these proceedings and that Act relevantly prescribed a limitation period of
three years.  
<P>

9	On 23 July 1998 the plaintiff's solicitors filed a Notice of Motion seeking
an extension of the limitation period to enable the
plaintiff to proceed
against Dr Fallowfield and the Townsville Hospital.  Directions were
subsequently given in relation to the filing
of affidavits.
<P>

10	On 26 August 1998 the Notice of Motion came before Master Malpass.  The
plaintiff sought an adjournment of the Notice of Motion
in order to place
further evidence before the Court.  The Master refused the adjournment and
dismissed the Notice of Motion with
costs payable forthwith.  
<P>

11	On 22 September 1998 the Notice of Motion the subject of the present appeal
was filed.  The Master's judgment states that on
the same date a proposed
further amended statement of claim was filed which named Gaincrew as the first
defendant, Marina Medical
Pty Limited as the second defendant, Mossman Hospital
as the third defendant, Dr Fallowfield as the fourth defendant and the State
of
Queensland as the fifth defendant.  However, in fact such proposed further
amended statement of claim was not filed.  Evidence
in support of the Notice of
Motion included an affidavit by Simon Chadwick sworn 22 September 1998.  Mr
Chadwick is the solicitor
who has the carriage of this matter in the office of
the plaintiff's solicitors.  Paragraph 17 of the affidavit states:
<P>

	<i>"Annexed hereto and marked with the letter "B" is a Further Amended
Ordinary Statement of Claim it is proposed to file in this manner
(sic) should
the Court grant leave to extend the limitation period."</i>
<P>

12	This is a reference to the further amended statement of claim which the
Master erroneously believed was filed on 22 September
1998.  However, nothing
really turns on that insofar as her judgment is concerned.
<P>

13	The Notice of Motion came before Master Harrison on 30 November 1998 when Mr
K. Andrews of counsel appeared for the plaintiff
and Mr I. G. Roberts of
counsel appeared for the defendants.  Both counsel also appeared before me on
this appeal.
<P>

14	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/loaa1974226/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 31</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/loaa1974226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions Act 1974</a> (the Act) applies (inter
alia) to actions for damages for negligence where the damages claimed by the
plaintiff for the negligence
consist of or include damages in respect of
personal injury sustained by the plaintiff.  
<P>

15	Sub-section (2) of s 31 defines the powers of the court to extend the
limitation period with respect to such actions and is in
the following
terms:
<P>

	"<i>Where on application to a court by a person claiming to have a right of
action to which this section applies, it appears to the court
 -  </i>
<P>

	<i>(a)	that a material fact of a decisive character relating to the right of
action was not within the means of knowledge of the applicant
until a date
after the commencement of the year last preceding the expiration of the period
of limitation for the action;  and</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	that there is evidence to establish the right of action, apart from a
defence founded on the expiration of a period of limitation:</i>
<P>

	<i>the court may order that the period of limitation for the action be
extended so that it expires at the end of one year after that
date and
thereupon, for the purposes of the action brought by the applicant in that
court, the period of limitation is extended accordingly."</i>
<P>

16	Section 30 of the Act defines (although not exhaustively) what facts
constitute a <i>material fact of a decisive character relating to the right of
action.  </i>It is not necessary, however, for present purposes to consider
those criteria.
<P>

17	In her judgment the Master held that the plaintiff did not know he had a
cause of action against Dr Fallowfield and the State
of Queensland until 29
August 1997 when he was so advised by his legal advisers on the basis of
Professor Gorman's report.  The Master
held that this knowledge constituted
"<i>a material fact of a decisive character relating to the right of
action</i>" which was not within the means of knowledge of the plaintiff until
29 August 1997, which was a date after the commencement of the
year last
preceding the expiration of the period of limitation for the action.  
<P>

18	Having made that finding of fact (which was not challenged on appeal) it was
open to the Master under subs (2) of s 31 to order
that the period of
limitation for the action be extended to 30 August 1998.  However, the Master
held that as the Notice of Motion
was not filed until 22 September 1998, the
claim for an extension of the limitation period must necessarily fail at the
threshold.
 Thus, it did not become necessary for the Master to determine
whether it was just and reasonable to extend time.
<P>

19	The manner in which the Master expressed this finding requires some comment.
It is now well established that if initiating process
is filed within the
extended limitation period, the notice of motion seeking leave to extend the
limitation period may be filed after
the expiration of that period.  So much is
clear from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <b>Clutha Developments Pty
Ltd v Barry </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 86</a> at 102, per Gleeson CJ.  See also
<b>Karolis v Prince of Wales Hospital &amp; Anor </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2080%2d053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) Aust. Torts Reports
80-053</a>, at 67, 974.
<P>

20	Thus, it would have been more appropriate for the Master to have expressed
her finding upon the basis that a further amended
statement of claim naming Dr
Fallowfield (as the fourth defendant) and the State of Queensland (as the fifth
defendant) was not filed
within the extended limitation period.  
<P>

21	The plaintiff's case, on appeal, took on a different complexion to that
presented to the Master.  Appellant's counsel focused
on the appeal upon
paragraph 25 of Mr Chadwick's affidavit of 22 September 1998 which paragraph
was not drawn to the attention of
the Master.  Paragraph 25 is in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>"On the 28th day of August 1998 a Statement of Claim was issued in this
honourable Court against Dr Fallowfield and the State of Queensland
who incur
liability for Townsville Hospital pursuant to the Health Legislation Amending
(sic) Act No. 2 1996, (Queensland)."</i>
<P>

Paragraph 25 needs some explanation.
<P>

22	I was informed by counsel for the appellant that after the Notice of Motion
seeking the extension of time was dismissed on 26
August 1998 by Master
Malpass, the appellant's advisers were placed in a position where they had to
make a critical decision to protect
their client's interests bearing in mind
that proceedings had to be filed joining Dr Fallowfield and the Townsville
Hospital by 30
August 1998.  There was not time, it was thought, to file a
fresh notice of motion, obtain the appropriate order and then file a
further
amended statement of claim before 30 August 1998.  The Supreme Court Rules
prevented the plaintiff filing a further amended
statement of claim without
leave, because the pleadings had been closed.
<P>

23	What was described by counsel for the appellant as a "<i>forensic
decision</i>" was made to file a fresh statement of claim on 28 August 1998
joining Dr Fallowfield and the State of Queensland as sole defendants.
However, as it was necessary under the Rules for that statement of claim to be
treated as an original matter it was allocated File
No. 20322 of 1998.  I
particularly note that paragraph 25 of Mr Chadwick's affidavit does not refer
to the fact that the statement
of claim filed on 28 August 1998 was given File
No. 20322 of 1998.
<P>

24	As I have indicated when the Notice of Motion was argued before Master
Harrison, her attention was not drawn to the 28 August
1998 statement of claim.
Mr Roberts, counsel for the defendants was only made aware of its existence on
the morning of the hearing
because, at that stage, it had not been served on
either of the defendants.  
<P>

25	Now, although the 28 August 1998 statement of claim had not been referred to
in argument before the Master nor, understandably,
in her judgment, it became
the linchpin of the appellant's argument on appeal.  I might add that File No.
20322 of 1998 was not before
her.
<P>

26	The thrust of the appellant's argument was that the only order which the
Master was asked to make was to extend the period in
which the appellant could
bring proceedings against Dr Fallowfield and the State of Queensland to 30
August 1998.  If the Master
had made such an order, it was submitted that the
28 August 1998 statement of claim (albeit that it was filed in different
proceedings)
would satisfy that order.  Alternatively, if necessary the
appellant could have gone back to the court and sought consolidation of
the
proceedings in File No. 20333 of 1994 with the proceedings in File No. 20322 of
1998, pursuant to Part 31, Division 2 of the
Rules.  
<P>

27	Counsel for the appellant conceded that this approach had not been raised
before the Master.  However, he submitted that there
was evidence before her of
a statement of claim having been filed on 28 August 1998 and that was enough
for the purposes of this
appeal.  It was not to the point, he submitted, that
it was not drawn to her attention or that the File was not before her.
<P>

28	In any event, counsel submitted, the Master should merely have satisfied
herself that there were justifiable grounds for extending
the limitation period
to 30 August 1998 and left it to the appellant to satisfy that order in
whatever way he could.
<P>

29	The appellant faces formidable difficulties on this appeal.  Firstly, the
decision by the Master was, upon the basis that the
appellant's case was
presented to her, in my respectful view, perfectly correct.  That case was
presented solely on the basis that
the appellant wished to obtain the necessary
extension of time so that the further amended statement of claim annexed to Mr
Chadwick's
affidavit could be filed in the proceedings before her, viz. File
No. 20333 of 1994.
<P>

30	However, upon the material presented to the Master, it would have been
futile for her to have made an order extending the limitation
period to 30
August 1998 because the order could not be satisfied.
<P>

31	Secondly, as the High Court (Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ)
re-affirmed in <b>Coulton v Holcombe </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 1</a> at 8, a party is
bound by the conduct of his or her case.  Their Honours repeated what the Court
had said in <b>University of Wollongong v Metwally [No. 2] (</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1985%29%2059%20ALJR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1985) 59
A.L.J.R. 481</a> at 483:
<P>

	<i>"Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all
principles to allow a party, after a case has been decided
against him, to
raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by advertence, he failed to
put during the hearing when he had
an opportunity to do so."</i>
<P>

Such exceptional circumstances do not exist here.
<P>

32	Nevertheless I might say that even if the Master had been apprised of File
No. 20322 of 1998, it would, in my view, have been
inappropriate for her to
have extended the limitation period (leaving aside discretionary
considerations) in anticipation that the
appellant might obtain a consolidation
order in relation to the two sets of proceedings.  Such a course would have
been highly unusual.
 As Brooking J pointed out in <b>Bolwell Fibreglass Pty
Ltd v Foley </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1984/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] VicRp 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20VR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] V.R. 97</a> at 104:
<P>

	<i>"The effect of a consolidation order is difficult to determine and in my
opinion such an order should rarely be made."</i>
<P>

	Those remarks had the concurrence (at 100) of Young CJ and 
<P>

	Kaye J.
<P>

33	It should be recalled that a consolidation order is a process by which two
or more matters are, by order of the court, combined
and treated as one action.
Such an order is to be clearly distinguished from an order that two or more
matters be heard together,
which refers to a situation where proceedings are
heard concurrently.
<P>

34	This Court should not be expected in any event, to resort to the rare course
of consolidation merely to avoid the consequences
of the appellant's solicitors
failing to approach the Court with the appropriate evidence and within time to
seek an order for extension
of the limitation period in Matter No. 20333 of
1994:  See <b>Baker v Australian Asbestos Insulations Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20NSWLR%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3
NSWLR 595</a> at 601.
<P>

35	Obviously, the appropriate course for the appellant now is to file a notice
of motion in File No. 20322 of 1998 seeking an extension
of the limitation
period against Dr Fallowfield and the State of Queensland.  The appellant will
not be faced with fatal defect so
far as the present notice of motion is
concerned.  However, he will, no doubt, be faced with other arguments arising
from the discretionary
considerations considered by the High Court in
<b>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541.</a>
<P>

36	If the appellant overcomes the discretionary considerations and obtains an
extension of the limitation period then an application
could be made for an
order that both matters be heard together, or if sufficient grounds can be
established, a consolidation order.
<P>

37	The appeal is dismissed with costs.
