AUSTIN J
<P>

MONDAY 26 JULY 1999
<P>

<b>3183/99 - AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES &amp; INVESTMENTS COMMISSION v STEPHEN LEWIS
MATTHEWS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered ex tempore on 26 July 1999;  revised 27 July
1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This matter comes before the Court by summons for
orders under the Federal Courts<b> </b>(State Jurisdiction) Act<b> </b>1999
(NSW) (`Jurisdiction Act').  The orders sought are of two kinds:  first, an
order pursuant to s 11 of the Jurisdiction Act that
a certain Federal Court
proceeding be treated as a Supreme Court proceeding; and, secondly,
declarations to the effect that under
s 6 of the Jurisdiction Act the rights
and liabilities of persons affected by certain judgments and orders of O'Connor
and Sackville
JJ in that proceeding are the same as if they had been valid
judgments and orders of the Supreme Court.
<P>

2  	The proceeding in the Federal Court was brought by an application
in the New south Wales District Registry of that court pursuant
to s 1324 of
the Corporations Law, filed on 16 February 1999.  Essentially the complaint is
that the defendant, without any licence
or authority, is carrying on an
investment advice business contrary to s 781 of the Corporations Law by means
of an internet site
called `The Chimes', and is thereby engaging in misleading
conduct contrary to s 995, and has thereby invited subscriptions for securities
in a company not yet formed contrary to s 1019 and without a prospectus
contrary to s 1018.
<P>

3  	Sections 781, 995, 1019 and 1018 of the Corporations Law of New
South Wales do not expressly articulate any territorial nexus
with this State.
In my opinion, it is appropriate to infer from the defendant's Sydney
residential address and his personal appearance
before me that the activity of
which the plaintiff complains is sufficiently connected with this State that
the Federal Court proceeding
is correctly described as a civil matter arising
under the Corporations Law of New South Wales.  That being so, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990</a> (NSW) (`Application Act') confers
jurisdiction on this Court, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/" class="autolink_findacts">Application Act</a> purports to
confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court, with respect to the matter.
<P>

4  	On 19 February 1999 O'Connor J made interim orders including
injunctions restricting the defendant from giving advice and publishing
reports
about securities.  One of O'Connor J's orders (order 4) was that `until further
order the respondent Stephen Lewis Matthews
be restrained from publishing
reports or allowing to be published reports about securities on the internet
including, but not limited
to, the internet site as `The Chimes' and situated
at htpp//www.chimes.au'.
<P>

5  	On 22 March 1999 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion in the
Federal Court seeking orders that the defendant be found guilty
of and punished
for contempt of the orders of O'Connor J made on 19 February 1999.  The
application for contempt orders was dealt
with by Sackville J on 16 June 1999.
His Honour found that the defendant was guilty of contempt and made certain
orders including
an order for the defendant's imprisonment.
<P>

6  	On the day after Sackville J made those orders, the High Court of
Australia delivered its judgment in<b> </b><i>Re Wakim;  ex parte McNally</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2031%20ACSR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 31 ACSR 99.</a>  The effect of the High Court's judgment is that under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> the Federal Court of Australia cannot exercise jurisdiction in a
matter brought solely under the Corporations Law of a State, although
the High
Court accepted that the Federal Court possesses accrued jurisdiction in
connection with federal matters.
<P>

7  	On 15 July 1999 the matter returned to Sackville J and at the
hearing before his Honour, counsel for the plaintiff conceded
on instructions
that, in view of the High Court's judgment in<b> </b><i>Wakim</i>, the Federal
Court had no jurisdiction to hear the proceeding.  During the course of the
hearing Sackville J said to counsel for
the plaintiff:
<P>

`Your position is that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear these
proceedings.  What I will do is stand this matter over generally
and note that
the Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the completion of this matter.  I
do not think it makes any difference
if I stand the matter over to a particular
date.'
<P>

Section 11(2) of the Jurisdiction Act is in the following terms:
<P>

`A person who was a party to a proceeding in which a relevant order is made may
apply to the Supreme Court for an order that the
proceeding be treated as a
proceeding in the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court may make such an
order.'
<P>

8  	The expression `relevant order' is defined in s 11(1).  The
evidence before me is that Sackville J made an order standing the
proceeding
over generally, expressly on the basis that the Federal Court had no
jurisdiction to deal with it.  In my opinion this
falls within paragraph (a) of
the definition of `relevant order', because in substance Sackville J's order is
an order of a federal
court staying a proceeding relating to a State matter for
want of jurisdiction, even though it is not formally expressed to be an
order
staying the Federal Court proceeding.
<P>

9  	If I am wrong in that respect, then at least Sackville J's
determination on 15 July 1999 is properly characterised as another
decision or
determination by a federal court that it has no jurisdiction to hear and
determine a proceeding relating to a State matter,
and therefore falls within
paragraph (c) of the definition of `relevant order' in s 11(1).
<P>

10  	The proceeding relates to a `State matter' because it is a
matter in respect of which either this Court has jurisdiction otherwise
than by
reason of the law of the Commonwealth or another state or Territory (the
jurisdiction of this Court being found in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/" class="autolink_findacts">Application Act</a>), or
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/" class="autolink_findacts">Application Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 42(3))</a> purports to confer jurisdiction on the Federal
Court of Australia: see definitions of `State matter', paragraphs (a) and (c),
and
`relevant State Act', paragraph (d), in s 3 of the Jurisdiction Act.
<P>

11  	I therefore conclude that this Court has jurisdiction under s
11(2) of the Jurisdiction Act to make an order that the Federal
Court
proceeding be treated as a proceeding of this Court.  Given the effect that the
decision in<b> </b><i>Wakim</i> otherwise would have on the proceeding, it
seems to me unquestionably appropriate that the order be made.
<P>

12  	Section 6 of the Jurisdiction Act states (relevantly) that the
rights and liabilities of all persons are, by force of that
Act, declared to
be, and always to have been, the same as if each ineffective judgment of the
Federal Court of Australia had been
a valid judgment of the Supreme Court.  By
s 4 an `ineffective judgment' is (relevantly) a judgment of a federal court in
a State
matter given or recorded before the commencement of s 4, in purported
exercise of jurisdiction purporting to have been conferred
on the federal court
by a relevant State Act. The Jurisdiction Act, including s 4, commenced on 9
July 1999.  I have already held
that the Federal Court proceeding in this case
relates to a State matter, and that the Federal Court has purported to exercise
jurisdiction
purporting to have been conferred by a relevant State Act, being
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/" class="autolink_findacts">Application Act</a>.  The word `judgment' is defined in s 3 of the Jurisdiction
Act to include an order, whether final or interlocutory.
<P>

13  	It follows, in my view, that the orders made by O'Connor on
Sackville JJ on 19 February and 16 June 1999 fall within s 6. 
Consequently,
they are to be treated under that section as if they were valid orders of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales.  To
avoid doubt, it is appropriate that I
make declaratory orders to that effect.
<P>

14  	At the hearing of the plaintiff's summons today, the defendant
appeared personally without legal representation. He submitted
that it would be
unsafe for the Court to `rubber stamp proceedings of another court'.  He
contended that the Federal Court proceedings
were so hurried that he had had no
time to obtain  legal advice.  Further, he drew attention to O'Connor J's order
4, which I have
set out above, and said it was an order with which he could not
comply.  He concluded that there would be jeopardy and lack of safety
in my
confirming such orders. He said he wished to adduce evidence about the
credibility of the plaintiff.  He said that he wanted
time to obtain legal
advice and representation to develop his submissions on these points.  He
sought an adjournment for two months.
<P>

15  	In my view very little of the defendant's submissions goes to
the issues for determination in the summons, which are issues
about the proper
construction and application of the Jurisdiction Act.  As I explained to the
defendant several times, some of his
submissions are matters which he will have
the opportunity to develop in preparation for the final hearing of the matter;
other submissions
might lead him to consider an application to vary or even
discharge the orders made by O'Connor and Sackville JJ, but they do not
go to
the present application.  The only submission which has some relevance to
today's application is his submission that he be
given time to obtain legal
advice.  I formed the view that the legal advice which he wishes to obtain, if
indeed he obtains advice,
would be legal advice on matters going to the merits
of the dispute rather than the technical construction of the Jurisdiction Act.
It seems to me, in those circumstances, that to adjourn the present application
to enable Mr Matthews to obtain legal advice would
serve no point.
<P>

16  	I have discussed the formal orders which I propose to make and
the plaintiff has offered to prepare short minutes.
<P>

NOTE:  subsequently orders were made as follows:
<P>

`The Court:
<P>

1.	Orders that the proceeding of Australian Securities and Investments
Commission v Stephen Lewis Matthews N3017 of 1999 in the
Federal Court of
Australia (`the Proceeding') be treated as a proceeding in the Supreme Court of
New South Wales.
<P>

2.	Directs that the Registrar of the Supreme Court arrange with the Registrar
of the Federal Court of Australia for the transfer
of the file of the
Proceeding.
<P>

3.	Declares that the rights and liabilities of the parties to the Proceeding
are, and always have been, the same as if the judgment
of O'Connor J on 19
February 1999 in the Proceeding had been valid judgment of the Supreme Court in
the Equity Division, constituted
by a Judge of the Supreme Court.
<P>

4.	Declares that the rights and liabilities of the parties to the Proceeding
are, and always have been, the same as if the judgment
of Sackville J on 16
June 1999 in the Proceeding had been valid judgment of the Supreme Court in the
Equity Division, constituted
by a Judge of the Supreme Court.
<P>

5.	Directs that the matter be stood over for pre-trial directions on 30 August
1999.'
