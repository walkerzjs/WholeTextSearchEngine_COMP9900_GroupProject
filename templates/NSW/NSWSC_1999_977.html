Ors</u></b>

<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Kristina Moran, is the
widow of Brendan Moran, who took his own life on 13 February 1995.  The
first
three defendants are members of Mr Moran's family and the fourth and fifth
defendants, described loosely, are family companies.
 The plaintiff has brought
proceedings which, as far as I am aware, are without precedent in this Court.
Put shortly, she alleges
that her husband was driven to his death by the
behaviour of the first three defendants, both in their personal relationship
with
him and in their dealings with him as members of the companies.  She has
commenced action under the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ctra1897288/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation to Relatives Act</i> 1897</a>, on her
own behalf and on behalf of the two children of the marriage.  She also sues in
her own right for nervous shock as a result
of the suicide, but that action is
not the subject of the application with which I must deal.
<P>

2    	The plaintiff has requested a jury, pursuant to
s86(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act </i>1970</a>, for the trial of the proceedings
under the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ctra1897288/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation to Relatives Act</a></i>. The defendants seek an order
under s89(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme</i> <i>Court Act</a></i> that all issues in those
proceedings be tried without a jury.  That application is on two bases.
Firstly, it is said that publicity
in recent years which is adverse to them
would make it unlikely that a jury could consider the matter impartially.
Secondly, it is
said that the case turns upon conflicting expert evidence of
such detail and complexity that it could not practicably be resolved
by a
jury.
<P>

3    	I approach the application on the basis that s86
confers a <i>prima facie</i> entitlement to trial by jury upon the party
requesting it, and that another party seeking an order under s89 that the jury
be dispensed
with bears the burden of establishing why that discretion should
be exercised in his or her favour: <i>Pambula District Hospital v Herriman
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 387</a>, per Kirby P at 399, 405.
<P>

<b>Publicity</b>
<P>

4    	I received in evidence copies of a considerable
number of newspaper and magazine articles, together with brief summaries of
some television and radio broadcasts, relating to the parties.  I have read
that material carefully.  To set it out in any detail
would only compound the
problem of which the defendants complain, as this judgment may itself be the
subject of publicity.  It is
sufficient to say that some of the material deals
with the proceedings in this Court and the relationship between the first three
defendants, on the one hand and the plaintiff and her late husband, on the
other.  Other material is concerned with the background,
political connections
and business dealings of the first defendant.  The publicity spans a period
between 1995 and 1999, most of
it in 1997.
<P>

5    	There is no doubt that much of this material is
adverse to the defendants.  Indeed, as a result of it, members of the
defendants'
family received anonymous telephone calls, faxes and letters of an
uncomplimentary, even abusive, kind.  I have also received evidence
of some of
those communications.  The question, however, is whether the prejudicial effect
of the publicity is such that the case
could not fairly be tried by a jury.
<P>

6    	Criminal trials with a jury in the wake of extensive
publicity adverse to the accused are by no means uncommon.  In <i>The Queen v
Glennon </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20173%20CLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 173 CLR 592</a>, Mason CJ and Toohey J observed (at 603):
<P>

The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial
information is inherent in a criminal trial.  The law acknowledges
the
existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting
in conformity with the instructions given to
them by the trial judge, will
render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence.  <b>...</b> in the past
too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess
critically what they see and hear and their
ability to reach their decisions by
reference to the evidence before them.
<P>

7    	In <i>R v Yuill </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2069%20ACrim%20R%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 69 ACrim R 450</a>, Kirby ACJ
said (at 453-4):
<P>

Courts will assume that jurors, properly instructed, will accept and conform to
the direction of the trial judge to decide the case
solely on the evidence
placed before them in the court<b>...</b>  There is an increasing body of
judicial opinion, lately expressed, to the effect that whatever pre-trial
publicity exists, jurors,
when they take on the solemn responsibility of the
performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip,
rumour,
news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which
they hear in the court in the trial for which they are empanelled.
<P>

The same approach was adopted in <i>R v Milat </i>(CCA, unreported 26 February
1998) per Gleeson CJ at p44 ff, and <i>R v Bell </i>(CCA, unreported 8 October
1998).
<P>

8    	True it is that a judge has no power to dispense with
trial by jury in a criminal case (although the case may be tried by
judge alone
if the accused chooses that mode of trial and the Crown consents, in accordance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s32</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act </i>1986</a>).  Nevertheless, the
observations in the cases to which I have referred are of general application,
and it is appropriate to have
regard to them in exercising the discretion under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s89.html" class="autolink_findacts">s89.</a>  Whether any of the jurors in the present proceedings would remember the
publicity about the defendants cannot be known, but there
is an obvious risk
that one or more of them may.  However, there is no reason to doubt that each
of the jurors would heed a direction
to put that material out of his or her
mind and to decide the case on the evidence.  I would not direct a trial
without jury on this
basis.
<P>

<b>Expert evidence</b>
<P>

9    	Obviously, the first issue in the proceedings will be
whether the defendants engaged in the conduct alleged to have led to
the
deceased's suicide.  However, the plaintiff must also establish his mental
state at the relevant time and prove that it was induced
by that conduct.  On
those matters expert evidence looms large.  I have been supplied with copies of
a number of psychiatric reports,
obtained for the plaintiff and the defendants.
They deal with factors giving rise to the suicide and the plaintiff's reaction
to
the death but, for present purposes, I am concerned only with the former.
<P>

10    	As one would expect, the authors of the reports
arrive at different views about the mental state of the deceased and about
the
extent, if at all, to which it could be said to stem from the defendants'
alleged behaviour rather than other stressors in his
life.  While the
circumstances in which this evidence has been sought are unusual, there is
nothing unfamiliar about the assessment
of it which a jury would need to
undertake.  From time to time, juries are required to arrive at a decision in
the face of conflicting
psychiatric evidence.  Particularly is this so in the
criminal jurisdiction, where defences of mental illness or diminished
responsibility
are not uncommon.  There is no reason why a jury in the present
case, guided by the burden of proof, could not make a realistic assessment
of
the conflicting expert opinions in the light of the facts and circumstances
which they find established.
<P>

11    	On the question of damages, the plaintiff and the
defendants have obtained accountants' reports.  Both reports are lengthy
and
contain detailed analyses of the plaintiff's claim for economic loss.  Again,
juries are sometimes called upon to deal with evidence
of this kind.  It is
usually not necessary for them to master all the material in voluminous
reports, as the author of each report
is normally "called to state its general
effect or result": see the observations of Hunt J (as he then was) in <i>NRMA
Insurance Limited v Flanagan </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 585</a> at 600.
<P>

12    	I am not persuaded that the expert evidence on the
present case is of such volume or complexity that it would be impracticable
for
a jury to deal with it.  I would not dispense with the jury on this basis
either.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

13    	Even viewed in combination, the two grounds advanced
in support of this application do not satisfy me that the case should
be tried
without a jury.  The application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s89.html" class="autolink_findacts">s89</a> of the Act is refused.  I shall hear
the parties on costs.
