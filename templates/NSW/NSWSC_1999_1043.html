<b>50042/99	ANDREW MCGREGOR CARLING   v   CGU INSURANCE</b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff is an architectural draftsman and landscape
draftsman who at the age of 31 years purchased a paddlesteamer called
the
"<i>Lady of Barmah</i>".  That was in September 1993.  The steamer was
purchased for approximately $25,000.  Prior to purchase it was inspected by a
local
shipwright, found to be sound, and, according to the plaintiff, it was
seaworthy and in fair condition.  Although by design a paddlesteamer,
it was in
fact powered by a diesel engine.  The vessel was purchased by the plaintiff for
family recreation.  At the time of purchase
it was located at Barmah on the
Murray River, some 60 kms downstream from Moama, a twin city of Echuca, which
is situated across
the Murray from Moama.  Shortly after purchase the vessel
was taken under its own power to Moama in the vicinity of the residence
of the
plaintiff's parents.  
<P>

2   	From the outset of the plaintiff's ownership of the vessel
it was insured under a "<i>Boat Insurance Policy" </i>(the policy) with the
defendant (the insurer).  The policy was effected through the agency of a
broker, Wayne Hildebrand (Hildebrand),
a principal of Insurance House Pty
Limited (the broker) of Echuca.  The plaintiff's father had signed the
insurance proposal on behalf
of the plaintiff, the period of insurance being 21
September 1993 to 30 September 1994, the policy issuing on 8 December 1993.

<P>

3   	The vessel sank at its mooring on 12 December 1993 as a
result of the hull "<i>becoming snagged"</i> on a submerged tree causing it to
take on water.  Photographs (Exhibit 2) depict the sorry state of the vessel
prior to its refloating
and graphically depict the entanglement of the vessel
with the submerged tree.  It was the evidence of Hildebrand that the sinking
of
the vessel received wide publicity in the print media circulating in the
district.  At the time the plaintiff encountered considerable
difficulty in
refloating the vessel without further damaging it in the process as there was a
real risk of the vessel breaking up
if the salvage was not carried out
correctly.  
<P>

4   	As a result of this experience the plaintiff, installed two
pumps with float switches aimed at preventing a re-occurrence.
 The vessel was
not refloated until 31 January 1994.  It sank again on 28 April 1994 when the
pumps that the plaintiff had installed
failed.  It was refloated on 30 April
1994.  Although the insurer has raised an issue of the unseaworthiness of the
vessel, no reliance
is placed upon the sinkings of the vessel in support of
that allegation.
<P>

5   	Following the second sinking the vessel was towed and
slipped on the banks of the Murray at a point across the river where
it is
surrounded by the township of Echuca.  The plaintiff made a claim under the
policy for the damage sustained to the vessel as
a result of the sinkings and
that claim was eventually satisfied by a payment by the insurer to the
plaintiff of $9,500 on 21 March
1995.  
<P>

6   	In the meantime, the policy had been renewed for a period
of twelve months from 30 September 1994 pursuant to a renewal invitation
and
renewal schedule submitted to the plaintiff by the insurer on 29 August 1994.
However the total sum insured in respect of the
vessel was reduced from $30,000
to $20,000.  The renewal did not issue until 23 February 1995.  I infer from
the evidence of Hildebrand
that he had to press the plaintiff to effect a
renewal to which the plaintiff agreed but at the reduced cover of $20,000.
There was
a further renewal of the policy issued pursuant to a renewal
invitation of the insurer issued on 21 August 1995: the renewal issuing
on 20
October 1995 for the period of twelve months from 30 September 1995.  On 4
March 1996 Brendon John Loftus (Loftus) suffered
serious injuries when he fell
to the ground from the vessel whilst engaged in restoration work on the vessel
for the plaintiff (the
Loftus accident).  Loftus has brought proceedings
against the plaintiff claiming substantial damages for personal injuries
suffered
in the accident.  The plaintiff has sought indemnification from the
insurer in respect of that claim under the public liability cover
of the
policy.  The insurer has declined to indemnify the plaintiff on the following
grounds: 
<P>

<u>"8A.	Further, the Defendant says: </u>
<P>

<u>a)	The Plaintiff has failed to disclosed material matters facts relevant to
the decision of the Defendant whether to accept the risk
proffered by the
application to renew the insurance and if so on what terms.</u>
<P>

<u>b)	The Plaintiff in breach of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21</a>,
failed to disclose to the Defendant or to its servants or agents the fact that
the boat was for an extended period of time on a
slipway, nor the fact that the
boat was undergoing major renovations and rebuilding whilst there.</u>
<P>

<u>c)	If the facts set out in paragraph 8A(b) above had been disclosed to the
Defendant, the Defendant would have declined to renew the
Plaintiff's insurance
in respect of the boat.</u>
<P>

9.	In respect of paragraph 11 of the Plaintiff's contentions the Defendant says
that the injuries to Loftus were sustained as a
result of the boat being in an
unsafe or unseaworthy condition.  Further the Defendant says that claims of
such nature were expressly
excluded by Exclusion 1(B) under the heading
"General Exclusions" in the policy wording."
<P>

7   	Any liability of the insurer is under part B of the policy
under which the insurer agreed to indemnify the plaintiff against
all claims
that he may become liable to pay as compensation or damages for bodily injury
to any person arising out of an accident
in connection with the use or
ownership of the vessel.  Exclusions under part B of the policy are notable
more for what they did
not exclude when compared with the exclusions under part
A, which was the property damage section of the policy.  For example, under
part A exclusions there were the following:   
<P>

"(g)	loss or damage caused by or directly attributable to any repair,
adjustment, service or maintenance.
<P>

(h)	loss of or damage to property occasioned by its undergoing any process
necessarily involving the application of heat.
<P>

(i)	theft of equipment, accessories or motors unless fixed to the Vessel or
locked in a secure area."
<P>

8   	There has been no reply filed in the proceedings on behalf
of the plaintiff.  However, the case has been conducted on behalf
of the
plaintiff on the basis that the matters said to be relevant to the decision of
the insurer were either in fact disclosed to
the insurer by the plaintiff, or
were matters that the insurer in the ordinary course of its business ought to
have known, alternatively,
in the circumstances a reasonable person could not
be expected to know that the subject matters were so relevant.  
<P>

9   	In brief, the vessel remained on the slips from May 1994
until March 1996 and beyond, with the plaintiff spasmodically carrying
out
repair work necessitated by the sinking of the vessel and carrying out
substantial renovation of the vessel.  In this respect
he was assisted from
time to time by Loftus.  Progress on this work was dependent upon the
availability of the plaintiff and Loftus
to perform the work and of the
availability of money to meet that cost.  The work performed in renovating the
vessel was extensive
 involving the removal of the walls and ceiling of the
superstructure and the replacement of the superstructure with new materials
and
the replacement of the diesel engine with a steam engine, presumably more in
keeping with the design of a paddle steamer.  
<P>

10   	It was the evidence in chief of the plaintiff that it was
a matter of common practice along the Murray for boats to be slipped
and for
repair and maintenance work to be performed on them and that he did not know
that the vessel "<i>being out of the water on the slips or work being done on
it when out of the water on the slip could be matters that could be relevant
to
the decision of the [insurer] as to whether or not to accept the [subject]
risk".</i>  However, I think that the case of the insurer is different from
that, having regard to the extended time over which the vessel remained
on the
slips, the physical features of the surrounding area, and the performance by
the plaintiff of extensive remodelling work on
the vessel during that time.

<P>

11   	The photographs in evidence leave no room for doubting the
extensive nature of the renovation of the vessel  which involved
reducing the
vessel to a bare hull and then rebuilding the superstructure.  
<P>

12   	As a result of my giving leave to the plaintiff to adduce
evidence by statement served out of time, I gave leave to the insurer
to call
the oral evidence of Edward Talbot Aldridge (Aldridge).  He was the loss
assessor appointed by the insurer to investigate
the plaintiff's claim under
part A of the policy arising out of the sinking of the vessel.  It was the
plaintiff's evidence that
between December 1993 and mid 1994 the plaintiff
informed Aldridge on more than one occasion of his intention to take advantage
of
the need to slip the vessel to carry out remodelling of its
superstructure.
<P>

13   	There was an issue about the authority of Aldridge to
receive such information so that his knowledge could be treated as knowledge
of
the insurer.  The insurer's case was that Aldridge's authority was limited to
written instructions in standard form simply requiring
his assessment of the
claim.  Clearly, the authority of Aldridge went beyond that, as was evidenced
by communications orally and
in writing between him and the plaintiff, with the
knowledge, for the most part, of the insurer, that covered the period until
settlement
of the claim in early 1995 and in which Aldridge was seen to be
negotiating settlement of the claim on behalf of the insurer.  
<P>

14   	However, I am satisfied that the authority of Aldridge to
assess the claim and to negotiate the settlement on behalf of the
insurer did
not entail a level of authority to fix the insurer with knowledge of any
statements made to Aldridge concerning the plaintiff's
intention to remodel the
vessel.  However the evidence of the plaintiff, which I accept, and the
evidence of Aldridge takes the matter
of disclosure beyond one of mere
statements by the plaintiff to Aldridge as loss assessor.  
<P>

15   	Under the insurer's guidelines it was provided as
follows:
<P>

"6.	<u>Claims</u>
<P>

To ensure that the effort of both claims and underwriting staff are not wasted,
there should be regular and constant liaison between
them.  It is the
responsibility of claims staff to advise underwriters of any unsatisfactory
underwriting feature which emerges from
the handling of a claim or any problems
with interpretation of policy wordings.  If urgent action is needed, immediate
notice should
be given to underwriting staff.
<P>

It is the responsibility of underwriting staff to:-
<P>

(i) 	check on any new or unknown underwriting features revealed by a claim.
<P>

(ii)	take the necessary action either immediately or before renewal, to correct
the problem."
<P>

16   	The evidence is clear that the claims section of the
insurer was informed of the fact that the vessel was and would be on
the slips
for a prolonged period and that the plaintiff intended to carry out repair and
renovation work largely in his own time.
 
<P>

17   	The Murray River where the vessel was slipped is a boating
area, comprised mainly of modest marine possessions whose owners
are want to
carry out repairs and improvements in their own time, much, I would infer, in
the way the plaintiff carried out work
on the vessel.  This feature of the area
and the general physical features of the location where the vessel was slipped
were well
known to the insurer's claim staff and, I think, at least one member
of its underwriting staff.  
<P>

18   	It was fairly obvious that the insurer knew through its
claims staff that the plaintiff was in no hurry to carry out the repairs
to the
vessel, nor, for that matter, to settle his claim under the policy. During this
period of extended slipping of the vessel
the insurer invited renewal of the
policy on two occasions.  
<P>

19   	The evidence of Aldridge was not entirely satisfactory.
That was partly due to a poor recollection of events, but also, I
think, due to
a lack of impartiality.  I have not the slightest doubt that Aldridge was
informed by the plaintiff on several occasions
that the plaintiff intended to
carry out extensive renovations of the vessel.  Indeed, following upon the
accident to Loftus, Aldridge
informed the insurer that the plaintiff had told
him in 1994 that he would <i>"completely renovate" </i>the vessel while it was
"<i>out of the water"</i>.  
<P>

20   	That was a report to the insurer's agent by Aldridge in
respect of which I had previously accepted the insurer's claim for
client legal
privilege.  That privilege was lost when it became clear that the report had
been used by Aldridge to revive his memory
for the purpose of giving evidence
in these proceedings.  When cross examined on the report he agreed he could
recall speaking to
the plaintiff <i>"at least twice"</i> about the plaintiff's
intention to carry out additional work on the boat, although he could not
remember the details of the discussion.
 
<P>

21   	Whatever the precise words were is of little moment, in my
view.  It is plain from Aldridge's report and the evidence of the
plaintiff
that Aldridge was informed by the plaintiff of the latter's intention to carry
out extensive renovation work on the vessel
while it was slipped.  I think it
is also clear that Aldridge was told by the plaintiff that he intended to carry
out repair work
and additional work, for the most part, by himself. The
evidence of Aldridge was reasonably clear to that effect that he had informed
the claims staff of the insurer, at the time of the negotiations for settlement
of the property damage claim in the last quarter
of 1994, that there was a
reasonable prospect for settling the claim for as little as $2,000 as the
plaintiff was carrying out the
repair work himself and intended carrying out
the renovation of the vessel at his own cost.
<P>

22   	In relation to the correspondence passing between
Aldridge, the insurer and the plaintiff concerning settlement of the property
damage claim, Aldridge gave the following evidence:
<P>

"Q.	And in the same context you may have communicated with the insurer that the
matter could be settled for that amount because
of the intention of Mr Carling
to do the work himself and carry out some renovations himself?
<P>

A.	Yes, by himself I meant him arranging.  I am not sure whether he was
physically going to do it.  That is the matter.
<P>

Q.	But (in) indicating to the insurer that the matter might be settled for
2,000 you think you did?
<P>

A.	I think so."
<P>

(T 45.7 - 45.17: the word in parenthesis I have added by way of correction of
the transcript which does not accurately record the
question.)
<P>

23   	When one looks at the photographs that Aldridge took of
the vessel in mid 1994 it is, I think, obvious that the plaintiff
had already
commenced removal of the superstructure of the vessel at the time he had
informed Aldridge of his intention to renovate
the vessel and that this would
have been apparent on inspection.
<P>

24   	On the evidence of Aldridge and that of the plaintiff,
having regard to the insurer's guidelines, if there was substance in
the
insurer's present denial of liability, the features of prolonged slipping of
the vessel and of the intention of the plaintiff
to carry out spasmodic repair
and renovation work on it while slipped would have been matters that in the
ordinary course would have
been reported to the underwriting staff of the
insurer.
<P>

25   	Phillip James Sholl (Sholl) was called in the insurer's
case. His evidence in chief was very brief and for convenience is
set out, so
far as relevant, as follows:  
<P>

"In May 1994 I took over the position of Area Manager for Commercial Union
Insurance at Bendigo.  This position had been previously
held by Martin
Corrigan.  This position included amongst other things, quoting insurance
business within my authority and referring
insurance outside my authority or
experience to others within Commercial Union Insurance.  In this position I
dealt with Wayne Hildebrand,
of Insurance House, on a regular basis.
<P>

Shortly after taking up the position of Area Manager at Bendigo, I became aware
that a boat owned by Mr Andrew Carling had sunk
and that a claim under the
Commercial Union Boat Insurance policy for the damage suffered to the boat was
made.  I recall Wayne Hildebrand
discussing the matter with me as it was a
claim which stood out as the boat had sunk twice and there had been
difficulties in refloating
it.
<P>

From my discussions with Mr Hildebrand it was my understanding that the boat
was to be repaired.  I was not aware that renovations
were intended.
<P>

If I had been informed that the boat would be on the slipway for an extended
period of time, or that the boat was to be extensively
renovated, I would have
referred the matter to Martin Corrigan, who at the time was the Northern
Regional Underwriter. I would have
referred the matter to Mr Corrigan as the
standard Commercial Union Insurance Boat Insurance policy would no longer have
been appropriate."
<P>

26   	It was Hildebrand's evidence that Sholl visited him in his
Echuca premises weekly, that there was telephone communication
more frequently
between them and that he had a recollection of conversations with Sholl in
January 1995, and in September that year
when the policy was being renewed, in
which he confirmed that the vessel was still on the slipway and that work was
still being performed
on it.
<P>

27   	Sholl gave his evidence in cross-examination frankly, in
my view.  However I think that evidence is difficult to reconcile
with a
portion of his evidence in chief in which he says that had he been<i> "informed
that the boat would be on the slipway for an extended period of time, or that
the boat was to be extensively renovated,
[he] would have referred the matter
to Martin Corrigan, who at the time was the Northern Regional
Underwriter</i>...<i>as the standard...Boat Insurance policy would no longer
have been appropriate."  </i>The fact is, as Sholl freely acknowledged, he was
fully aware from mid 1994 through to March 1996 that the vessel remained on the
slipway and that work was being performed, on his understanding, by the
plaintiff, spasmodically, from time to time.
<P>

28   	Indeed in a facsimile from the broker to the insurer of 19
January 1995 marked for Sholl's attention, Hildebrand informed
the insurer, in
seeking a quote on "<i>the new premium payable",</i> that the vessel was still
on the slipway "<i>being gradually repaired".</i>  In the same facsimile the
insurer was informed that the plaintiff wished<i> </i>"<i>to insure [the
vessel] for $20,000 whilst its(sic) being repaired (at present its (sic)
$28,500</i>)."  As earlier noted in these reasons, the insured amount was
reduced in the 1994/1995 policy year to $20,000 and maintained at that
level in
the following policy year.  
<P>

29   	I think that the only reasonable inference from that
evidence was that the insurer knew that the vessel remained on the slipway
until the Loftus accident and that work was being carried out on it during that
time without any identification of the precise nature
or extent of that
"<i>repair work</i>".  In fact I think that, from the evidence of Aldridge, the
claims staff had been informed during 1994 that the work included extensive
renovation.  
<P>

30   	I have great difficulty in distinguishing that situation
from the situation which the insurer said was not revealed to it
and that, had
it been so revealed, would have resulted in the cover being declined.  
<P>

31   	Some emphasis to that difficulty is given by the fact that
the officer responsible for the underwriting of the cover in the
subject region
after April 1994, Martin David Corrigan (Corrigan), had until April 1994 been
the Regional Area Manager, preceding
Sholl in that position.  As Area Manager
Corrigan had visited the broker's office in Echuca weekly and thereafter, as
underwriter,
visited the broker on an average of approximately two or three
times a year.  So far as is relevant the evidence in chief of Corrigan
was as
follows:
<P>

"After the boat sank I would not have been surprised if it was placed on a
slipway for a short period to undergo repairs to its
hull as this may have been
necessary to ensure that it did not sink again.
<P>

I did not know that the boat was going to be on a slipway for an extended
period, and I did not know that the boat was to be substantially
rebuilt.
However, if I had known that the boat was to be on a slipway for an extended
period of time for a major rebuild, I would
have referred the matter to Mr Don
Callahan to determine whether insurance coverage could be continued.
<P>

If I was told that the boat was to be renovated then I would have reported it
to Mr Don Callahan.  I did not have authority to:
<P>

1.	insure a paddle boat;
<P>

2.	insure a boat which was being renovated;
<P>

3.	to agree to continue to insure under an existing policy a boat which was
being renovated; or
<P>

4.	to renew an existing policy over a boat that was being renovated."
<P>

32   	It was Hildebrand's evidence that in the period from April
1994, when Corrigan assumed the underwriting role in the area,
Corrigan visited
the broker's Echuca office two or three times a year and on those occasions the
subject of the plaintiff's vessel
was raised and on those occasions Hildebrand
informed Corrigan that the vessel was still being repaired and on the slipway.
Cross-examined
about those conversations, Corrigan said that he had no
recollection of them.  I accept Hildebrand's evidence on this matter to the
extent that I am satisfied that on a number of occasions between April 1994 and
March 1996 conversations took place between Hildebrand
and Corrigan in the
broker's Echuca office in which the information was conveyed to the insurer
that the plaintiff's vessel was undergoing
a prolonged stay on the slipway
during which time work was being carried out on it, undefined in precise nature
and extent.
<P>

33   	Donald Peter Callahan (Callahan) gave underwriting
evidence in the insurer's case.  So far as is relevant he stated in his
evidence in chief as follows:  
<P>

"I was not aware that the boat was put on a slipway for an extended period of
time.  Generally, if a boat was damaged and a claim
was made for the damage,
insurance cover under the Boat policy would initially be allowed to continue
while repairs were performed
on the boat while it was in a slipway.  However,
if a boat was to be on a slipway for quite some time or it was undergoing major
renovations, then I would have had to consider whether the boat policy should
be renewed. 
<P>

The risk involved with a boat laid up on a slipway is a different risk to a
boat on the water.  A boat laid up on a slipway is viewed
as a commercial risk
and alternative insurance to that of the Boat policy must be sought.
Alternative insurance would be Fire Insurance
and rated according to the risk
of boat building or boat construction.  Commercial Union's rating
classification for boat building
is "Decline" for fibreglass boat builders and
"Decline" for wood boat builders.
<P>

If I had been informed at the expiration of the Plaintiff's boat policy in
September 1995 that the boat had been on a slipway for
some time and was
expected to continue to be on a slipway, I would have required a survey of the
slipway and boat to be conducted,
to determine whether the risk for Fire
Insurance and Public Liability insurance was acceptable.
<P>

If I was told at anytime that the boat was undergoing major renovations, then I
would have required a survey of the slipway and
the boat to be conducted.
<P>

A survey involves the assessment of the general condition of the slipway and
boat.  A survey of this nature would include photographs.
<P>

Attached to this statement is a number of photographs of the boat and the
slipway.  I have reviewed the photographs.
<P>

I have concluded from my review of the photographs the following:
<P>

*	Access to the boat was unrestricted.
<P>

*	The possibility of fire was high because wooden boat building is a high
hazard occupation, due to flammable materials used and
due to tools and
equipment used, and location of the slipway.  
<P>

*	The general condition of the slipway was relatively poor.
<P>

I would not have accepted this risk.
<P>

On the assumption that a survey I had requested would have revealed the matters
shown in the photographs attached to this statement
and referred to above, I
would have declined to renew the plaintiff's boat policy."
<P>

34   	The fact is that the insurer had been informed at claims
and underwriting level that the vessel had been subjected to a prolonged
stay
on the slipway and that during that period repair work was being carried out on
it.
<P>

35   	As to matters which would have resulted in Callahan's
non-acceptance of the risk, I make the following observations.  Access
was
something well known to the claims and underwriting staff from their general
knowledge of the area, from frequent and regular
visits to the Echuca area and
from the photographs provided by Aldridge.  The possibility of damage by fire
must have been present
from mere presence of the vessel on the slipway whether
the work could be described as repair or renovation.  The bushland nature
of
the location of the slipway was clearly shown in the photographs supplied by
Aldridge to the insurer as was the general condition
of the slipway: a
condition which Callahan acknowledged fell into the category of housekeeping
things that could be addressed specifically
in underwriting the risk, and would
not involve a non-acceptance of the cover.  I regard it as not without
significance that Callahan
had never had occasion to cancel or refuse renewal
of a boat insurance policy on the basis that repair work was being undertaken
in respect of the subject vessel.
<P>

36   	The statement of Eduard John Kuyper (Kuyper) admitted into
evidence in the insurer's case confirmed my strong view that by
its own
guidelines the underwriters should have been aware of the circumstances of
which the insurer  is now claiming  non-disclosure.
 It was Kuyper's evidence
that had he "<i>been aware that the boat would be renovated or would remain on
the slipway for an extended period, [he] would have reported this fact
to the
underwriting department at Commercial Union Insurance as it was something
unusual."   </i>I have no doubt that the insurer had been informed of both of
those facts prior to and subsequent to the renewal of the policy for
the
1994/1995 year and prior to the writing of the renewal for the 1995/1996 year.
In cross-examination, Kuyper's evidence was that
he had no recollection of
having being informed of the prolonged slipping of the vessel.  He understood
that the plaintiff was going
 to undertake the repairs to the vessel himself
and that he was taking his time to carry out that work as at the time of
settlement
of the claim in 1995.
<P>

37   	Brett Kingsley Watson (Watson) took over the position of
underwriting for the Victorian Rural Insurance division of the Insurer
from
Callahan. His evidence in chief in relevant respects was identical with that of
Callahan and my observations in relation to
Callahan's evidence have equal
application to Watson's evidence.
<P>

38   	In cross-examination Watson elaborated upon his evidence
in chief by alluding to the location of surrounding bush at the site
where the
vessel was slipped, to the absence of any fencing and the presence of building
materials lying around in the vicinity of
the vessel.  He was shown the
photographs forwarded by Aldridge to the insurer in mid 1994 and as to those
photographs he gave the
following evidence:
<P>

"Q.	Don't those photographs show all the things in respect to which you express
concern in your statement?
<P>

A.	Pretty much, yes.
<P>

RE -EXAMINATION.
<P>

DAVIES: Q.  It is just the first six of these photographs that show the
position that you have been discussing, is that right?
<P>

A.	Yes, I realise the others are of no relevance."
<P>

(T 82.54 - 83.4)
<P>

The first six photographs to which Watson referred in that evidence were
Aldridge's photographs taken in 1994. 
<P>

39   	I am firmly of the view that the insurer, at claims and at
underwriting level, was well aware of the following:
<P>

1.	that the vessel between May 1994 and March 1996 remained on the slipway on
the bank of the Murray in the vicinity of Echuca,

<P>

2.	the slipway on which the vessel had been slipped was situated in a typical
riverbank bushland area,
<P>

3.	material associated with the work on the vessel lay within the vicinity of
the slipway,
<P>

4.	during that period spasmodic work of an undefined nature, additional to
repair work, probably described as extensive renovation
work, was being carried
out by the plaintiff in his own time.
<P>

5.	while the vessel was on the slipway undergoing work the plaintiff required a
cover for $20,000 for the purposes of part A of
the policy and the policy was
renewed between 1994 and 1996 on that basis. 
<P>

40   	Upon those findings it is my view that there has been no
material non-disclosure by the plaintiff.  I would add that I am
not entirely
satisfied that the plaintiff knew that the matters of which non-disclosure is
alleged were matters "relevant to the
decision of the insurer whether to accept
the risk."  In cross-examination the plaintiff gave the following evidence:
<P>

"Q.	You did consider that CGU would wanted to know that you were completely
rebuilding the boat from the hull up?
<P>

A.	I didn't necessarily consider it along those lines. I considered that they
were aware of what was going on.  If I can add to
that. So, well, I suppose in
answer to your question, I would say yes, because I made a specific point of
bringing it to their attention."
<P>

(T 9.43 - 9.49)
<P>

41   	When that evidence was given I had the clear impression
that the additional material offered by the plaintiff was more a matter
of
reconstruction and that the reality was that the plaintiff did not turn his
mind to the question at the time of the renewals of
the policy that his
intention to carry out renovation work in his own time over an extended
slipping of the vessel was a matter relevant
to the decision of the insurer
whether to accept the risk.
<P>

42   	Whether I am correct in my view that the insurer knew of
the circumstances affecting the risk on the vessel at the times of
renewals of
the policy, I am satisfied that the statements made to the claims, management
and underwriting staff of the insurer by
the plaintiff or his broker, or
through Aldridge, were such that, on the insurer's own case were matters which,
in the ordinary course
ought to have been known by the insurer, and so falling
within the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21(2)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a> (Cth).

<P>

43   	As earlier noted in these reasons there was a defence
based on general exclusion 1(b) which excluded:
<P>

...
<P>

"liability incurred:
<P>

...
<P>

(b) as a result of the Vessel being in an unsafe or unseaworthy
condition..."
<P>

44   	It is not clear to me upon what evidence the insurer
relied in the contention that the vessel was unsafe or unseaworthy or
what was
the "<i>direct causal link between the unseaworthy condition of the boat and
the injuries suffered by Mr Loftus." </i> It is clear that the insurer was not
relying on the sinking of the vessel.  I did not understand that submission on
behalf of the
insurer to be pressed.  
<P>

45   	The case has been conducted before me on the basis that in
the event that there has been no material non-disclosure within
the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a>, the insurer is liable to indemnify the
plaintiff in respect of any liability he may have to pay as compensation or
damages for bodily
injury suffered by Loftus arising out of his accident in
connection with the plaintiff's use or ownership of the vessel, within the
meaning of clause 1 of part B of the policy.
<P>

46   	Accordingly I make the following declaration.  The
defendant is liable to indemnify the plaintiff under clause 1 of part B
of the
Boat Insurance Policy, number 39P5389740, in respect of any liability of the
plaintiff to pay compensation or damages to Brendon
John Loftus for any bodily
injury suffered by Brendon John Loftus on or about 4 March 1996, arising out of
an accident in connection
with the plaintiff's use or ownership of the vessel,
known as the "<i>Lady of Barmah</i>".  The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's
costs of these proceedings.
