<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These proceedings consist of two actions, each commenced by summons.  Each
summons claims an order in the nature of mandamus directed
to the first
defendant, a costs assessor under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a> (1987) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/s206.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.206</a>,
requiring that first defendant to deliver within 28 days a document specifying
the reasons for which he has disallowed or reduced,
as the case may be, the
various items in the bills of costs assessed by him in proceedings in this
court.
<P>

2	In each case the order claimed, notes that the costs assessor has stated
grounds for the disallowance or reduction of the relevant
item as:-
<P>

	"(a)	not reasonably necessary in whole or in part;
<P>

	(b)	not reasonable as to amount;  or
<P>

	(c)	not reasonable as not covered by the court order."
<P>

3	In addition in each summons orders are sought extending the time for appeal
under s.208L(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a> or for an application under s.208M
of the said Act for leave to appeal.  Alternatively an order granting leave to
the plaintiff to
file a notice of appeal from the assessments made by the first
defendant is sought.
<P>

4	No additional ground is advanced for the extension of time application, for
leave to appeal or for appeal other than that which
is relied on to support the
application for the order in the nature of mandamus under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</a>, or for an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.65</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> which the
plaintiff prayed in aid in addition in argument
<P>

5	The basis for the plaintiff's contention that it is entitled to the relief
sought is simply that the reasons given by the costs
assessor are in each case
inadequate.
<P>

6	It is accepted, on the authority of the <b>Attorney General &amp; Anor v.
Kennedy Miller Television Pty. Limited &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 729</a> that
costs assessors are required to give reasons.
<P>

7	Section 208F of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a> (1987) provides:-
<P>

	"Assessment of bills generally:-
<P>

	(1)	When considering an application relating to a bill of costs, the costs
assessor must consider;
<P>

	(a)	whether or not it was reasonable to carry out the work to which the costs
relate, and
<P>

	(b)	whether or not the work was carried out in a reasonable manner, and
<P>

	(c)	the fairness and reasonableness of the amount of costs in relation to that
work."
<P>

8	By s.208F(2) the costs assessor is to determine the application by confirming
the bill of costs, or if satisfied that the disputed
costs are unfair and
unreasonable, to substitute the amount that in his or her opinion is a fair and
reasonable amount.  The costs
assessor may have regard to a number of
enumerated matters pursuant to s.208G additional to those referred to for the
purposes of
ascertaining what is a fair and reasonable amount of costs, ie, the
criterion under s.208F(1)(c).
<P>

9	The appeal provided by s.208L to a party who is dissatisfied with a decision
of the costs assessor is as to a matter of law arising
in the proceedings to
determine the application.  It has not been suggested here that any particular
matter was raised on the determination
of the application other than as I will
turn to later when referring to the letters of the costs assessor and the
solicitors for
the plaintiff with respect to the adequacy of the reasons given.
Further, that appeal is to be dealt with by the Supreme Court under
s.208L by
either affirming the costs assessor's decision or making such determination in
relation to the application as in its opinion
should have been made by the
costs assessor (this could not possibly relate to the failure to give reasons)
or by remitting its decision
on the question to the costs assessor and ordering
the costs assessor to re-determine the application. (The re-determination of
the
application is hardly appropriate to a suggested inadequacy of reasons).
<P>

10	An appeal by leave is given under s.208M, but this is an appeal against the
determination of the application made by the costs
assessor.  It is
inappropriate where no challenge is made, as here, to the correctness of the
quantum finally decided as appropriately
assessed but to the reasons for the
assessor in reaching that determination.  In any event, no evidence has been
put before me to
suggest any reason whatsoever why the appeals in the
applications for extension had not been otherwise launched than by the filing
of the summonses herein.
<P>

11	Having regard to what appears in the judgment of Master Harrison in
<b>Stacks the Law Firm v. Bogeosvki</b> (unreported 19 November 1998) citing
the unreported decision of Master Greenwood in <b>Busuttil v. Holder &amp;
Anor</b> (9 August 1996) in which that Master referred to the criteria for the
extension of time and the grant of leave under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a>, unless
I were of the view that the reasons were materially inadequate, and unless I
were further of the view that the matters could
appropriately be dealt with by
way of appeal no extension would be appropriate and no grant of leave
appropriate.  As will appear
I am not of that view.
<P>

12	The argument that the costs assessor was required to give more reasons than
he has, needs to be examined in each case from the
starting point of looking at
what has so far been provided.  In the course of the argument the plaintiff
tendered and had admitted
into evidence three bundles of exhibits, exhibits 1,
2 and 3.  Each supplemented the  material annexed to the affidavit in each case
of A.G. Cameron, the solicitor for the plaintiff, which affidavits annexed
correspondence to and from the costs assessor.  I was
not taken to any
particular matter in any of the exhibits in argument.  Those exhibits were
supplemented by certificates of assessment
which were admitted in the case for
the defendant, and each setting out either the assessment of costs of the
relevant action or
the assessment of the costs assessor's costs.
<P>

13	The costs assessor has provided letters which whilst different in some
respects refer to the general scheme whereby he undertook
his task. He has
disallowed the charge out rate of the solicitors and reduced it to $250 per
hour including clerical work.  He has
allowed photocopying at a particular
basis.  He has expressed the view that some of the attendances on counsel and
the applicant
were not reasonably necessary or were unreasonably long.  He
disallowed certain items as being outside the ambit of the order, including,
for example, the obtaining of advice relating to capital gains tax.
<P>

14	Subsequent to his assessments he was requested, in consequence of the
decision of Sperling, J. at first instance in <b>Attorney General &amp; Anor v.
Kennedy Miller Television Pty. Limited</b> (unreported 1 August 1987), to
provide reasons for the assessment.  He provided in respect of the two bills
referred to in matter
No. 11994 of 1998 markings in the margin of the relevant
exhibits being exhibits 2 and 3, in effect by way of a code, setting out
the
bases on which the reductions or disallowances had occurred.
<P>

15	In matter No. 12086 of 1998, the other of the two proceedings before me, he
similarly marked that bill of costs, which is exhibit
1, and referred to the
basis on which he dealt with items either generally or in some cases
specifically in a letter dated 4 August
1998, which is annexure A to the
affidavit of Mr. Cameron sworn 24 August 1998.
<P>

16	Annexure C to that affidavit sets out the costs assessor's response to the
request for reasons and the code dealing with each
item in relation to the bill
of costs.
<P>

17	The extent to which a body which is required by law to furnish reasons,
whether it be an administrative body or a judicial body,
is to be ascertained
firstly from the nature of the particular function the body is performing and
secondly the purpose for which
the reasons are provided.  Often it will be
necessary to furnish reasons so that an appeal might be brought.
<P>

18	In <b>Pettit v. Dunkley</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%201%20NSWLR%20376" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 1 NSWLR 376</a> is to be found a classic
illustration of the necessity to furnish reasons to enable the basis for a
judicial determination to be
ascertained.  That, however, does not mean that
the reasons have to provide a justification entirely sufficient in law for the
conclusion
or that the whole of the reasoning process must be set out in all
cases to avoid quasi-prerogative relief.  Indeed the very absence
of a relevant
finding might well constitute a sufficient basis for an appeal, but not for
mandamus and in that sense it cannot be
said that the reasons are defective,
although the conclusion might be.
<P>

19	The extent of the necessity to deliver reasons can vary from that high
standard imposed by law on a trial judge conducting a
judge alone criminal
trial as was noted recently by the High Court in <b>Mark Fleming v. The
Queen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20HCA%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) HCA 68</a> dealing with the construction of Part 9 of the Criminal
Procedure Act in the context of an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act.
 (That
decision has recently been applied in this court in <b>Regina v. Brian William
Maxwell</b> (CCA, unreported 23 December 1998).)
<P>

20	The submissions of the plaintiff, however, in this case did not descend
beyond the simple contention that what was put by the
costs assessor on the
bills of costs and in the correspondence was inadequate.  No real assistance
was offered as to why those reasons
were inadequate as reasons except the
proposition that they were conclusions. Implicitly the argument suggested that
in respect of
each item the costs assessor should have to give in writing some
detail exposing the reasoning process.  To do so would mean that
the task of a
costs assessor would become not only onerous but in most substantial cases
immensely difficult to complete.
<P>

21	There is a distinction between furnishing a short notation of the basis for
the conclusion that the item should be disallowed
or reduced and furnishing
judicial reasons.  In <b>Attorney General v. Kennedy Miller</b> (supra),
Sperling, J., after noting what had been said in <b>Soulemezis v. Dudley
(Holdings) Pty. Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247</a> by Kirby, P. at 259 and McHugh,
JA. at 280 to 281 concerning the extent of judicial reasons to be given in the
context of a statutory
right of appeal proposed that the obligation on the part
of a costs assessor to provide reasons was such at least as would enable
the
exposure of simple errors of principle or mistake.  His Honour at p.34 held
that it was necessary to specify the items which
have been reduced by what
amount and for what reason in each instance.  His Honour held that:-
<P>

	"Having regard to the purpose to be served by such reasons and the sources of
the requirement - implied statutory obligation and
procedural fairness - the
obligation should be no higher than is necessary for the purpose.  It would in
my view be sufficient if
reasons were provided on request by each party.  The
request could be limited in some way if the agreed party was so minded, for
example, to particular items.  The costs assessor would be entitled to make a
supplementary charge for the time required to provide
reasons as part of the
cost of the assessment.
<P>

	It does not seem to me that what I propose would be particularly onerous or
that it would materially increase the cost of the process.
 It may be
preferable for assessors to anticipate the possibility of a request for reasons
when processing the bill.  In the ordinary
course the assessor would need to
note against any item reduced the amount of the reduction or the reduced amount
in order to be
able to tally up the result.  It would be easy enough to record
the reason for the reduction in each instance at the same time. 
In each case
the reason must be readily to mind.  Otherwise the item would not have been
reduced.  In most instances, a word or two
would suffice.  A code could be
devised for recurring reasons.  I doubt that this would add much to the cost of
the assessment. 
It would, in my view, be a reasonable incident of the
assessment and chargeable as part of the assessment. If a request for reasons
were made at a later time, little  extra work would be required to produce the
reasons in suitable form.
<P>

	The provision of reasons which was required on request under the earlier
scheme, is not inconsistent with the stated objectives
of the amending
legislation, namely, to speed up and to reduce the cost of taxation of costs,
having regard to other features of
the scheme in particular, the elimination of
herrings and oral argument before a taxing officer."
<P>

22	His Honour's proposal was not the subject of disapproval in the Court of
Appeal.  The court held that there was a necessity to
provide reasons.  It did
so particularly as the court had regard to the rights of appeal incorporated in
the new assessment system.
<P>

23	In the judgment of Priestley, JA. the passage set out from Sperling, J.'s
judgment at pp.35-36, part of which is included in
the portion I have cited,
was noted with approval, in particular it deals with the recording of the
reason for the reduction when
reducing or disallowing.  Particularly the
argument was put in <b>Kennedy Miller</b> (supra) that to undertake this
process would have caused significant problems of time and expense for costs
assessors.  The court
did not accept that the statute did not contemplate some
such process as this.  Priestley, JA. held at p.736D:-
<P>

	"The process described by Sperling, J. in the passage in his reasons above set
out seemed a workable method not involving the difficulties
suggested by the
appellant. The court was alive to the fact that the day-to-day expense of costs
assessors might well result in me
having a great deal more realistic
understanding of the situation than the members of the court.  (Although this
feeling was to some
extent lessened by the inability of counsel to point to any
specific difficulties caused by the method suggested by Sperling, J.)"
<P>

24	There was in that case, as there is before me, a lack of any material in the
evidence such as to suggest any particular problem
with the general scheme
provided in the suggestion of Sperling, J.  Priestley, JA. did go on to say at
737:-
<P>

	"One thing that both the submissions of the hearing and those contained in the
statement have made plain to me is that there is
scope for policy guidelines to
become established governing the way in which reasons are provided.  Sperling,
J.'s suggestions already
go some distance towards that.  Some matters mentioned
in the statement (his Honour is referring to a statement provided after the
argument of the appeal to the Court of Appeal in that case) indicate that
something more detailed may be required in the interests
of keeping costs and
time wasting to a minimum.  Whether or not that is so does not arise for
decision in the present appeal, where
the question is the general one in
respect of which leave was granted, is there an obligation upon costs assessors
to give reasons
for their determinations? As I have already said my opinion is
that the answer is clearly yes."
<P>

25	His Honour went on to hold that the primary requirement for reasons is of
sufficient strength, or was of sufficient  strength
to overcome any of the
asserted difficulties and dealt with ancillary questions.  Powell, JA. agreed
with him.
<P>

26	Handley, JA. expressed some dissatisfaction with the agreed basis for the
submissions, ie. that the costs assessor was performing
an administrative
function and concluded that in his analysis it was a judicial function.  He
expressed a view that it was arguable
that the costs assessor had a duty to
give reasons as an incident of that judicial function. Subject to those
remarks, which his
Honour noted were necessarily tentative, he agreed with the
orders proposed by Priestley, JA.  He also agreed with his Honour's reasons,
and, on the assumption that a costs assessor was exercising an administrative
function, did not wish to add anything.
<P>

27	It cannot be said that the method used by this assessor in this matter falls
so far outside what was noted by Sperling, J. and
the Court of Appeal as to
evidence a disregard for his statutory obligations and a jurisdictional error,
in my view. It may be that
more could have been done.  It may be that it could
have been done better.  It may be that what has been done may have failed to
make findings such that some appeal might lie, but I have not been taken to any
such failing. What I am concerned about on the primary
claim for relief is
whether relief in the nature of a prerogative writ might go.  I see no basis in
what has been put before me and
in what has been submitted for that
conclusion.
<P>

28	The outline of submissions provided by the plaintiff asserts that the
reasons do not speak for themselves.  In my view they do.
 The process was
intended to be expeditious and cheap.  To have to expose in relation to each
item or in relation to general categories
of items a detailed process of
reasoning goes well beyond what the Court of Appeal had held was necessary,
would not be necessary
to serve the purposes of the appeals provided, and would
impose onerous obligations on those assessing.
<P>

29	It was further argued that in particular in relation to the reduction of the
charge out rate no adequate reason was given for
the difference.  Reference was
made to criteria, to which it was said one should have regard to when
ascertaining the charge out
rate.  Those criteria, in particular the market
rate for provision of legal services of a like kind and the circumstances of
the
particular matter itself, are criteria that it is expected that a tribunal
of a specialist nature, such as a costs assessor appointed
from the profession,
would be entitled to either know or ascertain since in particular the matters
under s.208G are matters which
it would not be expected would give rise to a
formal hearing with the tender of evidence and perhaps oral argument. Section
208(2)
provides that in considering an application a costs assessor is not
bound by the rules of evidence and may inform himself or herself
on any matter
in such manner as he or she thinks fit.  Provided that the assessor affords to
the parties the opportunity to make
submissions and to deal with any basis
which might otherwise be erroneous in principle, he does not err in doing so.
The assessor
is entitled to have regard to the rates commonly charged from the
profession and the circumstances of the matter from what is before
him and his
own knowledge.
<P>

30	This was the only real particular matter to which I was  taken, albeit that
I was taken to it as an illustration of why the reasons
were not adequate.  In
my view they were and consequently I see no basis for any of the orders sought
in the summonses.
<P>

31	The conclusion I have reached, therefore, is that in each case the summons
should be dismissed.  I so order.
<P>

32	I order the plaintiff pay the costs of both sets of proceedings.  It would
be somewhat less, one would expect, than if they had
been determined
separately.
