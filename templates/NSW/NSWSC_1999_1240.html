<P>


<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  Following an order that the proceedings
between the parties continue on pleadings and, <i>inter alia</i>, that the
plaintiff should file and serve a Statement of Claim, a Statement of Claim was
duly filed on 12 February 1999.  It is sufficient
for present purposes to set
out the allegations in paragraphs 1 to 7-
<P>

1.	The plaintiff is the Chief Executive Officer of Customs.
<P>

1a	The Defendant is a company duly incorporated under the laws of Australia and
is liable to be sued in and by its corporate name
and style.
<P>

2.	In the period 1987 to 1990 inclusive the Defendant traded under the name
Aquila Shoes.
<P>

<b>Goods # 1</b>
<P>

3.	In or about July, 1987 Goods # 1 were:
<P>

3.1	imported into Australia
<P>

	3.2	imported into Australia for home consumption.
<P>

<b>Particulars of Goods # 1</b>
<P>

	672 pairs of shoes, supplied by Calcado Raly, Portugal:
<P>

<b>Particulars of Importation</b>
<P>

	Airway Bill No:  MAWB 057 376 36756, dated:
<P>

	28 July, 1987.
<P>

4.	At the time of importation the Defendant was:
<P>

	4.1	the owner of Goods # 1,
<P>

	4.2	importer of Goods # 1,
<P>

	4.3	beneficially interested in Goods # 1,
<P>

5.	Goods # 1 were not entered as required under Part IV of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>
(C'wth).
<P>

6.	Amount of Customs duty payable in relation to Goods # 1 is $9116.86.
<P>

7.	No Customs duty has been paid in respect of Goods # 1.
<P>

2   	By Notice of Motion the defendant seeks to have the
Statement of Claim struck out pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 26</a> of the Rules of the
Court as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
<P>

3   	The crucial provisions relevant to the cause of action
sought to be established by the plaintiff are contained in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs
Act</i> 1901</a> (the Act) and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cta1987178/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Tariff Act</i> 1987</a> (the Tariff Act).
These Acts must be read together.  Indeed, the Act is, by s4 of the Tariff Act,
to be incorporated in the latter
Act "and shall be read as one" with it.
<P>

4   	Section 21 of the Tariff Act provides -
<P>

"(1) Duties of Customs are imposed, in accordance with this Act, on:
<P>

	
<P>

		(a)	goods imported into Australia on or after the 			commencement day; and
<P>

	
<P>

		(b)	goods:
<P>

			(i)	imported into Australia before the 					commencement day; and
<P>

			(ii)	entered, or again entered, for home 					consumption on or after the
commencement 				day."
<P>

5   	When goods are imported, s68(1) of the Act requires them to
be entered for home consumption, warehousing or trans-shipment.
 The Statement
of Claim alleges that the relevant goods were imported into Australia for home
consumption but were not entered as
required by the Act.  The defendant was, at
the relevant time, both the owner and importer of the goods.  The Statement of
Claim
relies upon importation alone as creating the obligation to pay Customs
duty, quantified variously in relation to the sets of imported
goods
specified.
<P>

6   	The point that the defendant takes is deceptively simple.
It is, that there being no entry for home consumption, there can
be no
obligation to pay the sums specified or, if there be an obligation, it cannot
be quantified to create the debt alleged.
<P>

7   	Specification of the sum payable as Customs duty is
provided for by s132 of the Act which states -
<P>

(1)	Subject to this section and to section 123B, the rate of any import duty
payable on goods is the rate of the duty in force when
the goods are entered
for home consumption.
<P>

(2)	Where goods are entered for home consumption more than once before import
duty is paid on them, the rate at which the import
duty is payable is the rate
of the duty in force when the goods were first entered for home consumption.
<P>

(3)	Subject to subsection 38(5), for the purposes of this section, where an
entry for home consumption in respect of goods is withdrawn
under subsections
38(1) and (2) and the goods are subsequently entered for warehousing, the entry
for home consumption shall be disregarded.
 
<P>

Prepayment of duty
<P>

132A.	Where, before goods are entered for home consumption, an amount is paid
to a Collector in respect of duty that may become
payable in respect of the
goods, the amount shall, upon the goods being entered for home consumption, be
deemed, for the purposes
of this Act, to be an amount of duty paid in respect
of the goods."
<P>

8   	Section 132B is irrelevant for present purposes.  The
defendant points out that s 132 contains no reference to the circumstance
that
might obtain should goods be imported but no entry made.  Section 21 of the
Tariff Act thus has the role of identifying the
goods subject to duties of
Customs.  Moreover, if entry for home consumption were not material to the
imposition of duty, s21(1)(b)
would not need to refer to it.  The omission to
enter the goods in certain circumstances is made the subject of criminal
proceedings,
which may or may not obtain here, but which the pleadings do not
seek to deal with.  It may be that proceedings could be taken to
require
compliance with the obligations created by s68(1) of the Act, but as this
matter was not raised before me I say no more about
it.
<P>

9   	Under s30 of the Act goods are subject to the control of
Customs (relevantly) from the time of importation until dealt with
in
accordance with an entry of the goods for home consumption, or until export.
Offences may be committed if the goods are dealt
with otherwise than in
accordance with an entry, in certain circumstance.  Again, the Statement of
Claim does not purport to deal
with those circumstances.
<P>

10   	It is, I think, necessary to appreciate that rates of duty
may well vary between the time that goods are imported into Australia
and the
time that they are the subject of an  entry for home consumption.  Over the
years those rates have varied very substantially
almost from year to year.
<P>

11   	Amongst other submissions, the defendant argues that even
if an obligation to pay Customs duty arose following importation
of these goods
so that, for example, an offence may have been committed, if there was an
intention to evade duty, that obligation
cannot be quantified for the purpose
of civil proceedings for debt under s153 of the Act until an entry of any kind
but, relevantly
here, for home consumption is made.  At all material times s153
of the Act read as follows -
<P>

"All duties shall constitute Crown debts charged upon the goods in respect of
which the same are payable and payable by the owner
of the goods and
recoverable at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction in the name of
the Collector."  
<P>

12   	The plaintiff submits that in the absence of an entry the
duty is imposed on importation and the relevant rate is that applying
as at
that date.  This submission seems to be inconsistent with the specific
provisions of s132 of the Act set out above.
<P>

13   	The question raised by the Notice of Motion was
considered, though in a somewhat different context, in the Supreme Court of
Queensland <i>In Re Gregg Prechelt</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QSC/1999/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] QSC 36</a> (3 March 1999) per Muir J.
The issue for determination on that application was whether customs duty was
payable on a consignment
of cigarettes imported into Australia from Norfolk
Island.  The goods fell, it was agreed, within s68(1)(f) of the Act, but the
release
of the goods, on which customs was payable, was declined pending
valuation and payment of duty.  The Court needed to consider the
effect of s68
of the Act in the form it took following the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/caelaa1992391/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs and Excise Legislation
Amendment Act</i> 1992</a>.  Section 15 of the Tariff Act was at that time
substantially in the same form as s21(1) of the legislation I am considering,
although
some details differ.
<P>

14   	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant, before Muir
J, that although s15 of the Tariff Act imposed duties and s16 prescribed
the
mode of calculation of the rate of duty, s 132 of the Act fixed a rate for all
goods by reference to the date on which such goods
were "entered for home
consumption" and that as these goods were not so entered, no rate of customs
duty is set in respect of the
goods in question and, accordingly, no duty was
payable.
<P>

15   	As his Honour pointed out, although s132 of the Act has
varied from time to time, it has always provided, in substance, that
duties are
to be paid at the rate applicable when the goods were entered for home
consumption.  His Honour referred to the <i>Customs Law of Australia</i> (1904)
by Wallaston in explaining the purpose for s132.  It is convenient to set out
the passage relied on -
<P>

"This section disposes for many purposes of the question so often raised under
other Acts, as to what constitutes the exact date
of importation.  Seeing that
duties are leviable under the tariff on importation and become a debt due to
the Crown immediately on
importation, a change in the tariff after importation,
but before payment of duty, frequent raised the question under the State laws,
as to what duties were payable.
<P>

The above settles the point as regards the rate of duty. Liability to or
freedom from duty is determined by the law in force at
the date of entry for
home-consumption, not the date of importation."
<P>

16   	His Honour pointed out that the concept "entry for home
consumption played a central role in the operation of the legislation".
 With
respect to his Honour, this is self-evidently so.
<P>

17   	In this case, as in <i>Prechelt</i>, the strength of the
defendant's submission lies in the plain words of the legislation itself, not
only, of course, those of s21(1)
of the Tariff Act, but s68 and s132 of the
Act.  I consider that his Honour is correct in categorising the function of
s132 as performing
the critical requirement of "identifying the amount of tax
to be calculated and assessed ... so that absent such a provision, there
is no
mechanism by which tax imposed in a general way by ss 15 and 16 [here 21 and 22
of the Tariff Act] can attach to particular
goods."
<P>

18   	I find, with respect, the reasoning of Muir J in
<i>Prechelt</i> to be convincing, resting as it does upon both the clear
language of the sections to which I have referred, but also on the express
scheme of the Act.  But, even if I did not share his Honour's view, my doubts
would not be of a kind as to justify departing from
the decision; see <i>Re</i>
<i>Brashs Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2015%20ACSR%20477" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 15 ACSR 477</a> per Hayne J at 483.
<P>

19   	Mr Gelbart, who represented the plaintiff in this hearing,
and whose arguments I found most helpful in clarifying the issues,
pointed out
that there were a number of earlier decisions both in England and in the High
Court of Australia to which Muir J did
not refer and which did not appear to
have been brought to his attention.  The persuasive way in which Mr Gelbart
developed the argument
in this respect had, I must confess, led me to waiver
during the hearing on the appropriate conclusion.  However, at the end of the
day I do not consider that the observations that were the subject of his
careful submissions were such as to lead me to differ from
the conclusion
reached, albeit in absence of any such reference, in <i>Prechelt.</i>
<P>

20   	In deference to the arguments addressed to me in this
respect by Mr Gelbart, I should make some reference to those decisions.

<P>

21   	In point of chronological order, the first case is that of
<i>The Attorney General v Ansted &amp; Ors</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1844/177.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1844] EngR 177</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281844%29%20152%20ER%201304" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1844) 152 ER 1304.</a>  In that
case the defendants had imported fruit for which they passed a warehousing
entry and then stored them in a bonded warehouse.
 A portion of the fruit came
into their possession by the dishonesty of their agent whom they employed to
pay the duty and procure
delivery.  In the result, the fruit was taken into
home consumption without any duty having been paid to Customs.  No entry for
home
consumption was made, but their agent had misappropriated the money
received for payment of the duty.  The Crown sued them for debt.
 The
defendants argued that the duty did not attach on importation but only on entry
of the goods.  His Lordship, the Chief Baron,
referred to the object of "recent
Acts of Parliament" as to enable merchants in certain cases to postpone the
payment of duties,
but not to discharge the importer from liability for payment
by that process.  His Lordship pointed out that the right of the Crown
to the
duties of Custom pre-existed the recent legislation and their liability to pay
as importers on entering the goods for home
consumption, was unaffected by
their failure to make an entry and, thus, contend that their own failure
released them.  Baron Parke
was essentially of the same opinion, pointing out
that it did not lie in the mouth of the defendants to contend that the time for
payment had not arrived, because no  entry for home consumption had been made,
since that arose from their own fault.  The other
Barons of Exchequer on the
Court, agreed.
<P>

22   	Having regard to the specific terms of s132 of the Act,
general statements such as those made in this case are, on the face
of it,
somewhat less convincing than they otherwise would be.  However, <i>Ansted
</i>commended itself to Starke J, at first instance in <i>Wing On &amp; Co
Limited v The Collector of Customs for New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%206%20CLR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 6 CLR 97</a> at
100, where his Honour said -
<P>

"The defendant became possessed of uncustomed goods and exercised control and a
power of disposition over them, and thus, in my
opinion, became liable for the
duties.  The other argument based upon sec. 132, that the duties shall be paid
at the rate in force
when goods are entered for home consumption, is met, I
think, by the reasons given for the decision in <i>Attorney-General v
Ansted</i>.  It was the duty of the defendant when it became possessed of
uncustomed goods to enter them at the Customs, and it cannot excuse
itself by
neglecting to perform this duty."
<P>

It is important, I think, to note as making at least one point of distinction,
the observation of Dixon J (as he then was) at page
109 that -
<P>

"But it is sufficiently plain that under some understanding the goods were
brought to the defendant company uncustomed and that
they were at once resold,
all with the intention of defeating the revenue."
<P>

The argument on appeal proceeded on the basis that it was not disputed on
behalf of the defendant that the importer continued to
be liable to pay the
duties and that by virtue of s153 of the Act this liability continued until it
was discharged by payment or
otherwise.  Although the proposition stated by
Starke J is broad enough to apply to what might be the present circumstances,
yet
I consider that it was significantly affected by the consideration that the
defendant was party to a scheme to evade duty and, with
respect, the reasoning
of Muir J in <i>Prechelt</i> is more directly in point.  I note that there is
no allegation in the Statement of Claim, at all events, that the defendant
neglected
to make an entry for home consumption, let alone was party to an
attempted evasion.
<P>

In <i>Wilson v Chambers &amp; Co Pty Ltd</i>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1926/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1926] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281926%29%2038%20CLR%20131" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1926) 38 CLR 131</a> the question
arose, among others, as to whether duty was evaded by transferring, without an
appropriate entry, paint on board a ship
in Port Kembla to the ship's stores,
some of which was then used for painting the vessel.  It seems to follow that
if there was no
obligation to pay a duty, then there could be no evasion of it.
Knox CJ, dealing with the evasion offence charged against the defendants,
drew
the distinction between "evade" and "avoid" and having determined the evidence
proved no more than an omission to pay duty which
was legally payable, that the
information was rightly dismissed (38 CLR at 136).  I do not consider that his
Honour's judgment deals
in substance with the point before me.  The same, I
think, may be said of the judgments of Higgins and Rich JJ.  Starke J said (38
CLR at 150-151) -
<P>

"A duty was imposed on the goods mentioned in the information ... upon
importation into Australia and that duty was payable, in
this case, upon the
arrival of the ship in Port Kembla",
<P>

citing <i>Attorney-General v Ansted</i>.  
<P>

This, however, does not deal with the question of calculation, which was
unnecessary having regard to the nature of the proceedings,
his Honour
disposing of the point by concluding that a mere omission or negligence to pay
duty could not satisfy the statutory prerequisites
for the commission of the
offence.  In a more elaborate judgment in this respect, Isaacs J considered, I
think, that there was an
instant obligation to pay the duty that arose when the
entry for warehousing should have been made.  (It matters not that the entry
required was not for home consumption but for warehousing.)  His Honour,
however, in dealing with a number of authorities, in particular
with the
judgment of Baron Parke in <i>Ansted</i>, made the point that, "Where by the
importer's own fault, those provisions [relating to making an entry] were not
complied with,
the original liability stood and the time for payment had
arrived."  Again, this does not take the issue of calculation;  it also
rests
upon a finding of fault on the part of the importer, an allegation which, as I
have pointed out, is not make in the Statement
of Claim.
<P>

23   	Putting the applicant's argument in this Court in another
way, it was submitted by Mr Gageler that, even if there was an imposition
of
liability to pay duty on importation by virtue of s21, the time for payment
could not arrive, having regard to the imperative
and exclusive language of
s132 of the Act until quantification of the rate was possible; in other words,
the requirement of making
of the entry for home consumption had been satisfied.

<P>

24   	In <i>Carter Holt Harvey Manufacturing Group Pty Ltd v
Comptroller-General of Customs</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20128%20FLR%2096" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 128 FLR 96</a> at 98, Fitzgerald P and
Mackenzie J, with whom Pincus JA agreed, said of s153 of the Act -
<P>

"That provision is plainly applicable where an import entry has not been made,
duty has not been paid, and an authority to deal
with imported goods has not
been obtained."
<P>

If I may say so, with respect, this statement is plainly right, so far as it
goes.  However, the result might be forfeiture of the
goods under s229(1)(g) at
all events.  The imported goods would also be subject to a charge referable to
an inchoate sum, capable
of execution once the amount due is calculated.  It
does not appear that this decision was referred to by Muir J in
<i>Prechelt</i>, but having regard to the issues in it, I do not consider, with
the greatest respect, it demonstrates a flaw in his Honour's judgment.
<P>

25   	The submission made by Mr Gelbart cuts across the
difficulties of calculation by proposing that in the absence of an entry,
the
date of importation applies where the goods have been improperly removed from
the control of Customs and this enables the calculation
of duty to be precisely
made.  This is the approach, indeed, taken in the Statement of Claim except
there is no allegation of improper
removal.  It maybe that these reasons do not
do justice to this submission, which has the advantage of simplicity and which
appears
to express (and I say this with unfeigned respect for the judges to
whom this of course refers) assumptions which have underlain
the administration
of the Customs legislation for some time.  Nevertheless, I do not see how such
assumptions can survive reference
to the specific language of the Act.  
<P>

26   	Accordingly, I uphold the application and strike out the
Statement of Claim.
<P>

27   	It follows that there should be an order for costs for the
applicant.
<P>

28   	I will grant liberty to apply on three days notice in case
some specific orders need to be taken out. 
<P>
