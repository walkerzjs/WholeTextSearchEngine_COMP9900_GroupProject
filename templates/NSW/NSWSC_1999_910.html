MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>10814/1999</u>	<u>MARCEL I KALFUS, GEORGE B NEWHOUSE, LESLIE M S POZNIAK,
PETER WISE AND ANNA NANOS PRACTISING AS KNPW LAWYERS v OTTO WALDMANN</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiffs are a firm of solicitors.  During 1996 and 1997,
the plaintiffs performed legal work for the defendant.
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs rendered five Bills of Costs to the defendant.
The first bill was dated 22 April 1997 for costs in the sum of
$1,350.  The
second bill was dated 21 February 1997 for costs in the sum of $2,978.  The
third bill was dated 4 March 1997 for costs
in the sum of $500.  The fourth
bill was dated 4 March 1997 for costs in the sum of $1,672.  The fifth bill was
dated 19 March 1997
for costs in the sum of $2,837.
<P>

3  	On 20 March 1998, the defendant made application to this Court
for an assessment of costs.  The application was referred to
a Costs Assessor
(Mr Hattersley).  He completed his assessment and issued a Certificate As To
Determination Of Costs on 23 March
1999.  It was a protracted assessment which
generated a volume of documentation.  There were many communications between
the parties
and the Costs Assessor.
<P>

4  	The certificate was accompanied by a letter dated 12 March 1999.
It sets out his reasons for the determination.  There is other
correspondence
from the Costs Assessor which provides information as to earlier decisions made
by him in the assessment.
<P>

5  	The Costs Assessor said that he had no authority to assess the
first Bill of Costs because it was the subject of a Costs Agreement.
 He
disallowed the costs claimed in the second and third Bill of Costs on a number
of grounds, (including lack of retainer).  He
reduced the fourth bill to a sum
of $1,248.  He reduced the fifth bill to a sum of $2,145.  He determined that
these two amounts
represented a fair and reasonable charge for the work done in
relation to the fourth and fifth bills.
<P>

6  	On 8 April 1999, the plaintiffs commenced these proceedings.
Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a>
(the Act).  Under this section, the appeal is limited to "a matter of law
arising in the proceedings to determine the application".
<P>

7  	The plaintiffs are legally represented.  Counsel appeared on
their behalf.  The defendant appears in person.  Despite the modest
sums
involved, the proceedings have been vigorously litigated.
<P>

8  	At the commencement of the hearing, the plaintiffs sought leave
to file an Amended Summons which sought relief also under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M.</a>  The
application was opposed.  It is the practice of the court to require the
parties to proceed on the case as propounded and on
the evidence then filed at
the time of the giving of the special fixture.  The proposed amendment was
clearly going to be prejudicial
to the defendant who was appearing in person.
The small amount involved made any question of adjournment inappropriate.  In
any event,
the proposed amended relief had its own problems.  The application
for leave was now out of time and it would have been necessary
for the
plaintiffs to satisfy the court that an extension of time should be granted.
It appeared that the plaintiffs may not have
had the evidence to address such a
matter.  In the circumstances, the application to add a claim for relief under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M</a> was refused.  By consent, an Amended Summons was filed.  The purpose of
this document was said to present a better statement of the
grounds of
appeal.
<P>

9  	The plaintiffs also had in contemplation the filing of further
affidavits in court.  The application to rely on this additional
material was
not pressed.  By consent, the court proceeded on the basis that it should have
before it the material submitted to the
Costs Assessor for consideration.
<P>

10  	The case that was ultimately presented related to only the
second and third bills.  Although the amount in dispute was in the
order of
about three and a half thousand dollars, the hearing took most of the day.
<P>

11  	Largely, the plaintiff contended that there were four errors of
law.  Firstly, it was said that the Costs Assessor erred in
proceeding to
assess the Bills of Costs because the application had been brought out of time.
Secondly, it was said that he should
not have proceeded to an assessment
because both bills were the subject of a Costs Agreement.  Thirdly, it was said
that the Costs
Assessor's findings as to lack of retainer were erroneous.
Fourthly it was said that the Costs Assessor erred in exercising jurisdiction
in relation to Family Law matters.
<P>

12  	The scheme for assessment imposes time limitations for the
making of applications by clients for assessment of costs (See <u>Hook v
Simpsons</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/667.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 667).</a>  The matter of time limitations was raised by
the Costs Assessor.  He received submissions from both parties.  The
submissions generated
questions of fact (inter alia as to the time of the
giving of the bills).  It appears that the Costs Assessor did not accept the
submissions made on behalf of the plaintiffs.  After considering the
submissions, he proceeded with the assessment of those bills.
<P>

13  	It is immaterial that other minds may have formed a different
view on this question, the decision that was made was open to
the Costs
Assessor.  I am not satisfied that there was any error of law on this
question.
<P>

14  	For completeness, I should refer to one other matter which is
relevant to this question.  It was open to the Costs Assessor
to find that
neither of the two purported bills satisfied the requirements of the Act and
the <u>Legal Profession Regulation</u> 1994 (the Regulation).  Bills which
satisfied the requirements of the Regulation were not given until 12 February
1999 (after a request
for a detailed bill had been made by the Costs
Assessor).
<P>

15  	Both bills are expressed to have been given pursuant to a Costs
Agreement dated 28 October 1996.  The submissions put to the
Costs Assessor
raised issue as to the making of that agreement.  At the relevant time, the
defendant was in Romania and contends
that he did not receive a facsimile
transmission from the plaintiff dated 28 October 1996 (this communication
contained the alleged
Costs Agreement).  The Costs Assessor reached the
decision that the defendant did not receive the plaintiffs' facsimile.
Accordingly,
he proceeded with the assessment on the basis that sections 208A,
208B and 182 (3) had application.  As I have earlier said, it does
not matter
if other minds may have formed a different view, the decision made by the Costs
Assessor was open on the material placed
before him.  I am not satisfied that
there was any error of law on this question.
<P>

16  	The Costs Assessor formed the view that no costs were payable
pursuant to either of the bills.  I shall now turn to the reasons
presented for
the reaching of that view.  It was said that no retainer existed for the
purported performance of services from 3 September
1996 until 6 January 1997.
It was said that some of the services had been separately charged in other
bills.  It was said that some
of the services related to matrimonial matters.
It was said that there was no retainer for other aspects of the bill.
<P>

17  	However it was put, both in the assessment and in these
proceedings, in substance the stand taken by the defendant was that
the
plaintiffs had a retainer of a limited nature during the pre 6 January 1997
period.  It was not said that there was no retainer
at all.  It appeared to be
the position of the defendant that the plaintiffs were entitled to either an ex
gratia payment or a nominal
sum which reflected the value of the limited
services provided.  In the circumstances, there is no alternative but to
conclude that
the Costs Assessor has misdirected himself.
<P>

18  	It was common ground that exclusive jurisdiction to deal with
costs relating to matters of Family Law lay elsewhere.  It was
common ground
that the Costs Assessor either lacked power or authority to assess costs
relating to Family Law matters.  Whilst also
holding that view, the Costs
Assessor has unwittingly made assessment in respect of them.  Instead of
declining to make any assessment
in respect of them, he has in effect
disallowed items relating to Family Law matters.
<P>

19  	The plaintiffs identify a number of matters which they say
relate to Family Law costs.  They fall within a period from 21 October
1996 up
to 3 March 1997.  These items appear in both bills.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff has demonstrated errors of law.  They are entitled
to some costs under each of the two bills.  Whatever the quantum
of that sum
may be, one thing is clear, it will be modest.  Despite this, the court has no
option but to set aside the determination,
in so far as it relates to each of
the two bills, and to refer the matter of their assessment back to the Costs
Assessor.
<P>

21  	It is unfortunate that this course has to be taken. The end
result will inevitably be disproportionate to the costs and effort
involved in
the exercise.  It is hoped that the parties can reach some reasonable
compromise and so avoid a reassessment.
<P>

22  	I set aside the determination made in the assessment of the Bill
of Costs dated 21 February 1997 for costs in the sum of $2,978.
 I set aside
the determination made in the assessment of the Bill of Costs dated 4 March
1997 for costs in the sum of $500.  I remit
the question of the assessment of
those two bills to the Costs Assessor for re-determination.
<P>

23  	The question of costs is a vexed one.  It appears that the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</u> 1951</a> has no application in the present case. I bear in
mind the amount in issue and the fact that the plaintiffs prepared the bills.
Although,
the plaintiffs have been successful in having the two bills remitted
for re-determination, they were successful on only two of the
four questions
argued.  Each side has had some success.  It seems to me that justice is best
done if I make no order as to the costs.
<P>

24  	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
